        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a comprehensive hole-by-hole analysis of the Bethpage Black golf course, the designated venue for the 2025 Ryder Cup. It details the yardage, par, and specific challenges of each of the 18 holes, from the nerve-wracking first tee to the deceptively sloping final green. The guide offers insights into the strategic decisions players will face, highlighting key features like elevated greens, deep bunkers, and long, arduous par-fours that define the course's notorious difficulty. The text explains how certain holes, like the picturesque but reachable par-five 4th, offer scoring opportunities, while others, such as the punishing 15th, consistently rank as the hardest on the course.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are expected to have a mixed opening as investors cautiously await the release of the latest weekly jobs data from the United States. This data is particularly significant after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that a cooling labor market was a key factor in the central bank's recent decision to cut interest rates. In Europe, investor focus is also on consumer confidence reports from France and Germany, with the latter showing a halt in its downward trend but remaining at a low level due to geopolitical uncertainty and inflation fears. The Swiss National Bank's latest monetary policy update is also being closely watched by market participants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British retailer The Co-op has disclosed that a significant cyberattack in April cost the company at least £206 million in lost revenue. The security breach infiltrated its IT networks, leading to severe operational disruptions, including payment system failures, widespread product shortages, and the theft of data from all 6.5 million of its members. This incident contributed to an underlying pre-tax loss of £75 million for the first half of the year, a stark reversal from the £3 million profit reported in the same period last year. The company anticipates further financial impact in the second half of the year as it works to recover from the attack.</p>

His comments come at a time of pressure for Prime Minister Starmer, following high-profile staff changes and criticism of his leadership approach. Burnham criticized what he described as a "climate of fear" within the party and advocated for a wholesale change in strategy to counter the threat from the Reform UK party, suggesting he is ready to play any role required.</p>

          <p>The British government is exploring options to provide financial support to suppliers of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) after a cyberattack forced the carmaker to suspend all production. The attack has halted operations until at least early October, raising concerns that smaller firms solely reliant on JLR's business could face bankruptcy. Among the options being considered is a plan for the government to purchase and stockpile component parts from these suppliers to ensure their cash flow until JLR's factories are operational again. The production shutdown is reportedly costing JLR at least £50 million per week and has affected tens of thousands of workers in its supply chain.</p>

          <p>Three weeks after his £18.1 million transfer to Manchester United, 23-year-old goalkeeper Senne Lammens has yet to make his first appearance for the club. Despite impressing in training with his calm presence and strong fundamentals, head coach Ruben Amorim has opted for the more experienced Altay Bayindir, citing the need for stability in a new league. However, Bayindir's recent performance metrics have been weak, leading to widespread speculation that it is a matter of when, not if, Lammens will be given his chance. The team's early elimination from the EFL Cup has removed a potential 'soft landing' for his debut, meaning his first start will likely be in a high-pressure Premier League match.</p>

His transformation was catalyzed by Slot's faith in him after a planned transfer for another midfielder fell through. Analysts praise his unique ability to carry the ball through defensive lines, and his improved performance has made him a key figure for both his club and the Dutch national team.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has claimed he was the victim of a 'triple sabotage' during his appearance at the United Nations, demanding an immediate investigation. In a social media post, he detailed three incidents: an escalator he was on came to an abrupt halt, his teleprompter malfunctioned during his speech to the General Assembly, and the auditorium's sound system was apparently off. Trump asserted these events were not a coincidence and called for those responsible to be arrested. A UN official suggested the escalator's safety mechanism may have been inadvertently triggered, while the teleprompter and audio issues were also attributed to technical explanations rather than deliberate interference.</p>

Mainland China's CSI 300 also advanced, while markets in South Korea and Australia posted modest gains. In contrast, Taiwan's Taiex fell, weighed down by a drop in TSMC shares following a report that competitor Intel is seeking investment from Apple, a former major client. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has indicated that if a government shutdown occurs on October 1, it may pursue permanent layoffs rather than temporary furloughs for some federal workers. A memo from the Office of Management and Budget suggests a funding lapse would provide an opportunity to issue 'reduction in force' notices to employees in programs not aligned with the president's priorities. This marks a significant departure from past shutdowns and is seen by critics as an intimidation tactic amid budget negotiations. Democratic leaders have condemned the move, which escalates the stakes as Congress struggles to reach a funding agreement to keep the government open.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated broad national security investigations into imports of robotics, industrial machinery, and a wide range of medical devices, from surgical masks to pacemakers.

The Commerce Department is assessing whether reliance on foreign supply chains for these products poses a threat to U.S. national security. This move expands the administration's use of tariffs as a tool to encourage domestic production of critical goods and could significantly raise costs for hospitals, manufacturers, and consumers.

While the specific charges are unclear, reports suggest they could relate to allegations of lying to Congress in 2020 about the origins of the Russia investigation. The potential indictment comes amid significant political pressure, including a recent social media post from Trump calling Comey 'guilty as hell' and the recent replacement of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia with a lawyer who previously represented Trump personally.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's policy requiring states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive certain FEMA grants is unconstitutional. The ruling is a victory for 20 states that sued the administration, arguing that critical emergency preparedness funding was being illegally withheld to coerce them into assisting federal immigration agents. U.S. District Judge William Smith found the policy to be 'arbitrary and capricious,' stating that the potential loss of disaster funds would cause irreparable harm to public safety. The decision marks a significant setback for the administration's efforts to penalize so-called 'sanctuary' jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with ICE.</p>

          <p>Canada's Supreme Court has issued a temporary stay on an order to cull nearly 400 ostriches at a British Columbia farm following an avian flu outbreak. The decision halts the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) plan while the farm's owners appeal the cull order, a case that has drawn international attention. The owners were briefly arrested for obstructing agents who had a warrant to enter the property and take control of the birds. The CFIA maintains that the flock poses a risk for virus mutation and potential human health impacts, but the court has ordered that the birds be maintained with appropriate care while it decides whether to hear the full appeal.</p>

While Nvidia is providing an initial $10 billion in equity to help finance the first new AI supercomputing facility, the majority of the investment will flow back to Nvidia as payment for leasing the essential hardware.

A new study shows that this surge, led by South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria, reflects the continent's accelerating adoption of solar energy, driven by falling technology costs and the development of large-scale power plants by Chinese firms. As China dominates global solar panel production, these import figures serve as a strong indicator of Africa's growing renewable energy capacity, helping to rewire the continent for a more sustainable future.</p>

          <p>In Massachusetts, some cranberry farmers are opting to convert their unproductive bogs back into natural wetlands through a state-sponsored ecological restoration program. Facing economic headwinds from global competition, rising costs, and extreme weather, farmers are paid to undertake these projects, which restore the land's natural hydrology. The program has already restored over 500 acres, with another 500 planned. These restored wetlands offer significant environmental benefits, including water filtration, carbon storage, and storm resilience, while also providing public access for recreation. For many farmers, it is a way to preserve their land's legacy and ensure it remains in good hands for future generations.</p>
