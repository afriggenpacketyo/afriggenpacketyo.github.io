          <p>Reality TV couple Sean and Catherine Lowe are speaking out against the widespread use of Ozempic for weight loss, calling the trend "triggering" and "hard to watch." The former "Bachelor" stars, who have partnered with Atkins, emphasized that there are healthier alternatives to the popular drug. They shared that their own approach to wellness focuses on consistency, such as daily gym visits and mindful eating, rather than seeking a quick fix. The couple advocates for a long-term, sustainable lifestyle over what they see as a potentially risky and restrictive fad.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami star Lionel Messi left a Leagues Cup match against Necaxa in the opening minutes due to an apparent hamstring injury. The incident occurred around the eighth minute when Messi fell after a challenge and was seen walking off the field in frustration. Coach Javier Mascherano confirmed that Messi felt a pull in his hamstring and would undergo further testing to determine the injury's severity. This development raises concerns about his availability for upcoming matches, adding to a season where the 38-year-old's workload has been carefully managed.</p>

          <p>The UK's financial regulator has stated that a potential compensation scheme for the mis-selling of car loans could cost as much as £18 billion. This follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while hidden commissions were not broadly unlawful, claims could be made for exceptionally large and unfair commissions. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will now consult on establishing a payout system, with initial payments potentially starting next year. The FCA estimates most individuals would receive under £950 and advises customers to contact their loan providers directly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Moscow has accused Ukraine of launching an overnight drone attack that caused a large fire at an oil depot near the Black Sea resort of Sochi. Russian officials reported that debris from a drone hit a fuel tank, requiring a major firefighting response. This attack was part of a broader wave of assaults, with Russia claiming its air defenses intercepted 93 Ukrainian drones, while Ukraine's air force reported downing 61 of 83 Russian drones and missiles. The strikes coincide with renewed Russian bombing in Kherson, continuing the escalating cross-border conflict.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has downplayed a public trade request from star defensive end Micah Parsons, characterizing it as a negotiation tactic amid a contract extension dispute. Jones insisted the team has an agreement with Parsons from earlier talks, which the player contests, and expressed confidence that the situation will be resolved. Parsons, who is entering the final year of his rookie contract, is seeking a deal that would likely make him the highest-paid defender in the NFL. Several teammates have publicly supported Parsons, urging the team to complete the contract extension.</p>

          <p>Actor Sydney Sweeney is at the center of a new controversy after her Florida Republican voter registration from June 2024 became public. The revelation follows intense social media debate over her new American Eagle ad campaign, which uses the pun "Sydney Sweeney has great genes." Some critics have called the campaign tone-deaf, likening its language to eugenics, while conservatives have praised it as a stand against "woke" advertising. This is not the first time Sweeney's perceived political leanings have drawn criticism, following a 2022 incident involving guests at a family party wearing hats resembling MAGA apparel.</p>

          <p>Recent public appearances by President Donald Trump, marked by rambling statements and factual inaccuracies, have renewed questions about his mental acuity. Experts note instances of him drifting off-topic, such as a lengthy, unprompted rant about windmills, and apparent confabulation, like a false story about his uncle and the Unabomber. This scrutiny follows a period where similar concerns were directed at his predecessor, Joe Biden. While the White House aggressively defends the president's sharpness, some mental health professionals have expressed concern over what they describe as a noticeable deterioration in his speech and thought patterns.</p>

          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, using specific calming phrases can be highly effective in managing children's tantrums. Instead of punitive language, phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense" help validate a child's emotions and de-escalate the situation. The approach focuses on connection over control, reassuring the child they are safe and supported rather than being punished for their emotional distress. This method helps children learn to regulate their nervous systems and builds long-term emotional resilience.</p>

A yellow warning is also in place for northern England, north Wales, and Northern Ireland.

          <p>A 27-year-old woman has been arrested in New Zealand after a two-year-old girl was discovered alive inside a suitcase in the luggage compartment of a bus. The bus driver became concerned about a moving bag during a stop in Kaiwaka and found the child, who was reported to be very hot but otherwise physically unharmed. The girl was taken to a hospital for a thorough medical assessment. The woman has been charged with ill-treatment and neglect of a child, with police indicating that further charges are possible as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>British Labour MP Sir Chris Bryant has publicly stated that he was sexually abused as a teenager by Michael Croft, the late former head of the National Youth Theatre. Bryant said the abuse occurred in 1978 when he was 16 and attending the company in London. In a statement, the National Youth Theatre apologized to Bryant and other victims of the same perpetrator. Bryant also revealed he has been sexually assaulted by five male MPs during his time in Parliament but did not report them due to a lack of a system and fear of repercussions.</p>

          <p>The use of artificial intelligence to detect and bill for damages is becoming more common in the travel industry, moving from rental cars to potentially hotel rooms. Companies like Hertz are using AI to scan vehicles for damage upon return, a practice experts call "algorithmic auditing" that could soon be adopted by hotels to check for things like smoking or property damage. While businesses see this as a way to automate loss prevention, it raises concerns about customer satisfaction and fairness. Experts warn of a potential backlash if guests feel they are being unfairly scrutinized and billed by machines without human discretion.</p>

          <p>An American woman has been sentenced to eight years in prison for her role in a sophisticated scheme that helped North Korean IT workers secure remote jobs at hundreds of U.S. companies. Christina Chapman of Arizona ran "laptop farms," managing computers and finances for the workers, who posed as U.S. citizens using stolen identities. The scheme generated over $17 million, with funds allegedly used to support North Korea's weapons programs. This case highlights a growing cybersecurity threat where foreign actors exploit the remote work economy to infiltrate U.S. companies and circumvent international sanctions.</p>

          <p>While the Trump administration's promises to release documents from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation have not materialized, several ongoing legal cases may succeed where political pressure has failed. A public records lawsuit filed by Radar Online is currently on appeal, challenging the FBI's refusal to release thousands of pages from its Epstein file. Separately, a federal appeals court has ordered a lower court to review whether more documents from a civil case involving an Epstein accuser can be unsealed. These legal efforts represent a potential path toward greater transparency regarding Epstein's crimes and his network.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has revealed the decade-long process behind the creation of CHSN01, a high-strength, low-temperature steel essential for nuclear fusion technology. The material was developed to withstand the extreme conditions inside a fusion reactor, where superconducting magnets operate near absolute zero under immense force. This breakthrough was critical for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project after previous materials proved inadequate. The development and successful deployment of this super steel in the world's first fusion power generation reactor places China in a leading position in advanced materials science.</p>
