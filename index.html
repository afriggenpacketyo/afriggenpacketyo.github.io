          <h2>Nevada's Mental Health Hold Laws Did Not Prevent NYC Shooter from Legally Acquiring Firearms</h2>

          <p>The man responsible for a recent mass shooting in New York had been placed on emergency psychiatric holds twice in Las Vegas, but these incidents did not legally bar him from purchasing firearms. Nevada law does not automatically report temporary mental health holds to the national background check system unless they result in a court-ordered involuntary commitment. Experts suggest that "red flag" laws, which allow for temporary confiscation of guns from individuals deemed a threat, could have prevented the purchase, but such an order was not sought in this case, highlighting a critical gap in gun safety measures.</p>

          <p>A growing number of individuals, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are moving away from dating apps and embracing in-person singles events to find partners. Companies like Date Cincy are capitalizing on this trend, which is driven by a desire for genuine, face-to-face connections and frustration with the misrepresentation common on digital platforms. This shift is reflected in the declining market value of apps like Bumble and a significant rise in attendance at singles events, suggesting a cultural move back toward more traditional forms of meeting people.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that Americans derive an average of 55% of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods, with the figure rising to nearly 62% for young people. These foods, characterized as energy-dense and low in nutrients, include items like sandwiches, sweet bakery products, and savory snacks. The findings align with the Health and Human Services' "Make America Healthy Again" agenda and underscore previous research linking high consumption of ultra-processed foods to increased risks of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other adverse health outcomes.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, an exotic animal broker featured in the HBO docuseries “Chimp Crazy,” has been sentenced to 46 months in prison for perjury and obstruction of justice. Haddix had falsely claimed in court that her celebrity chimpanzee, Tonka, had died, when in fact she was hiding him in a small cage in her basement. PETA, which had pursued legal action against Haddix, discovered Tonka's whereabouts with help from the docuseries' director. The chimp has since been relocated to a sanctuary in Florida, and the case highlights ongoing issues in the exotic animal trade.</p>

This move follows President Trump's threat to federalize the city and comes despite D.C. police data showing a year-to-date decrease in violent crime, creating tension over the coordination and necessity of the federal intervention.</p>

The incident occurred just two weeks after Slater signed a major contract extension, raising concerns for the team's offensive line stability.

          <p>The UK has detained several dozen migrants who crossed the English Channel as part of a new pilot deportation deal with France. Under the "one in, one out" agreement, for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept an approved asylum seeker from there. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that the first returns could happen within weeks and that the government will robustly defend against legal challenges. The scheme aims to deter illegal crossings, which have increased significantly this year, though critics argue it will be less effective than the previous government's Rwanda plan.</p>

The administration argues the ban irreparably harms its ability to enforce immigration laws in a region with a large undocumented population.

          <p>President Trump recently attacked late-night television hosts like Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, and Jimmy Kimmel, predicting their downfall while boasting about his understanding of ratings. However, this focus on media ratings comes as his own presidential job approval has fallen to 37%, according to a Gallup poll, which is low compared to other two-term presidents. The article contrasts Trump's obsession with television metrics against polling data on substantive issues, such as public desire for the release of Epstein files and low approval for his handling of the matter, suggesting a disconnect between his focus and public concerns.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, accusing him of being "highly conflicted" due to alleged investments in companies linked to the Chinese military. The demand follows concerns raised by Republican Senator Tom Cotton and comes as Intel, a key player in the U.S. effort to rebuild its semiconductor industry, has received billions in government funding. Intel defended its CEO, stating both the company and Tan are committed to U.S. national security. The extraordinary presidential intervention has caused Intel's shares to fall and added to the challenges facing the U.S. chip industry.</p>

For the second quarter, Block reported a 14% rise in gross profit to $2.54 billion, beating analyst estimates, although revenue fell slightly short. The positive guidance suggests strong performance from its Square and Cash App segments despite growing competition in the fintech space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed regulators to review rules that could pave the way for including non-traditional assets like cryptocurrency, private equity, and real estate in 401(k) retirement plans. The move aims to give everyday workers access to investment classes previously reserved for the wealthy, potentially unlocking trillions in funding for these sectors. While proponents argue this could lead to higher returns, critics warn it could expose savers to increased risk, higher fees, and less transparency, especially with volatile assets like crypto. This aligns with the administration's broader embrace of the digital currency industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams was defeated in the first round of the Cincinnati Open by 22-year-old Spanish player Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, 6-4, 6-4. Despite showing flashes of her formidable skill and fighting back to level the first set, the 45-year-old Williams was ultimately outlasted by her younger, in-form opponent. Williams expressed satisfaction with her competitive performance, attributing the loss to needing more match play after a sparse competition schedule in recent years. She is expected to compete next in the US Open, where she will likely receive a main draw wildcard.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a 14-day temporary restraining order, halting further construction at the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" migrant detention facility in Florida's Everglades. The order pauses paving, fencing, and other building activities while the court considers a lawsuit from environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe. The suit argues that the facility's construction violates federal environmental law by threatening sensitive wetlands and endangered species like the Florida panther without proper review. While construction is paused, immigration detentions and other operations at the facility are permitted to continue.</p>

          <p>President Trump's latest wave of tariffs has gone into effect, impacting over 90 countries and raising the average tariff rate on imported goods to 18.6%, the highest level in nearly a century. For American consumers, these tariffs effectively act as a significant tax increase, as companies are expected to pass the additional costs on, leading to higher prices. The administration's strategy appears to be using the threat of catastrophic tariffs to negotiate deals, though economists widely view the policy as detrimental to the U.S. economy. The legality of the tariffs is currently being challenged in federal court.</p>

          <p>Rushanara Ali has resigned from her position as the UK's homelessness minister following accusations of hypocrisy regarding a property she owns and rents out. Critics, including renters' charities and opposition politicians, called for her to step down after it was revealed she ended a tenancy to sell the property, only to re-list it for rent at a higher price within six months. This action mirrors a practice her own department is trying to outlaw through the new Renters' Rights Bill. In her resignation letter, Ali stated she followed all legal requirements but was stepping down to avoid being a distraction.</p>
