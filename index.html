          <p>MicroStrategy's bitcoin treasury strategy, which significantly boosted its market capitalization, is now being adopted by various companies, including meme stock firms and media conglomerates. Despite this growing interest, Wall Street remains skeptical, as evidenced by the stock performance of companies like Trump Media and GameStop following their bitcoin-related announcements. Michael Saylor, Chairman of MicroStrategy, views this trend as a global shift in corporate finance and emphasized the long-term popularity of having bitcoin on the balance sheet. The Biden administration previously treated corporate bitcoin adoption with caution, but under President Trump, there's a move towards establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, signaling a change in regulatory perspective. Optimism about bitcoin's future and the increasing number of actors in the ecosystem contribute to its robustness.</p>

These platforms cater to first-generation immigrants and international students seeking authentic flavors from their home countries, with app designs reminiscent of Chinese platforms. Fantuan has seen significant growth in the U.S. and aims to "co-exist" with larger companies by connecting authentic businesses to customers.

          <p>Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center successfully removed a spinal tumor from a patient through her eye in a first-of-its-kind surgery. Karla Flores, who was initially diagnosed with a brain stem tumor, had a second chordoma discovered on her spine during an MRI. Dr. Mohammed Labib developed a unique surgical plan, called the "third nostril" approach, to access the tumor through Flores' eye, as traditional methods were not viable. The procedure involved removing part of her eye socket and cheekbone to reach the tumor, ultimately removing it entirely and reconstructing the eye socket. The success of the surgery offers hope for treating other difficult-to-reach tumors.</p>

          <p>Lyft, under CEO David Risher, has shown significant operational and financial improvements, including increased revenue and positive free cash flow. However, its share price remains undervalued due to industry dynamics and suboptimal capital allocation practices. Engine Capital has taken a position in Lyft, advocating for a strategic review, improved capital allocation, and elimination of the dual-class share structure. Following engagement with Engine, Lyft has committed to a substantial share repurchase program, leading to Engine withdrawing its director nominations.

          <p>U.S. immigration authorities are collecting DNA information from migrants, including children, and uploading it to a national criminal database. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) is creating detailed DNA profiles searchable by law enforcement, regardless of accusations of felonies. Experts criticize this practice as a "massive expansion of genetic surveillance" and an invasion of privacy. CBP has added over 1.5 million DNA profiles to Codis since 2020, a 5,000% increase. The expansion is possible due to fewer limitations on DNA collection in immigration contexts compared to criminal law.</p>

          <p>The trial of Bryan Kohberger, accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022, is set for August but faces several challenges. Kohberger's attorneys requested a trial delay, citing prejudicial publicity from an NBC Dateline special that allegedly contained prosecution leaks. Further complications may arise from a forthcoming true-crime book. Despite these issues, the judge has ruled against several defense motions to exclude evidence, including Amazon purchase history and a master's essay. Prosecutors have yet to ascribe a motive for the killings, which is a factor that jurors may consider important before a conviction.</p>

          <p>The 'Mission: Impossible' franchise initially distinguished itself through stand-alone stories with bold authorial styles from directors like Brian De Palma and John Woo, focusing on individual creative strengths rather than consistent lore. Later films by J.J. Abrams and Brad Bird stretched the limits of tone, further showcasing the adaptability of the franchise. In contrast, recent installments have leaned into cinematic universe conventions, attempting to connect disparate story threads, which some critics argue diminishes the unique appeal of the earlier films.

          <p>A carjacking reported in Central California was discovered to be an insurance fraud scheme orchestrated by Martha Gutierrez DeRomero and her boyfriend, Alfredo Ledezma. DeRomero initially claimed two masked men stole her van containing $60,000 worth of fitness merchandise. However, after multiple interviews, authorities determined the story was fabricated to collect insurance money. DeRomero and Ledezma have been charged with insurance fraud and filing a false police report.</p>

          <p>A monument to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, previously removed, has been replicated and reinstalled in a Moscow metro station. The original statue was taken down in the 1960s following Nikita Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin. While President Vladimir Putin has acknowledged the tragic period of Stalinist purges, an estimated 105 statues honoring the dictator have been erected since he came to power. The restored monument has sparked mixed reactions, with some praising it as a piece of art and others questioning the glorification of a leader responsible for mass deaths.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent comment that international students in the U.S. would be “fine” has added to the confusion surrounding his administration’s stance on student visas, particularly for Chinese students.

The scope of the visa crackdown remains unclear, with the State Department refusing to specify the criteria for visa revocation, prompting Beijing to lodge formal protests.</p>

          <p>Consumers are taking a more cautious approach to summer vacations this year due to economic uncertainty, according to a report by Deloitte. While more people plan to travel compared to last year, summer travel budgets have been scaled back following President Trump's tariff announcements and stock market volatility. Travelers are cutting back on in-destination spending, opting to stay with family and friends, and choosing to drive instead of fly to save money. Despite slightly lower travel costs, people are generally spending more due to inflation, leaving less discretionary income for travel.</p>
