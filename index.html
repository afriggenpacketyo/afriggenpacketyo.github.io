          <p>Iran launched over 100 drones towards Israel in retaliation for an Israeli missile strike that killed senior Iranian military leaders. Rocket sirens sounded in northern Jordan, with reports of interceptions of Iranian drones in Jordanian airspace. The alleged Israeli strike targeted nuclear enrichment facilities just before scheduled nuclear deal talks. News of the strikes caused oil prices to surge and global stock markets to decline as investors sought safe-haven assets. Optimism is diminished due to escalating tensions and the potential for a broader regional conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The High Court dismissed a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees, a policy introduced on January 1st. Families and private schools argued the policy was discriminatory and breached human rights law, particularly impacting families with children with special educational needs, those attending same-sex schools, and low-paying faith schools. The government defended the policy, stating it would raise Â£1.8 billion a year by 2029/30 to improve standards in state schools. The court acknowledged the policy's interference with some human rights but found the government entitled to balance the interests against the revenue raised.</p>

          <p>Jose Manuel Mojica, a Los Angeles protester charged with assaulting a federal officer, asserts that he was brutally attacked by law enforcement during a demonstration against immigration raids. Mojica claims he was trying to de-escalate tensions when officers took him to the ground, causing injuries. His lawyer disputes the charges and alleges that authorities are misrepresenting events and targeting individuals exercising their First Amendment rights. The case is part of a broader crackdown on protests in Los Angeles, raising concerns about civil liberties and the use of force by law enforcement.</p>

Cities like Portland and Boulder are leading the way, but challenges remain, including the need for local infrastructure to process and distribute salvaged materials. While deconstruction can be more expensive, some developers see long-term benefits in attracting eco-conscious buyers and reducing environmental impact.</p>

          <p>Copenhagen is implementing innovative solutions to adapt to a warmer world and increased rainfall, including rain tunnels and "sponge parks." Following a devastating storm in 2011, the city launched a $1.3 billion project to mitigate flooding. Key initiatives include the Kalvebod Brygge Cloudburst Tunnel and the transformation of green spaces into reservoirs. The city's long-term climate adaptation planning has gained international recognition, with Copenhagen consulting with cities worldwide on similar infrastructure projects. These projects aim to manage excess rainwater and protect the city from storm surges.</p>
