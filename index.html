          <p>A former assistant pastor in Oxnard, California, has been sentenced to two years in prison for stealing $200,000 from his church. The pastor, Curtis Frank Lemons, admitted to issuing himself a cashier's check while the church's founding reverend was on his deathbed. He used the misappropriated funds for personal expenses, including a new car and property in Tennessee. The theft was reported by a church member, and financial records contradicted Lemons' initial claim that the money was given to charity.</p>

          <p>Following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the scope of nationwide injunctions, the ACLU and other legal groups have filed a new class-action lawsuit against President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. The lawsuit argues that the order, which seeks to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, is unconstitutional. This legal action represents a new strategy to protect a broad class of individuals after the Supreme Court cleared the way for the policy to take effect in some parts of the country while challenges continue.</p>

Research from Chubu University suggests the cactus may have immune-boosting properties, further fueling its appeal. As climate change presents challenges to traditional agriculture, experts see the resilient and nutrient-packed cactus as a promising and sustainable food source for the future.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has permanently blocked a Trump administration executive order targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey, calling it "unconstitutional from beginning to end." This is the fourth such ruling against a series of orders aimed at punishing prominent law firms for representing clients or causes opposed by the president. The punitive measures included suspending security clearances and barring access to government buildings. The court's decision marks another significant legal defeat for the administration's campaign against what it perceives as politically opposed law firms, affirming the right to legal counsel without fear of government retaliation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government has performed a major U-turn on its plan to cut disability benefits, following a significant rebellion from within its own party. The proposed changes, which aimed to save Â£5 billion annually by tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payments (Pip), were criticized as a short-term cost-cutting measure rather than a genuine long-term reform. The reversal raises questions about the government's strategy and its ability to manage its large parliamentary majority. The compromise will spare current claimants from the cuts and involve disability charities in designing the new system for future applicants.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has voted against a resolution that would have required President Trump to seek congressional authorization before taking further military action against Iran. The measure failed by a 53-47 vote, largely along party lines, following recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that while several Iranian nuclear sites were severely damaged, there has been no significant off-site radioactive release. President Trump claimed the strikes "obliterated" Iran's nuclear program, a statement that comes amid a fragile ceasefire between Iran and Israel.</p>

The band ran through fan favorites like "Chocolate" and "Love It If We Made It," showcasing their musical tightness.

          <p>The California legislature has passed a bill to more than double the state's annual tax incentives for film and television production, raising the fund to $750 million from $330 million. The measure, supported by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to keep production in California and reverse the trend of projects moving to other states and countries with more generous credits. The move is a response to a significant decline in Los Angeles-based production and job losses in the state's entertainment sector. Industry unions and advocates have applauded the decision as a crucial step to bring production back home.</p>

The ruling means that presidential policies can no longer be blocked for the entire country by a single district judge, a practice that had frequently stalled the Trump administration's agenda. While supporters hail it as a restoration of the proper separation of powers, critics, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have called it a "terrifying step toward authoritarianism" that weakens judicial checks on the presidency.</p>

          <p>A Corona, California man has been sentenced to over a year in federal prison for tax fraud related to the sale of memorabilia signed by comic book legend Stan Lee. Mac Martin Anderson, who had a personal relationship with Lee, failed to report over $1.2 million in income from selling autographed Marvel items between 2015 and 2018. Anderson pleaded guilty to willfully filing false tax returns and has been ordered to pay $482,833 in restitution to the IRS for the unpaid taxes on his proceeds.</p>
