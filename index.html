          <p>A police officer in Alvarado, Texas, was shot in the neck and hospitalized after responding to a call about a suspicious person outside an ICE detention facility on July 4th. The incident appeared to be a planned ambush, with suspects allegedly using fireworks to lure law enforcement to the scene. After a brief chase, several armed suspects, some wearing body armor, were taken into custody. The Justice Department has stated it is closely monitoring the situation and has zero tolerance for assaults on federal officers or property.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most significant events in world history, arguing it created the concept of a citizen. He emphasized that the nation's founding was a bloody and divisive civil war, and that understanding the flaws of figures like Thomas Jefferson is crucial for modern society. Burns contends that embracing this complex and gritty history, rather than a sanitized version, provides the strength and perspective needed to navigate contemporary divisions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's newly signed tax and spending bill has sparked a sharp debate over its fiscal consequences. White House Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the law, arguing it will spur enough economic growth to reduce the deficit, contrary to projections from non-partisan bodies. Conversely, Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi criticized the bill as a "big, ugly bill," warning it will dramatically increase the national deficit, raise inflation, and cause millions to lose healthcare coverage.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that countries that fail to reach a trade agreement with the U.S. will see tariffs on their goods "boomerang back" to higher levels on August 1. This date marks the enforcement of tariff rates announced in April, following the expiration of a 90-day pause. Bessent rejected the idea that this is a new deadline, instead framing it as the point when the administration's previously stated policy will take full effect for partners without a negotiated deal.

          <p>A senior officer in Hamas's security forces has told the BBC that the group has lost approximately 80% of its control over the Gaza Strip. The officer, speaking anonymously, claimed that months of Israeli strikes have decimated the group's leadership and collapsed its command structure. This has created a security vacuum where armed clans and criminal gangs are now operating freely, leading to a state of near-total lawlessness and societal collapse across the territory.</p>
