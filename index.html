          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit signals a potential thaw in relations, despite historical animosities like the Galwan Valley clashes and China's close ties with Pakistan. Both nations face economic pressures, including U.S. tariffs, which could drive reluctant cooperation, particularly as India seeks to become a manufacturing hub while remaining reliant on Chinese raw materials. Experts remain cautious, viewing the summit as an opportunity to find common ground rather than the start of a deep friendship, given the deep-seated suspicions and trade imbalances. Resumed direct flights and border trade, alongside corporate partnerships, indicate some warming ties. The visit will offer clarity on the future trajectory of their complex relationship.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has launched an investigation into the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) regarding accusations of racial equity-based hiring practices. The probe, initiated under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, examines whether CalEPA's policies, which promote "applying a racial equity lens" and diverse interview panels, lead to discrimination based on race, color, sex, and national origin. The DOJ highlights CalEPA's guidance to broaden screening criteria to include "cultural competency and lived experience." This investigation underscores the federal government's scrutiny of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in state agencies, with officials warning of legal consequences for unlawful employment practices.</p>

          <p>Italy's ambitious banking merger and acquisition (M&A) wave has largely stalled, with several high-profile bids collapsing due to stringent government conditions and shareholder dissent. UniCredit dropped its bid for Banco BPM citing Rome's "golden power" rules, while Mediobanca's offer for Banca Generali was rejected by shareholders. Despite a healthier European banking sector and a push for consolidation to compete with Wall Street giants, domestic and cross-border tie-ups face significant obstacles, including EU scrutiny over state interventions. However, some activity continues, with Monte dei Paschi still pursuing Mediobanca and Credit Agricole eyeing Banco BPM, suggesting the M&A narrative is far from over.</p>

          <p>Russia's state space agency, Roscosmos, is on track for the first test launch of its Soyuz-5 rocket in December, with full operational status expected by 2028. This medium-class launch vehicle, equipped with powerful RD-171MV engines, is designed to carry a 17-ton payload. The ambitious project proceeds despite significant funding shortages faced by Roscosmos since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which also led to severed ties with the European Space Agency. The agency has shifted its launch operations to Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome, leasing the facility until 2050. Successfully meeting this deadline would be a notable achievement, highlighting Russia's determination in its space endeavors.</p>

Kim is accused of stock manipulation, receiving luxury gifts for business favors, and obtaining free opinion polls. These developments underscore a period of significant political upheaval and legal scrutiny in South Korea, with Yoon himself already facing charges of insurrection.</p>

          <p>The White House has named Jim O'Neill, Deputy to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), following the abrupt dismissal of Susan Monarez. Monarez, who had been in the role for only a month, was reportedly fired for not aligning with the president's agenda and refusing to endorse "unscientific, reckless directives." Her lawyers deem the sacking illegal, asserting that only the president can remove a Senate-confirmed director. This change comes amidst a wave of resignations from senior CDC leaders, who have cited concerns over vaccine policies and the spread of misinformation.</p>

          <p>UK firms are raising concerns about the new U.S. taxes on low-value parcels, which have eliminated the "de minimis" exemption for shipments under $800. This policy change, effective Friday, is creating significant uncertainty and potential price increases for British small businesses. Many companies, like hand-dyed wool seller Helen Hickman and gift maker Jay Begum, have already paused or stopped shipping to the U.S. due to the inability to provide upfront costs to customers and fears of excessive charges or returns. The Federation of Small Businesses warns of increased costs and new barriers, making it harder for smaller UK exporters to compete in the American market.</p>

          <p>The White House has appointed Jim O’Neill, a deputy to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the acting head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This decision is expected to bolster Kennedy’s efforts to reshape federal vaccine policy, despite O’Neill's lack of a medical or scientific background. The appointment follows the controversial firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez, who, through her lawyers, insists she will not depart unless President Donald Trump himself removes her. Four other senior CDC leaders have resigned, condemning political interference, budget cuts, and the spread of misinformation under the current administration.</p>

          <p>The UK government has instructed a contractor, Mitie, to remove job adverts for floristry, hairdressing, and "ballooncraft" tutors at an immigration removal center near Heathrow airport. This directive came after public criticism and a report by The Sun newspaper highlighted the roles, some with salaries nearing £39,000. Home Office minister Seema Malhotra stated that not all advertised roles were deemed necessary. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp criticized the spending on "perks" instead of focusing on deportations. The incident raises questions about the allocation of resources and the types of activities offered to detainees at such facilities.</p>

          <p>Luo Weiwei, a former NASA scientist, has become a pivotal figure in China's semiconductor industry, particularly through her company Innoscience. Founded in 2015, Innoscience specializes in gallium nitride (GaN) technology, a material crucial for highly efficient power electronics. Under Luo's leadership, the company became the first globally to mass-produce 8-inch silicon-based GaN wafers within six years, significantly advancing China's position in third-generation semiconductor technology. This achievement is particularly notable amidst U.S. efforts to decouple from China in cutting-edge chip technology, demonstrating China's independent progress in this critical sector.</p>

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initiated a trace-back investigation, identifying the company's "sunshine/omega-3 golden yolk" eggs as the source of contamination. The company has agreed to recall the affected products, distributed between June 16 and July 9, bearing specific brand names and codes.

          <p>A federal judge in Tennessee has ordered a new trial for three former Memphis police officers convicted in connection with the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols in 2023. The decision by Judge Sheryl Lipman cited concerns of bias after the original presiding judge allegedly suggested one of the defendants was a gang member. Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith Jr. were convicted of witness tampering but acquitted of violating Nichols' civil rights. The fatal beating sparked nationwide protests over police brutality. This new trial underscores the complexities and challenges of ensuring fair legal proceedings in high-profile cases involving law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, Biloxi, Mississippi, continues to struggle with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) over $34 million in outstanding funding for critical rebuilding projects. Mayor Andrew "FoFo" Gilich describes a protracted battle, with FEMA offering only a fraction of the needed funds for projects like pier reconstruction and sewage system upgrades. The city claims costs have outpaced original estimates, while FEMA cites insufficient documentation. This ongoing dispute highlights broader issues within FEMA, including a significant backlog of Katrina relief projects across Louisiana and Mississippi, and recent controversies surrounding staff cuts and potential overhauls under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The UK, France, and Germany (E3) have begun the process to restore major UN sanctions on Iran, lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, citing Tehran's non-compliance. This move triggers a "snapback mechanism" that could reimpose sanctions within 30 days. The E3's letter to the UN Security Council highlights Iran's high enriched uranium stockpile as a clear threat, lacking civilian justification. Iran's foreign minister rejects the E3's legal jurisdiction but expresses readiness for "fair and balanced" negotiations. The U.S. supports the snapback, while Russia and China back Iran, intensifying the international standoff over its nuclear ambitions.</p>

This shift, part of broader policy updates including assigned seating, has drawn strong criticism from advocates for the plus-size community. Travelers like Jen McLellan express heartbreak, citing concerns about increased financial burdens and accessibility barriers. The previous policy offered dignity and eased anxiety for those needing extra space. Critics argue the change reflects a reversal of Southwest's inclusive stance and a general corporate trend of cutting back on diversity and inclusion initiatives amidst economic pressures.</p>

          <p>BBC Verify analysis of new video footage has revealed that Israel struck Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza at least four times during a deadly attack on Monday, not twice as initially reported. The incident reportedly killed 20 people, including five journalists. The analysis indicates two nearly simultaneous strikes on staircases in the first wave, followed by two separate projectiles hitting the same spot milliseconds apart later. Experts suggest the use of Lahat missiles or multi-purpose tank gun projectiles, implying involvement of at least two tanks. Israel's narrative has evolved, acknowledging a "tragic mishap" but not the multiple strikes, raising concerns about potential violations of international law.</p>
