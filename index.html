          <p>Coinbase reported a data breach on May 11, 2025, where cybercriminals bribed overseas support agents to steal customer data, potentially costing the company up to $400 million to fix. The compromised data included names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, masked bank account numbers, last four digits of Social Security numbers, government ID images, and account balances. While passwords and private keys were not compromised, Coinbase has launched a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminals and is cooperating with law enforcement. The company will also reimburse customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attackers.</p>

          <p>Walmart executives warned that despite reduced tariffs on China, the company may have to raise prices on certain items later in May or June of 2025. CEO Doug McMillon stated that higher tariffs will result in higher prices, despite efforts to control costs. The retailer also pulled its quarterly profit outlook amid global economic uncertainty, although it maintained its annual sales and profit forecast for fiscal 2026. Rising cost pressures from tariffs are impacting various markets, particularly China, which represents a significant volume in categories like electronics and toys.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is hearing arguments on a case that could expand presidential power, focusing on whether lower court judges can block presidential orders nationwide. The case stems from President Trump's executive order denying U.S. citizenship to babies born on American soil if their parents aren't citizens or permanent residents. The Justice Department argues that nationwide injunctions unfairly tie the president's hands, while critics warn that limiting judges' power would force individuals to file thousands of lawsuits to protect their rights. The court's ruling is expected by early July.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changes in the economy and policy.

Powell cautioned that policy changes could create a difficult balancing act between supporting employment and controlling inflation. He has also acknowledged the likelihood that tariffs will slow growth and boost inflation, although the extent of the impact is difficult to gauge.</p>

The 0.7% growth in the January-to-March period was "very encouraging," driven by increases in consumer spending and business investment. However, analysts warn that the strong rate of growth is unlikely to continue due to US import tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. The Labour government aims to boost the economy, but its policies face criticism from businesses and economists.</p>

This comes as Ukrainian and Russian representatives are set to meet in Istanbul for their first talks since 2022. Despite an invitation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Putin will not attend the Istanbul talks. Trump suggested he might travel to Istanbul if progress is made, emphasizing the need to end the conflict and reduce casualties.</p>

          <p>The EPA plans to weaken limits on some "forever chemicals" in drinking water that were finalized last year, while maintaining standards for two common ones. Limits on three types of PFAS, including GenX substances, will be scrapped and reconsidered, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS. The EPA will give utilities two extra years, until 2031, to comply and treat for PFOA and PFOS. Health advocates criticized the move, while water utilities took issue with the original rule, citing high treatment costs.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that a shortage of affordable homes is preventing many middle-income families from achieving homeownership. Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing homes out of reach for middle-class households, with only about 1 in 5 listed homes affordable for households with $75,000 in annual income. The affordability gap is worst in cities with restrictive zoning regulations. Federal and local initiatives, such as easing zoning rules and bolstering downpayment assistance programs, could help spur more homebuilding and relieve the affordability crunch.</p>
