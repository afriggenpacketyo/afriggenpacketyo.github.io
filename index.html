        <p>A US Department of Justice official, Elizabeth Oyer, was fired after refusing to recommend restoring Mel Gibson's gun rights.  Gibson's lawyer had contacted senior DOJ officials, citing Gibson's alleged special appointment by President Trump and successful film career. Oyer cited concerns about restoring gun rights to a domestic abuser.  After expressing her opposition, she faced pressure from senior officials, ultimately leading to her dismissal.  The DOJ denies Oyer's account.</p>

        <p>Following a significant drop in Tesla's stock price, President Trump announced his intention to purchase a new Tesla. He attributed the stock slump to a boycott by "radical left lunatics." However, analysts cited concerns about Tesla's production targets and sales as the primary reasons for the decline.  Trump's own economic policies, particularly tariffs, also contributed to investor anxieties.</p>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>FIFA is accused of preventing a labor inspection at Mexico's Azteca Stadium, which is being renovated for the 2026 World Cup.  The Building and Wood Workersâ€™ International (BWI) union claims FIFA reneged on a commitment to ensure worker safety.  The BWI highlights a lack of scrutiny on labor conditions in Mexico and alleges FIFA withdrew from an agreement on joint inspections. FIFA's human rights policy states a commitment to high labor standards, but the union criticizes FIFA's actions.</p>
