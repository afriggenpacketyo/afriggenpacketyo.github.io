          <p>JP Morgan Chase is mandating that employees provide biometric data, including fingerprints or eye scans, to access its new multibillion-dollar headquarters in New York. This requirement, which was previously intended to be voluntary, became compulsory for staff who began working in the skyscraper since August, though criteria for exemptions remain undefined. The investment bank implemented these stricter security protocols to bolster safety, especially after a recent shooting involving a health insurer CEO occurred near JP Morgan's offices. This move also aligns with broader corporate trends of increased surveillance and follows the bank's earlier directive for hybrid employees to return to the office full-time.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te has committed to accelerating the construction of a multi-layered "T-Dome" air defense system to bolster the island's defenses against escalating threats from China. During Taiwan's National Day address, Lai highlighted the need for a rigorous system featuring advanced detection and interception capabilities to protect the lives and property of its citizens. The government plans to propose a special defense budget by year-end, increasing defense spending to over 3% of GDP next year and 5% by 2030, while also strengthening domestic defense industries. Lai simultaneously called on Beijing to renounce force in the Taiwan Strait, affirming Taiwan's resolve to uphold peace through military strength.</p>

          <p>Former French finance minister Eric Lombard has declared that "free trade is dead," directly attributing its demise to the protectionist and unfair trade practices employed by the United States and China. During a Paris summit on competitiveness, Lombard strongly advocated for the European Union to adopt a more "nationalistic" approach to its trade policy. He issued a stark warning that if Europe fails to adequately protect itself from issues like Chinese dumping and American tariffs, it faces the risk of economic marginalization. This article underscores a significant shift in global trade discourse, highlighting European anxieties about its position between two major economic powers.</p>

          <p>Peruvian President Dina Boluarte was unanimously impeached by Congress, primarily due to her administration's perceived inability to control a significant increase in crime across the nation. This decisive vote followed closely on the heels of a public shooting at a concert in the capital, which exacerbated widespread frustration. Boluarte, who became Peru's first female president in December 2022 after her predecessor's impeachment, had faced persistent scandals, including allegations of undeclared luxury gifts in the "Rolexgate" affair, and suffered from extremely low approval ratings. José Jerí, the Congress President, has now been sworn in as interim leader, committing to address the country's severe crime problem.</p>

In exchange, Israel will release approximately 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees. The agreement also includes daily humanitarian aid deliveries and the deployment of a multinational monitoring force, though significant sticking points remain for later phases, such as Hamas disarming and future Gaza governance.</p>

          <p>President Trump is lauded for brokering a significant peace deal between Israel and Hamas, an achievement compared to historical presidential diplomatic successes. This article highlights the complexity of the agreement, which involves hostage releases and a potential end to the two-year conflict, though uncertainties about Gaza's future governance and Hamas's disarmament persist. However, the positive momentum was overshadowed by Trump's domestic actions, specifically the indictment of New York Attorney General Letitia James on bank fraud charges. Critics argue this indictment, facilitated by a Trump-appointed prosecutor, is a politically motivated act of retribution against an antagonist.</p>

          <p>A rising tide of Chinese skepticism regarding Western classical history and its academic framework is now directed at ancient Egyptian treasures, introducing an unexpected dimension to the long-standing partnership between the two nations. This article highlights how Huang Heqing, a retired art history professor from Zhejiang University, drew attention to a major exhibition on ancient Egypt at the Shanghai Museum. His critical examination of artifacts, such as a pair of grass sandals, underscores a broader trend where Chinese voices are increasingly questioning and re-evaluating established Western interpretations of global history.

          <p>Overnight Russian missile and drone strikes have caused significant power cuts across large areas of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, also leading to disruptions in water supplies for eastern districts. Nine people were injured in Kyiv, while a separate, tragic Russian drone attack in the Zaporizhzhia area resulted in the death of a seven-year-old child and injuries to three others. These intensified assaults on energy infrastructure, occurring as colder temperatures approach, have prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to urgently appeal for "real steps" from international allies.

This measure, incorporated into the annual defense policy bill, is intended to enhance US competitiveness in cutting-edge industries and restrict the flow of critical technology to foreign adversaries. However, the bill has drawn criticism from US tech leaders and industry organizations, who argue that such export controls could inadvertently hinder innovation and reduce global competition.

The comprehensive research, which analyzed millions of health records over two decades, also revealed that the vast majority of those affected had two or more of these conditions, with hypertension being the most common.

This deliberate circumvention allows properties to be rented to tourists throughout the year, directly undermining a regulation intended to safeguard London's crucial housing supply for long-term residents. Westminster City Council, currently investigating thousands of alleged breaches, contends that these practices render the law ineffective. While Airbnb states it employs an automatic capping system and responds to local authority reports, critics argue that such extensive evasion exacerbates the capital's already severe affordable housing crisis.</p>

          <p>London councils are set to receive £36.5 million in government funding to address the capital's homelessness crisis this winter, with one in 50 Londoners currently homeless and record numbers of children in temporary accommodation. The funding, part of a larger £84 million distribution across England, will primarily target preventing rough sleeping and supporting families in temporary housing, with a portion allocated for drug and alcohol treatment for rough sleepers. While welcomed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan and homelessness charities like Crisis, the latter called for a more comprehensive, long-term strategy to tackle the issue, which saw over 1,100 homeless deaths in the UK in 2024.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Commerce Ministry has officially blacklisted TechInsights, a prominent semiconductor research firm, effectively barring Chinese individuals and organizations from collaborating or sharing data with the Canadian-based company due to national security concerns. This action closely follows TechInsights' recent report, which indicated that Huawei's newest artificial intelligence chips contained components sourced from outside mainland China, corroborating similar findings by other research entities. These revelations have intensified scrutiny over the efficacy of US export controls, especially since Huawei has been on a US trade blacklist since 2019. Beijing's decision is likely to further obscure its domestic chip industry and accelerate its drive for semiconductor self-sufficiency amidst escalating global tech tensions.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on charges of bank fraud and making false statements related to a mortgage. This indictment follows public calls for charges by President Donald Trump, a long-time antagonist whom James successfully sued in a civil fraud case. The charges allege James misrepresented her use of a Norfolk, Virginia home, claiming it as a secondary residence while renting it out, potentially saving on interest. James vehemently denies the "baseless" charges, asserting they are a politically motivated "weaponization of our justice system" by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Scientists from China and Spain have achieved a significant breakthrough, discovering that salt-laced ice possesses the ability to generate electricity when subjected to bending. This innovative finding, which builds upon previous research by the same team, is attributed to flexoelectricity—a phenomenon where an electrical charge is produced when a material undergoes non-uniform strain. The researchers observed that salt-doped ice yielded an electrical response comparable to some of the most effective ceramic materials used for their electrical properties. This article underscores the potential for developing novel, low-cost clean energy sources specifically tailored for cold environments, opening exciting possibilities for sustainable power generation.</p>
