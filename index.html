          <p>An infant in Bakersfield, California, has died after being left in a car on a 101-degree day with a 2-year-old sibling. The mother, Maya Hernández, was reportedly receiving a lip filler procedure at a medical spa for approximately 90 minutes. The car's engine, which was left running with the air conditioning on, automatically shut off after an hour due to a vehicle feature, leading to a fatal rise in temperature inside. Hernández now faces charges of involuntary manslaughter and murder for the death of her one-year-old son.</p>

          <p>Top tennis players, including Amanda Anisimova and Carlos Alcaraz, are increasingly discussing the importance of mental health amid the sport's demanding 11-month season. Anisimova, a Wimbledon semi-finalist, took a significant break from tennis to address burnout, a step she credits for her recent success and return to the world's top 10. Other players like Andrey Rublev and Aryna Sabalenka also shared their strategies for managing psychological pressure, from working with therapists to fostering open communication. The conversations highlight a growing awareness of the mental toll of professional sports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's former President Yoon Suk-yeol has been returned to prison as prosecutors investigate accusations of insurrection. The charges stem from his declaration of martial law in December, when he allegedly sent armed soldiers to parliament to prevent a vote against his decree. A court approved a second detention warrant over concerns Yoon might destroy evidence, following his initial release on technical grounds. If convicted of insurrection, the 64-year-old former leader could face a life sentence, marking a significant political crisis for the nation.</p>

          <p>First responders successfully rescued 31 construction workers who were trapped after a tunnel collapsed in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred within the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, a massive infrastructure project designed to manage wastewater. The workers were reportedly able to climb over a large pile of dirt to escape the collapsed section and were then shuttled out from a distance of over five miles underground. The Los Angeles Fire Department deployed its Urban Search and Rescue teams, and thankfully, no significant injuries were reported among the rescued crew.</p>

Berry, who was knighted by Boris Johnson, heavily criticized the last two decades of both Conservative and Labour rule, stating they could not have done a better job of deliberately wrecking the country. His move follows other recent defections of former Tory MPs and signals growing momentum for Reform UK.

          <p>A group of 13 brown pelicans, who were sickened by a toxic algal bloom, have been successfully treated and released back into the wild in Huntington Beach. The recent bloom was the most severe in Southern California since 2015, poisoning hundreds of seabirds and marine mammals with domoic acid. The Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center rescued and rehabilitated the birds, and their release was celebrated by the community. The event serves as a positive reminder of successful wildlife conservation efforts, even as the region faces increasingly frequent and dangerous environmental challenges.</p>

          <p>Recent major floods in the neighboring states of New Mexico and Texas have highlighted the critical role of preparedness in disaster outcomes. In Ruidoso, New Mexico, where wildfires had previously created vulnerable 'burn scars,' expected flooding led to three deaths but the community was prepared and recovered quickly. In contrast, a few days earlier in Texas, the ferocity of the inundation caught officials by surprise, resulting in at least 119 fatalities. The comparison underscores how recent experience with and anticipation of specific weather risks can significantly influence a community's response and ultimate survival rate.</p>

          <p>A senior Israeli official, speaking anonymously in Washington, has cast doubt on the likelihood of achieving a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. The official suggested a 60-day ceasefire might be possible within weeks but stated that a lasting peace is 'questionable' as long as Hamas remains. He reiterated Israel's core war aims of returning hostages and eliminating Hamas, indicating that no permanent truce is possible unless the group completely disarms. The comments highlight the significant gap between the negotiating parties, particularly over the future governance of Gaza and the presence of Israeli forces.</p>

          <p>President Trump has named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as the temporary head of NASA. The appointment comes weeks after the president withdrew his initial nominee, billionaire Jared Isaacman, citing a review of his 'prior associations' and noting he was a Democrat recommended by Elon Musk. In a social media post, Trump praised Duffy as a 'fantastic leader' for the space agency. This move places another cabinet member in a dual-hatted role and comes at a critical time for NASA as it pursues ambitious goals, including returning astronauts to the moon and a future mission to Mars.</p>

The man pleaded guilty to assaulting a police animal and paid the vet bill. Freddie sustained bruising but has since been cleared to return to his job of detecting illegal agricultural products.</p>

          <p>Recent US tariff policies targeting Chinese goods transshipped through Southeast Asia are creating significant uncertainty for Chinese manufacturers. President Trump's moves have put the ASEAN region, China's largest export market, directly in Washington's trade crosshairs. The lack of clear implementation details on how the US will handle transshipment is forcing many Chinese companies to adopt a cautious 'wait-and-see' approach. This ambiguity is disrupting supply chains and complicating investment decisions for businesses that had been using Southeast Asian countries to navigate previous rounds of tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports could lead to higher prices for a wide range of consumer products, according to economists. Copper is a critical component in electrical wiring, plumbing, appliances, electronics, and electric vehicles. Experts warn that the hefty tariff will increase costs for manufacturers, which will likely be passed on to consumers, potentially fueling inflation. While the administration argues the tariff will reshore manufacturing and protect national security, the U.S. currently imports over half of its copper, and ramping up domestic production would take years.

The recovery has been particularly slow for Black and Hispanic Californians, who continue to experience a significantly larger life expectancy gap compared to pre-pandemic levels.

The claim was met with skepticism, as the House Speaker has no formal power to block a presidential pardon. Before making the allegation, Santos posted a statement declaring he was not suicidal, expressing concern about the dangers faced by gay men in federal custody.</p>
