            <p>Joe Thompson, a former Rochdale midfielder, has tragically died at the age of 36 after a prolonged battle with cancer. Diagnosed with cancer for the third time in April of last year, Thompson had previously recovered twice during his playing career. Rochdale expressed their devastation, highlighting Thompson's loving personality and inspirational spirit, and acknowledged his role as a devoted husband and father.

Plant encourages building social connections, recognizing the trustworthiness of others, and supporting effective charities that address issues like depression and malnutrition. By choosing decency over cruelty and evidence over bluster, individuals can help build a happier, higher-trust society and counteract the negative effects of Trumpism. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A comprehensive study published in Frontiers in Oncology indicates strong support for medical cannabis as a potential treatment for cancer symptoms and potentially the disease itself. The analysis, which examined over 10,000 studies, found that cannabis is beneficial for managing inflammation, appetite loss, and nausea related to cancer, and may even fight cancer cells. While some experts remain skeptical about cannabis's ability to cure cancer, citing the need for more clinical trials, the study's lead author hopes the findings will encourage the DEA to reclassify cannabis, facilitating further research. This could lead to new treatment options and improve the quality of life for cancer patients. (not investment advice)</p>

The incident occurred on Mount Faito, and a fifth person was seriously injured.

            <p>A Japanese bus driver with 29 years of service was fired and lost his $84,000 retirement package after being caught stealing $7 from passenger fares. Despite initially winning a court case arguing the punishment was excessive, the Supreme Court overturned the verdict, upholding the city's decision. The court ruled that the man's conduct could undermine public trust in the system. The city hailed the decision, emphasizing the importance of maintaining public trust in employees handling public money.</p>

            <p>Manchester United secured a victory against Lyon in what Harry Maguire described as the "maddest game" he's played in. With a Premier League campaign that sees the 20-time champions of England floundering in 14th, United boss Ruben Amorim says he will trust the "kids" to guide the club through the remainder of the Premier League season in order to rest some of his senior players for Europe. United will face Spanish side Athletic Bilbao in the semi-finals, after their 2-0 aggregate win against Rangers. </p>

            <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers, despite being a top team with star players, are pricing out many local fans with rising ticket costs, challenging the notion that baseball remains an affordable family sport. With average ticket prices significantly higher than other teams, attending a game at Dodger Stadium is becoming increasingly expensive for middle-class families. While the team and its sponsors provide some free and discount tickets, the overall trend raises concerns about accessibility and the long-term impact on fan base development. The debate highlights the tension between maximizing revenue and nurturing a new generation of baseball enthusiasts. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Republicans in numerous state legislatures are advancing bills that would require documentary proof of citizenship to vote, sparking concerns about restricted voter access. These measures, fueled by unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud, could disproportionately impact certain groups and undermine confidence in elections. The state-level moves align with national efforts to tighten voter ID requirements and limit voter registration, raising questions about the integrity and fairness of the electoral process. Opponents argue that such restrictions are based on false premises and could disenfranchise eligible American citizens.</p>

            <p>A group of tech billionaires who backed Donald Trump's candidacy in 2024, believing his pro-business policies would accelerate economic growth and technological progress, have been proven wrong. Trump's trade war has depressed consumer confidence and deterred business investment by driving up costs and increasing economic uncertainty, resulting in a potential recession. Additionally, Trump has undermined America's diplomatic credibility, leading European and Asian powers to consider China a more stable global superpower. His administration's cuts to federal science funding, restrictions on mRNA research, and actions that discourage foreign-born scientists from immigrating to the US have further undermined American innovation.</p>
