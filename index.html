          <p>Google has agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle allegations that it violated the data privacy rights of Texas residents. According to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, the lawsuit, filed in 2022, accused Google of unlawfully tracking and collecting users' private data, including movements, searches, voiceprints, and facial geometry. Google stated that the settlement addresses old claims related to product policies that have since been changed and that they are committed to building robust privacy controls into their services. Paxton hailed the settlement as a major win for Texans' privacy, sending a message that companies will be held accountable for abusing trust.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was released from an immigration detention facility in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered her release, stating that her continued detention could chill the speech of millions of non-citizens. Ozturk had been detained since March, accused by the Department of Homeland Security of supporting Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization, allegedly based on an op-ed critical of Israel she co-authored in a Tufts student newspaper. The judge found no evidence of violence or advocacy of violence and emphasized the importance of protecting First Amendment rights for non-citizens. The ACLU, representing Ozturk, expressed delight at her release, underscoring the principle that no one should be imprisoned for expressing their beliefs.</p>

          <p>White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge detention in court, for migrants. Miller argued that the United States is facing a national security threat due to undocumented migrants "invading" the country, justifying the potential suspension. Legal experts, however, argue that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus and that unilateral suspensions by the President are unconstitutional. This consideration follows the administration's previous attempts to use the Alien Enemies Act for speedy deportations, which were blocked by federal judges. The article highlights the constitutional implications and legal debates surrounding this potential action.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are set to begin trade talks in Switzerland, marking the first high-level meeting since the Trump administration imposed tariffs on China in January, prompting immediate retaliation from Beijing. Despite heated rhetoric from both sides, both countries are signaling a desire to break the deadlock as factory output in China has taken a hit, while the US economy contracted for the first time in three years due to tariff-related uncertainties. The talks coincide with Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow, projecting China as an alternative global leader, and Trump acknowledges the impact of tariffs on US consumers. Both countries face pressure to reassure nervous markets and domestic constituencies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into the import of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and related parts, which could result in new tariffs imposed under the Trade Expansion Act, citing national security interests. The Commerce Department will seek industry input on various factors, including domestic demand, the role of foreign suppliers, and foreign government support. While the aerospace industry has historically maintained a trade surplus, it heavily relies on a global supply chain, with critical parts often produced by a limited number of manufacturers. Companies like Boeing and RTX have already expressed concerns about the potential impact of existing tariffs on their suppliers and costs.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President Trump in Washington as documents related to his previously abandoned federal corruption case were released. While the mayor's office stated the meeting focused on New York City priorities like infrastructure projects, Trump suggested Adams was there to thank him. The released documents, requested by The New York Times, revealed that the FBI had investigated Adams for potential witness tampering, though he was never charged. The case against Adams was dismissed last month after intervention from the Justice Department, a move that caused internal controversy and resignations.</p>

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed the 90-second outage impacted communications and radar display. The incident occurred shortly after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the Trump administration's plan to overhaul the U.S. air traffic control system to address outdated equipment issues. United Airlines has been limiting flights to and from Newark due to the ongoing problems. Senator Charles Schumer called for immediate action to fix the connection between New York airspace and the Philadelphia air traffic control center.</p>

President Trump has proposed a transactional offer to President Zelensky, demanding access to Ukraine's critical minerals in exchange for arms shipments. As a result, Ukraine is increasingly relying on European allies and building its own defense industry, as the once unbreakable bond with the United States appears to be weakening.</p>

The San Francisco-based company generated $169.8 million in revenue during 2024, up 38% from $122.8 million the previous year. Omada contracts with employers, and the company said it works with more than 2,000 customers and supports 679,000 members as of March 31.

          <p>Chinese buyers have purchased between 400,000 and 500,000 metric tons of wheat from Australia and Canada in recent weeks due to concerns that a heatwave may damage crops in China’s agricultural heartlands. Henan province, which grows about a third of China's crop, issued a risk warning due to hot, dry weather. The purchases from Australia are the first by China from the country since last year. Despite these purchases, there is no guarantee that more will follow, as China has large wheat inventories and faltering economic growth is depressing demand for grains.</p>

          <p>Rich Trumka Jr., a former commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), plans to challenge his dismissal by President Trump, claiming it is illegal. Trumka stated his firing occurred after he and other commissioners opposed allowing members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to work at the agency, fearing they would undermine product safety. Consumer Reports and Democratic senators have condemned the firings, calling them an attack on the independence of the CPSC. Trumka argues that his dismissal could cripple the agency's lifesaving functions to benefit wealthy donors.</p>

This pageant of puppetry includes a flutter of butterflies, a goat with a plaintive bleat, a menagerie of wild animals and, at one point, a school of glowing fish. The story revolves around the survival at sea of a 17-year-old boy named Pi Patel (a mesmerizing Taha Mandviwala) after the Japanese cargo ship transporting his family sinks en route to Canada. The staging transitions in dreamlike fashion from the hospital to Pondicherry, India, where Pi grew up in a happy, hectic ferment of adolescence.</p>

          <p>The acquittal of three former Memphis police officers on murder charges in the death of Tyre Nichols has raised concerns about the future of police reform. Despite video evidence of a savage beating, the jury's decision underscores the difficulty of securing murder convictions against officers, especially when compared to the convictions of officers in the George Floyd case. The article suggests that broader systemic reforms are necessary, but changing political winds and rising violent crime have stalled progress both locally in Memphis and nationally. The author argues that the failure to secure murder convictions and bring greater accountability means that Nichols will not be the last to suffer an unjust death.</p>

The lawsuit challenges President Trump's executive order declaring a "national energy emergency" and argues that agencies are improperly permitting projects under the Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act. The states contend that this will cause significant and irreparable harm to natural and historic resources.

          <p>Chinese exports to the U.S. plunged in April following increased tariffs, making it too costly for many U.S.-based retailers to import goods. The Trump administration raised tariffs on Chinese goods to up to 145%, leading China to retaliate with 125% levies on American goods. Shipments of goods from China to the U.S. dropped 21% compared with the same period one year earlier, while exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by the same amount.

The agreement maintains a 10% tariff on U.K. imports, which serves as a baseline import tax. While lower than some other tariffs, it is still higher than the pre-Trump effective tariff rate. The trade war's impact on the economy has raised concerns about a potential recession, and consumer spending could decrease.
