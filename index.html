          <p>Venezuela has strongly condemned the United States for allegedly detaining one of its fishing boats for eight hours in its exclusive economic zone. Caracas claims the USS Jason Dunham, a destroyer, illegally boarded the vessel with 18 armed agents, calling it a "direct provocation" aimed at escalating conflict and justifying regime change. This incident further heightens tensions between the two nations, which have been strained by US military patrols targeting drug cartels in the Caribbean and President Trump's increased pressure on Venezuelan leader Maduro.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly drafted plans to deploy 1,000 Louisiana National Guard troops for law enforcement operations in the state's urban centers, including New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Citing military planning documents, the proposal aims to supplement local police and assist with drug interdiction, despite falling violent crime rates in many US cities. Critics, including Louisiana residents, view the potential deployment as a political maneuver rather than a genuine crime-fighting solution, raising concerns about the militarization of domestic law enforcement.</p>

Lara Trump blamed the media for fostering political violence, and the White House released a video tribute, underscoring the deep political and cultural impact of the tragedy.</p>

          <p>A Mexican congressional staffer resigned following online backlash and implied threats from a US Deputy Secretary of State over comments made on television about Charlie Kirk's assassination. Salvador Ramírez, from Mexico’s ruling Morena party, had facetiously suggested Kirk "was given a spoonful of his own chocolate" due to his pro-gun stance. The incident highlights the Trump administration's willingness to exert diplomatic pressure on foreign nationals and media outlets for perceived disrespect towards conservative figures, leading to job losses beyond US borders.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Robinson, who is not a student at the university, was taken into custody after his father recognized him from law enforcement photos and urged him to surrender. The investigation revealed inscriptions on bullet casings, including "Hey fascist! CATCH!", though a motive remains unconfirmed. The FBI offered a $100,000 reward and received over 11,000 leads, underscoring the high-profile nature of this "political assassination."</p>

This comes amid heightened tensions following Russian drone incursions into Polish airspace, with Europe having drastically reduced but not entirely eliminated its reliance on Russian energy since the 2022 Ukraine invasion.</p>

          <p>A 37-year-old man, Ionut-Cristian Bold, has been charged with six counts of racially or religiously aggravated criminal damage and one count of harassment in connection with a series of attacks on synagogues and a private residence in north-west London. Between September 4 and 11, a substance, understood to be bodily fluids, was smeared on four synagogues and thrown at a school and car. Police described the incidents as "revolting and appalling," and the charges reflect a serious response to hate-motivated crimes targeting the Jewish community.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Memphis, Tennessee, will be the next US city to receive National Guard troops as part of his administration's crime crackdown, a decision he claimed the city's mayor supported. However, Memphis Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, expressed his displeasure, stating he learned of the deployment via Fox News and did not request it. While acknowledging Memphis's high crime rate, Young emphasized the need for financial resources and police support rather than military intervention, fearing the deployment could evoke negative historical images.</p>

          <p>Fox News co-host Brian Kilmeade ignited controversy by suggesting that homeless individuals suffering from mental health issues who refuse help should be "involuntary lethal injection[ed]" or simply "just kill 'em." The comments, made during a discussion about a Ukrainian refugee's fatal stabbing by a suspect with schizophrenia, drew strong condemnation, including from California Governor Gavin Newsom. The segment highlighted a broader debate on homelessness and the mental health crisis in the US, with critics slamming the remark as "deeply evil" and dehumanizing.</p>

          <p>Famed economist David Rosenberg warns that the S&P 500 is in a "gigantic price bubble," with its Shiller CAPE ratio at its third-highest level ever, signaling potential negative returns ahead. Historically, such high valuations have been reliable predictors of weak long-term market performance. Rosenberg, known for calling the 2008 recession, also points to rising recession risks as the labor market slows. His analysis suggests investors should heed the data indicating a historically expensive market, despite short-term unpredictability. (not investment advice)</p>
