          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler made a significant climb to third place at the Procore Championship, delivering an impressive eight-under-par 64 in the third round. He now trails leader Ben Griffin by two shots, who maintained his position with a consistent 70, ending the day at 16 under par. US amateur Jackson Koivun currently holds second place, one shot ahead of Scheffler, after a round of 68. This tournament serves as crucial preparation for Scheffler, Griffin, and eight other US Ryder Cup players ahead of their upcoming match against Europe in New York. Scheffler's strong performance, featuring ten birdies, moved him up from 14th overnight, despite a double bogey on the 14th hole.</p>

          <p>Robert Andrews Jr., who maintained an unassuming facade as a working father, was unmasked as the mastermind behind a multi-million-pound cocaine and heroin trafficking network in South Wales. His extensive drug empire was uncovered after incriminating WhatsApp messages were found on another gang leader's phone, prompting a detailed police surveillance operation. Andrews Jr. was observed conducting brazen Class A drug deals in broad daylight and using his illicit profits to build a lavish, unfinished home. He was ultimately sentenced to 14 years and eight months in prison for conspiracy to supply and actual supply of these controlled substances, with other significant members of his organized crime group also receiving substantial sentences.</p>

          <p>A new study strongly suggests that women aiming to conceive should abstain from cannabis use, as it may negatively impact fertility and the success of in vitro fertilization (IVF). The research found that THC, the active compound in cannabis, interferes with the development and stability of egg cells, resulting in a significantly lower proportion of genetically healthy embryos in THC-positive IVF patients. While experts acknowledge the important findings, they also call for further comprehensive studies to examine THC's effects across different age groups and consumption patterns, as well as considering other influential factors.</p>

          <p>China has issued four travel advisories since April, cautioning its citizens about public security risks in the Philippines, including reported crimes targeting Chinese nationals. These repeated warnings, which also include specific alerts for Chinese students, could potentially lead to a slowdown in two-way trade, investment, and higher education exchanges between the two nations. Analysts suggest that while most Chinese citizens visiting for legal purposes generally encounter few issues, the advisories reflect escalating diplomatic tensions and could have significant economic repercussions if heeded by Chinese travelers and businesses. Beijing maintains that the average Chinese citizen visiting the archipelago for legal trade, investment, study or tourism seldom gets in trouble, although they need to be alert to potential risks.</p>

Despite the judges scoring it tighter than anticipated, the unbeaten 37-year-old's victory cemented his status as boxing's pound-for-pound star. This defining performance, on a grand stage, will be remembered as a landmark achievement in the sport's history.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the Nazi regime's Nuremberg Laws systematically disenfranchised and persecuted Jewish Germans and other minorities, Germany continues to grapple with the enduring legacy of ancestry-based discrimination. While the current German constitution guarantees equality, statements from far-right politicians, such as the AfD's Stefan Möller, echo the Nazi-era distinction between "Reich citizens" and "state citizens," reinforcing racial prejudice. Experts highlight that racial discrimination persists, with immigrants often feeling unprotected and experiencing a lack of the constitutional promise of equality. The article emphasizes the ongoing societal challenge to overcome racist and antisemitic prejudices, urging collective responsibility beyond state action.</p>

Following a lengthy interrogation, Knox and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were arrested after Knox changed her statement. The investigation faced significant criticism regarding its handling of forensic evidence and shifting police theories, particularly after the involvement of Rudy Guede, whose DNA was found at the crime scene. Knox and Sollecito were initially convicted but later acquitted on appeal, having spent nearly four years in prison, highlighting the dramatic twists and turns of the legal process.</p>

          <p>A growing trend among teenagers involves adopting intense "cut and bulk" bodybuilding regimes, heavily influenced by social media, in pursuit of muscular physiques. This cycle entails consuming hundreds of extra calories to gain size, followed by calorie restriction to lose fat and achieve a leaner look. While some young individuals, like 14-year-old George Holland, report positive experiences and discipline, sports nutritionists express serious concerns. They warn that such extreme practices can negatively impact hormone health, growth, and development during crucial formative years, potentially leading to eating disorders such as muscle dysmorphia.

Observers are particularly keen to monitor the performance of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), classified as "right-wing extremist," as it aims to expand its voter base beyond its traditional strongholds in eastern Germany. The election results will offer significant insights into the current popularity of both the federal government and state premier Hendrik Wüst, who is tipped as a potential successor to Merz, amid a broader national shift towards the right.</p>

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, the newly appointed President of the UN General Assembly, has suggested the potential deployment of UN peacekeeping forces, or Blue Helmets, to Ukraine to secure a future ceasefire and post-war peace. Speaking to German media, Baerbock emphasized the critical need for such missions to ensure lasting stability, provided they receive majority support from UN member states. However, this proposal faces a significant obstacle: Russia, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, holds veto power over peacekeeping missions. With ceasefire talks stalled and Russia demanding concessions on Ukraine's NATO and EU ambitions, the prospect of UN peacekeepers remains distant.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has instigated a widespread crackdown on critical commentary, leading to numerous individuals losing their jobs across various sectors. Teachers, journalists, politicians, and even Pentagon employees have faced suspension or termination for expressing views perceived as mocking or condoning Kirk's murder. This swift response, ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has ignited a contentious debate over free speech and the appropriate public reaction to political violence. Critics highlight the perceived hypocrisy, noting that some Republican figures now expressing outrage had previously mocked victims of political violence themselves.</p>

The Hostages and Missing Families Forum stated that Israel's strike on Qatar indicates Netanyahu sabotages deals as they approach. They condemned his response to the strike as an "excuse for failing to bring home" the hostages, claiming his "stalling" has cost lives and threatens others.

          <p>Taiwan's profound reliance on imported energy is identified as its most critical strategic vulnerability should a conflict with Beijing erupt, with experts warning that a prolonged blockade could paralyze the island within days. Limited domestic storage capacity further exacerbates this risk, creating a significant liability for Taiwan's energy grid reliability and overall economic continuity. Analysts suggest China could exploit this weakness through multifaceted tactics, including cyber warfare, selective maritime quarantines, and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan's energy suppliers, aiming to undermine societal resilience. This highlights an urgent need for Taiwan to enhance its energy security amidst escalating cross-strait tensions.</p>
