          <p>The U.S. has revoked the visa of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and 80 other officials, a move preceding key United Nations meetings. The State Department cited national security interests and holding the Palestinian Authority accountable for undermining peace prospects. Palestinian officials condemned the decision as a violation of U.S. commitments as the UN's host nation and have been contacting international partners, including the EU and Spain, to pressure the U.S. to reverse the action. This escalation is the latest in a series of visa restrictions imposed by the Trump administration on Palestinians.</p>

          <p>Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have announced that an Israeli airstrike killed Ahmed al-Rahawi, the prime minister of their rebel-controlled government. The strike reportedly occurred in the capital, Sanaa, during a government workshop, killing several other ministers as well. The Israeli military confirmed it had precisely struck a Houthi military target in the area. This event marks a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict, where Houthis have been launching attacks against Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The USS Lake Erie, a U.S. guided-missile cruiser, has been observed crossing the Panama Canal into the Caribbean, following the deployment of other warships near Venezuela. The U.S. administration has stated the deployment is part of an anti-drug trafficking operation, having previously accused Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of leading a drug cartel. In response, Venezuela has deployed its own security forces and mobilized militia members, denouncing what it calls "outlandish threats." The move reflects heightened military posturing and political tensions between Washington and Caracas.</p>

Parubiy was a co-founder of the Maidan "self-defence" units and later served as secretary of the National Security and Defence Council.

          <p>Severe drought in Iraq has caused water levels in the Mosul Dam reservoir to drop, leading to the discovery of approximately 40 ancient tombs. Archaeologists believe the tombs, unearthed in the Duhok province, date back over 2,300 years to the Hellenistic or Hellenistic-Seleucid period. While the drought has had devastating impacts on agriculture and electricity, it has created opportunities for archaeological excavation in areas previously submerged. The team is working to excavate and preserve the artifacts before water levels rise again.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court in Washington D.C. has ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his presidential powers by imposing widespread tariffs based on a declared national emergency. The 7-4 decision found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unlimited authority to impose taxes. The ruling voids the tariffs but has been stayed until October 14 to allow the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. This decision represents a significant legal challenge to Trump's trade policies and could have major financial implications for the U.S. Treasury. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Utah Supreme Court has stayed the execution of Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old inmate on death row, due to his dementia diagnosis. His lawyers argued that his cognitive decline is so severe he cannot comprehend why he is being executed, which would violate constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment. Menzies, who was convicted of a 1986 murder, had chosen to be executed by firing squad. The court ordered a lower court to re-evaluate his competency, acknowledging the suffering of the victim's family but emphasizing their duty to uphold the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Restaurant chain Cracker Barrel has reversed a recent rebranding effort after facing a significant backlash from conservative voices, including Donald Trump Jr. and the President himself. The company's move to a minimalist logo was decried as "woke," leading to a drop in its stock price and a campaign to "break the Barrel." After Trump publicly called for the old logo to be restored, the company acquiesced, thanking him for his input. The incident is being viewed as a major victory in the right's culture war against corporations perceived as adopting progressive values.</p>

Nelson argues that as we destroy natural habitats, we create "choreographed, hyper-managed, curated versions of nature" in zoos, theme parks, and tourist experiences. His photographs capture these paradoxes, from tourists recreating a scene from "Out of Africa" in Kenya to elephants chained underwater for an Instagram-friendly infinity pool backdrop in Sri Lanka. The project serves as a commentary on our sense of loss for the natural world and our attempts to replace it with artificial facsimiles.</p>

          <p>This opinion article questions why the international community and media took so long to acknowledge the possibility of genocide in Gaza, despite early and persistent warnings from Palestinians. The author argues that Palestinian testimony is often dismissed or required to be validated by non-Palestinian sources, a phenomenon rooted in the dehumanization essential to a colonial project. The piece criticizes the media's framing of the conflict, which often strips Palestinians of their right to narrate their own suffering without first condemning Hamas. The author concludes that the recent shift in discourse is not a moral awakening but a reaction to more palatable forms of suffering like starvation.</p>

Prosecutors allege the men provided inaccurate information about a May 2021 leak, causing the Navy to report that only 1,600 gallons had spilled instead of the actual 20,000. These are the first indictments related to the incident, which has led to numerous lawsuits and a decision to close the aging facility.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a massive overnight missile and drone attack across 14 regions of Ukraine, killing one person and injuring 30 in the Zaporizhzhia region. President Zelensky stated that over 500 drones and 45 missiles were used, damaging infrastructure. In response, Ukraine's military reported successful strikes on Russian oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran, causing explosions and fires. The exchange of heavy fire comes as international diplomatic efforts to end the war remain stalled, with both sides escalating their long-range attacks on critical targets.</p>

          <p>Low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than a year, though it plans to continue normal operations during the restructuring. The airline, which emerged from its previous bankruptcy in March, stated that more work was needed to address its financial challenges, including $2.4 billion in long-term debt. Spirit has struggled with rising operational costs and poor demand for domestic leisure travel since the pandemic. The company has already planned furloughs for pilots and is considering selling off aircraft to raise cash.</p>

          <p>A North Carolina pastor, Kelvis Reid, is recovering after a life-saving heart and kidney transplant to treat AL amyloidosis, a rare and aggressive disease. The condition caused abnormal proteins to build up on his organs, making his heart "hard like cement" and leading to a major cardiac arrest. After weeks on life support, his doctors successfully advocated for him to receive the double transplant. Eighteen months later, Reid has returned to his pulpit and recently participated in a 5K run, inspiring others to be vigilant about their health.</p>

          <p>The landscape of Indian food in the United States is undergoing a significant transformation, moving from a reputation for cheap buffets to a burgeoning upscale and fine-dining scene. Restaurateurs like Vikas Khanna, whose restaurants have earned Michelin stars and massive waitlists, are leading the charge. This shift is driven by a growing American interest in global and hyper-regional flavors, as well as an increasingly affluent Indian American population. As a result, investor interest is growing, with private equity firms now backing popular Indian restaurant chains looking to expand in the U.S. market.</p>

          <p>U.S. law enforcement agencies are increasingly alarmed by the interest far-right extremist groups are showing in using commercially available or homemade drones for domestic attacks. Drawing inspiration from their use in modern warfare and by drug cartels, these groups discuss drones as a critical tool for a future insurgency against the U.S. government. Analysts have tracked online chatter and a recent foiled plot by a neo-Nazi to bomb a power station, indicating a tangible threat. The accessibility and low cost of first-person viewer (FPV) drones make them a potent potential weapon for targeting critical infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of President Trump's executive order to prosecute flag-burners suggests it is legally flawed and likely to backfire. The Supreme Court has twice ruled that flag-burning is a form of protected speech under the First Amendment. While the order directs officials to use "content-neutral" laws, such as general prohibitions on public burning, the order's explicit focus on the message of flag-burning could provide defendants with a "selective prosecution" defense. Legal experts argue the order is an empty threat that will do nothing to expand government power and may instead encourage more acts of protest.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the University of California system should sue the Trump administration rather than negotiate over hundreds of millions of dollars in illegally frozen research funds. The author, who is co-counsel in a similar successful lawsuit brought by Harvard researchers, contends that the administration's actions violate federal law and the First Amendment. The administration's stated reason is antisemitism on campus, but the author calls this a pretext to advance an ideological agenda and extort money from universities. The piece urges UC officials to fight back in court, stating that capitulating to a bully will only encourage future overreach.</p>

These brands, which have lucrative sponsorship deals with top NBA players, have been connected to factories that use Uyghur and other ethnic minorities transferred from Xinjiang under coercive conditions. The report highlights the NBA's complex financial relationship with China and the ethical dilemmas faced by players and the league. The findings follow years of activism by former player Enes Kanter Freedom, who claims he was pushed out of the league for his criticism of China and Nike.</p>

          <p>A new book explores why China can build massive infrastructure projects at a "breakneck" speed while the U.S. struggles. The author posits that China is an "engineering state," run by leaders with technical backgrounds who view society as a problem to be solved, leading to monumental projects like high-speed rail. In contrast, the U.S. is a "lawyerly society" where legal processes, regulations, and litigation often lead to paralysis and gridlock. While the engineering mindset allows for rapid progress, it has also led to brutal social engineering policies, such as the one-child policy.</p>

He used the opportunity to urge his followers to use sunscreen, especially during the weekend. Basal cell carcinoma is one of the main types of non-melanoma skin cancer, often caused by sun exposure, and is typically easily treated when caught early.</p>
