          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that Ukraine will not cede any territory to Russia for a peace agreement. His remarks came in response to suggestions that a potential deal, discussed ahead of a planned summit between U.S. President Trump and Vladimir Putin, could involve land swaps. Zelenskyy emphasized that any negotiations conducted without Ukraine's direct involvement would be considered "dead decisions" and counterproductive to achieving a lasting peace. He reiterated that his country's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and a fundamental principle enshrined in its constitution, underscoring Kyiv's insistence on being a central party in any resolution to the conflict.</p>

Lee Yi-yang, who serves as Taiwan's de facto ambassador to Japan, attended the events in an unprecedented move, signaling Taiwan's effort to enhance its international visibility. While Tokyo and Beijing have been carefully managing their relationship, this development is viewed by observers as a potential point of friction.

          <p>Authorities in Los Angeles County are investigating a significant theft where a group of masked individuals stole approximately $7,000 worth of collectible Labubu dolls. The incident occurred early Wednesday morning at a store in La Puente, with surveillance footage capturing the suspects breaking in and making off with the entire inventory. The dolls, created by artist Kasing Lung, have gained immense popularity over the last decade. The store owner expressed shock over the event, which not only resulted in a major financial loss but also left the establishment trashed, and has appealed to the public for help in identifying the thieves.</p>

Despite a slow start and challenging, humid conditions, Raducanu demonstrated resilience and strategic play, capitalizing on her opponent's errors and leveraging her strong return game. This win continues her recent trend of solid performances against lower-ranked players and builds on her momentum from recent tournaments in Washington and Montreal. Her victory sets up a challenging third-round match against either the world number one or a former Wimbledon champion.</p>

          <p>Cincinnati Bengals head coach Zac Taylor has explained his team's unconventional approach to training camp, opting out of joint practices that are common across the NFL. Taylor stated he prefers to focus on internal development and use preseason games as the primary opportunity for starters, like quarterback Joe Burrow, to get valuable reps. He believes that focusing on the Bengals' own installations and tweaking their systems is more beneficial at this stage than preparing for a specific opponent in a practice setting. This strategy allows the team to continue evaluating position battles, such as on the offensive line, in a controlled, competitive environment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's justice secretary has announced new proposals that would allow for the immediate deportation of foreign criminals upon receiving a custodial sentence. Under this plan, individuals with fixed-term sentences could be removed from the country right away and would be barred from re-entry. The decision of whether they serve their sentence abroad would be left to their home country, which critics note could mean some offenders walk free. The government argues the measure will save taxpayer money and enhance public safety, while those serving life sentences for the most serious crimes would still complete their prison term in the UK before deportation.</p>

The administration has aimed to use the IRS to aid in its immigration crackdown, but Long's agency cited taxpayer privacy rights in its refusal to hand over most of the requested information.

          <p>The depiction of Kashmir in India's Hindi-language film industry, Bollywood, has undergone a significant transformation over the past several decades. Initially portrayed as a romantic, idyllic paradise in the years after India's independence, the region's cinematic image shifted dramatically with the rise of militancy in the late 1980s. Films began to depict Kashmir as a conflict zone, a battleground for nationalist narratives. In recent years, particularly since the 2019 abrogation of Article 370, films have often aligned more closely with government perspectives, reflecting the changing political and social dynamics of both India and the contested territory.</p>

          <h2>North Korea Reportedly Dismantling Propaganda Loudspeakers at Border with South</h2>

          <p>In a potential sign of easing tensions, the South Korean military has detected North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border. This action follows South Korea's own move to dismantle its speakers earlier in the week, which had been broadcasting anti-Pyongyang messages and K-pop music. The tit-for-tat psychological warfare had escalated in recent months, contributing to heightened animosity between the two nations. This de-escalation comes as South Korea's new liberal government seeks to improve relations, though Pyongyang has so far been publicly dismissive of Seoul's diplomatic overtures.</p>

          <p>In excerpts from her upcoming memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has denied the existence of a conspiracy to destroy her predecessor and one-time mentor, Alex Salmond. She writes about the painful breakdown of their political partnership, which she says became inevitable after she refused to intervene in an investigation into allegations of his inappropriate behavior. Sturgeon accuses Salmond of being unwilling to accept responsibility and instead fabricating a narrative of a wide-ranging plot against him involving senior government officials and police. She describes the period as engaging in "mortal political combat" with someone she knew to be ruthless.</p>

          <p>An explosion along the Thai-Cambodian border has injured three Thai soldiers, with one suffering a severe leg injury after stepping on a landmine. The incident occurred in a contested border region and threatens to destabilize a fragile ceasefire that ended deadly clashes between the two nations just days ago. The Thai army has condemned the event, stating it is a clear violation of the Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel mines and a significant obstacle to peaceful resolutions. Cambodia has denied laying new mines, stating that any remaining devices are remnants from past conflicts that plagued the region for decades.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced he will hold a press conference on Monday, claiming it will "essentially, stop violent crime in Washington, D.C." This announcement follows a week in which the White House initiated a surge of federal law enforcement onto the city's streets and Trump threatened to assert federal control over the local police force. The president's focus on crime in the capital has intensified after a member of his administration was injured in an attempted hijacking. Critics point to data showing that violent crime rates in the city have actually decreased significantly in recent years.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's decision to halt weapons exports to Israel intended for use in Gaza "until further notice" has sparked division within his own conservative political alliance. Senior members of the Christian Social Union (CSU) called the move questionable and a departure from decades of foreign policy, demanding internal discussions. However, the decision has also received support from other prominent conservatives and coalition partners like the Social Democrats, who described it as a correct and inevitable reaction to the Israeli government's recent actions, underscoring the complex political dynamics surrounding Germany's relationship with Israel.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been analyzed by scientists and found to be approximately 4.56 billion years old, making it older than Earth itself. The space rock, which left a dent in the floor, was part of a fireball event witnessed across Georgia and South Carolina in June. A University of Georgia geologist determined the meteorite originated from the breakup of a much larger asteroid in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter about 470 million years ago. It is the 27th meteorite ever recovered in the state.</p>

The protest, one of several similar actions across England, drew a large police presence to manage the march and a small group of counter-protesters.
