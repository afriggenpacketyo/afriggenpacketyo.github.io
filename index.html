          <p>China's top security officials have emphasized the need for the country's security and law enforcement apparatus to act with 'passion' to maintain internal stability, especially as external tensions increase. Yin Bai, a key figure in the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, highlighted the importance of absolute loyalty to the Communist Party and President Xi Jinping, ordering the law enforcement system to adhere strictly to party decisions. He also addressed inadequacies within the system, such as work discipline and coordination, and reiterated the commitment to purging corruption and ending 'profit-driven law enforcement' practices. This comes as the international and domestic landscapes evolve, placing greater demands on China's security apparatus.</p>

          <p>Arab countries anticipate significant business engagements with the U.S., despite the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE aims to strengthen economic and security cooperation, with a focus on defense, artificial intelligence, and advanced weaponry. Saudi Arabia is pursuing investments and partnerships with American firms, offering $600 billion in trade and investment over four years, while the UAE plans to invest $1.4 trillion in the U.S. over the next decade, particularly in AI and semiconductors. While the Gaza conflict is expected to be sidelined, analysts speculate that Trump's 'very big announcement' may relate to hostage releases, a potential nuclear deal with Iran, or the situation with Yemen's Houthis.</p>

The 91-year-old former emperor, who showed no symptoms, will require careful follow-up care. He was admitted to the hospital after an earlier checkup revealed signs of the heart condition. Akihito previously received treatment for heart failure in 2022 and abdicated the Chrysanthemum Throne in April 2019, marking the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in about 200 years.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched towards Venus in 1972, is predicted to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space and is now slowly spiraling back to Earth. Experts estimate the re-entry to occur within the next few days, but the exact time and location remain uncertain. While the spacecraft was designed to withstand the Venusian atmosphere, it is expected to break apart upon re-entry, posing a low risk of injury on the ground, though any recovered pieces would legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors released documents detailing key moments in a corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, which was ultimately dropped after intervention from the Trump administration. The investigation, which began in August 2021, focused on the mayor's fundraising and connections to the government of Turkey. Despite gathering significant evidence, including search warrants and sworn statements, the Justice Department directed the interim U.S. attorney to seek dismissal of the case, citing interference with the mayor's cooperation on President Trump's deportation agenda. The dismissal has drawn criticism and accusations of a quid pro quo.</p>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, has hailed the recent UK-US trade deal as a 'platform for going further and opening up more trade opportunities'. The deal has reduced or removed tariffs imposed by President Trump on some UK imports, including cars, steel, and aluminium. While discussions are ongoing regarding the UK's Digital Services Tax, Mandelson stated that abolishing the tax was not part of the current agreement. He also noted the positive relationship between Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump, emphasizing their commitment to defending their national interests.</p>

          <p>Changes to 'de minimis' rules, which allowed low-value packages to enter the US without tariffs, are causing concern among online shoppers. President Trump's decision to end the carve-out, combined with new trade tariffs, is expected to raise prices and limit options for consumers. The change primarily impacts packages from China worth less than $800. While some businesses are adapting by shifting to locally based sellers, economists estimate that ending de minimis will lead to billions in new costs, disproportionately affecting lower-income households.</p>
