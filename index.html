          <h2>Welsh Government Proposes Changes to Holiday Let Tax Rules Amid Industry Criticism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 11:25:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Welsh government has proposed adjustments to controversial tax rules for self-catering holiday accommodations, shifting the letting criteria to an average of 182 days let over several years. This move comes after 40% of properties failed to meet the previous 182-day threshold, which allowed them to pay lower non-domestic rates instead of higher council tax. While the government states it has listened to feedback, industry groups and opposition parties criticize the changes as a "token gesture" that does not adequately address the ongoing tourism crisis and housing challenges. Critics argue the unchanged occupancy threshold remains a significant burden, forcing businesses to heavily discount services and negatively impacting local economies and employment. The proposed changes, including allowing charity holidays to count, are intended to take effect in April 2026, subject to consultation.</p>

          <p>A Metropolitan Police special constable, James Bubb (who now identifies as Gwyn Samuels), has been found guilty of multiple sexual assault offenses, including against a child under 13 and an adult woman. Bubb groomed one victim online before sexually assaulting her at age 12, and also sexually assaulted a woman he met online while posing as a 16-year-old girl. The court heard allegations that Bubb used police training techniques to intimidate victims, highlighting a severe breach of trust by an individual in a position of authority. The offenses occurred over several years, leading to his suspension from police duties and a theatre technician role. Sentencing is scheduled for December, with the NSPCC emphasizing the need for victim support and for tech companies to improve online safety.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, challenging his unprecedented attempt to remove her from office. Cook asserts that Trump's firing order is "unlawful and void," arguing no legal cause exists for her dismissal, despite Trump citing unsubstantiated allegations of false statements on her mortgage applications. The president has been putting increasing pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates, and removing Cook, a Biden appointee, could allow him to replace her with a candidate more aligned with his economic agenda. This significant legal battle highlights concerns over the U.S. central bank's autonomy and is expected to face numerous challenges, potentially reaching the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>The Reform UK leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, Mick Barton, has banned the Nottingham Post and its online arm, Nottinghamshire Live, from speaking to him or any of his councillors. This "unprecedented ban," reportedly stemming from a disagreement over a story on local government reorganization, also includes BBC-funded Local Democracy Reporting Service journalists. The council will cease sending press releases and deny interviews or invitations to events, though reporters can still attend public meetings. The decision has drawn strong criticism from opposition parties and journalistic bodies, who view it as a direct attack on press freedom and the public's right to scrutinize elected officials. Concerns are high that this move will hinder transparency regarding taxpayer money and council operations.</p>

The Home Office warns that the case could set a damaging precedent, potentially acting as an impetus for further protests and legal actions from other councils against asylum accommodation. Concerns were raised about the potential hardship for the asylum seekers if the injunction is upheld, impacting the Home Office's ability to fulfill its legal duties. A decision from the judges is expected soon, shaping future policy on migrant housing.</p>

          <p>In a tragic turn of events, a pediatric critical care nurse at Hennepin Healthcare in Minneapolis found herself treating her own 12-year-old daughter, Sophia Forchas, after the child was critically injured in a mass shooting. Sophia was among 19 people shot, including 16 children, during a Mass at Annunciation Catholic School, with two children, ages 8 and 10, dying from their injuries. The mother had rushed to work to assist with the influx of victims, unaware her own daughter was among them, highlighting the profound personal impact of the tragedy. Sophia remains in critical condition after emergency surgery, facing a long and difficult recovery, while her younger brother, present during the attack, was physically unharmed but traumatized. A community prayer service has been organized for Sophia and all victims.</p>

          <p>The immigration detention center in Florida's Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," is expected to be emptied of detainees within days, following a U.S. District Judge's order. The ruling mandated a halt to new detainees and a wind-down of operations within 60 days, citing violations of federal law regarding public input and environmental impact during its hasty construction. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and the Trump administration are appealing the decision, which has already seen the state spend approximately $245 million on the facility, with projected costs exceeding $400 million. Environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe filed the lawsuit, arguing the location is inappropriate. Detainees are being moved to other facilities to comply with the court's order, although the administration continues to defend the center's necessity.</p>

          <p>Ford is recalling 500,000 vehicles, including 2016-2018 Lincoln MKX and 2015-2018 Edge SUVs, due to a potential rear brake system hose rupture that could lead to brake fluid leaks. This critical issue can cause increased brake pedal travel and longer stopping distances, significantly raising the risk of a crash. Drivers might also observe a red brake fluid warning indicator light if the fluid level becomes low. While Ford will notify affected owners in early September, the specific remedy for the problem is still under development and is anticipated to be available by April. This recall follows a recent separate recall of over 355,000 pickup trucks for an instrument panel display failure, indicating Ford's intensified strategy to quickly find and fix hardware and software issues.</p>

          <p>The UK, France, and Germany (E3) have initiated the process to restore major UN sanctions on Iran, which were originally lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. This action triggers a "snapback mechanism" that could reimpose sanctions within 30 days, following Iran's "clear and deliberate" non-compliance with its nuclear commitments, including its growing stockpile of high enriched uranium. The E3 nations had previously warned of this step unless a diplomatic solution was reached by the end of August, emphasizing that Iran's nuclear program "remains a clear threat to international peace and security." Iran had warned of repercussions if the snapback was triggered, as the original deal had unraveled after the US pulled out in 2018, leading to renewed crisis.</p>

          <p>Israel is increasingly denying entry to foreign medical professionals seeking to volunteer in the Gaza Strip, leading to accusations that it is preventing international witnesses from exposing the war's catastrophic toll on civilians. Doctors, like Mimi Syed, report being rejected without reason after speaking publicly about conditions in Gaza, including child malnutrition and deaths due to lack of basic medical supplies. The World Health Organization confirms a 50% rise in denial rates since March, impacting thousands of consultations weekly and contributing to more Palestinian deaths. Medical aid groups also highlight severe restrictions on essential medical supplies entering Gaza, with Israel citing security concerns about Hamas diverting aid for military purposes.

          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that a recent Supreme Court ruling, *Trump v. Wilcox*, has inadvertently left the Federal Reserve vulnerable to presidential power, enabling President Donald Trump's attempts to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook. The Court's decision, while carving out the Fed as "special," embraced an expansive theory of presidential power that undermines the "for cause" removal protections traditionally afforded to independent agencies. This analysis suggests that if Trump's removal of Cook is allowed, it could set a dangerous precedent, potentially allowing a president to exert undue control over the money supply by dismissing other board members without proper legal process or substantive cause. The article highlights concerns about the politicization of the Fed and the erosion of institutional independence.</p>

Recent surveys indicate a rise in "negative debt behaviors," such as making less than minimum payments and consolidating debt into personal loans, with percentages increasing over the past six months. Experts attribute this to a combination of worsening employment, sustained high interest rates, and inflation, leading to a "tipping point" where interest expenses exceed affordability.

The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) found the officer has a case to answer regarding the accuracy of his accounts to colleagues and potential inconsistencies in his statements, which could breach police standards of honesty and integrity. While no indication of contact was found between the police van and the e-bike, the officer's driving and language at the scene also raised concerns. The fatal incident sparked widespread unrest and riots in Ely, injuring officers and damaging property. The families of the deceased are challenging the Crown Prosecution Service's decision not to prosecute the officer, seeking further answers.</p>

          <p>Iran is participating in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, signaling its strategic shift towards the East to counter the US-dominated global order and its isolation from the West. Having joined SCO and BRICS in 2023, Iran seeks closer ties with Russia and China, while also improving relations with Middle Eastern rivals like Saudi Arabia. This eastward orientation has accelerated due to US withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and recent US-Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear program, leading many in Tehran to give up on reconciliation with the West. The article highlights Iran's goal to prevent a pro-American, anti-Iranian axis in the region and increase military cooperation with China, despite internal criticisms regarding Russia's support during past conflicts.</p>

          <p>Best Buy surpassed Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations for its recent quarter, showing a modest sales recovery with comparable sales rising 1.6%, its highest growth in three years. Despite this positive trend, the consumer electronics retailer maintained its full-year forecast, citing uncertainty from potential tariff impacts on consumers and its business in the back half of the year. CEO Corie Barry noted strong customer response to back-to-school sales events and innovation-driven purchases, particularly in computing and gaming with the Nintendo Switch 2 launch. However, the company anticipates some shoppers may delay purchases in the third quarter due to holiday deal expectations and ongoing tariff concerns.

The Kurdish-led Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES) condemned the exclusion as "undemocratic," while Druze leaders in Sweida renewed calls for a separate governorate.

This dip coincides with a significant spike in contract cancellations, reaching 15% in July—the highest rate since 2017. Rising mortgage rates in July, which started at 6.67% and ended at 6.75%, contributed to buyer hesitation, with Redfin agents citing "cold feet" and overall economic uncertainty as primary reasons for backing out.

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a faster-than-initially-estimated annual pace of 3.3% in the second quarter, bouncing back from a first-quarter slump, according to new government data. The Commerce Department's upward revision was primarily driven by increased business investment in structures, equipment, and intellectual property, as well as consumer spending. However, economists note that much of this strength was a "mirage," reflecting a sharp decline in imports after businesses accelerated purchases in Q1 due to impending tariffs. The overall average growth rate for the first half of the year was only 1.4%, with weak private-sector demand outside of AI-related investment. Concerns about the economy persist amid a slowdown in hiring, leading investors to anticipate Federal Reserve interest rate cuts to shore up economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

Former captain Marlie Packer will take over as skipper for the upcoming game against Samoa, as coach John Mitchell makes 13 changes to the team, resting several regular starters to give everyone game time.

          <p>A $1.2 billion Army contract to build and operate a massive immigration detention tent camp at Fort Bliss, Texas, is shrouded in mystery and controversy. The contract was awarded to Acquisition Logistics LLC, a small business with no listed experience in running correctional facilities and no functional website, sparking concerns from members of Congress and legal experts. This secretive and brisk contracting process highlights the government's rush to fulfill the president's deportation pledges, increasingly relying on the military for tasks traditionally left to civilian agencies.

However, other metrics, like CoinMarketCap's altcoin season index, remain inconclusive, showing a sideways trend. The article suggests a true altcoin season would require fundamental shifts like surging transaction volumes and increased developer activity on smart contract platforms.

This escalation, potentially linked to the India-Pakistan conflict and Trump's ceasefire claims, alarms those who view the India-US partnership as vital for regional stability.

A federal judge ordered the new trial, citing a prosecution violation of Barbour's constitutional rights by failing to disclose initial forensics notes that excluded him as the DNA source.

The article explains that Iran's actions, though seemingly amateurish, align with the IRGC's playbook of using decentralized criminal networks to intimidate Jews and destabilize the West.
