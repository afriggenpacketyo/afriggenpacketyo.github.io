          <p>In Chicago's Brighton Park, federal agents shot a woman after their vehicle was allegedly rammed and surrounded by multiple cars. The Department of Homeland Security stated the agents, feeling trapped, fired when they saw a weapon in the driver's possession. The incident, which led to the woman's hospitalization and subsequent arrest, sparked immediate protests and tense standoffs between demonstrators and federal law enforcement at the scene. DHS also reported that other officers were injured and a vehicle was damaged in related altercations, highlighting escalating tensions between federal authorities and local groups.</p>

          <p>A decommissioned nuclear plant in Michigan is being revived to power the nation's first small modular reactors (SMRs), signaling a broader shift in public and market sentiment toward nuclear energy. This revival is largely fueled by the massive electricity requirements of AI and data centers, with tech giants like Microsoft and Google investing in nuclear solutions. While proponents highlight the economic benefits and the technology's safety advancements, some experts caution that regulatory frameworks and cost challenges could slow widespread SMR deployment. Public support for nuclear power is growing, however, as the demand for reliable, clean energy intensifies.</p>

The game was paused as medical staff attended to Lewis, who was motionless before being strapped to a stretcher and carted off the field. University officials later stated that the outlook for his recovery was "promising" following additional testing.

          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, the most common subject of fights among couples is not money or chores, but rather the tone of voice used during conversations. Research indicates that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry more emotional weight than the actual words spoken, turning simple questions into perceived accusations. The article suggests that partners can de-escalate potential arguments by becoming more self-aware. It advises individuals to pause and rephrase their statements if their tone is harsh, and for those on the receiving end to calmly ask their partner to try again, thereby interrupting the cycle of negativity.</p>

The party is observing the playbook of right-wing populist movements, hoping to use simple messaging and emotional appeals to resonate with voters disillusioned with mainstream politics.

The poll also reveals negative public perceptions of both parties, with Democrats most often described as "weak" and Republicans as "extreme."

Sanders, who has a history of serious blood clot issues that led to the amputation of two toes, stated he was "hurting like crazy" and not getting proper blood flow to his leg. The 58-year-old coach, who was seen sitting down at times during the game, has a doctor's appointment scheduled to address the issue. This health concern arises after he spent time away from the team over the summer for cancer treatment.</p>

          <p>President Trump has intensified his attacks on billionaire philanthropist George Soros, naming him as a potential target for investigation and prosecution related to the funding of "leftwing terrorism." Critics view this move as a politically motivated strategy to intimidate Soros and other major Democratic donors ahead of the midterm elections. The article notes that while Soros is a significant contributor to liberal causes, his portrayal by the right often employs antisemitic tropes. Political analysts suggest that by targeting a high-profile figure like Soros, the administration aims to create a chilling effect, making it harder for Democrats to raise funds.</p>

          <p>The UK Conservative Party has unveiled an aggressive immigration plan that aims to remove 750,000 illegal immigrants within five years. The proposal includes banning anyone who enters the UK without permission from ever claiming asylum and replacing court appeals with an internal Home Office review process. To execute this, the party would rebrand the immigration enforcement unit as a "Removals Force," double its budget, and give it a mandate to deport at least 150,000 people annually. This hardline stance is part of a broader strategy to address immigration, which also includes withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker announced that the Trump administration has issued an ultimatum to either call up the state's National Guard or have them be federalized. The White House confirmed plans to federalize 300 guard members to protect federal assets in Illinois amid ongoing protests and clashes with federal agents. Pritzker condemned the move as an "outrageous and un-American" act of aggression, stating there is no need for a military presence and that it serves as a political performance rather than a public safety effort. This action represents a significant escalation in the conflict between federal and state authorities over law enforcement jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>Across the world, from refugee camps in Bangladesh to war-torn areas in Ukraine and Gaza, children are instinctively turning to play as a way to cope with trauma and crisis. Child psychologists explain that play is not just a pastime but a crucial lifeline that helps children manage stress, process their experiences, and regain a sense of normalcy. In these harsh environments, children show remarkable creativity, making jump ropes from rubber bands or kites from discarded aid parachutes. This act of creating joy and imagining a different reality serves as a powerful form of resilience in the face of immense hardship.</p>

          <p>Two years into Israel's military campaign in Gaza, assessments indicate that Hamas has been significantly degraded but not eliminated. While Israel claims to have killed thousands of fighters and most of the group's senior leadership, observers suggest Hamas has adapted by shifting to decentralized guerrilla tactics and may have recruited thousands of new members. The group's ability to launch rockets into Israel has been greatly reduced, but it can still organize complex attacks. Hamas's control over civilian governance in Gaza is weakening, with criminal gangs and rival clans filling the power vacuum, suggesting its survival remains its primary form of victory.</p>

The smell, emanating from an Asian supermarket within a shopping center, was distributed by the building's ventilation system, causing concern among visitors. Later that evening, a similar incident occurred in a residential building where a neighbor had brought home the exotic fruit.

          <p>Recent tax legislation signed by President Trump may impact how individuals approach their year-end charitable giving. Starting in 2026, a new tax break will be available for non-itemizers, making it potentially advantageous for some to delay smaller donations until then. Conversely, higher earners may face a reduction in the value of their charitable deductions in 2026 due to a new deduction "floor" and a cap on the benefit for top-bracket filers. Financial experts suggest that donors, especially those in higher income brackets, might consider accelerating their giving into the current year by using tools like donor-advised funds.

          <p>This opinion piece proposes that a coalition of "blue states" should declare a national emergency and form an interstate compact to create a prototype for a post-Trump American government. Drawing parallels to the actions of the American colonies before independence, the author suggests this body could draft its own declaration of rights and obligations, focusing on issues like healthcare, social security, and climate change. The goal would be to engage in a form of "political theatre" that shifts the focus away from reacting to Trump and proactively puts forward an alternative vision, even if it has no immediate path to federal adoption.</p>
