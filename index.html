          <p>Palantir shares recently entered bear market territory, plummeting 20% from their peak in the longest losing streak since April 2024. This downturn follows a broader market sell-off and a critical report from Andrew Left's Citron Research, which labeled the company "detached from fundamentals and analysis," suggesting a much lower price target. Despite a strong performance earlier this month, where Palantir rocketed to record highs after its first $1 billion-revenue quarter, the article highlights that even with the recent price drop, its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 193 times indicates shares remain expensive compared to megacap peers, prompting investor discipline.

She conveyed that despite the overwhelming sadness, she is functioning, finding some days stronger than others, and expressed gratitude for moments of happiness.

          <p>Sony has announced a $50 price increase for all PlayStation 5 models in the U.S., effective this week, with the entry-level Digital Edition now costing $500. While the company did not directly attribute the hike to tariffs, it stated it is navigating a "challenging economic environment," aligning with warnings from other consumer companies about rising prices due to President Trump's tariff plan. This move follows similar price adjustments by Microsoft for its Xbox consoles and Nintendo's delayed Switch 2 pre-orders, highlighting a broader industry response to economic pressures.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's pause on student loan forgiveness for the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan continues, prompting lawmakers, including Senator Bernie Sanders, to urge its immediate resumption. The U.S. Department of Education halted the loan discharge component due to recent court actions impacting the Biden administration-era SAVE plan, affecting 1.97 million federal borrowers. While the delay primarily impacts borrowers nearing debt forgiveness who previously switched from other income-driven plans, experts advise all IBR enrollees to continue making payments to avoid penalties, as their progress toward cancellation still counts.

          <p>Five veteran FBI agents, including former acting director Brian Driscoll and Washington field office head Steven Jensen, were summarily fired earlier this month without clear explanation, sparking shock within the agency. Sources close to the agents suggest the dismissals may be politically motivated, possibly linked to their involvement in investigations concerning former President Trump or January 6th.

          <p>Chris Brain, a former priest who led the influential Nine O'Clock Service (NOS) evangelical movement in the 1980s and 90s, has been found guilty of 17 counts of sexual assault against nine women. The prosecution argued that Brain abused his position within what became a "cult," sexually assaulting numerous congregation members, some of whom were part of a "homebase team" performing household chores and sexual favors. The jury continues deliberations on additional charges, including one of sexual assault, highlighting the profound betrayal of trust within the religious community.</p>
