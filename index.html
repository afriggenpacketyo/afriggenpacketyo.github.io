          <p>In their final preseason game, the Los Angeles Lakers lost 117-116 to the Sacramento Kings, despite a stellar performance from Luka Doncic, who scored 31 points, provided nine assists, and grabbed five rebounds. The team, playing without superstar LeBron James due to a sciatica issue expected to last until November, utilized the game as a "dress rehearsal" for their upcoming season. Coach JJ Redick integrated Gabe Vincent into the starting lineup, where he contributed 14 points, while Marcus Smart showed improved form with 14 points off the bench after an initial slow start. This article highlights the Lakers' ongoing adjustments and individual player efforts as they prepare for a challenging regular season without their key player.</p>

          <p>Antony Easton discovered a hidden family history and a vast fortune lost under Nazi rule after finding an old suitcase belonging to his late father, Peter. The contents revealed Peter was born Peter Hans Rudolf Eisner, part of a wealthy Jewish Berlin family whose assets were forcibly sold and confiscated. The investigation, spanning a decade, uncovered artwork and properties stolen by a seemingly helpful tax adviser, Martin Hartig, under the guise of protection. This article details the family's escape in 1938, the tragic loss of many relatives in concentration camps, and Antony's ongoing efforts to reclaim lost artworks, including one from the Brohan Museum.</p>

          <p>Dozens of South Koreans, detained in Cambodia for alleged involvement in cyberscam operations, have been repatriated and arrested upon arrival at Incheon International Airport. The suspects face criminal probes related to voice phishing, romance scams, and "no-show" fraud schemes, with some also undergoing drug testing due to suspicions of use in Cambodia. This article notes the repatriation follows public outrage over the death of a South Korean student reportedly tortured in a Cambodian scam center, prompting Seoul to issue a "code-black" travel ban for parts of Cambodia. Rights groups like Amnesty International highlight mass abuses and human trafficking in these scam compounds.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the commutation of George Santos's federal prison sentence for wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, leading to his immediate release. Trump, who called Santos "somewhat of a 'rogue,'" cited a letter from Santos and advocacy from Republican allies like Marjorie Taylor Greene as influences. Santos, expelled from Congress in 2023 for extensive fabrications and misuse of campaign funds, had been serving an 87-month sentence. This article notes Trump's comparison of Santos's actions to those of Senator Richard Blumenthal, and highlights the former president's history of granting clemency to political allies.</p>

          <p>Renowned theoretical physicist Chen-ning Yang, a Nobel Prize laureate, passed away in Beijing at the age of 103 due to sickness. Often ranked alongside Albert Einstein, Yang was celebrated for his groundbreaking contributions to the field. In 1954, he co-authored the Yang-Mills theory with Robert Mills, a set of equations that proved as fundamental to physics as Einstein's theory of relativity. This article highlights his immense legacy, as the Yang-Mills theory described how three of nature's four fundamental forces operate in the subatomic world, laying the mathematical foundation for the Standard Model of modern physics.</p>

          <p>A series of bad loans, including alleged fraud cases involving regional banks Zions and Western Alliance, has sparked renewed concerns among bank investors about hidden risks in lending to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs). JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of more issues, likening the situation to finding "one cockroach." This article highlights that while individual losses have been small, their near-total wipeout nature is alarming, especially given the rapid growth of NDFI lending since 2008. The lack of transparency in these loan books has investors scrutinizing exposures, despite an improving interest rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has terminated a consent order that prohibited Citibank from discriminating against its Armenian American customers, three years ahead of schedule. Citibank had paid over $24.5 million in penalties and redress for applying stricter criteria or blocking credit card applications from individuals with "ian" and "yan" surnames, with some employees referring to them as "Armenian bad guys." This article notes the bank did not admit or deny findings, but California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff criticized the decision, arguing it prioritizes corporations over people and casts a long shadow over the community.

Operation Dudula argues the public health system is overburdened and resources are scarce, finding sympathetic ears among some residents who report improved service since foreigners were excluded. Human rights lawyers and government officials condemn these actions as deeply problematic and lawless, but arrests have not deterred the group.</p>

India's central bank is also a major buyer, diversifying its foreign exchange holdings. Despite record prices, experts expect demand to hold up in value terms, though some families are priced out.
