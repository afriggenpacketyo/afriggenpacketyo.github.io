          <p>A weather system moving across the Florida Panhandle is gaining strength and has a significant chance of developing into a tropical depression as it heads toward the northern Gulf Coast. Officials have issued warnings for southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, anticipating heavy rainfall and potential flooding regardless of the system's final classification. In New Orleans, preparations are underway with sandbags being distributed to residents in anticipation of receiving up to 10 inches of rain in some coastal areas. This threat follows a summer already marked by lethal floods in other parts of the country, heightening concerns among local communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British Labour MP Diane Abbott has stated she does not regret the comments on racism that led to her year-long party suspension. In a recent BBC interview, she reiterated her belief that racism based on skin color is distinct from prejudice faced by Jewish, Irish, or Traveller communities, arguing that Black individuals are visibly identifiable as different in a way others are not. Despite a previous apology where she called the original letter a draft sent in error, her new remarks double down on the core argument. Abbott, who was reinstated just before the last general election, also claimed the Labour leadership had tried to force her out of her position.</p>

          <p>Construction has commenced on a new $8 billion luxury resort in Singapore, a major project by Las Vegas Sands that will significantly expand its presence in Asia. The development, described as a new property with its own identity rather than an extension of the existing Marina Bay Sands, will feature a 55-story all-suite tower with 570 rooms. Key attractions include a public rooftop space with an observation deck, multiple infinity pools for guests, and a 15,000-seat arena. This project aligns with Singapore's long-term tourism strategy to attract high-value leisure and business travelers to the city-state.</p>

          <p>The Indiana Fever were defeated by the New York Liberty 98-77 in their final game before the WNBA All-Star break, playing without star rookie Caitlin Clark due to a groin injury. The Liberty, led by Breanna Stewart's 24 points, controlled the game from the start, highlighting the Fever's struggles in Clark's absence. Coach Stephanie White expressed the need for the team to build consistency and develop a more resilient mindset. Clark's availability for the upcoming All-Star Game, where she is a team captain and 3-point contest participant, is now uncertain as the team prioritizes her long-term health.</p>

          <p>Israel has conducted significant airstrikes in Syria for a third consecutive day, targeting the Syrian defense ministry in Damascus and government forces in the south. The escalation follows deadly clashes in the Suweida province between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes, which have reportedly killed over 350 people. Israel's Prime Minister stated the intervention aims to protect the Druze minority, a group with ties to communities in Israel. In response to the escalating violence and Israeli military action, the U.S. has announced that "specific steps" have been agreed upon to de-escalate the crisis, while the Syrian military has reportedly begun withdrawing from the embattled province.</p>

Huang emphasized that as technology progresses, the chips available to China should also improve, though this ambition remains subject to U.S. government approval.

Despite a recent $12.5 billion congressional allocation for technology upgrades, many controllers argue that stagnating pay and mandatory six-day workweeks are the real problems driving exhaustion and stress. The national shortage of over 3,000 controllers forces many to work under highly demanding conditions to keep the U.S. air travel system functioning.

          <p>Japan's exports fell by 0.5% in June compared to the previous year, marking the second straight month of decline and raising fears of a potential recession. The drop was driven by a significant 11.4% decrease in shipments to the U.S. and a 4.7% fall in exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner. This economic pressure is compounded by the lack of a trade deal with the U.S., which has imposed a 25% tariff on Japanese imports, including automobiles. With exports comprising a significant portion of its GDP, another quarter of economic contraction would place Japan into a technical recession, heightening pressure on officials ahead of upcoming elections.

          <p>A tsunami advisory for Alaska's southern peninsula was canceled after being issued in response to a 7.3 magnitude earthquake on Wednesday. The earthquake, which struck south of Sand Point, initially prompted a more severe tsunami warning, leading to evacuations in coastal towns like Seward. However, authorities later downgraded the alert, stating that large, widespread waves were not expected as the quake occurred in shallow water. The incident caused concern in the seismically active region, which is located along the Pacific "Ring of Fire" and was the site of North America's strongest-ever recorded earthquake in 1964.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Army veteran is calling for a full investigation after he was detained for three days by immigration agents during a massive raid on a cannabis farm in Ventura County, California. George Retes, a 25-year-old American citizen, said he was driving to his security guard job when he was caught in the raid, pepper-sprayed, and arrested at gunpoint despite identifying himself as a citizen. He was held at a federal detention center without access to a lawyer and was not told of any charges against him before his release. Retes plans to file a lawsuit, calling the incident a violation of his civil rights.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially canceled $4 billion in federal funding for California's high-speed rail project, a move state leaders have denounced as illegal. The Federal Railroad Administration pulled the funding, citing mismanagement, budget overruns, and delays, and is considering clawing back other funds already provided. Governor Gavin Newsom vowed to fight the decision, stating the project is now in the track-laying phase and crucial for the state's future. The project, intended to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, is decades behind schedule and its cost has ballooned from an initial $33 billion to an estimated $128 billion.</p>

          <p>A massive afforestation project in northern China, known as the 'green great wall,' has successfully curbed desertification but is now being linked to a rise in hay fever cases. Chinese scientists have confirmed that pollen from the widely planted artemisia plant, chosen for its low cost and durability, is a primary cause of allergic reactions in the region. Researchers have identified five specific volatile components in the plant's pollen that trigger symptoms ranging from sneezing to asthma. This unintended consequence highlights the complex ecological and health trade-offs involved in large-scale environmental engineering projects.</p>

          <p>A coalition of immigrant advocacy groups has filed a class-action lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging a coordinated effort to unlawfully arrest and deport people attending their immigration court hearings. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of twelve plaintiffs, claims that the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security are weaponizing immigration courts, turning them into traps for individuals seeking legal protection. This practice, they argue, violates due process rights and reverses a long-standing policy of limiting arrests in such sensitive locations. The plaintiffs, many of whom were seeking asylum from persecution, are now facing expedited removal.</p>

This strategy offers a sustainable alternative to building new gas-fired power plants, which are currently being planned to meet the growing electricity needs of AI. The system is designed to be simple and scalable, using batteries that still have significant capacity after being retired from vehicles.</p>

His comments came a day after the Pentagon ordered the withdrawal of half the troops deployed in Los Angeles. Newsom argued the deployment's low utilization rate proved it was a "solution in search of a problem" and that its primary goal was not pursuing violent criminals.

The recent conflict erupted after clashes between Druze militias and Bedouin fighters in the Suweida province.

          <p>Recent workplace immigration raids have exposed significant vulnerabilities in the federal E-Verify system, which is used by over a million employers to confirm work eligibility. Experts and business owners argue the system is broken, as it primarily vets paperwork rather than people, making it susceptible to identity theft and fraud. A recent raid on a Nebraska meat processing facility, whose owner believed he was compliant by using E-Verify, was revealed to be a criminal investigation into identity theft, with the business itself considered a victim. Critics call E-Verify a "wink-and-nod" system that allows politicians to appear tough on immigration without imposing real costs on the economy.</p>
