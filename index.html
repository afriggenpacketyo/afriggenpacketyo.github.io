          <p>France has formally summoned US Ambassador Charles Kushner following his letter to President Emmanuel Macron, which alleged that France was not adequately addressing antisemitism. The French foreign ministry strongly rejected these claims as "unacceptable" and a breach of international law, asserting that French authorities are fully mobilized against a rise in antisemitic acts since the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack. This diplomatic friction adds to existing tensions between the two nations, which have seen disagreements over trade, UN peacekeeping missions, and support for Ukraine, though some splits have recently eased. The incident underscores the delicate balance of transatlantic partnership and the need for mutual trust, with France emphasizing its commitment to combating antisemitism.</p>

          <p>Jerry Adler, a distinguished actor known for his roles as Hesh Rabkin in "The Sopranos" and Howard Lyman in "The Good Wife," has passed away peacefully at the age of 96. Before gaining recognition in front of the camera in his 60s, Adler enjoyed a lengthy and impactful career behind the scenes on Broadway, contributing to 53 productions as a stage manager, producer, or director. Coming from a family with deep ties to Jewish and Yiddish theater, he worked on iconic shows like "My Fair Lady" and with stars such as Marlene Dietrich. His successful transition to acting in later life, which he once considered "the twilight of a mediocre career," demonstrated his enduring passion, as he famously stated, "retirement is a road to nowhere."</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-24 18:42:49 EDT</div>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has accused President Donald Trump of "manufacturing a crisis" to justify deploying federalized National Guard troops to Chicago, bypassing local authority. The Pentagon confirmed that planning is indeed underway for this move, which follows earlier deployments in Los Angeles and the arming of National Guard members in Washington D.C. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson strongly condemned the proposal as "the most flagrant violation of our constitution in the 21st century," highlighting a nearly 40% reduction in city shootings over the past year. Democratic leaders argue that Trump lacks the legal authority for such a deployment, viewing it as a politically motivated distraction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A military official has confirmed that some National Guard members deployed in Washington D.C. will begin carrying their assigned service weapons starting Sunday night, marking a notable escalation in President Trump's law enforcement initiative. This directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reverses previous guidance that these troops would remain unarmed during their deployment. Currently, nearly 2,000 National Guard members are stationed in the city, primarily tasked with protecting landmarks and managing crowds, and there have been no prior reports of threats necessitating the use of weapons. Local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, contend that the operation is unwarranted, as violent crime in D.C. has been declining for the past year and a half.</p>

          <p>Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse has been abruptly ousted as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), with Deputy Director Christine Bordine stepping in as acting director. While no official reason was provided, a Pentagon spokesperson indicated that senior military leaders "serve at the pleasure of President Trump and Secretary Hegseth." This dismissal has drawn criticism from Democratic Senator Mark Warner, who described it as the Trump administration treating intelligence as a "loyalty test." The move follows a DIA assessment of military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities that contradicted President Trump's more aggressive public statements, raising significant concerns among DIA employees about the increasing politicization of their intelligence work.</p>

          <p>Netflix has experienced a remarkable 150% stock increase over the past five years, driven by robust growth in subscribers, revenue, and operating profits, solidifying its dominance in the streaming industry with over 300 million global subscribers. The article anticipates that the company's revenue and earnings will continue to climb, thereby supporting a higher stock price in the next five years. Nevertheless, a primary concern for potential investors is Netflix's elevated price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 51.7. As the business matures and its growth rate is projected to moderate, the P/E multiple may contract, potentially causing the stock to underperform the broader S&P 500 in the coming years.

          <p>A catastrophic and fiery multi-vehicle crash occurred Saturday night on Interstate 15 in Temecula, resulting in the deaths of four individuals. According to the California Highway Patrol, a black BMW M4, driven recklessly, suddenly veered across the concrete median into southbound lanes, where it collided with a white Nissan Sentra and immediately burst into flames. The three passengers in the BMW—a 23-year-old woman, a 14-year-old boy, and a 15-year-old girl—were tragically killed, as was the 35-year-old driver of the Sentra. The 25-year-old BMW driver was pulled from the wreckage by Good Samaritans and suffered major injuries. Authorities are investigating the incident, with charges pending against the BMW driver, although alcohol has been ruled out as a contributing factor.</p>

Da Wei maintains a cautiously optimistic outlook regarding the possibility of the two nations reaching a comprehensive trade agreement, suggesting that both parties are motivated to secure a deal, ideally before the end of autumn.

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to deploy National Guard troops to Baltimore, intensifying his conflict with Maryland Governor Wes Moore, who had previously extended an invitation for Trump to join a "safety walk" in the city. Trump, describing Moore's invitation as "nasty," asserted he would "quickly clean up the Crime" if the governor required assistance, referencing similar deployments in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles. This initiative is part of Trump's broader strategy to dispatch military personnel to Democratic-led cities, a move that has drawn strong condemnation from Democrats, who label it an "abuse of power." Despite the president's claims of escalating crime, official statistics indicate significant reductions in violent crime in both Washington D.C. and Baltimore.</p>

          <p>One man was killed and four other individuals were injured in a tragic shooting incident that occurred Saturday night at Haffen Park in the Bronx, New York City. Multiple gunmen opened fire during a basketball tournament, causing a large crowd to disperse in panic. Responding officers discovered a 32-year-old man who had been fatally shot in the chest, and a 17-year-old girl who sustained critical injuries from a gunshot wound to the face. Three additional victims, struck in the back and arm, later arrived at hospitals via private vehicles. While four individuals have been detained for questioning, the motive behind the shooting remains under active investigation. This event marks the second consecutive weekend the NYPD has responded to a mass casualty shooting.</p>

          <p>Joe Root's magnificent unbeaten 64-run innings led Trent Rockets to a tense three-wicket victory over Welsh Fire, thereby confirming their qualification for the knockout stage of The Hundred men's competition. Chasing a target of 151, the Rockets appeared to be cruising at one point but then lost five wickets for just 20 runs, setting up a dramatic finish. Root, however, maintained his composure, hitting a crucial six and a four in the final overs, with Sam Hain ultimately striking the winning runs with only one ball to spare. This victory also solidified the top three teams in the standings and eliminated other contenders. Notably, Root survived an early dismissal due to a no-ball, which proved pivotal for his match-winning performance.</p>

Raducanu, whose ranking has climbed close to the top 30, expressed significant relief at ending her four-year winless streak at Flushing Meadows. She attributes her renewed vigor and improved performance to her current form and a more relaxed mindset, supported by her new coach Francisco Roig and chiropractor Jerome Poupel.</p>

This tragic incident contributes to the escalating death toll of individuals killed while desperately searching for food, as parts of the Gaza Strip plunge into famine. UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell described the famine as "shocking but not surprising," while Senator Jeanne Shaheen criticized Israel's blockade as "a shameful black mark on humanity." Witnesses and Al-Awda Hospital reported indiscriminate gunfire on a crowd that was pushing forward towards a distribution site. Since the war began, over 2,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 13,500 wounded while seeking aid.</p>

The unusually large transaction immediately triggered a security alert, prompting American Express security to contact O'Neal, initially suspecting fraudulent activity. Despite this humorous anecdote, the article points out O'Neal's subsequent reputation for astute financial acumen and significant charitable contributions, underscoring the importance of financial literacy and robust credit card security protocols, even for high-profile individuals.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is undertaking its 10th test launch of the massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket, incorporating significant upgrades following a series of three consecutive catastrophic in-flight failures earlier this year. The ambitious flight plan includes testing unique engine configurations for the booster's controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, while the Starship upper stage will attempt to deploy simulated satellites and execute an in-space engine restart before its own splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This test is critically important for Elon Musk's long-term goals of Mars colonization and large-scale Starlink deployment, and also for NASA's Artemis program, which is depending on Starship for lunar landings by 2027. However, many aerospace observers consider this NASA timeline unrealistic given the complex in-space refueling requirements.</p>

          <p>A proposed cannabis tax cut in California has ignited a conflict between the struggling legal weed industry and child care advocates, as it threatens to significantly reduce funding for vital social services. An industry-sponsored bill seeks to lower the cannabis excise tax from 19% back to 15% for the next six years, which would result in an annual cut of $180 million from programs supporting child care, law enforcement, and at-risk youth. Specifically, this reduction would eliminate approximately $81 million annually, impacting about 8,000 subsidized child care slots. Child care advocates contend that this proposal prioritizes the cannabis industry over the well-being of children, while the industry argues the current tax rate is unsustainable amidst declining sales and fierce competition from the illicit market.</p>

The article suggests that Trump intends to be a central figure, even in contexts deemed uncouth or inappropriate, potentially using the event for political messaging, such as his controversial crackdown on D.C. crime.

The National Weather Service cautions that such prolonged high temperatures can impede the body's recovery, thereby increasing the risk of heat-related illnesses. This extreme weather is severely exacerbating ongoing wildfires, including the Pickett Fire in California's Napa County and the Flat Fire in central Oregon, which have already scorched thousands of acres, making containment efforts exceptionally challenging for firefighters.</p>

While the government is committed to ending hotel accommodation for asylum seekers, the Refugee Council contends that the most effective way to reduce the appeals backlog is by minimizing errors in initial decisions, as approximately half of original rulings are overturned.
