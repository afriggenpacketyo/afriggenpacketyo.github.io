          <p>A tax preparer in Bakersfield, California, has admitted his involvement in a significant tax fraud operation. He pleaded guilty to assisting an undocumented Mexican national in filing hundreds of fraudulent income tax returns using stolen identities and fictitious businesses. The scheme attempted to claim $25 million in refunds from the IRS, of which $2.3 million was successfully paid out before the fraud was uncovered. The tax preparer, who received thousands in fees for his services, now faces a potential 10-year prison sentence and a substantial fine.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Pediatrics reveals a startling 763% increase in the rate of young children under six accidentally consuming nicotine pouches between 2020 and 2023. Researchers analyzing U.S. poison center data found that while these pouches are smoke-free, they contain nicotine, which is highly toxic to children. Despite making up a small fraction of total nicotine ingestions, pouch-related incidents were more likely to lead to serious medical outcomes or hospitalization. Health experts are calling for greater regulation, such as banning flavorings, to mitigate the risk posed by packaging that can be attractive to children.</p>

          <p>A man has been arrested in Victorville, California, after allegedly planting a macabre teddy bear and falsely reporting it to authorities as being made of human skin. The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department responded to a call at a gas station and found the object, but the coroner quickly determined it was not made of human remains. The artist who created the prop confirmed she had sold it to a customer in the area but was unaware of the buyer's intentions. The suspect was arrested for filing a false report and wasting valuable emergency resources on the prank.</p>

          <p>Dan Bongino, the Deputy Director of the FBI, is reportedly contemplating resignation following a heated dispute with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. The conflict stems from unfulfilled expectations within the MAGA movement regarding a supposed "client list," which the Department of Justice has stated does not exist. Bongino, a former right-wing media personality and a controversial appointee, allegedly stormed out of a high-level meeting, and his future at the bureau is now uncertain. This internal turmoil highlights a significant rift among key figures in the Trump administration over the politically charged Epstein affair.</p>

          <p>Shares of major fintech companies like Block and PayPal rallied on Monday, recovering from losses sparked by reports that JPMorgan Chase planned to charge for access to customer data. Analysts at Evercore ISI and Morgan Stanley downplayed the potential impact, suggesting the proposed fees would be a negligible cost for large, established fintech platforms. They noted that any new expenses would likely only slightly increase costs for one-time account verifications and would not be a "business model-breaking" event. The rebound was also supported by broader positive momentum in the Nasdaq and the cryptocurrency market. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite being a career starter, Lopez is prepared to contribute in any role, including potentially coming off the bench. He also floated the possibility of playing alongside Zubac, creating a formidable "twin towers" lineup that could dominate defensively and stretch the floor on offense.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, now the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, is facing social media backlash for comments made regarding recent cuts to the Medicaid program. During a Fox Business interview, Oz advised Americans to "stay healthy" and "do the most that you can do" to live a full life in the face of losing health care coverage. His suggestion to "not eat carrot cake" as part of this advice was widely mocked as out-of-touch and tone-deaf to the serious financial and health challenges millions face. The incident drew comparisons to a previous gaffe from his failed Senate campaign.</p>

          <p>In a stunning display of bowling, Australia dismissed the West Indies for just 27 runs to secure a 176-run victory and a 3-0 series sweep in Jamaica. The total was the second-lowest in Test cricket history and the worst since 1955. Australian pace bowler Mitchell Starc was the primary destroyer, taking an incredible six wickets for nine runs, including five wickets in just 15 balls, the fastest five-wicket haul ever in Test cricket. The result was a heartbreaking collapse for the West Indies, who had entered their second innings needing a manageable 204 runs for victory.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Major League Baseball is missing a significant opportunity by not having its biggest stars, Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge, participate in the annual Home Run Derby. Ohtani has cited the physical toll of the current format as his reason for declining, having experienced a performance dip after his only appearance in 2021. The author suggests the league should be flexible and even alter the rules—such as limiting swings or focusing on distance—to accommodate its superstars. The piece contends that securing their involvement is crucial for the event's relevance and would provide a much-needed platform to elevate the profiles of other talented players.</p>

The state's Department of Cannabis Control confirmed it received a complaint about the company, Glass House, employing minors, which is strictly illegal.

          <p>President Trump's recent shift to a more aggressive policy toward Russia regarding the war in Ukraine is reportedly driven by personal frustration rather than a strategic change. According to White House insiders, Trump feels insulted and made to look weak by Vladimir Putin's repeated defiance of his calls to end the conflict. After months of deferring to the Russian leader, Trump has authorized new weapons shipments to Ukraine via NATO and threatened tariffs, feeling that Putin has "overplayed his hand." This change in tone reflects Trump's anger at being ignored, suggesting his actions are motivated by a desire to project strength after feeling personally humiliated.</p>

The council aims to replace an aging and costly ferry fleet, which is crucial for the archipelago's major industries like salmon farming and its new spaceport. The multi-million pound project would likely be funded through borrowing and paid back with tolls, similar to the Faroese model. Proponents argue the tunnels could be "transformational," boosting the economy and revitalizing island life by providing reliable, all-weather connections.</p>
