          <p>Tommy Paul triumphed in his first-round match at the French Open against Elmer Moller, overcoming a first set loss to win the next three. Following the victory, Paul recounted an incident where his truck was repossessed due to missed payments after he switched banks and forgot to update his automatic payment settings. He humorously described watching security camera footage of the repossession while in Europe and has since regained possession of the vehicle. Paul joked about now watching 'repo' shows and career earnings of $10.8m.</p>

          <p>Top Republicans in the Senate, including Ron Johnson and Rand Paul, are threatening to block Donald Trump's tax-cutting bill, dubbed the "big beautiful bill," unless significant reductions in government spending and the national debt are addressed. Johnson estimates the bill could add $4 trillion to the federal deficit, echoing concerns from the Congressional Budget Office. Rand Paul criticized the proposed spending cuts as insufficient and warned they would "explode the debt," while other senators expressed concerns about the impact on health coverage for millions of Americans. Speaker Johnson urged Senate colleagues to minimize modifications to maintain support in the House. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Navy veteran Jack McCain, son of the late Senator John McCain, spoke out about the plight of Afghan pilots and crew members who served alongside U.S. forces and are now at risk under Taliban rule. McCain emphasized the debt of honor owed to these individuals, including interpreters and ground troops, and criticized the U.S. government's lack of planning during the withdrawal from Afghanistan. He disagreed with the Homeland Security's assessment that it is safe for Afghans to return, citing instances of imprisonment, torture, sexual assault, and killings by the Taliban. McCain urged lawmakers to raise the cap on Special Immigrant Visas and address the legislative hurdles preventing Afghan refugees from receiving necessary support.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a large-scale drone and missile barrage on Ukraine, resulting in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries, marking one of the largest attacks of the war.

The Ukrainian Air Force reported that Russia launched 69 missiles and 298 drones, with approximately two-thirds of the missiles and nearly all the drones being shot down. The attacks have intensified since February, resulting in increased civilian casualties, and have stretched Ukraine's air defenses, particularly in western and southern regions.</p>

Floyd's aunt, Angela Harrelson, called for continued action to advance the work started after his death. While many viewed Floyd's death as a catalyst for national reckoning with racism, some police reforms are being rolled back.

          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, has resigned after wrongfully arresting an undocumented teenager, Ximena Arias-Cristobal, leading to her detention in a federal immigration jail and potential deportation. The arrest occurred after Arias-Cristobal was pulled over for a false turn, but the charges were later dropped. Despite the dismissal, Arias-Cristobal, who was brought to the U.S. from Mexico at age four, was transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) custody. The incident sparked national attention and criticism, highlighting the White House’s attempts to engage in “mass deportations” and the role of local jurisdictions partnering with Ice through 287(g) contracts.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent warming towards the new Syrian leader, Ahmed al-Shara, has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region. After hundreds of Israeli airstrikes targeting weapons and preventing hostile groups from establishing a presence near Israel, Trump met with al-Shara and announced plans to lift sanctions. Since this meeting, Israeli strikes on Syria have significantly decreased, raising concerns among Israeli officials about the rise of another anti-Israel neighbor. While Israel publicly cites kinship with the Druse minority as a reason for its actions, the shift in U.S. policy is reshaping the dynamics in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Venezuela is holding an election for governor and legislators to represent Essequibo, a region internationally recognized as part of Guyana. President Nicolás Maduro is attempting to legitimize his rule and rally domestic support by claiming the oil-rich territory, which comprises about two-thirds of Guyana. Most residents of Essequibo identify as Guyanese and want to remain part of Guyana. This action has heightened tensions between the two countries, with Guyana tightening border security and the U.S. expressing support for Guyana's sovereignty. The International Court of Justice has ordered Venezuela to refrain from electing officials to oversee the area.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, reportedly killed at least seven children of a local doctor, Alaa al-Najjar, with two more children missing and presumed dead.

The Israeli military stated that it had struck suspects near Israeli forces and was checking if "uninvolved civilians were harmed." This incident occurred amidst renewed fighting between Israel and Hamas, with escalating airstrikes and threatened ground assaults.

Frye's mother was also ejected after jumping on the dugout roof. The game was delayed for nearly 30 minutes, and the Southern Conference commissioner intervened.

Johnson stated that he believes there are enough GOP senators to halt the bill's progress until spending reductions are addressed. The bill passed in the House by a narrow margin and is projected to add trillions to the national deficit. Senator Rand Paul also expressed concerns about the bill's debt implications, while House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the bill as a necessary step toward fiscal responsibility.</p>

          <p>Critics in Scotland are alleging that local councils are disproportionately targeting drivers with parking fines while neglecting to enforce penalties for dog fouling and littering. Figures show that councils issued over 600,000 parking fines worth £25.1 million in 2023-24, compared to only 273 fines for dog fouling and fewer than 2,000 for littering. Stephen Kerr, a Tory MSP, accused councils of "effectively legalizing" littering and dog fouling while focusing on revenue from motorists. Local authorities stated that dog fouling and littering are difficult to enforce due to the need for witnesses.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has renewed his criticism of Harvard University's international student program after a judge blocked his administration's attempt to revoke the school's ability to enroll international students.

The university had argued that the administration's revocation was a "blatant violation of the First Amendment."

The acceptance of a luxury jet from Qatar and the hosting of an exclusive dinner for cryptocurrency investors underscore the scale of presidential mercantilism.
