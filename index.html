          <p>Harper Lee's family has shared insights into a newly discovered collection of her short stories and essays, published in The Land of Sweet Forever. These works, found posthumously, predate To Kill A Mockingbird and offer a glimpse into her developing literary voice, featuring early versions of beloved characters and settings. While some narratives, particularly one addressing racial segregation, contain language and attitudes that are challenging to a modern audience, her family confirms Lee's intention to publish them during her lifetime. This article highlights how the collection contributes to understanding her craft and its enduring relevance to contemporary discussions on race and societal issues.</p>

          <p>British number three tennis player Katie Boulter was defeated by Germany's Eva Lys in straight sets during the first round of the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo. Boulter, 29, lost 6-2 6-1 in a match lasting just over an hour, continuing a challenging run of form. This marks her inability to advance beyond the second round of any tournament since June's Nottingham Open.

          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 has shown strong consumer demand, outselling the previous generation by 14% in its initial availability period across the US and China.

Sales in China have nearly doubled compared to the iPhone 16's launch, indicating robust market momentum. The premium iPhone 17 Pro Max is also experiencing high demand, particularly within the US market.</p>

          <p>Poland is consistently outperforming many EU members economically, with a projected GDP growth rate of around 3.3% for this year, significantly higher than the overall EU average. Since joining the EU in 2004, the country has seen its real GDP double, driven largely by strong domestic consumption, low unemployment, and real-wage growth. Its successful integration into EU and NATO structures, coupled with effective use of EU funds for infrastructure, has been pivotal. This article highlights Poland's growing economic and geopolitical importance, positioning it as a potential future economic leader in Europe.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's renewed threat to impose a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the US could severely impact Britain's film industry, which heavily relies on American investment. Last year, 65% of the UK's film production spending came from US studios and streaming platforms. Directors and industry leaders express concerns about the practicality of such tariffs and the potential for a significant blow to the sector, which contributes billions to the UK economy. The article suggests this move could force the UK to seek more co-production opportunities with European and Asian territories.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has announced an independent inquiry into "repeated failures" at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust's maternity units, following reports of potentially avoidable harm to babies and mothers. A BBC investigation revealed that at least 56 baby deaths and two mother deaths over five years may have been preventable. Bereaved families, who shared their traumatic experiences, had advocated for this inquiry, hoping to uncover the truth and ensure accountability. The Care Quality Commission had previously downgraded the units to "inadequate" due to concerns about patient safety and a "blame culture" among staff.</p>

Demonstrations in major cities like New York, Boston, and Los Angeles featured slogans such as "Resist Fascism" and were described by some as street parties. Protesters voiced outrage over the administration's crackdown on undocumented migrants, deployment of National Guard troops, and attacks on the media. Trump dismissed the protests as "a joke," while Republican surrogates labeled them "Hate America" rallies, highlighting deep political divisions.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen has openly acknowledged the "real possibility" of winning his fifth Formula 1 world championship, a shift from his previous dismissive stance. His confidence stems from a remarkable gain of 64 points in the last four races, significantly closing the gap to McLaren drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris. Verstappen attributes this surge to car upgrades and a better understanding of the vehicle's performance. With five races remaining, the article highlights the intense competition and Verstappen's determination to maintain his "flat out" approach under positive pressure.</p>

          <p>Artillery shrapnel from a prematurely detonated round struck at least two vehicles on a California highway during a US Marine Corps celebration attended by Vice President JD Vance. The incident occurred as live munitions were fired over Interstate 5 near Camp Pendleton, leading to a temporary closure of the busy freeway. Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the event as "dangerous," accusing the administration of putting lives at risk for a "vanity project." While no injuries were reported, the California Highway Patrol notified the Marines, who then cancelled further live fire and launched an investigation.</p>

          <p>The fragile ceasefire in Gaza faced a major test as Israel launched air and artillery strikes in retaliation for alleged Hamas targeting of Israeli soldiers, resulting in the deaths of two IDF soldiers. An Israeli official reported Hamas used a rocket-propelled grenade and sniper fire, calling it a "bold violation." Prime Minister Netanyahu ordered "strong action" against "terrorist targets," while Hamas denied involvement, reaffirming its commitment to the ceasefire. The incident led to a halt in aid transfers to Gaza and raised fears of renewed conflict, despite President Trump's assertion that the ceasefire remains in effect.</p>

          <p>Bereaved families are demanding a public inquiry into the UK government's "repeated failures" to protect vulnerable individuals from a website promoting suicide. A report by the Molly Rose Foundation indicates that departments were warned 65 times about the online forum, which has been linked to at least 133 deaths in the UK from a toxic chemical. Families argue that coroners' warnings were ignored and current measures are fragmented and slow. They criticize the Home Office for not tightening substance regulation and Ofcom for relying on voluntary measures from the site's operators, despite new powers under the Online Safety Act.</p>

          <p>Erez Reuveni, a former Department of Justice lawyer, claims he was fired for refusing to sign a brief that would have misrepresented facts in the mistaken deportation case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

His whistleblower complaint highlights concerns about the DOJ's conduct under the Trump administration, with other judges also criticizing the department for providing "false information."
