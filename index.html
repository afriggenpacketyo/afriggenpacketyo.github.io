          <p>Maurene Comey, a former prosecutor for the Southern District of New York and the daughter of former FBI Director James B. Comey, has filed a lawsuit alleging her termination was politically motivated. The suit claims her firing was an unconstitutional act by the Trump administration, done without cause or due process, likely because of her father's contentious relationship with the former president. Comey, who handled high-profile cases involving figures like Jeffrey Epstein and Sean Combs, argues that career federal prosecutors should be shielded from political influence. She is seeking reinstatement to her position along with back pay, asserting that her removal undermines the principles of an independent justice system.</p>

          <p>China's market regulator has announced that a preliminary investigation found U.S. chipmaker Nvidia to be in violation of the country's anti-monopoly laws. The probe relates to conditions set during Nvidia's 2020 acquisition of Israeli tech firm Mellanox, although specific details of the violation were not disclosed. This development adds another layer of complexity to the already tense technological and trade relationship between Washington and Beijing, with U.S. and Chinese officials currently engaged in trade talks. Nvidia, which has faced significant challenges in the Chinese market due to U.S. export controls, stated it complies with all laws and will continue to cooperate with government agencies.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Vice President JD Vance hosted Kirk's radio program, "The Charlie Kirk Show," as a tribute to his late friend. Vance described Kirk as a brilliant political operative and a key architect of the Trump administration's 2024 victory and staffing. During the broadcast, Vance and other administration officials, including Stephen Miller, vowed to bring the killer to justice and dismantle what they described as left-wing extremist networks responsible for the attack. The gesture highlights the close personal and political ties between Kirk and the highest levels of the current administration, which plans to posthumously award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p>

The incident was reported by nurse Lexi Kuenzle, who subsequently filed a lawsuit claiming she was suspended in retaliation. The hospital announced that its investigation concluded with the physician's resignation and confirmed the nurse was never fired and will return to her scheduled shifts without loss of pay. Kuenzle stated that the doctor made comments such as Kirk "deserved it" and "had it coming to him," prompting her to report the behavior.</p>

          <p>A homicide investigation in Downey, California, was complicated when an ambulance responding to the scene was stolen. The initial incident involved a man who was fatally stabbed in front of the Downey Library, leading to the lockdown of the library and a nearby high school. Police arrested a 23-year-old suspect in connection with the stabbing on the high school campus.

          <p>The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) is amending a lawsuit against the Trump administration to seek class-action status, alleging widespread delays and denials for student loan relief programs. The union claims the Department of Education is failing to process applications for Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), harming millions of borrowers. According to court filings, over a million borrowers are caught in a backlog for IDR plans, and more than 72,000 are awaiting a decision on PSLF. The AFT argues that these delays are causing significant financial hardship and preventing borrowers from receiving legally mandated debt cancellation.</p>

Starmer said the emails revealed a relationship far different from what was understood during the appointment process and that they contradicted his government's stance on violence against women.

The report notes that while the Trump administration is phasing out clean energy incentives and promoting fossil fuels, the fundamental economics favor renewables due to their low operating costs once built.

Financial experts advise consumers to act now by paying down variable-rate debt, locking in high yields on savings accounts and CDs before rates fall, and improving their credit scores to qualify for better loan terms.

          <p>Authorities have provided a detailed overview of the investigation into the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was arrested after his father recognized him in photos released by law enforcement and urged him to surrender. Investigators believe Robinson acted alone in what they term a "targeted attack," firing a single shot from a high-powered rifle from a nearby rooftop. While a motive remains unclear, officials noted Robinson had become more political in recent years; messages and inscriptions on bullet casings are being analyzed for further clues.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Letter to NATO Unlikely to Change EU's Russia Policy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's recent letter urging NATO allies to cease all purchases of Russian oil and gas is being viewed in Brussels as a rhetorical move unlikely to alter the EU's strategic course. The letter puts pressure on Hungary and Slovakia, two EU members still reliant on Russian energy, but analysts suggest Trump is setting an impossibly high bar to justify his own inaction on imposing sanctions. The demand also includes non-EU member Turkey, a major buyer of Russian oil over which Brussels has little influence. European policymakers see the letter as potential internal leverage but not a guarantee of coordinated U.S. support against Russia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following its collapse into administration earlier this month, the health and beauty chain Bodycare has announced the closure of an additional 30 stores. This brings the total number of shuttered shops to 62 and job losses to 685 since the company's financial failure. Administrators cited the high cost of maintaining stores amid rising rents as a key factor in the retailer's decline. While there has been interest from potential buyers for some of the remaining 85 stores, the administrators stated that continuing to operate all of them was no longer viable due to stock shortages and high operating costs.</p>

          <p>Police have released new CCTV footage showing what is believed to be the last sighting of Sarm Heslop, a British woman who disappeared from her boyfriend's yacht in the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2021. The video shows Heslop and her boyfriend, Ryan Bane, getting into a dinghy to return to his yacht after an evening at a bar. The case, which is the subject of a new BBC documentary, remains unsolved, with Bane being the sole person of interest, though he has never been formally questioned. Heslop's family continues to seek answers, and police hope the newly released footage might generate new leads in the four-year-old case.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that Hamas leaders will not have immunity "wherever they are," refusing to rule out further strikes following a recent controversial attack in Qatar. Speaking alongside U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Netanyahu asserted that Israel conducted the strike on its own and that every nation has the right to self-defense beyond its borders. The attack drew international criticism, including from the U.S., as Qatar is a key ally and mediator in the Gaza conflict. Despite the apparent tension, both leaders presented a united front, emphasizing the strong alliance between the U.S. and Israel.</p>

          <p>American runner and reigning Olympic 1500m champion Cole Hocker was disqualified from his semifinal race at the world championships for "jostling." During the final stretch, Hocker was boxed in and forcefully pushed through a small gap, making contact with another athlete, Germany's Robert Farken. Although Hocker finished second and would have advanced, officials ruled that his physical contact created an unfair advantage, and a subsequent appeal by the U.S. team was rejected. The disqualification is a significant setback for one of the top contenders in the event, who explained he was trying to get through as cleanly as possible.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased approximately $1 billion worth of the company's shares on the open market, his first such acquisition since 2020. The move was interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle maker, causing the stock to jump by about 6%. This significant insider buy comes as Tesla's stock has faced challenges this year due to slowing sales and increased competition. The purchase also follows Musk's long-stated desire for greater control of the company as he pushes its focus toward artificial intelligence, robotics, and autonomous driving.

          <p>Phillip Swagel, the director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), stated that President Donald Trump's tariffs have likely contributed to higher inflation than initially anticipated by his agency's analysts. This view contrasts with some Wall Street expectations, which have yet to see significant price hikes materialize from the levies. Swagel also noted that the CBO projects the tariffs will reduce the U.S. budget deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade through increased revenue and averted debt costs. The future of the tariffs remains uncertain, however, as they face a legal challenge that is set to be heard by the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

These maneuvers are designed to enhance allied responses to North Korea's growing nuclear and missile threats. The exercises have drawn sharp condemnation from North Korea, with Kim Yo Jong, sister of leader Kim Jong Un, warning of "unfavorable consequences" from what she termed "reckless muscle-flexing."</p>
