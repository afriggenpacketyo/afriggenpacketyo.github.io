          <p>Shares of Sarepta Therapeutics fell sharply after reports that the FDA is considering halting shipments of its gene therapy, Elevidys, due to safety concerns. The agency's investigation follows three patient deaths linked to the company's gene therapies, two of which were tied to Elevidys. This treatment for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy has faced controversy since its approval, with questions surrounding its proven effectiveness. The stock's decline reflects significant investor uncertainty about the therapy's future on the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion purchase of Hess Corporation, securing access to valuable oil assets in Guyana. The deal proceeded after an International Chamber of Commerce ruling defeated Exxon Mobil's claim of first refusal rights over Hess's stake in the Stabroek Block. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth expressed satisfaction with the outcome, which affirms that asset-level rights do not typically apply to corporate mergers. The acquisition had faced uncertainty, and its completion is seen as a major strategic victory for Chevron in the energy sector.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly pushing for a minimum tariff of 15% to 20% on all goods imported from the European Union, escalating demands in ongoing trade negotiations. According to sources, this represents a significant increase from the EU's hopes for a deal similar to the one with the U.K., which has a 10% baseline. The stalled talks reflect tensions over the U.S. trade deficit with the bloc, a frequent point of contention for the president. This development has created uncertainty in financial markets, contributing to a drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores how retirees on fixed Social Security incomes can qualify for credit card debt relief. While being on Social Security does not disqualify individuals, options may differ from those for wage earners due to the nature of their income. Debt management plans, which consolidate payments and lower interest rates, are often a suitable choice. Other options like debt settlement or credit card hardship programs may also be viable, though debt consolidation loans can be harder to secure. The key is finding a strategy that aligns with a fixed income to manage debt without risking essential benefits.</p>

This cost saving is attributed to moving asylum seekers into cheaper accommodations, such as shared housing, and renegotiating contracts. An increase in room-sharing within the remaining hotels has also helped lower the per-person cost. However, an expert from the Migration Observatory warns that a recent surge in small boat crossings could reverse this trend and lead to a renewed need for hotel placements.</p>

          <p>Following a significant 8.5% drop in Abbott Laboratories' stock, analysts are coming to its defense, with Jefferies upgrading the stock to a "buy" rating. The sell-off was triggered by a slight reduction in the company's growth outlook, which analysts and the CEO have called an "overreaction." They argue the headwind, related to a slower-than-expected recovery in its diagnostics business in China, is temporary. The consensus among these analysts is that the company's fundamentals remain strong, with potential for accelerated growth in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has imposed sanctions on three Russian military intelligence (GRU) units and 18 individual officers for conducting a "sustained campaign of malicious cyber activity." The Foreign Office stated that these spies were working to "destabilise Europe" by targeting UK media, telecommunications, energy infrastructure, and political institutions. This action was coordinated with the European Union, which announced its own new sanctions against Russia aimed at undermining its ability to finance the war in Ukraine. The UK's Foreign Secretary emphasized that these "hybrid threats" will not be tolerated.</p>

          <p>A woman who acted as a surrogate is speaking out amid an investigation into a California couple, Guojun Xuan and Silvia Zhang, who allegedly ran a surrogacy scam. The woman, Kayla Elliott, claims she was lied to about the couple's circumstances and was one of many surrogates carrying embryos for them simultaneously. Xuan and Zhang were arrested on child endangerment charges after a nanny was filmed abusing an infant in their care. The case has expanded, with 21 children now in protective custody, and Elliott is fighting for custody of the baby she delivered.</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified a previously unknown type of cell in the intestines of Burmese pythons that enables them to completely digest the bones of their prey. This discovery explains how the invasive snakes can consume large animals, such as deer, and leave no skeletal remains behind. The specialized cells manage the massive influx of calcium from the bones, preventing it from overwhelming the snake's system. This unique biological adaptation has also been found in other constrictor snakes and the Gila monster, offering new insights into the physiology of these reptiles.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation found that TikTok's platform makes hundreds of videos promoting extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery easily accessible to underage users, a violation of its own community guidelines. By creating an account for a hypothetical 15-year-old, researchers found that simple searches led to harmful content, which was then amplified by the "For You" recommendation algorithm. The videos included restrictive diet promotions and idealization of thinness, using hashtags like "harsh motivation." Critics argue the platform is failing to protect children from potentially dangerous content.</p>

          <p>At least 63 people have been killed in severe flooding in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province over the past two days, caused by exceptionally heavy monsoon rains. The country has received 82% more rainfall this July compared to the same period last year, with the Punjab region experiencing a 124% increase. Authorities have issued warnings and advised against travel in affected areas due to the risk of landslides. With nearly 200 deaths reported nationwide since late June and more heavy rain forecasted, there are growing fears of a repeat of the catastrophic 2022 floods.</p>

          <p>A 55-year-old woman from Corby, England, discovered she had a brain tumor after a routine eye test revealed vision problems not caused by an issue within the eye itself. An MRI scan confirmed a meningioma was pressing on her optic nerve. During follow-up testing just months later, she received a second shocking diagnosis of breast cancer. After successfully undergoing a mastectomy and radiotherapy, she had surgery to remove the non-cancerous brain tumor. Her story highlights the critical importance of regular health screenings, as they can lead to the early detection of serious underlying conditions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order establishing "Schedule G," a new classification for federal employees in policy-making roles who can be hired and fired at will by the president. The White House claims this will streamline appointments and help "dismantle the deep state." Critics and public service advocates argue this is another attempt to politicize the nonpartisan civil service, similar to the revived "Schedule F" plan. This move aligns with Project 2025's goal of increasing the number of political appointees in government, which experts warn could undermine the stability of federal services.</p>
