          <p>President Trump has commuted the federal prison sentence of former New York Congressman George Santos, who was serving over seven years for wire fraud and identity theft. Trump stated on Truth Social that Santos had been "horribly mistreated" in prison and would be released immediately. Santos had pleaded guilty in April and was also ordered to pay nearly $374,000 in fines and restitution. This action marks Trump's latest high-profile clemency for a former Republican politician.</p>

Trump, who also spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and plans a future meeting in Budapest, expressed openness to a Tomahawk-for-drone trade with Ukraine.

          <p>Richard Kenneth Djerf, 55, was executed by lethal injection in Arizona for the 1993 murders of four members of the Luna family in Phoenix. Djerf, who had spent over 29 years on death row, chose not to seek clemency and had recently apologized for the pain he caused. Prosecutors stated the killings were an act of revenge over stolen goods, involving extreme violence.

          <p>The US-China trade relationship is characterized by escalating blame games, tit-for-tat threats, and unpredictable meetings between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping. This diplomatic instability, marked by wild tariff swings and expanding export controls, is attributed by analysts to a disregard for traditional diplomatic norms. Experts suggest both sides have misread the other's reactions, leading to heightened tensions. The lack of clear communication continues to jeopardize any chances of a stable resolution to the ongoing trade disputes.</p>

          <p>Alexander Acosta, former US attorney who negotiated Jeffrey Epstein's 2008 plea deal, testified to the House Oversight Committee that a federal trial would have been a "crapshoot." A released transcript shows Acosta cited victims' reluctance to testify and inconsistencies in their accounts as evidentiary hurdles. He argued the plea deal, which required Epstein to register as a sexual offender and serve jail time, was crucial to signal that such conduct was unacceptable. Acosta also denied consulting Donald Trump about the deal, despite their acquaintance.</p>

          <p>CBS News has ended its over 60-year physical presence at the Pentagon after declining to sign new press requirements that news organizations argue could infringe on First Amendment rights. The Pentagon's new policy mandates formal authorization for publishing even unclassified information, which most major news outlets rejected. Chief national security correspondent David Martin, who covered the Pentagon for 40 years, emphasized the importance of in-person reporting for building trust and breaking stories. Despite losing access, CBS News journalists vow to continue reporting on military affairs.</p>

          <p>President Trump used strong language to assert that Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro has offered "everything" to de-escalate tensions with the US, including significant stakes in the country's natural resources. Trump defended recent US military strikes on suspected Venezuelan drug vessels, claiming one targeted a "drug-carrying submarine." These actions, which have resulted in casualties and survivors, are justified by the administration as combating "narco-terrorists." However, human rights experts and some lawmakers have raised concerns about the legality and transparency of these military operations.</p>

          <p>A collection of 17 iPad drawings by renowned artist David Hockney, titled "The Arrival of Spring in Woldgate," sold for £6.2 million at Sotheby's in London. Created in 2011, these prints capture the changing seasons in the Yorkshire Wolds, a region significant to Hockney. The artist turned to his iPad for the project due to the challenges of painting outdoors in winter. This sale, which more than doubled the collection's estimate, represents a rare opportunity for collectors to acquire these distinctive digital works.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a freeze on an additional $11 billion worth of infrastructure projects in Democratic states, citing the ongoing government shutdown. White House budget director Russell Vought stated that the US Army Corps of Engineers would pause work on "low priority" projects in cities like New York, San Francisco, and Boston, threatening potential cancellations. This action follows an earlier freeze of $28 billion in transportation and energy projects, intensifying pressure on congressional Democrats to resolve the shutdown. The administration explicitly targeted states that voted against Trump in the 2024 election and sanctuary jurisdictions.</p>

Yadav Enterprises, already a major franchisee, will acquire over 550 Del Taco restaurants. The transaction is expected to close in January 2026, as Del Taco has recently faced struggles and closures.</p>

          <p>Instagram is automatically placing all users under 18 into a new "PG-13" version of the app, designed to filter out content deemed inappropriate for teens. This update expands existing restrictions, hiding posts about risky stunts and strong language from recommendations, and concealing accounts that regularly share inappropriate material. While Meta aims to reassure parents, content moderation experts express skepticism about the system's effectiveness and potential to stifle creative expression. The anachronistic label may offer false comfort, as it struggles to apply movie ratings to the dynamic nature of social media interactions.</p>

          <p>The remnants of Typhoon Halong have caused widespread devastation across Western Alaska, particularly in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, displacing over a thousand people. The storm brought hurricane-force winds and record flooding, destroying homes, uprooting boardwalks, and rendering essential systems inoperable. Evacuations were complicated by the region's remoteness, with many residents reluctant to leave their ancestral lands and subsistence food sources. The disaster highlights the vulnerability of these communities to climate change, as thawing permafrost exacerbates erosion and structural instability.</p>
