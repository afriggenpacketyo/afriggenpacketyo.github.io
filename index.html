          <p>At least three Indian states have prohibited the sale of a specific cough syrup after it was linked to the deaths of at least nine children. Health Ministry tests found the syrup, Coldrif, contained toxic levels of diethylene glycol (DEG), an industrial solvent. The incident places renewed scrutiny on India's pharmaceutical industry, which is the world's third-largest by volume and a major supplier of generic medicines globally, following similar contamination issues in recent years.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, journalist Amandla Thomas-Johnson recounts his experience of being targeted by U.S. immigration authorities after participating in a pro-Palestine protest at Cornell University. As a Black, foreign, Muslim activist, he describes being banned from campus, going into hiding, and ultimately self-deporting after learning the Department of Homeland Security had obtained his data. He raises concerns about the use of AI surveillance technologies to monitor non-citizens and the erosion of free speech rights for those critical of U.S. foreign policy.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new powers for police to impose conditions on recurring protests by considering their "cumulative impact" on communities. This move, which could lead to demonstrations being relocated, follows the arrest of nearly 500 protesters and aims to balance the right to protest with public safety. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the measures are intended to prevent communities, particularly the Jewish community, from feeling intimidated or unsafe due to repeated large-scale protests.</p>

          <p>Investigators in the murder case of Kenneth Fandrich in Hillsboro, Oregon, faced a major setback when a key piece of evidence was destroyed. A maroon minivan, believed to be the primary crime scene where Fandrich was killed, was towed and crushed at a scrapyard just a week before detectives could locate it. The suspect, Dr. Steven Milner, was allegedly stalking the victim over an affair with Milner's former employee, who was Fandrich's wife, and had used the vehicle to commit the crime.</p>

          <p>Nearly four years after its controversial Saudi-led acquisition, Newcastle United has undergone a significant transformation, including modernizing its training facilities and achieving on-field success like winning the Carabao Cup. The club has also grown commercially, with revenues projected to rise substantially, though it must navigate strict Profit and Sustainability Rules that limit spending. The article also addresses the ongoing criticism from human rights groups who argue the takeover is a form of "sportswashing" to sanitize Saudi Arabia's human rights record.</p>
