          <p>A passenger train in southern Denmark has derailed after colliding with a slurry tanker, resulting in the death of a 60-year-old woman and injuries to 27 others, with two remaining in critical condition. The crash occurred at a level crossing near the German border, involving a total of 106 people, including a group of schoolchildren who were not seriously harmed. Emergency response teams are using a crane to inspect the overturned carriages for any additional victims. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has offered condolences to those affected by the tragedy, and rail services on the line have been suspended indefinitely.</p>

          <p>China's ambitious plan to land astronauts on the moon by 2030 has reached a significant milestone with the successful ground test of the engines for its Long March-10 rocket. The test verified the synchronized performance of the 21 YF-100K engines that will power the superheavy launcher, which stands 92 meters tall and has three times the thrust of China's current most powerful rocket. According to the mission plan, two separate Long March-10 rockets will be used to launch the Mengzhou crewed spacecraft and the Lanyue lander. The two vehicles will then perform a rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit before attempting the historic landing.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated summit in Alaska between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin has concluded without a concrete ceasefire agreement for the war in Ukraine. While Trump characterized the talks as "productive" and claimed "headway" was made, he emphasized that "there's no deal until there's a deal." Putin described the meeting as a crucial "starting point" for mending bilateral relations, which he stated have fallen to their lowest point since the Cold War. The absence of Ukrainian representatives at the summit has fueled apprehension in Kyiv about the potential for a deal that could compromise its sovereignty.</p>

          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, English football legend Wayne Rooney discussed pivotal moments from his life and career, from a childhood encounter that focused him on football to his transition into management. He shared regrets, such as losing the 2005 FA Cup final, and reflected on the challenges he faced managing clubs like Derby County and Birmingham. Rooney also spoke about his commitment to self-education, including studying black history and religion to better connect with teammates from diverse backgrounds. Now a pundit, he aims to provide fair and honest analysis, even if it means criticizing former colleagues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents a critical analysis of the summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, portraying it as a diplomatic victory for the Russian leader. The author argues that Putin effectively manipulated the meeting by endorsing Trump's claims of a rigged 2020 election, thereby gaining favor and a platform on the world stage. The piece highlights the optics of the event, from the red carpet welcome for a leader accused of war crimes to Putin's invitation for a future meeting in Moscow. It suggests the summit was less about achieving peace in Ukraine and more a display of deference from the U.S. president.</p>

          <p>The meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska yielded several significant observations despite not producing a ceasefire agreement for Ukraine. The summit marked Putin's return to the world stage, where he was welcomed with a red carpet on U.S. soil. The article notes that while no concrete deal was announced, Putin reiterated maximalist demands for peace, amounting to Ukrainian capitulation. Trump's subsequent statement was notably vague, omitting any mention of a ceasefire or consequences for Russia. A final key moment was Putin's public invitation to Trump for a future meeting in Moscow.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is implementing new residency regulations that require mainland Chinese nationals applying to live on the island to prove they have relinquished their household registration and passport in mainland China. The policy, driven by President Lai Ching-te's administration, aims to address what it perceives as escalating security threats from Beijing, including societal infiltration and identity ambiguity. Applicants must provide notarized proof of renunciation or an invalidated passport. This move represents a significant shift in cross-strait residency governance and reflects a strategy to eliminate dual-status situations that Taipei views as a potential security risk.</p>

Trump also advised Zelenskyy to "make a deal" and reiterated his belief that the 2020 U.S. election was rigged, a point he said Putin agreed with.</p>

          <p>Democrats in California have unveiled a controversial proposal to redraw the state's congressional district maps, aiming to gain up to five U.S. House seats. The move is a direct response to a similar effort by Texas Republicans and is intended to bolster the Democratic party's chances of controlling Congress. The plan would require a state constitutional amendment and voter approval in a special election. If passed, it would significantly reshape several GOP-held districts to create strong Democratic advantages, a move critics, including former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, have condemned as partisan gerrymandering.</p>

This resolution ends a tense standoff over the control of the city's law enforcement, which began when President Trump deployed federal agents to crack down on crime.</p>

          <p>An internal review by the Arkansas Department of Corrections has revealed that convicted murderer Grant Hardin, known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," spent six months meticulously planning his escape. Hardin stated that lax security in the prison kitchen, where he worked, allowed him to gather supplies and create a fake law enforcement uniform. The report details how he walked out of a gate after a tower guard unlocked it without confirming his identity, a failure that led to two employees being fired. After escaping, Hardin survived in the woods on smuggled food and foraged items before his recapture.</p>

This finding challenges the long-held assumption that the lake bed is the primary cause of the region's severe air quality issues and high asthma rates. The report, authored by the Pacific Institute, suggests that pollution sources are varied, including agricultural chemicals, diesel exhaust, and mining debris.
