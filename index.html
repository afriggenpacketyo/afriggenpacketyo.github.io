          <p>A Frankfurt court is set to deliver a verdict in the case of a Syrian doctor, Alaa M., accused of committing crimes against humanity during the Assad regime's rule between 2011 and 2012. The doctor is accused of torturing and murdering prisoners in military hospitals in Damascus and Homs, with allegations including setting a teenage boy's genitals on fire. Alaa M., who arrived in Germany in 2015 and worked as an orthopedic doctor until his arrest in 2020, denies the charges, claiming he feared the military police. Prosecutors are seeking a life-long prison sentence, while the defense is demanding acquittal in this trial held under Germany's "universal jurisdiction" principle. The case is one of several Germany has pursued against Assad regime supporters for crimes committed abroad. The optimism score for this article is relatively low given the severity of the accusations. </p>

Governor Tim Walz thanked the over 20 agencies that collaborated to apprehend the suspect, emphasizing the need to reject violence and embrace civility in a deeply divided nation. He also acknowledged the pain of the Hortman family and commended law enforcement's courage and professionalism during the arrest.

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has arrived in Canada for his first in-person G7 summit, where he intends to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss tariffs. The summit occurs amidst global challenges, including the repercussions of Trump's trade policies and rising tensions following attacks between Israel and Iran. Ishiba aims to emphasize the G7's role in maintaining peace and stability in regions such as Ukraine, the Middle East, and Asia, particularly concerning China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific. Japan hopes to persuade the United States to reconsider its tariff measures, which threaten the country's export-driven economy, especially with upcoming elections and persistent inflation.

          <p>Immigration raids persisted in Southern California, causing anxiety and anger over the weekend, even as President Trump appeared to soften his stance on some workplace raids. ICE agents conducted a raid at a Santa Fe Springs swap meet, leading to the postponement of a scheduled concert. Trump recently suggested that some undocumented immigrants provide essential services, while his administration officials hinted at a need to carefully manage deportations to avoid disruptions in the food supply. Union leaders remain skeptical about the administration's leniency towards rural workers, and protests against Trump's immigration policies continued in Los Angeles. While the article highlights ongoing tensions and fears, the mention of potential policy shifts offers a glimmer of hope. </p>

          <p>Palestinians in Gaza are facing severe hunger, exacerbated by the use of hunger as a weapon of war. US-backed aid distribution points, intended to provide relief, have become death traps due to Israeli forces' actions. Incidents of shootings and killings have been reported at or on the way to these facilities, with civilians desperately seeking food. The aid distribution process is chaotic and undignified, resembling a fight for survival. The article highlights the contrast with the structured and humane aid system previously provided by Unrwa, where people were treated with dignity and received their fair share of supplies. The tone of the article is one of despair and condemnation of the current aid situation. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that ice jams will become more frequent in the Yellow River's estuary by the end of this century due to global warming, posing a threat to coastal cities in eastern Shandong province. As warmer weather arrives, upstream ice will break apart and drift downstream, potentially refreezing and accumulating in colder downstream areas. These ice jams can cause destructive flooding, damaging communities, wildlife, and infrastructure. The study, based on analysis of ice jam floods over the past 160 years, highlights the need for proactive measures to mitigate the risks associated with climate change. The article's focus on the negative impacts of climate change leads to a lower optimism score. </p>

          <p>Experts say that up to 100 truckloads of Scotland's waste will be moved to England daily after a landfill ban comes into effect at the end of the year. The Scottish government is banning "black bag" waste from landfills but acknowledges there are insufficient incinerators to meet the demand. This ban, covering biodegradable municipal waste, will apply to most domestic and commercial waste. The Scottish government views any waste export as a short-term solution, while environmental consultants estimate a significant capacity gap. The article highlights the challenges of implementing environmental policies and the need for long-term solutions. </p>

          <p>Analysts warn that Donald Trump's new "revenge tax" could threaten foreign investment into the US. The provision, within the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, allows the US to apply higher taxes on foreign entities connected to jurisdictions that impose "unfair foreign taxes" on US individuals and companies. This could chill investment by calling into question the US's openness and potentially undermine the dollar's safe haven status. The tax could also be used as a negotiating tool in trade deals, especially as Republicans may withdraw from the global minimum tax framework.
