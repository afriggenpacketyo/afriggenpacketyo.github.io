          <p>More than three decades after four teenage girls were murdered in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, the case remains unsolved. Initial convictions were overturned, and new DNA evidence has cast doubt on the original suspects. A persistent theory focuses on two unidentified men seen in the shop shortly before the crime, who were described by multiple witnesses but have never come forward. Defense attorneys and retired investigators believe these two individuals, who were the last known customers, could hold the key to solving the decades-old mystery that continues to haunt the city.</p>

Violante recounts being shot on his first date with Stacy Moskowitz, who died from her injuries, an attack that left him blind but determined to rebuild his life. Denaro describes his own shooting and the long-term psychological impact of being a victim of the infamous crime spree that terrorized New York City in the 1970s.

          <p>Fairfax County Public Schools Superintendent Michelle Reid is seeking a taxpayer-funded "Executive Protection Agent," a role critics describe as a personal bodyguard. The position, with a salary range up to $143,880, is being advertised while Reid faces scrutiny over her handling of various district scandals and policies. This request comes on top of her $424,146 annual salary and car allowance, drawing criticism from local parents and school safety experts who call the move unusual for a school district official. The district defends the position as formalizing existing security protocols and supporting broader safety initiatives.</p>

The article details the 1991 crime, the subsequent investigation that led to wrongful convictions, and the enduring grief of the victims' families. Hope for a resolution now rests on advanced DNA testing of a small male DNA sample found on one of the victims. The newly passed Homicide Victims' Families' Rights Act, partly motivated by this case, offers a new avenue for federal review with modern technology.</p>

Berkowitz, now a born-again Christian, describes his past actions as the work of a "demon" and expresses remorse for the pain he caused, stating he was "walking in darkness." He discusses his troubled childhood, his life behind bars as "just another face in the crowd," and his current efforts to minister to young people.

          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has chosen not to reappoint clean energy advocate Alessandra Carreon to the state's public services commission, which regulates utility monopolies. Environmental groups allege the move was influenced by utility giants DTE Energy and Consumers Energy, who were reportedly unhappy with Carreon's stances. The governor's new appointee, Shaquila Myers, is described by critics as an "industry ally" with ties to a former state house speaker seen as friendly to big business. The decision is controversial as the commission is currently considering major rate increases and long-term energy plans for the state.</p>

          <p>This essay reflects on the crucial, undramatic work of George Washington in the summer of 1775, a period that was essential for the success of the American Revolution. After taking command of a chaotic assembly of militias outside Boston, Washington methodically built a true American army. He overcame his own prejudices to appoint talented New Englanders to key posts and established the discipline and organization needed to face the British. The author argues that this quiet, foundational leadership, rooted in character and judgment, was more vital than tactical genius and remains a powerful, if often overlooked, example of greatness.</p>

This conflict highlights the transactional nature of their half-century-long association, where Murdoch's outlets, particularly Fox News, helped fuel Trump's political rise.

          <h2>Op-Ed: Trump Administration Ruling Reverses Decades of Progress for Women Seeking Asylum</h2>

          <p>A recent ruling by the Trump administration's Board of Immigration Appeals marks a significant reversal of U.S. policy on gender-based asylum claims, an opinion piece argues. The decision holds that a "particular social group," one of the five grounds for refugee protection, cannot be defined by gender or gender combined with nationality. The author contends this returns refugee law to an era when violence against women was dismissed as a private matter, ignoring decades of progress since the "women's rights are human rights" movement gained prominence. This legal shift creates a major new barrier for women and girls fleeing persecution.</p>

          <p>Despite heavy rain, tens of thousands of protesters, including WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge for a pro-Palestinian demonstration. The "March for Humanity," which called for a ceasefire and more humanitarian aid for Gaza, proceeded after a last-minute Supreme Court decision authorized the event over police safety objections. The court ruled that while safety concerns were valid, the urgency of the humanitarian situation was compelling. The protest, one of the largest public assemblies to close the bridge in recent years, caused major traffic disruptions but remained largely peaceful.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed rating for each player on the 2025 British and Irish Lions rugby tour to Australia. While the Lions secured a 2-1 series victory, the analysis suggests it was a hard-fought win against an underprepared but resilient Wallabies team, and the Lions were not a "great" team. Standout performers like Tadhg Beirne and Tom Curry received high marks for their immense work rate and impact. The piece also reflects on the mixed fortunes of other players, including those whose tours were cut short by injury and those who struggled to find their best form.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov Volcano on Russia's remote Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time since the 15th century, sending an ash plume six kilometers into the sky. Experts suggest the eruption may be linked to a massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake that struck the region last week. Shortly after the eruption, another strong earthquake of 7.0 magnitude hit the nearby Kuril Islands, prompting a new tsunami warning for parts of the peninsula. Russian authorities have stated there is no immediate threat to populated areas from the volcanic eruption.</p>

          <p>Chile is experiencing one of the world's most dramatic drops in fertility, with its birth rate now below that of most European countries and Japan. This rapid demographic shift, driven by the high cost of living and changing societal norms, may foreshadow trends in the United States, where the birth rate also recently hit a record low. A growing number of young Chilean women are delaying or opting out of motherhood to pursue education and careers, a trend also seen in the U.S. This transformation is creating a political debate and posing long-term challenges for social systems built on population growth.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed a Biden-era policy, increasing the rate at which the Social Security Administration (SSA) can garnish benefits to recover overpayments. The clawback rate, which was lowered to 10% during the pandemic, has been raised to 50%, affecting potentially over a million beneficiaries who were overpaid. The SSA is owed an estimated $23 billion in such payments. Beneficiaries facing these garnishments have legal options, including applying for a waiver due to financial hardship or requesting a reconsideration if they dispute the overpayment amount.

          <p>A Ukrainian drone attack has been blamed for a large fire at an oil depot near the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, according to Russian authorities. The regional governor reported that drone debris struck a fuel tank, requiring a major firefighting response, and the nearby airport briefly suspended flights. This attack was part of a wider wave of Ukrainian drone strikes over the weekend targeting Russian infrastructure. The strikes come in retaliation for Russia's sustained bombardment of Ukraine's energy grid and follow a particularly deadly week of Russian missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new offense to combat illegal Channel crossings by targeting those who advertise them on social media. The proposed law would make creating and publishing material that promotes illegal immigration, such as offering fake documents or passage on small boats, punishable by up to five years in prison. The Home Office notes that around 80% of migrants arriving by small boat report using social media to contact smuggling gangs. The government believes this measure will give authorities more power to disrupt the business model of these criminal networks.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to cut interest rates this week, likely by 0.25 percentage points to 4.0%. This would be the fifth reduction since last August, as policymakers seek to support the UK economy, which is facing rising unemployment and a slowdown in growth. Factors influencing the decision include a shrinking economy in recent months and the negative impact of new U.S. tariffs on global trade. While the cut will be welcomed by borrowers, it highlights concerns that the UK may be entering a period of stagflation, with slow growth and persistent inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

The bunker contains two large rooms with original features, including tiled floors and German writing on the walls.

Hargreaves, a 22-year-old mother of three, was shot to death by three men who burst into her Liverpool home on August 3, 2005, and then set the house on fire.
