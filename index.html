          <p>An Iranian ballistic missile directly hit Soroka Hospital in Beersheba, southern Israel, causing damage and requiring the evacuation of 20 patients, according to Israeli authorities. Dozens of ballistic missiles were launched at Israel, with reports of impacts in multiple locations in central Israel. The incident is part of an escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, marked by tit-for-tat attacks. Israel has vowed to respond to the attack on the hospital and defend its people, indicating a potential continuation of the conflict. The situation remains tense as both sides exchange fire. Optimism is low for de-escalation in the near future.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have painstakingly pieced together thousands of fragments of 2,000-year-old wall plaster, revealing remarkable frescoes from a luxurious Roman villa in Central London. Discovered in 2021, the frescoes depict musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, providing insights into the affluence of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London." The largest fresco measures about 5m by 3m and features a lower section imitating marble and yellow panels with green borders. The art suggests that the Roman painters incorporated local elements into classical designs, and the team hopes to find the missing fragment bearing the artist's name to further understand the history of Roman London.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has resumed processing student visa applications but now requires applicants to unlock their social media accounts for review. Consular officers will be looking for posts deemed hostile to the U.S., its government, culture, or founding principles. Refusal to grant access to social media accounts may result in visa rejection, as it could be seen as an attempt to hide online activity. The State Department also stated that consulates should prioritize students enrolling at colleges where foreign students comprise less than 15% of the student body, adding further scrutiny to international students in the U.S.</p>

          <p>New Zealand has halted NZ$18.2 million in funding to the Cook Islands due to concerns over wide-ranging deals the latter made with China, covering infrastructure, tourism, technology, and deep-sea mineral exploration. Wellington, the Cook Islands' biggest funder, claims it was not informed about these deals, which were struck in February. New Zealand's Foreign Minister stated that funding relies on a high-trust bilateral relationship and will not be considered until the Cook Islands takes concrete steps to repair the relationship and restore trust.

          <p>Emmet Sheehan made a successful return to the Dodgers' mound after recovering from Tommy John surgery, pitching four sharp innings in their 4-3 win against the San Diego Padres. Sheehan's performance, featuring a fastball around 95 mph and effective sliders and changeups, provided a much-needed boost to the Dodgers' rotation. Justin Wrobleski followed with five innings of relief, but struggled in the ninth, giving up two runs. Will Smith ultimately secured the victory with a walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth, marking a promising sign for the Dodgers' pitching depth in the second half of the season. The team is hopeful that Sheehan will become a solid option.</p>

While acknowledging the repressive nature of the Iranian regime and its destabilizing actions in the region, the author cautions against the assumption that its overthrow would automatically lead to a better outcome. The lessons from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya highlight the difficulties of rebuilding after destruction, and a defeated Iran could face prolonged civic instability due to ethnic and religious tensions, and the presence of elements from the former regime.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government will resume issuing international student visas but will require applicants to make their social media accounts public for thorough screening. The move comes after a temporary halt in visa interviews in May, and the new guidance includes a comprehensive vetting of applicants' online presence. Prospective students will be assessed for "hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles." This tightening of standards follows alleged acts of anti-Semitism during student protests against Israel.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump questioned the immigration status of workers installing new flagpoles at the White House, making remarks that appeared to be in jest. During a press conference, Trump asked if there were any "illegal immigrants" among the workers, who shook their heads in response. The comments came after Trump discussed his administration's deportation efforts, emphasizing the removal of "murderers, drug dealers, people that are mentally insane." The incident highlights Trump's continued focus on immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Companies are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to avoid higher duties imposed by the U.S. government. This legal practice involves altering an item's materials, dimensions, or composition to fit into a different harmonized system code with lower tariff rates. Examples include bundling steel and aluminum elements into products, using cotton instead of synthetic materials, and adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins. Columbia Sportswear and Converse have also implemented strategic product tweaks to save on tariff costs, demonstrating the widespread use of this practice. (not investment advice)</p>
