          <p>A recent ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll reveals that Donald Trump's job approval rating has fallen to 39%, the lowest for any president at 100 days in office in the past 80 years. The poll highlights significant public disapproval of Trump's policies, particularly regarding the economy, with 72% believing his policies will cause a recession. Furthermore, negative assessments extend beyond the economy, with majorities expressing concern about Trump's administration avoiding court orders and expanding presidential powers. Despite this, the poll indicates that voters trust Trump more than the Democrats in Congress to handle the nation's main problems.</p>

          <p>The European pharmaceutical industry is bracing for potential tariffs on drugs exported to the United States, as President Trump has been promising to impose higher tariffs on pharmaceuticals as part of his plan to reorder the global trading system. These tariffs could have significant consequences for European-made drugs, which constitute the bloc's top export to America, including popular treatments like Ozempic, cancer treatments, and cardiovascular drugs. The implementation of these tariffs could disrupt the flow of essential medicines and impact the affordability of drugs for American consumers.</p>

          <p>Australia, once a top destination for international students, is reconsidering its approach to overseas education due to a growing housing crisis. Politicians are now considering capping the number of international students as a means to reduce demand for rentals and starter homes. This shift marks a significant change for Australia, which has historically viewed international education as a major economic driver. While acknowledging the need to address housing affordability, some argue that limiting international students could have negative consequences for the country's economy and research capabilities.</p>

          <p>Tensions between China and South Korea have risen due to the presence of three large steel structures in a disputed area of the Yellow Sea. While China maintains these structures are for commercial fish farming, South Korean critics fear they are being used to assert territorial claims, mirroring China's actions in the South China Sea. Some Chinese analysts caution that this dispute could impede efforts to improve relations between the two countries, particularly as China seeks support from its neighbors in opposing US tariffs.

          <p>US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have reportedly deported three children, who are US citizens, along with their Honduran-born mothers from Louisiana. The ACLU has condemned these deportations as illegal and inhumane, particularly highlighting the case of one child with metastatic cancer who was deported without medication or medical consultations. A federal judge has scheduled a hearing to address concerns about the deportation of the 2-year-old, emphasizing the illegality of deporting a US citizen. The Trump administration has faced criticism for its deportation policies, with rights groups alleging violations of migrants' constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>Canada's upcoming election has seen a dramatic shift in fortunes, with the Liberal party regaining ground after a period of low popularity. The return of Donald Trump to the White House and his subsequent tariff threats have played a significant role, allowing Liberal leader Mark Carney to position himself as a steady hand capable of navigating the challenges posed by the US. While Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre focuses on domestic issues, Carney's focus on the US relationship has resonated with voters concerned about economic stability and national sovereignty.</p>
