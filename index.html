          <h2>Mike Waltz Faces Senate Scrutiny During UN Ambassador Confirmation Hearing</h2>

          <p>President Trump's nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Mike Waltz, underwent a confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Lawmakers questioned him on the administration's foreign policy, particularly concerning China and Israel, and the need for UN reform. Democrats, including Senators Chris Coons and Cory Booker, confronted Waltz about his role in a security scandal involving the Signal messaging app, criticizing his handling of the incident and lack of accountability. Despite the controversy, Waltz's confirmation is considered likely due to the Republican majority in the Senate.</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index rose to an annual rate of 2.7% in June, an increase influenced by the ongoing effects of the administration's trade tariffs. While lower gasoline prices provided some relief, costs for groceries and housing continued to climb, contributing to the overall inflationary pressure. Economists anticipate that the full impact of these tariffs will become more evident in consumer prices in the latter half of the year, as businesses can no longer absorb the increased import duties.

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed the arrest of five Iranian citizens and two Uzbek citizens who were attempting to illegally cross the border from Canada into upstate New York. All seven individuals had prior arrests for illegal border crossings and are currently detained pending removal proceedings. The arrests have heightened concerns in small border towns about national security, especially in light of recent U.S. military actions against Iranian nuclear sites. Counterterrorism experts have previously warned that existing border policies could allow for potential sleeper cells to enter the country.</p>

          <p>An exploration team has discovered the wreck of the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer Teruzuki, which was sunk by U.S. torpedo boats in 1942 during the Guadalcanal campaign. Located over 2,600 feet deep in the Solomon Islands' Iron Bottom Sound, the warship was found with its munitions, including depth charges, still intact. The discovery provides new insights into the ship's final moments, disproving the long-held theory that its own depth charges caused the sinking. The find is historically significant as there are no known photographs of the Teruzuki from its time of service.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States has secured a trade deal with Indonesia, just a week after threatening the country with a 32% tariff on its exports. In a social media post, the president described it as a "great deal, for everybody" and stated that further details would be released soon. This announcement follows a similar pattern to a recent trade deal declared with Vietnam, which reportedly surprised Vietnamese officials and has not yet been formally accepted.

          <p>The U.S. Senate is preparing to vote on a White House rescissions package that seeks to cancel $9.4 billion in previously approved funding. The proposal primarily targets $8.3 billion in foreign aid programs, including global health initiatives like PEPFAR, and would also eliminate $1.1 billion in federal funding for NPR and PBS. The package, which requires only a simple majority, has faced resistance from some Senate Republicans concerned about its impact on humanitarian programs and rural broadcasting. The move has also angered Democrats, who warn it could jeopardize future bipartisan cooperation on government funding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senior British police officials have warned that Russia, Iran, and China are intensifying hostile state activities in the United Kingdom, including life-threatening operations such as attacks and kidnappings. Officials reported a fivefold increase in such activities since 2017, noting that these states often use criminal proxies, and sometimes even teenagers, to carry out their work. Recent examples include an arson attack linked to Russia's Wagner group and numerous Iran-backed plots to kidnap or kill individuals in Britain. The three nations have consistently denied these accusations, calling them politically motivated.</p>

The judge found sufficient evidence that such practices violate the 4th Amendment.
