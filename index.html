          <p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee has awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado for her persistent efforts to promote democratic rights. Machado was lauded as a key unifying figure in the country's once-divided political opposition, championing the cause for free elections and a peaceful transition away from dictatorship. The prestigious award, established by Alfred Nobel, includes a prize of over $1 million and recognizes individuals who have conferred the "greatest benefit on mankind." The article also provides context on past winners and President Trump's previously expressed desire to receive the award.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been indicted on federal bank fraud charges related to a property she purchased in Virginia. Prosecutors allege she misrepresented the property as a secondary residence to secure a more favorable mortgage, while actually renting it out. James has called the charges a "desperate weaponization of our justice system" and claims they are politically motivated by President Donald Trump, against whom she previously led a successful civil fraud case. The indictment follows Trump's public calls for his political opponents, including James, to be legally pursued by the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>During a heated Virginia gubernatorial debate, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears challenged her Democratic opponent, Rep. Abigail Spanberger, to publicly urge Virginia's Democratic senators to help end the ongoing government shutdown. Earle-Sears argued that securing just eight Democratic votes in the Senate could resolve the impasse, which is significantly impacting federal workers and military personnel in the state. Spanberger countered by stating that all Virginia leaders should be urging the president to re-enter negotiations and criticized Earle-Sears for her past remarks on federal job cuts. The exchange highlighted the deep political divisions surrounding the shutdown.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown drags on, furloughed federal workers and those required to work without pay are expressing significant anxiety about their financial stability. Many government employees, especially those earning lower salaries, have little savings and fear they will have to incur debt to cover basic living expenses. The shutdown has also halted the work of agencies like the National Labor Relations Board, delaying justice for workers with claims of unfair labor practices. Employees describe a "huge psychological toll" and a sense of "moral injury" from the political stalemate affecting them and the public.</p>

          <p>At just 19 years old, Arjun Malaviya from Southern California has traveled solo to 118 countries, starting his journey on his 17th birthday. Financing the entire $22,500 trip himself through various jobs, Malaviya aimed to connect with local people and understand their daily lives, from sipping tea with a Taliban guard to visiting remote Pacific islands. He says the experience taught him that people across different cultures share similar desires for their families and futures. Malaviya hopes his journey inspires other young people to embrace new experiences and explore the world.</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown is preventing Social Security Administration employees from providing benefit verification letters, a crucial service for many recipients. While monthly payments are still being disbursed, these official letters are often required to apply for or recertify for housing aid, fuel assistance, and other support programs. Many beneficiaries, particularly the elderly and disabled, struggle to access the letters through online portals, leaving them at risk of losing essential aid. Agency workers express deep frustration, describing an influx of desperate calls from people facing deadlines for mortgages and rent subsidies without the necessary documentation.</p>

          <p>In his second term, President Trump has increasingly suggested or ordered the deployment of the National Guard to nearly a dozen cities, all of which are led by Democratic mayors. The administration justifies these actions as necessary to combat crime and quell protests, particularly around federal facilities like those for ICE. However, critics and local officials have condemned the moves as a dangerous abuse of power, leading to legal challenges in states like Illinois and Oregon. The deployments have sparked significant controversy, with some federal judges temporarily blocking the administration's orders to federalize state Guard units.</p>

Komeito's exit leaves the LDP without a majority in parliament just days before the scheduled vote for the next prime minister.

          <p>India has announced it is reopening its embassy in Kabul and upgrading its technical mission, four years after it was closed following the Taliban's return to power in 2021. The decision was revealed during a landmark visit to India by Afghanistan's acting Foreign Minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, a trip that required a UN travel ban exemption. This diplomatic move marks a significant policy shift for New Delhi, which does not officially recognize the Taliban government. The development comes as relations between the Taliban and India's rival, Pakistan, have deteriorated, creating a new strategic opening for India.</p>

          <p>The announcement that Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny will headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show has triggered a significant backlash from conservative commentators and supporters of Donald Trump. Critics have labeled the global music icon a "massive Trump hater" and taken issue with his social activism and Spanish-language music. The controversy highlights cultural and political divides, particularly concerning Puerto Rican identity, as some critics mistakenly claimed the US citizen was "not an American artist." Despite the outrage, Bad Bunny's music has seen a surge in streams, and the NFL's decision is seen as a strategic move to increase global viewership.</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group concerning Kendrick Lamar's hit diss track, "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that the song's lyrics, which contained serious accusations, constituted "nonactionable opinion" within the context of a highly publicized rap battle. The ruling noted that a reasonable listener would not interpret the "incendiary language and offensive accusations" as verifiable facts, especially since Drake himself had previously goaded Lamar. Drake's spokesperson has stated he will appeal the decision, while UMG expressed satisfaction with the outcome.</p>

While exemptions exist for some staff, the move has raised questions amid a broader debate over corporate use of technology to track employees.

          <p>Peru's Congress has unanimously voted to impeach and remove President Dina Boluarte from office, citing her administration's failure to control a severe national crime wave.

The impeachment was triggered by widespread public anger, which intensified after a recent shooting at a concert in Lima.
