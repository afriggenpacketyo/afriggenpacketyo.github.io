        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's control over the global rare earth supply chain has been significantly strengthened by its reliance on Myanmar for these materials, particularly heavy rare earth elements like dysprosium and terbium. Myanmar accounted for approximately 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year, with exports peaking at nearly 42,000 metric tons in 2023. This reliance poses supply chain risks for China, as much of the extraction occurs in Myanmar's Kachin State, a region grappling with civil war and rebel activity. The extraction methods in Myanmar involve environmentally damaging leaching processes, raising concerns about human rights and environmental abuses. Optimism score is based on the fact that the author is just reflecting on the global supply chain without having a strong positive or negative sentiment. </p>

          <p>A severe heat wave is predicted to sweep across the eastern United States, bringing record-high temperatures for several days. The National Weather Service has issued warnings for the Midwest to the East Coast, expecting numerous daily record maximum and minimum temperatures. Over 150 million Americans are under extreme heat alerts, with the total number affected rising to around 200 million, marking one of the most expansive heat alert events ever. Experts advise staying indoors with air conditioning, staying hydrated, and avoiding strenuous outdoor activities to prevent heat-related illnesses, as climate change is making such extreme temperatures more frequent and longer-lasting.

Germany will borrow a total of ‚Ç¨378.1 billion for defense between 2025 and 2029, made possible by debt brake reform from March.

He said the department would evaluate each use-of-force incident, but maintained that officers faced dangerous conditions, including attacks with bottles and Molotov cocktails. Critics, however, have questioned whether officers used excessive force against non-threatening protesters, and the department is likely to face civil litigation alleging excessive force.

          <p>President Trump's decision to involve the U.S. in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran may have resulted in a ceasefire, at least temporarily. Trump announced that the two countries had agreed to a ceasefire that could lead to lasting peace. This development followed a day of heightened tensions, including Iranian missile attacks on a U.S. base in Qatar, which were reportedly intercepted without casualties. The potential ceasefire marks a step back from a wider conflict that threatened to engulf the region, though the situation remains delicate. The tone of the article is cautiously optimistic, thus the optimism score reflects this. </p>

          <p>Following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, Republican lawmakers have largely congratulated President Trump, while Democrats have been more reserved in their reactions. Republicans praised Trump's negotiating skills and credited him with achieving a safer world, while Democrats, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, raised concerns about the legality and constitutionality of the U.S.'s involvement in the conflict. Rep. Thomas Massie, who had been pushing for congressional approval before any attacks on Iran, stated that he would not advance the measure if the ceasefire holds.
