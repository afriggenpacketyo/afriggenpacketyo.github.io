          <p>Shares of eToro, an Israel-based stock brokerage platform, experienced a significant surge of 40% during their Nasdaq debut after successfully raising nearly $310 million in its IPO, pricing shares above the anticipated range. This IPO is being closely watched by Wall Street as a potential indicator of renewed interest in IPOs after a prolonged period of slowdown. EToro's revenue from cryptoassets has seen substantial growth, contributing significantly to its trading income. The company had previously shelved plans to go public via a SPAC merger in 2022 due to unfavorable market conditions.</p>

          <p>A two-year-old girl, Maikelys Espinoza, who was separated from her parents due to deportation, has arrived in Venezuela, where her mother had been deported earlier. The U.S. government justified the separation by alleging the parents' ties to the Tren de Aragua gang, designated a terrorist organization. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro thanked President Trump for the return of the toddler, calling it a "profoundly humane act." The father was deported to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador under Trump's invocation of an 18th-century wartime law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's latest effort to lower prescription drug prices by tying them to lower prices abroad has sparked debate over the high costs paid by U.S. patients. Americans pay more for drugs than Europeans due to the U.S.' complex reimbursement system and lack of national pricing control. Drug prices are generally set by pharmaceutical companies and negotiated by private insurers, unlike in Europe where governments negotiate directly. While U.S. consumers pay more for branded drugs, unbranded generic drugs are often cheaper than in other nations.</p>

          <p>Hearing aids are becoming more accessible and technologically advanced, with new options like glasses that double as hearing aids and personal sound amplification products (PSAPs). These devices are appealing to a wider age range and offer more affordable alternatives to traditional hearing aids. The social isolation caused by hearing loss can lead to loneliness and cognitive decline, making early intervention important. While it takes time to adjust to hearing aids, the improved sensory input is vital for connecting with others and optimizing aging.</p>

          <p>As President Putin prepares for potential ceasefire negotiations, Russia is asserting its military advantage in Ukraine and demanding strict limitations on Ukraine's military capabilities and territory. The Trump administration faces the challenge of convincing Putin that warmer ties with the United States outweigh the benefits of incremental battlefield gains. Despite Russian forces seizing territory, they have suffered significant troop losses. Russia hopes that Ukraine will eventually run out of resources, leading to a collapse of its defensive lines.</p>

          <p>A large blind taste test conducted by Nectar, a nonprofit researching alternative proteins, revealed the best plant-based meat products across various categories. The test involved nearly 2,700 participants who sampled 122 plant-based meat products alongside animal meat benchmarks. Twenty of the plant-based products, including those from Impossible Foods and MorningStar Farms, were rated equal to or better than their animal-based counterparts. The results suggest that some consumer preference for animal meat may be psychological, as differences in taste become less significant when prepared in a meal.</p>

The cause of this mortality discrepancy is not fully understood, but it could be due to hormonal differences or physical stress being a more common trigger for men.
