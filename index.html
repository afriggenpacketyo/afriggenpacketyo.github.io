          <p>Singer Jessie J has revealed that she has been diagnosed with early breast cancer and is planning to undergo surgery after her performance at Capital's Summertime Ball. The 37-year-old star shared the news on Instagram, noting that she has been undergoing tests recently and expressed optimism by focusing on the 'early' stage of the diagnosis. She humorously mentioned that she views the surgery as a dramatic way to get a boob job and plans to return with new music after a brief absence.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the Navy to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, a ship named after the gay rights activist and Korean War veteran. The decision, made to align with President Trump's objectives to "re-establish the warrior culture," has been met with criticism from figures like Nancy Pelosi and Gavin Newsom. They argue that it weakens national security and disrespects Milk's legacy as a civil rights leader. The ship, christened in 2021, had been intended to honor LGBTQ+ leaders in the Navy and the Biden administration also changed the names of two Navy ships in 2023 to remove Confederate names from U.S. military installations.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Cologne, Germany, evacuated approximately 20,000 people as experts worked to defuse three unexploded World War II bombs. The operation, one of the largest of its kind in the city, led to the closure of a significant portion of the city center, including hotels, care homes, and bridges. Cologne was a major target during WWII, experiencing numerous bombing raids, including the British Royal Air Force's first "thousand-bomber raid" in 1942.

          <p>Data released Wednesday indicates that the number of births in Japan fell below 700,000 in 2024, marking the first time this threshold has been crossed, with a 5.7% decline from the previous year to 686,061. This highlights a continuing trend of delayed marriages and childbirths in the country. The total fertility rate also dropped to a record low of 1.15, down from 1.20 in 2023, while the number of marriages increased slightly for the first time in two years. The natural decrease, which is the difference between deaths and births, reached a record high, indicating a significant demographic challenge for Japan.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, a move intended to secure the future of the American steel industry. Critics argue that these protections could disrupt steel producers outside the US, spark retaliation from trade partners, and increase costs for American users of the metals. The UK has been granted a carve-out from the measures, leaving duties on its steel and aluminum at 25% due to ongoing trade discussions with the US. Economists warn that the tariffs could lead to job losses in sectors that rely on these metals.</p>

Bereaved families describe the review process as "hell on earth" and believe that speedier reviews could prevent further deaths.

          <p>Wednesday's newspaper front pages cover a range of topics, including a surge in small boat crossings attributed to good weather and discussions of potential tax increases. Several papers feature the ongoing search for Madeleine McCann in Portugal, nearly two decades after her disappearance. Economic issues, such as the future of Thames Water and the potential impact of Labour's spending pledges, are also prominent. Additionally, some headlines address international affairs, including Trump's criticism of the BBC's coverage of the conflict and the UK's plans to stockpile medical supplies for nuclear attacks.</p>

          <p>More than 15 former Indiana men's basketball players have alleged improper sexual conduct by a former team physician, Dr. Bradford Bomba, with claims that university officials, including coach Bobby Knight, were aware of the behavior. The allegations involve regular rectal exams performed on male athletes despite medical guidance not recommending them for college-age men. Players who raised complaints were allegedly instructed to continue seeing Bomba, leading to lawsuits against the school. An investigation commissioned by Indiana University found Bomba's exams were performed appropriately, a finding disputed by the players' legal representatives.</p>
