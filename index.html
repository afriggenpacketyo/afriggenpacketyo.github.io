          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Texas's Hill Country have resulted in the deaths of over 110 people, with dozens more still missing. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically over a short period, inundating the area and prompting a massive search and rescue operation. A significant number of the victims were children and counselors from Camp Mystic, a summer camp located directly on the river. Officials are now facing intense scrutiny over the adequacy and timing of their emergency warnings to residents and campers as the disaster's full scope becomes clear.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire, fanned by strong winds and dry conditions, has reached the edge of Marseille, France's second-largest city, forcing the evacuation of at least 400 residents. Over a thousand firefighters have been mobilized to combat the blaze, which officials described as spreading with apocalyptic speed at its peak. The fire, which originated from a burning car on a motorway, has burned approximately 700 hectares and injured nine firefighters. This event is part of a broader pattern of early summer heatwaves and wildfires affecting other parts of Europe, including Spain and Greece.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has officially ended the nearly two-decade-old policy requiring travelers to remove their shoes at airport security checkpoints. Secretary Kristi Noem stated that advancements in screening technology and layered security measures, including REAL ID enforcement, now allow for this change. While the general mandate is lifted, individual travelers may still be asked to remove their shoes for additional screening. The TSA PreCheck program will retain its value by allowing members to also keep on belts and leave laptops in their bags.</p>

          <p>A murder investigation in Florida centers on the complex and volatile relationship between three people, known as a 'throuple.' In April 2018, Aileen Seiden was found dead after staying in a motel room with her partners, Zachary Abell and Christina Araujo. Seiden's friends reported that the relationship was abusive, with Seiden expressing fear of both partners, particularly Araujo, who allegedly used her father's law enforcement position to intimidate her. The case, which took nearly six years to go to trial, highlights the turbulent dynamics that ultimately led to Seiden's violent death.</p>

The viral clip prompted a wave of social media commentary, with many users deeming the behavior disrespectful and unprofessional. The loss dropped the Sky to a 5-13 record for the season, one of the worst in the WNBA.</p>

          <p>An emergency response plan from 2015 for Kerr County, Texas, explicitly identified flash flooding as a "highly likely" hazard with a potential for "major" impact on public safety. The document, found on the Kerrville city website, outlined a high-readiness protocol for flash flood warnings that included public notification and evacuation of low-lying areas. This revelation raises further questions about the official response to the recent catastrophic floods that killed over 100 people.

          <p>Recent legislation signed by the President does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, contrary to some claims, but instead introduces a new temporary tax deduction for seniors. The bill provides a deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older with incomes under $75,000, or $12,000 for couples earning under $150,000. Policy experts note this primarily benefits higher-income seniors and does not affect low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax. Critics also argue that the measure could further strain Social Security's finances by reducing overall tax revenue.</p>

          <p>The devastating Texas floods expose critical failures in modern emergency alert systems, which rely heavily on cellphone notifications and social media posts. While the National Weather Service issued timely warnings, local authorities in Kerr County were slow to issue evacuation orders, and the generic instruction to "move to higher ground" was insufficient for many. Experts point to gaps in training for local officials, vacant key meteorological liaison positions, and an over-reliance on a single technology.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports, a move that caused copper prices to jump to a record high. The president also indicated that steep tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, potentially as high as 200%, are forthcoming. The copper tariff follows a national security investigation ordered in February and is expected to be formally implemented by the end of July. This policy aims to protect domestic producers and bring production back to the U.S., mirroring the administration's earlier tariffs on steel and aluminum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to move forward with significant staff reductions and reorganizations across numerous federal agencies. The court's decision lifts a lower-court injunction that had blocked the mass layoffs, known as "reductions in force." In its unsigned order, the court stated the administration was likely to succeed in arguing its executive order was lawful, though it did not rule on the legality of specific agency plans. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the sole dissenter, warning the decision unleashes a "wrecking ball" on the federal workforce and government services.</p>

Kashanian was abruptly arrested outside her New Orleans home shortly after U.S. airstrikes on Iran. Her neighbors and friends organized a letter-writing campaign that drew the attention of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who intervened with Trump administration officials. Although she has no criminal record and has complied with regular check-ins for decades, she was previously unable to secure legal status due to a past fraudulent marriage.</p>

          <p>James Gunn's "Superman" reboot presents a Man of Steel, played by David Corenswet, who is more impulsive and overwhelmed than traditionally heroic. The film skips the origin story, instead pitting a less-than-fully-healed Superman against a tech-zealot Lex Luthor, portrayed by Nicholas Hoult. The review notes that the movie struggles to balance its pop-punk sensibilities with moments of sincerity, resulting in a hero who feels more obtuse than idealistic. While the plot is entertaining and features fun cameos, the overall tone is seen as recklessly shape-shifting, caught between silly gags and brutal action.</p>

          <p>The UK's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), projects the annual cost of the state pension triple lock will reach £15.5 billion by 2030, three times the original estimate. The policy, which increases the state pension by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%, has become more expensive due to recent volatility. The OBR warned that rising age-related spending pressures are putting public finances on an unsustainable long-term path. Despite the forecast, the government stated it remains committed to the triple lock to ensure security for pensioners. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article challenges the idea that the recent Republican cuts to means-tested programs like Medicaid prove the political superiority of universal benefits like Social Security. The author argues that the political resilience of programs for the elderly stems from their perceived "earned" status and the high voter turnout of seniors, not just their universality. The article points out that universal unemployment insurance has faced significant cuts, while overall spending on targeted anti-poverty programs has grown substantially over the past decades. It concludes that while universal programs have policy advantages, establishing them is politically difficult given American aversion to higher taxes.</p>
