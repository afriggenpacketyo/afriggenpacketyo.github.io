          <p>Erez Reuveni, a former Department of Justice lawyer, has emerged as a whistleblower, alleging that high-ranking DOJ officials, including Emil Bove, disregarded due process and federal court orders. He claims his termination stemmed from his refusal to sign a brief that falsely labeled a deported Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, as a terrorist. Reuveni's disclosure contributes to a growing concern about governmental misconduct, with a law professor citing over 35 cases where judges found the government provided false information. This article exposes serious ethical and legal integrity concerns within the Justice Department's operations under the current administration, impacting the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Renowned artist Amy Sherald, celebrated for her portrait of Michelle Obama, canceled her "American Sublime" exhibition at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery. She expressed concerns that museum officials, reportedly under pressure from the Trump administration, might censor her painting of a transgender person depicted as the Statue of Liberty. Sherald views her work, which predominantly features Black Americans with grayscale skin tones, as deeply patriotic, aiming to challenge conventional perceptions of identity and American ideals. The exhibition will now open at the Baltimore Museum of Art, affirming the artist's commitment to her uncompromised artistic vision.</p>

          <p>China's top leaders are preparing their next Five-Year Plan (2026-2030), a strategic blueprint that has historically reshaped the global economy. Previous plans, such as the 1981-84 "Reform and Opening Up," propelled China's economic boom and the "China shock" of outsourced manufacturing. More recently, the 2011-15 "Strategic emerging industries" plan established China as a global leader in green technology and secured near-monopolies over rare earth supply chains, granting significant geopolitical leverage. The current "High quality development" (2021-25) aims for technological dominance, challenging American leadership and sparking diplomatic disputes over tech bans.</p>
