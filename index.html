          <p>Tuesday's UK newspapers are dominated by reactions to Prime Minister Keir Starmer's new Brexit trade deal with the EU, which promises to boost the economy but faces criticism for concessions on fishing rights and youth visas. Several papers highlight the UK's joint condemnation with France and Canada of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's actions in Gaza, including restrictions on aid. The Financial Times reports on UBS's use of AI analyst avatars, while other papers focus on Gary Lineker's departure from the BBC. The Daily Mail accuses Starmer of a 'great Brexit betrayal'.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut, driven by investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the booming electric vehicle market.

CATL plans to use 90% of the funds to build a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen.

          <p>House Republicans are working through late-night sessions to advance President Trump's 'big, beautiful bill,' facing internal divisions and Democratic opposition. The Budget Committee convened late Sunday to move the tax cut and spending reduction package forward after a previous setback. The article highlights the parliamentary reasons for the unusual timing and the challenges Republicans face in securing enough votes, particularly regarding spending cuts and state and local tax deductions. The process is described as reminiscent of Edward Hopper's 'Nighthawks,' with lawmakers fueled by caffeine as they try to reach a deal.</p>

The season will feature 'The Outsiders' but not 'Hamilton,' and lacks the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, a former staple at the Kennedy Center.

          <p>President Donald Trump is visiting Capitol Hill to persuade divided House Republicans to support his 'big, beautiful bill,' a multitrillion-dollar package of tax breaks and spending cuts. Conservatives demand steeper cuts to federal programs, while lawmakers from high-tax states seek larger tax breaks for their constituents. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the bill would add $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Democrats criticize the bill as a giveaway to the wealthy at the expense of essential programs.</p>

However, Britain had to allow European trawlers to fish in its waters for 12 years and grant greater access to American agricultural products.

They also called for Hamas to release the remaining hostages taken in the October 7, 2023, attack. Netanyahu responded by accusing the leaders of offering a 'huge prize' for Hamas.</p>

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) lowered the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. This decision follows earlier moves by state-backed commercial lenders to reduce deposit rates, protecting their net interest margin.
