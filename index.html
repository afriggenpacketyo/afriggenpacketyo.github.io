          <p>Basel Adra, a Palestinian director who recently won an Oscar for the documentary "No Other Land," reported that Israeli soldiers raided his home in the West Bank. The raid occurred while he was at a hospital with relatives injured in an attack by Israeli settlers on his village. Adra stated that soldiers questioned his wife about his whereabouts and searched her phone while his infant daughter was present. He described the event as part of a system designed to intimidate and terrorize Palestinians who document settler violence in the region.</p>

This partnership is not seen as competition for Hong Kong but as a complementary relationship where Hainan's free trade port can be supported by Hong Kong's established world-class financial system and global connectivity. The collaboration aims to create a more competitive southern China region by linking Hainan's duty-free ecosystem with Hong Kong's high-end services, enhancing the appeal for international travelers and investors alike.

          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The attack, described as a "targeted" political assassination, occurred during an outdoor debate event. The investigation, which involved a massive manhunt and over 11,000 leads, was aided by the suspect's father, who recognized his son in photos and urged him to surrender. Investigators recovered a high-powered rifle and bullet casings with unusual inscriptions, though a motive has not yet been officially determined.</p>

          <p>Earl Richardson, the former president of Morgan State University, has passed away at the age of 81. He was a pivotal figure in a 15-year lawsuit against the state of Maryland that resulted in a historic $577 million settlement for four of the state's historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). The lawsuit argued that Maryland had systematically underfunded its Black colleges while developing similar programs at nearby predominantly white institutions. Richardson's relentless advocacy brought national attention to funding disparities for HBCUs and led to a period of significant growth and renewal at Morgan State, often called "Richardson's Renaissance."</p>

          <p>Following a severe drought that significantly reduced vessel transits, the Panama Canal Authority is launching major infrastructure projects to ensure future water security. The plans include constructing the Rio Indo dam to supplement the canal's freshwater supply and developing a land bridge with a natural gas pipeline to move commodities without relying on the waterway. These initiatives aim to mitigate the economic impact of climate change on the critical global trade route, which handles roughly $270 billion in cargo annually and is vital to U.S. commerce. The projects are not expected to be fully completed before the next anticipated El Niño event.</p>

          <p>The FBI has increased its reward to $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of a man believed to have fired a gun at federal officers during an immigration raid at a Camarillo cannabis farm. The incident occurred in July at a Glass House Farms facility, where the raid led to over 300 arrests and sparked chaotic protests. The FBI stated the man who allegedly fired the weapon appeared to be a protester. The raid and its aftermath, which included the death of one worker trying to evade capture, have shaken California's legal cannabis industry.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has described the recent incursion of Russian drones into Polish airspace as an "unacceptable and dangerous development." The incident prompted Poland to shoot down the drones, marking the first time a NATO member has fired on Russian targets during the Ukraine war. Rubio stated that while the drones were intentionally launched, it remains unclear if they were deliberately targeted to enter Poland. He added that if evidence proves the incursion was intentional, it would be considered a "highly escalatory move," and the U.S. is consulting with allies before making a final determination.</p>

          <p>Immigration lawyers and advocates are raising alarms that approximately 1,000 unaccompanied children from Central America, including dozens in California, are at risk of being deported before their court proceedings are complete. This concern follows a recent attempt to remove 76 Guatemalan children, which was halted by a federal judge's emergency order after they were already on a plane. The government is now believed to be expanding this effort to include children from Honduras and El Salvador, despite many facing threats of gang violence and abuse in their home countries.</p>

          <p>While authorities have identified 22-year-old Tyler Robinson as the suspect in the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, his motive remains unclear, fueling intense political debate. Utah's governor stated that investigators believe Robinson was "deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology," but did not provide specific evidence for this conclusion. In the absence of a clear motive, public discourse has focused on political polarization, with some conservatives blaming liberal rhetoric while others have noted the suspect's seemingly stable family background, complicating simple narratives about his radicalization.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has sparked widespread online reaction, highlighting the volatile state of American political discourse. A panel on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" discussed the recurring pattern seen after acts of political violence, where there is an immediate sense of regret and calls to de-escalate rhetoric from both sides of the aisle. However, the panelists noted that these reactions are often fleeting and do not lead to enduring changes in the political climate. The discussion explored how Kirk's death exposes the deep divisions and the charged nature of contemporary political engagement in the United States.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer personally questioned Lord Peter Mandelson about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before appointing him as the UK's ambassador to the US. It is understood that after initial vetting flagged the connection, Starmer's chief of staff sent Mandelson three specific questions via email regarding his continued contact with Epstein after his conviction. Mandelson was dismissed from the post this week after newly surfaced emails showed him sending supportive messages to Epstein. Downing Street sources suggest Mandelson was "economical with the truth" in his answers, which were initially deemed sufficient for his appointment.</p>

The FAA also found that a Boeing employee pressured an inspector to sign off on a non-compliant aircraft to meet delivery schedules.

A third bill, AB 715, aims to combat discrimination by creating a state Office for Civil Rights with specialized coordinators for issues like antisemitism and anti-LGBTQ+ bias.
