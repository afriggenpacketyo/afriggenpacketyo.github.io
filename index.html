          <p>The House GOP is pushing forward with President Trump's budget package, facing divisions over Medicaid and tax cuts. Three committees voted to advance key parts of the bill, including changes to Medicaid, food stamps, and tax provisions. Republicans are struggling to reach a consensus on the state and local tax deduction (SALT) cap, with blue state representatives seeking an increase. The Energy and Commerce Committee debated Medicaid cuts, while the Agriculture Committee considered changes to food stamp eligibility, and the House aims to vote on the bill next week, though Senate approval remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Following Trump's offer of refugee status, a debate is ongoing about whether Afrikaners want to leave South Africa for the US, some white South Africans have embraced the offer, while others are committed to staying and contributing to their home country. Some see themselves as a persecuted minority, while others believe that South Africa is their home and are determined to contribute to its success. Despite claims of systematic targeting, crime statistics paint a different picture.</p>

The brothers, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, claimed they acted in self-defense due to alleged abuse. A judge's decision to strike the special circumstance opens the door for parole hearings, with the case potentially going to the California Board of Parole Hearings and then the governor's office.</p>
