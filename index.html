          <p>Two sisters from Wales are struggling with feelings of anxiety and distrust after their mother and grandfather were convicted of defrauding them of their £50,000 inheritance, left to them by their grandmother in a trust fund. The sisters, Gemma and Jessica Thomas, described their mother, Katherine Hill, as having been their best friend before the incident, and expressed their shock and disbelief at her actions, which included emptying the trust fund account over a year. They also recounted signs of extravagance from Hill and her partner prior to the discovery, and the sisters said that they are grateful for the support of their father, Chris Thomas, who helped them fight to have their case heard in court. The experience has deeply affected their ability to trust others, and they are now trying to move forward. Optimism score does not apply.</p>

          <p>Italy is holding a referendum on shortening the waiting period for citizenship from 10 to 5 years, a move supported by civil society groups but boycotted by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who deems the current law "excellent." The referendum aims to integrate long-term foreign residents who contribute to the country's economy, but requires a 50% voter turnout to be valid, with Meloni's allies urging abstention. Activists like Sonny Olumati, born and raised in Italy but still denied citizenship, highlight the practical implications, such as job limitations and bureaucratic hurdles, and the broader issue of racial discrimination. The debate underscores sensitive questions about national identity and immigration policy in Italy, and the referendum is a test of public sentiment.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has indicated a willingness to engage in dialogue regarding rare earth export controls and has approved some export applications, signaling a potential easing of trade tensions with the United States. The ministry acknowledged the growing global demand for medium and heavy rare earths in sectors like robotics and new energy vehicles, and affirmed China's commitment to meeting legitimate civilian needs while strengthening compliance review processes. This development comes as Vice-Premier He Lifeng is expected to attend the first meeting of the US-China bilateral economic and trade consultation mechanism in London, where rare earths are anticipated to be a key discussion point.

          <p>Mauricio Pochettino, currently the United States head coach, has dismissed speculation linking him with a return to Tottenham following the sacking of Ange Postecoglou. Despite previously managing Tottenham for five years, Pochettino stated that a return is "not realistic" given his current position. Postecoglou was sacked despite leading the club to their first piece of silverware in 17 years with victory in the Europa League. Pochettino was appointed US manager in October 2024, and says he is happy in his new role.</p>

The decision to spend an additional £15 billion on nuclear warheads is seen as a continuation of a redundant and immoral deterrence policy that Britain can ill afford. This move sends a cynical signal to other nations and increases the risk of tactical nukes being deployed, and gradual disarmament is the only way to escape this nightmare.

The nanowire implants convert visible light and infrared radiation into electrical signals, bypassing damaged photoreceptor cells. The advance, led by Wang Shuiyuan at Fudan University, offers significant promise for treating human blindness, and tellurium is a byproduct of copper refining.

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles under Title 10 has sparked legal debate, with experts questioning the authority to federalize the Guard without the governor's request.

The move has raised concerns about the potential violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the use of the military for domestic law enforcement, and legal challenges are expected regarding the scope of presidential authority in these circumstances.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong (HKU), found that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. The drastic decline in fertility rates is especially urgent in countries “getting old before getting rich,” and China's overall fertility rate is estimated at 1.1 children per woman, well below the level needed for a population to sustain itself. The study also found that traditional expectations that place the burden on women persist in China and other East Asian countries.</p>
