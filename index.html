            <p>The death toll in attacks in Nigeria's Benue state has risen to 56, significantly higher than the previously reported 17. Benue state Governor Hyacinth Alia visited the affected villages and attributed the attacks to suspected herdsmen. Clashes between nomadic cattle herders and settled farmers over land use have become increasingly common in central Nigeria, often taking on a religious dimension. Amnesty International has criticized the Nigerian government for failing to stem the violence.</p>
