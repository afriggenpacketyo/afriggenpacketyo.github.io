          <p>A significant portion of the M60 motorway near Stockport, UK, remains closed for a second day following a severe eight-vehicle crash. The collision involved three lorries, one of which crossed the central reservation, leading to a shed load of beer barrels and a large diesel spill across both carriageways. National Highways is conducting emergency resurfacing work and extensive repairs, causing significant travel disruption. Three people were hospitalized, and six others were treated for minor injuries at the scene.</p>

          <p>Research teams in China have made notable advancements in optical chip technology, which uses light instead of electrons for data transfer, potentially accelerating the development of powerful artificial intelligence. One recent development, known as Meteor-1, reportedly demonstrates a hundred-fold increase in computability by utilizing a high number of light channels for parallel processing. While some experts note the underlying theories are not new, the hardware implementation represents a significant engineering achievement that could help overcome the physical limitations of traditional electronic chips.</p>

          <p>Lord Norman Tebbit, a prominent and often polarizing cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher, has passed away at the age of 94. A staunch Thatcher ally, he was known for implementing laws to reduce trade union power and for his controversial "cricket test" to gauge immigrants' loyalty. In 1984, he and his wife were severely injured in the IRA's Brighton hotel bombing, an event that left his wife permanently disabled. His political career was marked by a tough, uncompromising style that defined an era of British politics.</p>

          <p>The public inquiry into the UK's Post Office scandal is set to release the first part of its final report, focusing on the human toll and victim compensation. The scandal saw thousands of sub-postmasters wrongly accused of theft due to a faulty IT system called Horizon, leading to wrongful prosecutions, financial ruin, and imprisonment for many. While this report is expected to be damning about the victims' treatment, the section assigning blame for the miscarriage of justice will not be published until a later date. Victims hope the findings will accelerate the process for full and fair compensation.</p>

          <p>Fast-fashion giant Shein has reportedly filed confidentially for an initial public offering in Hong Kong, a move seen as an attempt to pressure UK regulators who have delayed approving its London listing. The company's London IPO has been stalled for months due to disagreements between UK and Chinese regulators over risk disclosures, particularly concerning its supply chain in the Xinjiang region. This strategic shift to Hong Kong comes as Shein faces mounting scrutiny in the West over its business practices and alleged human rights issues, making its path to a public listing increasingly complex.

          <p>Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki volcano has erupted again, sending a massive ash cloud 18 kilometers (11 miles) into the sky and triggering further evacuations. The eruption, one of the volcano's most powerful in months, has prompted authorities to raise the alert to its highest level and expand the exclusion zone. More than 4,000 people have been evacuated, and dozens of flights to the nearby resort island of Bali were cancelled due to the ash. Authorities are also warning of potential lahar floods if the area experiences heavy rain.</p>

          <p>Key Asian allies of the United States, including Japan and South Korea, have responded with "regret" to President Trump's latest tariff threats but have vowed to continue negotiations to avoid the steep duties. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called the announcement "truly regrettable," while South Korean officials pledged to accelerate talks to resolve trade uncertainties. Other nations like Thailand and Malaysia, also facing new tariff rates, expressed surprise but remained hopeful that engagement with the U.S. could lead to a more favorable outcome before the August 1 deadline.

          <p>Yorkshire Water has announced a hosepipe ban for its five million customers, the first such restriction in the UK this year, due to a record-breaking dry and warm spring. Reservoir levels in the region have fallen to just over 50% capacity, a record low for this time of year, prompting the need for water conservation measures. The ban prohibits activities like watering gardens and washing cars with a hosepipe and will remain in place until significant rainfall replenishes supplies. The move raises long-term questions about water supply resilience amid climate change and population growth.</p>

          <p>A new formulation of a malaria treatment, specifically designed for babies and young children weighing under 4.5kg (10lbs), has been approved for use. Previously, the youngest infants were treated with adjusted doses of drugs made for older children, creating a risk of overdose and a significant "treatment gap." This new medicine, Coartem Baby, was developed by Novartis and the Medicines for Malaria Venture and is expected to be rolled out in African countries within weeks. The breakthrough is a major step in protecting the most vulnerable population from one of the world's deadliest diseases.</p>

This admission, revealed in court filings, contradicts the U.S. government's public stance that it is powerless over the men because they are outside its jurisdiction. The revelation is a significant development in the legal challenges against the controversial deal, under which the U.S. paid El Salvador to house the migrants in its notorious CECOT mega-prison.</p>

          <p>A significant number of Oasis fans were left "gutted" and "angry" after paying hundreds of pounds for concert tickets in Cardiff that they never received. The victims allege that a Pembrokeshire-based business owner sold them tickets for a private box that did not exist, affecting potentially as many as 100 people. Many victims trusted the seller due to previous legitimate dealings for other events. After the seller failed to appear at the stadium as promised, it became clear through social media that many others had been similarly defrauded, prompting a police investigation.</p>

The families of the victims have issued a statement demanding "real change" to ensure such a tragedy never happens again. The attacker was sentenced to life in prison earlier this year.</p>

The visit, the first by an EU head of state since Brexit, symbolizes an effort to reset UK-France relations and tackle shared challenges, particularly the politically sensitive issue of illegal migration.</p>

The article also warned other nations, like Vietnam, against striking deals with the U.S. that are designed to cut China out of supply chains, stating that it would "respond resolutely" to any such agreements.
