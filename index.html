          <p>Chinese quantitative hedge funds are capitalizing on stricter US visa policies and academic funding cuts to recruit top-tier talent. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are offering competitive salaries to attract PhDs and engineers who might have previously stayed in the US. This influx of expertise is intended to fuel the expansion of China's rapidly growing quant sector and enhance its use of artificial intelligence in the world's second-largest market. The trend highlights a shift in the global competition for financial and technological brainpower. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Voters in Taiwan are participating in a significant recall election targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party. The referendum could potentially restore a parliamentary majority for President Lai Ching-te's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which it lost in the 2024 elections. The recall effort was initiated by civic groups after KMT lawmakers, in alliance with the Taiwan People's Party, obstructed government agendas and pushed for controversial parliamentary reforms. The outcome of this historic vote is being closely watched amid accusations of Chinese interference.</p>

          <p>Officials have confirmed that one of two grenades recovered from a Santa Monica garage is missing following a deadly explosion that killed three Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies. The blast occurred at a training facility after deputies, believing the devices were inert, stored them overnight. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is leading the search for the second grenade, which investigators believe was also transported to the facility. In response to the tragedy, the department has updated its policies to treat all explosive devices as live.</p>

          <p>Two Democratic congressmen, Ro Khanna and Robert Garcia, have sent a formal letter to the attorneys of Jeffrey Epstein's estate requesting an unredacted copy of a "birthday book." The book, reportedly compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell, is said to contain messages from prominent figures, including a crude poem allegedly from Donald Trump. The lawmakers argue the book's contents are essential for congressional oversight regarding the handling of the Epstein investigation and the subsequent release of related files. This request amplifies the political pressure surrounding the case and its connections to powerful individuals.</p>

          <p>Heavy fighting along the border between Thailand and Cambodia has resulted in at least 32 deaths and forced tens of thousands of civilians to flee their homes. The conflict, which erupted over a long-running border dispute, has prompted an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council and calls for de-escalation. Malaysia, as the chair of the regional ASEAN bloc, has offered to mediate the dispute, urging both nations to cease hostilities and find a peaceful resolution. The clashes represent a rare instance of armed confrontation between ASEAN member states.</p>

          <p>Despite CEO Elon Musk's plans to expand Tesla's robotaxi service, California regulators have stated the company is not authorized to operate autonomous vehicles for public transport without a human driver. The California Public Utilities Commission clarified that Tesla's current permit only allows for a charter-party carrier service, similar to a limousine company, which requires a driver to be in control at all times. This regulatory stance presents a significant hurdle for Tesla's ambitions to launch a fully autonomous ride-hailing network in the state, confining its immediate plans to a service with drivers.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami's owner, Jorge Mas, has publicly criticized Major League Soccer for its "draconian" decision to suspend star players Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba for one game. The suspension was enforced because both players missed the MLS All-Star game, a league rule for unapproved absences. Mas argued that the club made the decision for the players to rest and that the punishment is not understood by them. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged Messi's importance to the league but stated the long-standing policy had to be enforced, though it will be reevaluated.</p>

The abundance of aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, has been particularly noticeable, according to the Royal Horticultural Society. While the warm conditions have benefited many species this year, experts caution that a relative lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year. This year's boom contrasts with 2024's "butterfly emergency," which followed a cool, wet season.</p>

It showcases how the anti-Communist fervor ruined careers, compelled individuals to "name names," and extended beyond Hollywood to affect many ordinary Americans.

          <p>A scientific revolution is taking place in women's sport, moving away from treating female athletes as "mini-men" to researching their unique physiology. Scientists are studying how factors like breast movement can affect performance, highlighting the importance of properly fitted sports bras which can improve stride length. Research is also delving into how the menstrual cycle impacts performance and anxiety, and why female athletes have a higher risk for certain injuries like ACL tears. This growing field aims to improve performance, health, and safety for female athletes at all levels.</p>

          <p>An asteroid named 2024 YR4, which was once considered a risk to Earth, may now be on a collision course with the moon for late 2032. While an Earth impact has been ruled out, scientists are studying the potential effects of a lunar strike from the 200-foot-diameter space rock. Such an event could create a visible flash and a large crater, sending lunar debris toward Earth. While not dangerous to people on the ground, this high-speed debris could pose a significant risk to satellites crucial for global communications and navigation, expanding the scope of planetary defense.</p>

          <p>Aid experts have raised concerns about the nutritional value of food boxes being distributed in Gaza by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). While the boxes contain items like pasta, lentils, and flour, an analysis suggests they are deficient in essential vitamins and minerals. One expert described the aid as providing a "full stomach but an empty diet," which could lead to "hidden hunger" and diseases like anemia and scurvy over time. The report highlights the challenge of providing adequate nutrition in a crisis zone where access to fresh food, clean water, and cooking fuel is severely limited.</p>

The "Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt" program has existed for decades, accepting payments through various means, but the addition of Venmo offers a modern, convenient option. With the national debt exceeding $36 trillion, the initiative provides a direct, albeit small-scale, way for patriotic or concerned citizens to contribute. Since 1996, Americans have voluntarily contributed over $67 million to the cause through this program.</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years after "Big Brother" first aired, some psychologists and social experts are suggesting that reality television may have positive effects on society. The genre has historically been more demographically diverse than other media, offering viewers a glimpse into different social landscapes and fostering greater understanding. By showcasing raw emotions and difficult conversations on topics like health, disability, and relationships, these programs can make people feel less isolated and even prompt valuable societal discussions. Despite valid criticisms about contestant welfare, some research suggests reality TV can positively influence viewer behavior and social awareness.</p>
