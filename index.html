          <p>Senator Chuck Grassley has revealed that the FBI's 2022 election-related investigation into Donald Trump, codenamed 'Arctic Frost,' also targeted numerous other Republican-affiliated entities. Documents show that subpoenas were issued to groups including Turning Point USA, founded by the recently assassinated activist Charlie Kirk, and the Republican Attorneys General Association. Grassley asserted that the investigation's broad scope suggests it was a partisan effort to improperly investigate the entire Republican political apparatus. The revelation adds another layer of political complexity to the ongoing discussions surrounding federal law enforcement and political impartiality.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah Valley University event, has been formally charged with aggravated murder and other offenses. Utah County prosecutors have announced their intention to seek the death penalty in the case, describing Kirk's death as a significant American tragedy. The investigation is ongoing, with federal authorities examining Robinson's digital footprint, including messages on the platform Discord where he allegedly admitted to the shooting. Officials are exploring the motive, with President Trump and others suggesting Robinson was radicalized online by leftist ideology.</p>

          <p>Sources have confirmed that Tyler Robinson, the suspect in the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, appeared to confess to the shooting on the messaging platform Discord. In a message to friends, an account allegedly belonging to Robinson stated, "It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this." The messages were reportedly sent hours before his arrest, following a day-long manhunt. FBI Director Kash Patel stated that investigators will question everyone involved in the Discord chat group, which reportedly included more than 20 people. This digital evidence is a key component in the ongoing investigation to establish a motive.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's manager, Arne Slot, has pushed back against criticism from pundits regarding the club's £450 million expenditure on eight new players during the summer transfer window. He highlighted that the significant spending was offset by over £250 million generated from player sales, arguing it was a necessary investment to strengthen the squad. Slot defended the club's strategy of signing younger players, like the record £125 million striker Alexander Isak, who are under 25 but ready to compete at a high level. He believes the club deserves praise for its self-sustaining business model and forward-thinking recruitment policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby stated that his company's aggressive expansion is succeeding because customers are choosing United for its superior product and network. While many rival airlines are scaling back growth plans due to an oversupply of flights, United is set to increase its domestic capacity by 5.7% in 2025, outpacing the industry average. Kirby attributes this success to investments in onboard amenities like Bluetooth connectivity and seat-back screens, which differentiate the airline from competitors.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many individuals may be inadvertently worsening their debt despite making regular payments, due to common but counterproductive financial habits. One major issue is the 'minimum payment trap,' where paying only the minimum on credit cards primarily covers interest, barely reducing the principal balance in a high-rate environment. Another pitfall is the overuse of 'buy now, pay later' plans, which can lead to a pile-up of small, unmanageable monthly obligations. Relying too heavily on balance transfers without addressing underlying spending habits can also perpetuate a cycle of debt, especially once promotional low-interest periods expire.</p>

Most recently, after a Russian drone incursion into Poland, Trump's administration conditioned new sanctions on the EU meeting what the article calls undoable demands, such as massive increases in U.S. gas imports.

          <p>President Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom comes at an awkward political moment for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who recently fired his US ambassador, Peter Mandelson. The dismissal was prompted by new revelations about Mandelson's past friendship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This has put the issue of Epstein's associates back in the headlines, potentially leading to unwanted questions for President Trump about his own past relationship with the financier. The situation adds a layer of tension to a visit intended to showcase the strength of the UK-US relationship, which is already set against a backdrop of growing political polarization in Britain.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Renewable Energy Remains Most Cost-Effective, Despite Policy Shifts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite political debates and shifting government policies, renewable energy sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar remain the cheapest forms of energy to produce in the U.S. An analysis using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark shows that even without subsidies, renewables are more cost-competitive than fossil fuels like coal and natural gas. While President Trump has enacted policies favoring oil and gas, and tariffs may increase costs for some renewable components, the fundamental economics still favor wind and solar due to their low operating expenses once built. Experts note that a diverse energy portfolio is necessary, but renewables lead on production cost.</p>

          <p>The 1979 disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz in New York City remains one of the nation's most haunting cold cases, having fundamentally changed how parents supervise their children. For decades, the investigation focused on suspect Jose Ramos but never yielded a criminal charge. The case saw a major turning point in 2012 when a tip led police to Pedro Hernandez, a former corner store worker who confessed to the crime. After a mistrial, Hernandez was convicted in a second trial in 2017, but a recent federal appeals court ruling stated he should receive a new trial, ensuring the long and painful legal saga is not yet over.</p>

          <p>During an emergency debate in Parliament, senior Labour MP Dame Emily Thornberry stated that 'red flags were missed or ignored' in the process of appointing Peter Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the US. Thornberry, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, said 'something went very wrong' given Lord Mandelson's known association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which ultimately led to his dismissal. The Foreign Office indicated that the initial due diligence was handled by the Cabinet Office, shifting scrutiny onto Prime Minister Keir Starmer's role in the decision. The appointment and subsequent sacking have been widely criticized across party lines.</p>

          <p>A proposed deal to remove the 25% tariff on UK steel exports to the United States has been put on hold indefinitely, delivering a blow to the British steel industry. While President Trump hinted at possible relief during his state visit, US officials have reportedly raised questions about the UK's production methods, delaying any agreement. The UK government maintains that its steel producers are still in a competitive position, as other countries face even higher tariffs of 50%. The development is a disappointment for the financially distressed industry, which had hoped for a swift resolution to provide certainty and protect jobs.</p>

In an interview, Van Hollen argued that despite heightened political tensions following the Charlie Kirk assassination, it is crucial not to give President Trump a 'blank check' for what he calls lawless activities, such as illegally withholding congressionally appropriated funds. He believes Republicans would bear the political blame for a shutdown, asserting that Democrats must stand firm to protect essential programs and push back against the administration's authoritarian impulses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The '6-month rule' is a critical component of reverse mortgages, dictating the timeline for heirs after the borrower passes away or permanently leaves the home. Lenders must issue a 'Due and Payable' letter, giving heirs six months to either repay the loan balance in full or sell the property to satisfy the debt. This rule primarily applies to federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). While extensions are possible, the tight timeline underscores the need for borrowers to engage in thorough estate planning and communicate clearly with their families to avoid a stressful situation or potential foreclosure on the family home.</p>

          <p>A majority of economists, fund managers, and strategists surveyed by CNBC believe President Donald Trump's actions toward the Federal Reserve are an attempt to limit or eliminate its independence. The survey found that 82% of respondents view the president's actions this way, with majorities predicting the pressure campaign will lead to negative economic outcomes. These consequences include weaker growth, higher inflation, and increased unemployment. The results highlight significant concern within the financial community that political interference in monetary policy could destabilize the economy and reduce the value of the U.S. dollar.

          <p>Following the death of actor Robert Redford at age 89, a scathing 2019 editorial he wrote for NBC News is being widely shared online. In the piece, Redford described the Trump administration as a 'dictator-like attack' on American values and lamented the country's transformation into the 'Divided States of America.' The viral resurgence of his critical words stands in contrast to President Trump's brief comments on his passing, in which he noted Redford 'was the hottest' for a time. The editorial's pointed criticism highlights the late actor's strong political convictions and adds a complex layer to remembrances of his legacy.</p>
