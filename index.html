          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [other person]?" as a highly damaging statement in relationships, arguing it fosters insecurity and feelings of inadequacy. The psychologist explains that the comparison itself, rather than the person mentioned, conveys the message that the partner is not good enough. The article suggests that this phrase is often a symptom of deeper issues, such as a fear of open communication about needs and frustrations. Instead of making comparisons, partners should strive to communicate their needs clearly and directly to foster a more secure and emotionally close relationship.</p>

          <p>President Trump signaled a willingness to lower tariffs on China, citing the current high levies as detrimental to trade between the two nations. Trump noted that tariffs, as high as 145 percent on Chinese imports, have led to a significant slowdown in business activity. He acknowledged economic challenges in China, including a contraction in factory activity, and expressed optimism that a fair deal could be reached. Trump reiterated that any agreement must be balanced and beneficial for the United States, indicating a potential shift in trade policy.</p>

          <p>According to a New York Times analysis, the Trump administration has canceled over $800 million in NIH grants related to LGBTQ health, impacting studies on cancers and sexually transmitted infections. The administration justified the cuts by stating that the research no longer aligns with agency priorities, citing concerns about gender identity and equity objectives. Scientists and researchers express concern that these cuts will harm vulnerable populations and undermine efforts to address critical health issues. The canceled projects include studies on HIV prevention, mental health, and other diseases disproportionately affecting LGBTQ individuals, raising questions about the administration's commitment to evidence-based science and inclusivity in healthcare.</p>

A developer in Dallas, Monte Anderson, has converted his own home into four studio apartments, highlighting the possibility of creating more housing units within existing neighborhoods. The article discusses how changing demographics and housing mismatches have led to older people living in large, empty homes while single adults seek smaller, more affordable options. Cities and states are increasingly encouraging these types of conversions to add housing without disrupting existing neighborhoods, offering a potential solution to the housing shortage.</p>

Figures such as Jamie Dimon and Tim Cook praised Buffett's integrity, wisdom, and commitment to investing in the growth of the nation. Buffett has led the company since 1965, and is credited by many with transforming Berkshire from a flailing textiles manufacturer into a $1.03tn conglomerate.</p>
