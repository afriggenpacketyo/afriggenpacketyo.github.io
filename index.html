          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Suspending Habeas Corpus for Migrants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 22:07:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House is actively exploring the possibility of suspending habeas corpus for migrants, a move that would curtail their right to challenge detention in court. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller justified this consideration by claiming the U.S. faces a national security threat due to undocumented migrants. Legal experts argue that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus, and a unilateral suspension by the President would be unconstitutional. The administration's decision hinges on whether courts align with their views on immigration matters, raising concerns about potential overreach of executive power.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have issued an annual quarantine on sport-harvested mussels due to the risk of naturally occurring toxins. The quarantine, effective through October 31, warns against eating mussels harvested along the California coastline. Biotoxins, such as paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid, can accumulate in mussels during this period. Consuming toxic shellfish can be deadly, and cooking does not reliably eliminate the toxins. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt from the quarantine.</p>
