          <p>An apparent Israeli raid on the Holy Family Catholic Church in Gaza City has resulted in the deaths of two people and multiple injuries, including to the parish priest, Father Gabriel Romanelli. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem confirmed the casualties and damage to the church, which was sheltering hundreds of displaced civilians, including both Christians and Muslims. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the attack on the civilian population as unacceptable. The Israel Defense Forces stated it is reviewing the circumstances of the incident, expressing regret for any harm caused to civilians or religious sites and promising a transparent investigation.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has signed 20-year-old Canadian forward Olivia Smith from Liverpool for a world-record fee of £1 million, making it the most expensive transfer in women's football history. Smith, who has signed a four-year contract, is considered one of the sport's most promising young talents, known for her pace and direct attacking style. The deal surpasses the previous record set by Chelsea's signing of Naomi Girma. For Liverpool, the sale represents significant profit and includes a sell-on clause, with the funds intended for strengthening their squad in multiple areas. Smith's impressive career includes a successful season at Liverpool and accolades at the international level with Canada.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 07:00:16 EDT</div>

          <p>A senior executive at Meituan has described the escalating price war in China's instant delivery sector as an "irrational competition" that is detached from business fundamentals. Wang Puzhong, head of Meituan's local commerce, stated the company felt compelled to participate in the discount battle against rivals JD.com and Alibaba to avoid being perceived as a loser. The conflict has intensified as all three tech giants offer substantial subsidies to capture market share, expanding from food delivery to on-demand groceries. Wang expressed concern that the aggressive subsidy programs, including a 50 billion yuan pledge from Alibaba, will lead to significant financial losses for all competitors involved.</p>

          <p>Once seen as a novelty, foldable smartphones are becoming a viable alternative to the standard slab design that has dominated the market for over a decade. This article explores the growing appeal of devices like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7, which offer adaptable screen sizes for different tasks, evoking the nostalgia of older flip phones. While some tech leaders predict a future of AI pins and augmented reality glasses, the smartphone remains the central gadget for the foreseeable future. Foldables represent a significant innovation, offering a bridge between current technology and future concepts by providing users with more control over their screen time and immersion.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man was killed and fourteen other people were injured after a lightning strike occurred at an outdoor archery range in Jackson Township, New Jersey. The incident happened during a children's archery competition, with the youngest victim being seven years old. According to an instructor, the strike happened unexpectedly as there were no signs of a storm. The deceased, Robert Montgomery, was a volunteer club member who was performing CPR on when first responders arrived. This marks the third serious lightning-related incident in the Tri-State Area in the past month, highlighting the unpredictable danger of such weather events.</p>

However, overall volume fell, with a 1% shrink in its North American food division and a 2% drop in its domestic drinks segment. To counter this, PepsiCo is focusing on cost-cutting measures, improving profit margins, and targeting growth areas like protein-based products and multicultural offerings, while reiterating its full-year financial outlook.

          <p>Despite growing public and political pressure, the full investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein are unlikely to be released by the Department of Justice under Attorney General Pam Bondi. This article explains that a long-standing DOJ policy prevents the release of closed investigative files simply due to public interest, a principle meant to protect uncharged individuals. Bondi's previous conflicting statements, including a claim that a "client list" was on her desk, have fueled confusion and conspiracy theories. Legal expert Elie Honig suggests the administration's sudden reversal, citing an FBI memo that there is nothing more to release, may be driven by political calculations or the potential for embarrassing revelations about powerful figures, including President Trump.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly criticized his own supporters, labeling them "weaklings" for believing what he calls a "radical left" hoax regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. This rare break with his base comes as many of his followers demand more transparency from his administration about the investigation into the deceased sex offender. The controversy has been fueled by Attorney General Pam Bondi's conflicting statements about a supposed "client list." Trump's dismissal of his supporters' concerns marks a significant moment, as he typically relies on stoking such theories but is now trying to quell one that could reflect poorly on his own past associations and his administration's handling of the case.</p>

Gillis also made a contentious joke about WNBA star Caitlin Clark and referenced the supposed deletion of an Epstein-related joke from his script.

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Justice is showing signs of shifting its focus away from prosecuting white-collar crime, a move that contrasts with its tough rhetoric on other types of offenses. This article notes that President Trump has paused enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has pardoned numerous financial fraudsters since taking office. Federal prosecutions for white-collar crimes have declined over 10% compared to last year. Critics suggest this approach creates a favorable environment for corporate misconduct and that enforcement actions are becoming politicized, targeting opponents while giving allies and major corporations a pass, potentially undermining the rule of law.</p>

These indicators have increased speculation that the Bank of England may cut interest rates next month to stimulate the economy.

          <p>Consumer advocates are raising concerns that the Trump administration's overhaul of the federal student loan system will leave many borrowers without affordable payment plans. The Biden-era SAVE plan is now defunct, and President Trump's new legislation phases out several other income-driven repayment options, replacing them with a single, less generous plan. Experts calculate that monthly payments under the new Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP) could be more than double what they were under SAVE for the same income level. This shift is expected to increase the financial strain on millions of Americans, raising the risk of widespread defaults. (not investment advice)</p>

The move to withdraw the whip from the four MPs, who will now sit as independents, is seen by many as a message from the party leadership to enforce loyalty, particularly among the new 2024 intake of MPs.

          <p>China has officially enacted export restrictions on eight key technologies related to the manufacturing of electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Under the new rules, companies must now obtain government licenses before transferring these technologies abroad. The restrictions primarily cover critical technologies for producing battery cathodes, such as those for LFP and LMFP precursors, which determine a battery's energy density and lifespan. Also included are five technologies for lithium extraction and processing. This move is seen as an effort by Beijing to maintain its dominance in the global EV supply chain by controlling access to its advanced manufacturing know-how.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores the paradoxical idea that President Donald Trump may be uniquely positioned to pressure the Israeli government to end its brutal campaign in Gaza. The author, Kenneth Roth, argues that Trump is less susceptible to traditional political pressure from pro-Israel lobby groups than other presidents. Given his transactional nature and immense ego, Trump could be persuaded to seek a resolution to the conflict in pursuit of a Nobel Peace Prize or to avoid the appearance of being played by Prime Minister Netanyahu. While Trump has largely supported Israel's actions, his fickle nature and focus on self-interest could, if leveraged correctly, present an unexpected opportunity for a constructive turn.</p>

Bove's nomination has been met with strong opposition from former prosecutors and judges, and he faces allegations of unethical conduct from a DOJ whistleblower. The whistleblower claims Bove pushed for dropping a prosecution against NYC Mayor Eric Adams in a quid pro quo and suggested ignoring court orders on immigration. Despite the controversy, Bove appears to have enough Republican support to clear the committee, though his confirmation by the full Senate remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A three-way debate is shaping the future of the Democratic Party, with different factions offering competing visions for its agenda and strategy. The party establishment is attempting to rebrand with a new policy project, while being challenged from two directions. The "Abundance" faction argues for a focus on cutting red tape to build more housing and clean energy, recently scoring a win in California. In contrast, the invigorated left, led by figures like Zohran Mamdani, advocates for sweeping policies like rent freezes and free public services. This internal struggle over policy, governance, and influence will likely define the party's direction heading toward the 2028 election.</p>

          <p>Despite an initial record that encouraged union advocates, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer is now facing sharp criticism for undermining worker protections under the Trump administration. This article details how her department has moved to slash its own budget, cease enforcement of a rule protecting workers from being misclassified as contractors, and rescind 63 regulations, two-thirds of which relate to health and safety. These actions, which include weakening standards for respirator use and narrowing safety requirements for dangerous professions, align with the anti-labor policies of Trump's first term. Worker advocates fear this is just the beginning of a broader deregulation effort at the expense of workers' well-being.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Givhan's latest novel, "Salt Bones," is lauded in this review as a triumphant and masterful blend of horror, mystery, and literary fiction. Set in a fictional town near the Salton Sea, the story follows a mother, Mal, whose past trauma is reignited when a young woman disappears, echoing the vanishing of her own sister two decades earlier. The reviewer praises Givhan's use of magical realism, including the folkloric figure La Siguanaba, and her skillful weaving of multiple perspectives to build a propulsive and haunting narrative. The novel is described as a powerful exploration of a community haunted by its history, infused with strong Mexican American and Indigenous culture.</p>

          <p>Ari Aster's new film "Eddington" is praised in this review as a brilliant, if bleak, social satire set in a small New Mexico town during the early COVID-19 pandemic. The movie stars Joaquin Phoenix as a local sheriff and Pedro Pascal as the mayor, whose rivalry is set against a backdrop of conspiracy theories, social media-induced brain sickness, and societal breakdown. The reviewer highlights the film's bitterly funny dialogue, sharp visual gags, and its unflinching portrayal of a lonely, divided America where every character seeks connection and correctness. While some plot points may not fully land, the film is described as a hysterical, humanistic, and culpability-inducing group therapy session for a fractured nation.</p>

The move comes as the federal government cuts funding for LGBTQ+ counselors at the national 9-8-8 suicide lifeline, a decision critics fear will harm vulnerable populations.

          <p>Despite President Trump's focus on trade imbalances, American automakers face a fundamental challenge in Asian markets like Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam: their products are often not what local consumers want. This analysis argues that the issue goes beyond tariffs and regulations to a core product mismatch. American cars are frequently seen as too large, expensive, and fuel-inefficient for Asia's congested cities, smaller parking spaces, and price-sensitive consumers. While European and Japanese brands have adapted their offerings, U.S. companies have been slower to cater to local tastes, leading to persistently low sales figures even in markets with few trade barriers.</p>

Spencer, who died in 2022, used his American Patrol website to spread fear about a supposed Mexican invasion and demonize Latinos.

Given California's status as America's largest EV market and a hub for automotive R&D, the state is uniquely positioned to fill the void.

The author contends that the 1910 law, which prohibits transporting individuals across state lines for prostitution, is an archaic and overly broad statute with a racist and xenophobic history. It allows for excessive penalties and gives prosecutors a tool for selective enforcement, often when they struggle to secure convictions on more serious charges.

Another critical area is the flank, where England's Alex Greenwood will need to contain the dangerous dribbling of Sweden's Johanna Rytting Kaneryd. Finally, the midfield clash is examined, with Sweden's creative players like Kosovare Asllani and Filippa Angeldal facing off against England's balanced trio of Georgia Stanway, Ella Toone, and Keira Walsh in a high-stakes encounter.</p>
