          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will make a rare foreign visit to Beijing to attend China's "Victory Day" military parade alongside Russia's Vladimir Putin and 26 other heads of state, marking a significant diplomatic event for Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The parade, commemorating the 80th anniversary of Japan's World War Two surrender, will showcase China's latest weaponry and new military force structure. This gathering allows Xi to assert his influence over both Kim and Putin amid US President Donald Trump's attempts to broker a peace deal in Ukraine and a potential visit to Asia. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has also been invited, presenting a complex diplomatic dilemma regarding potential North-South Korean engagement.</p>

          <p>Chinese retail stock traders are experiencing a significant bull run, with some individuals reporting over 30% returns this year and anticipating further gains through early next year. This optimism is largely fueled by a government pledge to stabilize the stock market amidst a challenging economic environment, aiming to create a "wealth effect" that could stimulate consumption. Traders are strategically concentrating their equity exposure in high-beta sectors such as new-consumer, consumer-electronics, software, and hardware companies. The expectation is that continued government intervention and ample liquidity will sustain this upward market trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $950 million for Saturday night's drawing after no ticket matched the winning numbers for Wednesday's $850 million prize. This makes it the game's sixth-largest jackpot ever, with an estimated cash value of $428.9 million before taxes. Ticket sales have doubled, contributing to the growing prize and supporting good causes in communities. A single winner could choose between a lump sum payment or an annuity over 29 years. The odds of winning the top prize remain 1 in 292.2 million, as the excitement for the massive payout continues to build.</p>

The activists, affiliated with "No Azure for Apartheid," demanded Microsoft end its support for Israel, with Smith claiming they blocked access and planted listening devices. This incident follows earlier protests and arrests on Microsoft's campus, prompting a third-party investigation into the use of its technology in surveillance. The company is cooperating with law enforcement as it continues to investigate these disruptions.</p>

          <p>South Korea's central bank held its policy rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, prioritizing assessment of housing prices and household debt despite modest economic improvement. The Bank of Korea upgraded its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 0.9% and its inflation forecast to 2%, noting a modest recovery in domestic demand supported by a supplementary budget and improved consumer sentiment. Exports are expected to show favorable movements but may slow due to expanding US tariffs.

          <p>The 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's brutal murder is being commemorated with a symbolic train ride from Chicago to Mississippi, retracing his fateful 1955 journey. Among the passengers are Till's cousin, Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr., the last surviving eyewitness, and Juliet Louis, widow of a key trial witness. Till, a 14-year-old Black boy, was lynched after allegedly whistling at a white woman, and his mother's decision for an open-casket funeral ignited the modern Civil Rights Movement. The journey serves as a powerful reminder of racial injustice and the progress made, while also acknowledging the ongoing need for healing in America.</p>

          <p>Florida is employing an innovative strategy to control invasive Burmese pythons in the Everglades by deploying 120 robot rabbits designed to mimic their prey. These solar-powered robots emit heat, smell, and make natural movements to lure the voracious snakes, which have decimated native mammal populations by up to 95%. Monitored by video cameras, the robots alert contractors when a python is detected for removal. Costing about $4,000 each, this experiment follows less successful attempts with live rabbits. While still in its early stages, officials are optimistic about the project's potential to significantly reduce the python population.</p>

          <p>Europe is enduring its worst wildfire season on record, with over one million hectares burned across the EU this year, particularly devastating Spain and Portugal. Roughly 1% of the Iberian Peninsula has been scorched, a figure six times the Spanish average for this period. Experts link the worsening fires directly to climate change, which creates hotter, drier conditions, and warn of future increases. The fires also release record levels of CO2, contributing to a climate feedback loop. Rural depopulation and abandoned agricultural land exacerbate the problem by increasing flammable vegetation, straining firefighting efforts despite significant EU deployment.</p>

The breach has halted several state services, including DMV operations, and temporarily disrupted law enforcement access to records and dispatch lines. Cybersecurity experts highlight the increasing vulnerability of state and local governments to such attacks, citing numerous incidents across the US resulting in significant downtime and financial losses. The ongoing investigation and meticulous process of bringing systems back online underscore the critical need for enhanced cyber defenses and inter-state information sharing.</p>

          <p>Denmark's foreign minister summoned the top U.S. diplomat in Copenhagen for talks following a report by public broadcaster DR alleging that individuals connected to President Trump are conducting covert influence operations in Greenland. The report suggests these operations aim to weaken Greenland's ties with Denmark and support a potential secession movement, with sources indicating efforts to compile lists of citizens for and against Trump's overtures. While a White House official responded by saying "the Danes need to calm down," Denmark's foreign minister stated that any interference in the kingdom's internal affairs is unacceptable, underscoring diplomatic tensions over the Arctic territory.</p>

          <p>Taylor Townsend and Jelena Ostapenko were involved in a heated exchange at the net following Townsend's victory at the US Open. Ostapenko accused Townsend of being disrespectful for not apologizing after a net ball during a crucial moment and for violating warm-up rules. Townsend, in turn, stated Ostapenko insulted her, saying she had "no class, no education," and threatened her outside the US. While Townsend, who is Black, did not attribute racial undertones to the comments, she acknowledged the historical stigma. Ostapenko later denied any allegations of racism, attributing the dispute to the intensity of competition.</p>

          <p>A new NATO report reveals that all member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of GDP this year, largely due to increased military spending since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and demands from US President Donald Trump. However, only three nations—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently achieving the new, higher goal of 3.5%. While the US contributes the most in absolute terms, its spending is 3.22% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed the increased spending but stressed the importance of converting funds into genuine military capability for effective deterrence.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted Jose de Jesus Ortega and Danielle Nadine Davila, two employees at an Ontario surgery center, on felony charges of assaulting and interfering with US immigration officers. The incident occurred when landscapers, allegedly unauthorized immigrants, sought refuge in the facility during an ICE raid. Court documents state the medical staffers physically obstructed agents attempting to detain the individuals, with one staffer grabbing an officer's arm and vest.

          <p>The deployment of the National Guard and federal law enforcement, including ICE agents, in Washington D.C. under President Trump's "law and order" agenda is escalating tensions and creating an "edgy" mood in the capital. While the troops are a visual display of power, the real impact is seen in increased immigration raids, where federal agents detain individuals based on their inability to prove legal status on demand. Locals are reacting with anger and protests, viewing these actions as an unprecedented extension of presidential authority and an occupation of their neighborhoods. The situation is described as "creeping towards a tipping point," raising concerns about divisiveness if similar tactics are applied nationwide.</p>
