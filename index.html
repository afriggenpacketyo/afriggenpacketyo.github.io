          <p>The Co-op Group has disclosed that a significant cyber-attack earlier this year resulted in at least £206 million in lost revenue, contributing to a £75 million pre-tax loss for the first half of 2025. The breach disrupted payments, caused widespread product shortages, and led to the theft of data from all 6.5 million of its members. While the company's CEO praised the business's response, the full financial impact is still unfolding amid a challenging retail environment. The incident highlights a growing pattern of cyber threats against major UK businesses.</p>

          <p>A surge in demand and rising NHS rejections for specialist wheelchairs has created a 'national crisis' for disabled children in the UK, forcing the leading charity Whizz Kids to halt new referrals for the first time in its history. Thousands of children are waiting months for essential mobility equipment, with many living in pain or confinement due to inadequate NHS funding and strict eligibility criteria. Families describe the charity's services as a vital lifeline, not a luxury, as they face systemic failures in statutory support.</p>

Retail was a notable exception, buoyed by a surge in H&M shares after a strong earnings report. Meanwhile, German consumer confidence showed signs of stabilizing, but experts warned that the overall economic climate remains at a very low level due to geopolitical and inflationary concerns.

          <p>The parliament of Kyrgyzstan has voted to dissolve itself and hold a snap election on November 30, a move analysts believe is designed to consolidate the power of President Sadyr Japarov. Lawmakers officially argued the decision was to avoid the financial burden of holding parliamentary and presidential elections close together. Since rising to power in 2020, Japarov has overseen a crackdown on independent media and dissent, shifting the country's politics toward a more authoritarian model seen in neighboring states.</p>

          <p>A Paris court is set to deliver its verdict in the trial of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is accused of illegally financing his 2007 presidential campaign with funds from the government of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Sarkozy, who denies all charges and claims the case is a politically motivated 'plot,' faces a potential seven-year prison sentence if convicted. This trial is one of several legal battles that have tarnished his legacy, though he remains an influential figure in French politics.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, has stated that Labour MPs have privately encouraged him to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for the party leadership.

Burnham criticized the current leadership's approach, calling for 'wholesale change' to address what he terms an 'existential' threat to the party, though he faces significant procedural hurdles to mount a challenge.</p>

          <p>Colombia's President Gustavo Petro has strongly condemned recent US airstrikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean, which have reportedly killed 17 people. In an interview, Petro labeled the actions 'murder' and an 'act of tyranny,' calling for criminal proceedings against US officials if investigations confirm Colombian casualties. The Trump administration defends the strikes as necessary to combat fentanyl trafficking, but the use of lethal force has raised questions about its legality under international law.</p>

The incidents included an escalator coming to an abrupt halt, a teleprompter malfunctioning during his speech, and audio problems in the main auditorium. UN officials offered explanations, suggesting a videographer may have accidentally triggered a safety stop on the escalator and that the teleprompter was operated by the US delegation.</p>
