          <p>In a significant policy shift, former President Donald Trump is now urging Ukraine to bypass a ceasefire and move directly toward a permanent peace agreement with Russia. This change came after his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, where Putin reportedly presented a peace offer involving Ukrainian territorial concessions. Following the summit, Trump scheduled a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has expressed that Russia's refusal to cease hostilities complicates peace efforts.</p>

          <p>A White House official has stated that National Guard members deployed in Washington, D.C., as part of a new federal crime initiative may be armed. This represents a shift from earlier guidance where they were to remain unarmed. The official clarified that the Guard's role is not to make arrests but to protect federal assets and create a secure environment for law enforcement officers. The deployment is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to address crime by placing the city's police under federal control.</p>

National Guard troops already activated, tightening federal control over the capital. The move has prompted protests from some D.C. residents who oppose what they describe as a military occupation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of the Interior has announced a new zero-tolerance policy for homeless encampments in Washington, D.C., aligning with the Trump administration's urban "beautification" efforts. This policy shift means individuals in encampments must accept shelter and treatment or face potential jail time. U.S. Park Police have already cleared 70 encampments, with the remaining few scheduled for removal by multi-agency teams. The move is part of a broader federal crackdown on homelessness and crime in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>Erin has become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, intensifying rapidly before weakening slightly to a Category 4 storm. While currently located northeast of Puerto Rico, the powerful system is expected to generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents along the U.S. East Coast next week. Although most meteorological models predict the storm will remain offshore, coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks, could face significant beach erosion. Tropical storm watches are in effect for several Caribbean islands.</p>

          <p>COVID-19 positivity rates are rising across the United States, with the Southwest experiencing the highest levels at 12.5%, driven by the highly contagious "Stratus" variant. This spike coincides with students returning to school and a recent change in CDC guidance, which no longer universally recommends updated COVID shots for healthy children. Public health experts have criticized this policy shift, arguing that vaccinations remain crucial for mitigating severe outcomes, even as new variants emerge and vaccine effectiveness wanes over time.</p>

The historic property, which was once a hotel known for its parties, had been abandoned for 17 years and lacked basic utilities. After an arduous restoration process, the island now features 40 beds, modern amenities, and a nightclub, and is back on the market for £3 million.

          <p>As UK families face rising food prices, parents are employing creative strategies to feed their children affordably during the six-week summer holidays. Cost-saving tactics include buying reduced "yellow-sticker" items for the freezer, batch cooking, and organizing daily food rations to prevent over-snacking. Many parents rely on local food pantries and council-issued vouchers to supplement their budgets. These measures have become crucial as increased rent, mortgage, and childcare costs offset any recent wage growth for many households.</p>

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share increasing from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined. This shift is partly driven by Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which offer a new form factor compared to the traditional design of the iPhone. While Apple still leads the market, Samsung's wider range of products at various price points and its experimentation with new technology are creating renewed competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that despite past successes, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 needs to be defended and strengthened, not weakened as proposed by some lawmakers. While some species like elephant seals have recovered, others such as the North Atlantic right whale remain critically endangered. New threats, including climate change, marine heatwaves, and pollution, are causing population crashes in species like gray whales and contributing to the deaths of dolphins and sea lions, making robust environmental protections more urgent than ever.</p>
