          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Tibetan Dam May Increase India's Dry-Season Water Supply</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 00:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study indicates that China's controversial mega-dam project in Tibet might not cause the water crisis in India that many feared. By analyzing data from two existing upstream dams, researchers found that water flows downstream during the dry season have actually increased. Specifically, low flows in February were up by over 50%, suggesting the dams help regulate water levels by storing it during wet seasons and releasing it during dry periods. This outcome counters widespread concerns in India about potential droughts resulting from the dam's construction.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of Florida lawmakers has toured the new "Alligator Alcatraz" migrant detention facility in the Everglades for the first time following weeks of requests and a lawsuit. Democratic representatives, who had been denied entry previously, reported "appalling" conditions, citing extreme heat, inadequate food, and claims that detainees' drinking water comes from toilets. In contrast, Republican lawmakers expressed satisfaction with the facility, with one senator describing the beds as comfortable. The state has consistently denied the allegations of inhumane conditions, while federal authorities have been denied media access to the site.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Mexico have strongly criticized the US proposal to impose a 30% tariff on their imports starting August 1. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen stated the bloc would take necessary steps to safeguard its interests, including "proportionate countermeasures," while Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum emphasized that her country's sovereignty is non-negotiable. The proposed tariffs are part of a broader US strategy targeting multiple trading partners, with the administration citing persistent trade deficits as the primary justification for the move. The announcement has escalated trade tensions, with several European leaders expressing strong disapproval. (not investment advice)</p>

A 25% tariff on UK steel exports to the US remains in place, costing the industry orders and fraying nerves in communities already hit by plant closures and job losses. While the UK was exempted from a recent surprise tariff hike, the lack of a deal to reduce the base tariff to zero adds to the precarious situation. This economic pressure forces these historic industrial towns to confront a difficult future, debating whether to fight for their steelmaking heritage or pivot to new industries.

          <p>The BBC was granted rare access to the massive Rubaya mining site in eastern DR Congo, which is a vital source of coltan for mobile phones and is currently controlled by M23 rebels. Thousands of miners work daily at the site, which the M23 claims to have secured, allowing for regulated operations. This control comes amid a fragile peace process, including a recent US-brokered ceasefire deal between DR Congo and Rwanda, which some speculate could open the door for American investment in the region's mineral resources. The situation highlights the complex interplay of conflict, natural resources, and international interests in the volatile region.</p>

          <p>The reality show "Love Island" is experiencing a resurgence in popularity, with TV viewership returning to levels not seen in recent years. However, its growth on social media, particularly TikTok, is even more significant, with the show's official accounts gaining 1.8 million followers in 2025. Content creators and fans are driving engagement with recaps, analysis, and clips, allowing audiences to keep up without watching the full nightly episodes. This shift in consumption habits highlights how social media platforms are becoming essential for the survival and relevance of traditional broadcast shows, though it also raises concerns about content being taken out of context.</p>

In Canada, the province of Manitoba is under a state of emergency due to its own severe wildfires. The combination of active fires in the U.S. and drifting smoke from Canada is creating hazardous conditions and highlighting the widespread impact of this year's fire season.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas have killed at least 129 people, including children at a summer camp, with dozens still missing. The catastrophe was caused by a massive weather system that dumped extreme rainfall over the flood-prone Hill Country region while many were asleep during the holiday weekend. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timeliness and effectiveness of their emergency warnings, as many survivors reported receiving no alerts. In response, authorities have highlighted the challenges of forecasting such a rare "100-year flood" event and previous public resistance to funding a more robust warning system.</p>

          <p>Investigators have begun a two-year excavation at the site of a former church-run mother-and-baby home in Tuam, Ireland, where a mass grave is believed to hold the remains of 796 babies and young children. The St. Mary's home operated from 1925 to 1961, housing unmarried women and their children, who were often separated. The grave's existence was uncovered by an amateur historian in 2014, and a 2017 test dig confirmed "significant quantities of human remains." The full excavation aims to recover and identify the remains, bringing a measure of truth to survivors and relatives after decades of silence.</p>

Players expressed a renewed belief, with Chelsea midfielder Johanna Rytting Kaneryd stating "there is something different this year." The victory sets up a quarter-final match for Sweden against the runner-up of Group D, as they aim to finally capture the championship trophy again.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, ordering a halt to the "indiscriminate" detention of individuals suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. The ruling, by U.S. District Judge Maame Frimpong, also prohibits immigration officials from denying detainees access to legal counsel. The order stems from a lawsuit filed by immigrants and U.S. citizens who were detained without reasonable suspicion. Judge Frimpong's decision cited a "mountain of evidence" of unconstitutional practices and comes amid intensified immigration enforcement efforts and protests in the state.</p>
