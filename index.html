          <p>The article explores allegations that Russia is using far-right and criminal organizations to carry out attacks on western democracies. A former Pentagon contractor, Rinaldo Nazzaro, who once worked with US Special Operations Command, is accused of being a Russian spy and leader of a neo-Nazi terrorist group recruiting Americans. Experts suggest the Kremlin is invested in developing assets to wreak havoc in the West, using disinformation and funding far-right political parties. The Kremlin may be cultivating relationships with these groups as a form of strategic depth, saving them for a rainy day.</p>

          <p>McDonald's customers are sharing a secret menu hack online for a drink called "Cotton Candy Sprite." The drink is made by ordering a medium Sprite with three pumps of French vanilla syrup. While some customers are excited to try it, others are skeptical of the flavor combination, with some reporting it tastes more like creme soda and doesn't resemble cotton candy at all. McDonald's has not yet commented on whether they will officially embrace the drink, but this article indicates that the article is not the first time a secret menu item has gone viral.</p>

          <p>Democratic U.S. representatives for California are raising concerns about the slowdown of activity at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach due to President Trump's tariffs. The tariffs have resulted in fewer cargo containers moving through the ports, leading to fewer jobs for longshoremen and truckers, and potentially higher prices for consumers. Port officials predict a significant drop in activity, with numerous ships canceling their trips.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin used the celebration of victory in World War II to emphasize Russia's resources for continuing the war in Ukraine. He showcased support from North Korea and China, honored soldiers' sacrifices, and paraded Russian-made drones. The events were designed to communicate that Russia is not exhausted and has the will, equipment, and personnel to fight. The article indicates that President Trump, who had promised on the campaign trail to broker peace in Ukraine within 24 hours, said talks with Russian officials were continuing.</p>

          <p>President Trump is exerting greater control over the Republican Party's big-money world by bringing key super PACs under his influence. The Congressional Leadership Fund and Senate Leadership Fund have new leaders working closely with the White House and installing Trump strategists in senior positions. Trump's super PAC, MAGA Inc., has amassed a significant amount of money, potentially overshadowing congressional super PACs. This shift raises concerns about a power imbalance and the potential for conflicts between Trump's agenda and Republican leaders' priorities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge detention in court, in an effort to combat illegal immigration. Stephen Miller, a top aide, stated the Constitution allows for suspending this legal liberty in times of "rebellion or invasion."
