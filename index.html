          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is scheduled to meet with a top Chinese official in Switzerland to discuss economic matters as the trade war between the U.S. and China continues. The meeting comes after China pushed back against President Trump's claims of active trade discussions. Bessent aims to rebalance the international economic system to better serve U.S. interests, while China emphasizes its commitment to safeguarding its development interests and defending international fairness. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will also attend the meeting with his Chinese counterpart.</p>

          <p>Tensions have escalated between India and Pakistan following Indian missile strikes in Pakistani territory, with Pakistan vowing retaliation and India conducting nationwide preparedness exercises. India claims the strikes targeted infrastructure used by militants linked to a recent tourist massacre in Kashmir, while Pakistan denounces the action as an act of war. The U.S. diplomatic mission in Pakistan has issued a security alert, advising citizens to depart conflict areas or shelter in place, and the UN Secretary-General has called for maximum restraint. Despite the heightened tensions, Pakistan has reportedly reopened airports in major cities, offering a glimmer of hope for de-escalation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that the prehistoric ChavÃ­n people of the Peruvian Andes used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals, potentially influencing social and political hierarchies. Archaeologists discovered artifacts, including "snuff tubes," at ChavÃ­n de HuÃ¡ntar containing traces of DMT and tobacco. These substances were likely consumed during tightly controlled ceremonies reserved for a select few, reinforcing social inequality. The findings indicate that hallucinogens played a significant role in the transition from egalitarian societies to stratified ones, where inequality was normalized.</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, but revenue fell short of projections, causing a 5% drop in share prices. Revenue grew by 14% to $11.53 billion, while net income reached $1.78 billion, a significant increase from the previous year's loss. The company expects gross bookings to range between $45.75 billion and $47.25 billion in the current quarter. Uber is also facing a lawsuit from the FTC over deceptive billing practices related to its Uber One subscription service, though the CEO maintains that the service is simple to cancel. The company is also pushing into autonomous vehicles, with 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips completed.</p>

To maximize savings, consumers should compare different accounts and consider online banks for potentially higher interest rates and lower fees.

Solar and wind energy now power millions of homes, with battery storage and electric vehicle adoption also surging.

          <p>Germany's new coalition government is committed to climate neutrality by 2045, but experts suggest that environmental protection is not a top priority. Domestic and international climate policy will be moved back under the environment ministry, which may lead to conflicts with other ministries focused on the economy. The new Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, prioritizes economic stability and has made it clear that he would only wind down coal and gas power plants if it did not further endanger an already beleaguered industrial sector. The government aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 65% compared to 1990 levels by the end of the decade, but it is in danger of missing that goal.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans are relying on a spending and tax cut package to revitalize their political standing, but this effort may be overshadowed by President Trump's tariffs. The author argues that extending the 2017 tax law, while beneficial, may not be enough to offset the economic damage caused by tariffs. He suggests that Republican leaders should pressure Trump to reconsider his trade policies or reclaim Congress's authority over tariffs. The author cautions that without a stable economic foundation, Republicans face a challenging path to re-election.</p>

Far-UVC light, at wavelengths of roughly 200 to 235 nanometers, can kill airborne pathogens without harming human skin or eyes. The article highlights advancements in cheaper, solid-state lamps using secondary harmonics, potentially making far-UVC disinfection more accessible. While uncertainties remain regarding air quality effects, recent research suggests that moderate use of far-UVC lamps could disinfect without significantly impacting indoor air quality.</p>
