          <p>Swedish automaker Volvo Cars announced second-quarter operating profits that surpassed analyst expectations, causing its stock to rise. However, the company also reported a significant year-over-year decline in both profit and revenue, attributing the results to a challenging automotive market and the impact of U.S. tariffs. To adapt, Volvo is shifting its U.S. strategy by adding its popular XC60 SUV to its South Carolina production line while phasing out sedans and station wagons with waning demand.

          <p>After years of stalled plans, Elon Musk's business interests are finally gaining traction in India, marked by the opening of a Tesla showroom in Mumbai and Starlink's regulatory approval. Tesla's initial strategy targets the premium EV segment rather than the mass market, with high import duties making its cars a luxury item. Meanwhile, Starlink aims to address rural internet connectivity gaps, suggesting a collaborative approach with local telecoms rather than a disruptive one, signaling a long-term strategic pivot for Musk.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's labor market is showing signs of weakening, according to new data from the Office for National Statistics. The unemployment rate increased to 4.7%, its highest level in four years, while the annual rate of pay growth slowed to 5%. These indicators, combined with a three-year continuous decline in job vacancies, suggest a cooling economy. Economists believe this trend makes it more probable that the Bank of England will implement an interest rate cut next month to stimulate economic activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Robert Roberson, a Texas inmate convicted of killing his two-year-old daughter in 2002, has been scheduled for execution in October. His conviction was based on the "shaken baby syndrome" hypothesis, a theory that his lawyers and numerous experts, including the original detective on the case, now argue has been widely discredited. Despite a bipartisan push from state lawmakers for clemency and claims of new evidence pointing to the child's death from pneumonia, the court has moved forward with setting the date.</p>

          <p>The White House has stated that funding for a crucial national fentanyl overdose prevention program, currently short by $140 million, will be paid out "in increments" rather than as a single annual grant. This change in disbursement has caused significant uncertainty and concern among state and local public health departments, which rely on the CDC-managed funds. Officials worry the unpredictable payment schedule will disrupt their ability to hire staff, sign contracts, and provide continuous services to combat the overdose crisis.</p>

          <p>While federal officials are focusing on modernizing equipment and hiring more staff, U.S. air traffic controllers argue these measures fail to address the root causes of problems plaguing the system. Controllers point to critical issues like chronic staffing shortages, grueling six-day workweeks, stagnating pay, and low morale as the primary drivers of stress and risk. They express frustration that the current conversation overlooks these fundamental quality-of-life concerns, which they believe are more demoralizing than the technological challenges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it is revoking $4 billion in federal funds previously allocated for California's high-speed rail project. President Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy heavily criticized the project, labeling it an incompetent "boondoggle" and a "total waste of Taxpayer money." California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have denounced the move as illegal and politically motivated, vowing to explore all options to fight the cancellation of what they consider a legally binding agreement.</p>
