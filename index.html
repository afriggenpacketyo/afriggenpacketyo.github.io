            <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the U.S. holds a significant advantage over China in their escalating trade war, highlighting the disparity in export volumes between the two nations. Bessent emphasized that China's escalation through tariff increases is a strategic misstep due to the U.S. exporting significantly less to China than vice versa. He outlined the administration's strategy of using reciprocal tariffs to encourage trade partners to negotiate and bring jobs back to the U.S., envisioning tariffs as a temporary measure that decreases as domestic manufacturing grows. Bessent noted that numerous countries have expressed interest in talks, but China has vowed to resist and imposed tariffs on U.S. goods. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Walgreens reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue, driven by cost-cutting measures as the company prepares to be taken private by Sycamore Partners in a $10 billion deal. The company withdrew its fiscal 2025 guidance due to the pending transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Walgreens' sales increased by 4.1% year-over-year, fueled by growth in its U.S. retail pharmacy and international segments. Despite the positive sales, Walgreens reported a net loss of $2.85 billion, including a $4.2 billion charge related to the decreased value of its U.S. retail pharmacy and investment in VillageMD.

            <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. and Iran would hold "direct talks" regarding a potential new nuclear deal, but Iran's foreign minister clarified that the discussions in Oman would be "indirect." Trump, who previously withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear deal, emphasized that Iran would face "great danger" if the talks are unsuccessful. Prime Minister Netanyahu affirmed Israel's shared goal with the U.S. of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The talks aim to address concerns over Iran's nuclear activities, which Iran insists are peaceful, despite breaches of the existing deal's restrictions.</p>

            <p>Lenders are anticipated to reduce mortgage rates following market instability caused by President Trump's tariff policies, which have heightened expectations for further interest rate cuts by the Bank of England. TSB Bank announced plans to lower some two-year fixed-rate mortgages by up to 0.25 percentage points, following similar actions by MPowered Mortgages. Financial markets and economists now predict that the Bank of England will implement more significant interest rate cuts this year to mitigate potential economic downturns. The current interest rate is 4.5%, and the market now expects three cuts to 3.75% due to the tariff-related uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Colossal Biosciences announced the birth of three dire wolf puppies through genetic engineering, claiming to have "de-extincted" the species; however, experts dispute this assertion. Zoologist Philip Seddon clarified that the puppies are genetically modified grey wolves with some dire wolf-like characteristics, such as a larger skull and white fur. Paleogeneticist Dr. Nic Rawlence explained that ancient dire wolf DNA is too degraded to clone, so Colossal used synthetic biology to insert dire wolf traits into grey wolf cells. While Colossal maintains this represents de-extinction by recreating animals with the same characteristics, experts emphasize the significant biological differences between the two species.</p>

            <p>Senator Adam Schiff, in his first Senate bill, has partnered with Senator Tim Sheehy to propose a federal tax credit for homeowners who retrofit their homes to withstand wildfires and other natural disasters. The FIREWALL Act aims to help families earning less than $300,000 annually afford upgrades like fire-resistant roofs, water barriers, and storm shelters. The tax credit would cover up to half the costs, capped at $25,000 for lower-income families, and is designed to incentivize insurers to cover more homes in vulnerable areas. Schiff emphasized that the bill would help victims of recent fires rebuild with disaster-resistant materials and technologies.</p>

            <p>A flypast featuring the UK's Red Arrows and Italy's Frecce Tricolori occurred over Rome to honor King Charles III and Queen Camilla's state visit to Italy. The aerial display, symbolizing closer military ties between the two nations, accompanied a warm welcome from Italy's President Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinale Palace. The King and Queen are on a four-day state visit, coinciding with their 20th wedding anniversary. The visit aims to strengthen the alliance between Italy and the UK, particularly in supporting Ukraine and resetting relations with European neighbors post-Brexit.</p>

            <p>South Korea's military fired warning shots after approximately 10 North Korean soldiers crossed the tense border between the two countries. The North Korean soldiers, some of whom were armed and wearing bulletproof vests, returned to the North after the warning broadcasts and shots. The incident occurred at the eastern section of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), the heavily fortified border between North and South Korea. Tensions between the Koreas remain high as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un continues to develop his nuclear capabilities and align with Russia.</p>

These changes are intended to reduce confusion and impersonation, with enforcement beginning on April 10. The move comes after numerous instances of users posing as Elon Musk to conduct cryptocurrency scams and other misleading activities.</p>

            <p>Over 40 Labour MPs are urging the government to introduce digital IDs to enhance migration control and improve public services. They argue that a "gear shift" is needed to fully utilize the benefits of digital identification. While the government has made strides in digitizing identification, there are no plans to introduce mandatory digital IDs. Proponents believe digital IDs could help combat illegal employment and streamline public services. The proposal differs from the compulsory identity cards introduced by former Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p>

            <p>China has vowed to "fight to the end" in its trade war with the U.S., as President Trump threatens to nearly double tariffs on Chinese goods. This escalation could result in most Chinese imports facing a staggering 104% tax. In response, China has allowed its currency to weaken and state-linked enterprises have been buying up stocks to stabilize the market. Experts suggest that this standoff could lead to long-term economic pain for both countries. The situation is causing uncertainty and concern in global markets, as governments, businesses, and investors struggle to adjust to the rapidly changing global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

This initiative comes after Taiwan was hit with a 32% export tariff despite its close relationship with the U.S. Analysts note that Trump's transactional approach to international relations means the success of these goodwill gestures remains uncertain. The move is part of a broader effort by affected economies to seek exemptions or special negotiations with the Trump administration.</p>

Solar power continues to be the fastest-growing energy source, doubling its electricity generation in the last three years.
