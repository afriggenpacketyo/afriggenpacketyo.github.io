            <h2>Report Warns US Against Complacency in Tech Race With China</h2>

            <p>A report by the Atlantic Council cautions the United States against complacency in the escalating technological competition with China, particularly in engaging with the Global South. Developing countries are expected to play a crucial role in advanced technology, potentially strengthening ties with China. Failure to actively engage could allow China to advance its geopolitical, economic, and technological interests, undermining the US and its allies. The report stresses that the US must avoid falling behind China in these critical areas to maintain its global influence.</p>

            <h2>Analysis: Potential Consequences if China Wins Trade War with US</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 07:41:57 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>An analysis suggests that the United States could lose its trade war with China due to its dependence on Chinese goods and a lack of strategic preparation. China has been preparing for economic conflict by investing in key industries and diversifying its export markets. The US administration's approach, marked by inconsistent policies and strained relationships with allies, weakens its position. A Chinese victory could embolden Beijing in other areas, such as military actions, while the US would suffer economic pain and a loss of global standing.</p>

            <p>Due to the Trump Administration's suspension and termination of billions of dollars in global health programs, many HIV-positive people in Zambia are facing shortages of essential medications, leading to chaos and confusion. People are falling ill without their HIV medication. Clinics are being shut down, leaving patients without access to medication and basic food, which is essential for taking the drugs. Zambian people are struggling to find alternative sources for their medication, with some having to ration their pills, which can lead to drug resistance. The situation is causing immense worry and fear, especially for those who remember the pre-treatment era when AIDS was a death sentence.</p>

            <p>China's ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, cautioned against repeating the protectionist policies of the Great Depression era amid escalating trade tensions. Xie emphasized addressing the root causes of economic issues and promoting global economic growth through joint efforts rather than protectionist measures. He specifically cited the Smoot-Hawley Act as a cautionary tale, noting that its high tariffs worsened the Great Depression by triggering a dramatic decline in global trade.

            <p>A report indicates that over 155,000 people crossed state lines for abortions in the US in 2024, doubling the number from 2020, highlighting the impact of state-level abortion bans. States like Illinois, North Carolina, Kansas, and New Mexico have become major hubs for abortion services, but travel is costly for patients and support networks. The Trump administration's demolition of the CDC team responsible for abortion surveillance reports raises concerns about tracking public health outcomes. Experts estimate that 20-25% of people who want abortions are blocked by bans, underscoring ongoing challenges in accessing reproductive care.</p>

            <p>Amid Trump's tariffs, the world responds with humor, from Chinese government memes to Canadian premiers removing American alcohol. Joking about the tariffs has become a common response to the serious issue of the economic fight, upending markets, and sparking recession fears. Political scientists say humor is a natural response to stressful times, and the Chinese government is strategically using memes to communicate its stance. While Trump is also skilled at using dark humor, the global response highlights the widespread anxiety and uncertainty surrounding the tariffs.</p>

            <p>Debris removal from the Los Angeles County fire is progressing rapidly, with more than one-third of the affected home lots cleared. The Army Corps of Engineers is overseeing the effort, with crews working at a record pace to clear nearly 120 lots a day. The scope of the work is immense, with over 1 million tons of debris removed, and officials expect the bulk of the cleanup to be completed by June. The operation requires both brute force and a soft touch, as crews work to recover personal treasures and address environmental concerns.</p>

His relatives are completely in the dark about his wellbeing or how long he might be trapped behind bars. His deportation highlights the emotional toll of anti-immigrant policies and the challenges faced by Venezuelan migrants seeking a better life. Trump's policy of deporting asylum seekers to an authoritarian foreign land has grim echoes in Latin America, where such tactics were common during US-backed dictatorships.</p>

            <p>A former cold war communist dictatorship and component part of the Habsburg empire seems an unlikely source of hope for Donald Trump’s opponents. The Czech Republic – once part of what was cold war-era Czechoslovakia and, coincidentally, birthplace of Trump’s first wife, Ivana – is a possible blueprint for how street protest can bloom into a unified electoral strategy that eventually unseats a billionaire leader with autocratic aspirations and apparent scorn for democracy. In 2018, a popular movement, Million Moments for Democracy, began organizing rallies in the Czech capital, Prague, and other cities to protest the anti-democratic tendencies of the country’s prime minister, Andrej Babiš, who had been labelled “the Czech Trump”.</p>

            <p>The dismantling of Hungary's democracy under Prime Minister Viktor Orban is a point of fascination for political scientists around the world, including those advising the Trump administration. Hungary serves as more of a conservative fantasyland that MAGA Republicans can aspire to. Orban began, by weakening Hungary's courts, filling them with loyalists. He then applied pressure on media companies, either turning them into state propaganda or putting them out of business. Then, says Kreko, Orban took control over universities, appointing leaders loyal to him. The difference, says Kreko, is the pace at which Trump is operating. </p>
