          <p>A husband and wife from Rhode Island died when their single-engine plane crashed on Route 195 in Dartmouth, Massachusetts. The aircraft, which had departed from New Bedford Regional Airport, went down in the median and caught fire, closing the highway for hours. A woman driving on the highway was also injured by debris from the crash but her injuries are not life-threatening. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause, with poor weather from a nor'easter being a possible factor.</p>

          <p>This article addresses and refutes several claims made by the White House linking acetaminophen (Tylenol) use, particularly during pregnancy, to autism. Medical experts clarify that there is no scientific evidence supporting these assertions, including the baseless claim that the Amish community has no autism due to avoiding medication. Doctors emphasize that Tylenol remains the safest option for pain and fever relief during pregnancy when used as directed. The article highlights the dangers of spreading medical misinformation and advises consulting healthcare professionals for guidance.</p>

          <h2>Welsh Government Faces Spending Cuts Amid Budget Negotiation Challenges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 05:06:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labour-led Welsh government is warning of significant public service cuts if it cannot secure support for its upcoming budget in the Senedd. As a minority government, Labour lacks the votes to pass the £27 billion spending plan alone and must negotiate with opposition parties. The Conservatives have offered to discuss a deal in exchange for scrapping the land transaction tax, a Welsh equivalent of stamp duty. Failure to pass a budget by the start of the financial year in April would trigger automatic spending restrictions, potentially leading to widespread public sector redundancies.</p>

          <p>A new book titled "Candid New York" compiles the groundbreaking work of George Bradford Brainerd, a civil engineer and photographer from the 1870s. Often called the "father of instantaneous photography," Brainerd developed early handheld cameras that allowed him to capture candid scenes of everyday life on New York City streets. His innovative technology enabled him to document a wide range of subjects, from musicians and paperboys to beggars, with unprecedented detail. The book, authored by Erik Hesselberg, offers a unique visual record of the era.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the ongoing federal government shutdown is causing significant harm to everyday Americans, moving beyond political theatrics to affect real lives. The article highlights the financial strain on federal workers and contractors, delays in essential services like food-safety inspections, and threats to public safety. It criticizes the use of the budget as a political weapon, calling for competent governance over partisan standoffs. The author urges Congress to reopen the government and focus on pragmatic reforms that protect vulnerable citizens rather than continuing the damaging stalemate.</p>

          <p>A new study by DHL and NYU Stern School of Business suggests that global trade will withstand recent tariff increases, though its growth will be slower. The DHL Global Connectedness Tracker forecasts an average annual growth rate of 2.5% for global trade volume through 2029, a pace similar to the previous decade but down from an earlier 3.1% prediction. The report notes that while growth is expected to slow from 3.2% this year to 1.6% next year, a complete reversal of globalization is a risk but not a current reality. Researchers emphasize the enduring strength and creativity of international commerce in adapting to economic headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An NPR journalist explains their decision to give up their Pentagon press pass after 28 years due to a new Defense Department policy. The rule threatens to revoke credentials for "soliciting" unclassified information that has not been officially approved for release, a practice the author argues is fundamental to journalism. The article contends that signing the document would turn reporters into stenographers, unable to hold the government accountable or report on the reality of situations beyond official press releases. This move is part of a broader trend of reduced access and transparency at the Pentagon.</p>

The charity estimates the program, involving MRI scans and blood tests, would cost £25 million annually.

          <p>India and China have become major buyers of Russian oil following Western sanctions, altering global energy trade dynamics. Indian traders are now reportedly requesting state refiners to pay for Russian crude in Chinese yuan, a move that strengthens the currency's international standing and supports China's efforts to create an alternative to the US dollar. This shift is partly driven by US trade policies, which have inadvertently pushed India towards closer economic cooperation with Russia and China. Despite US pressure, India is unlikely to abandon the arrangement, having saved an estimated $12.6 billion on discounted Russian oil.</p>

The rise in unemployment was primarily driven by younger people, a trend some analysts link to increased employer national insurance costs affecting part-time roles.

Machado, a longtime critic of President Nicolás Maduro, received the award for her work promoting democratic rights.</p>

          <p>Many international shipping customers are experiencing severe delays and fear their packages have been lost or destroyed due to a backlog at US customs. The chaos began after the Trump administration ended a rule that allowed parcels valued under $800 to enter the country without inspection, subjecting millions of daily packages to new, complex processing rules. Shipping giant UPS is struggling to manage the influx, with some customers receiving notifications that their items will be disposed of due to incomplete customs information. The situation has caused significant financial and emotional distress for individuals and small businesses.</p>

Representatives from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS), land management groups, and environmental organizations will attend. The SFRS described this year's wildfire risk as "unprecedented," with over 200 incidents, prompting a collaborative effort to learn from the events and improve mitigation efforts across Scotland.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Inverclyde, Scotland, is advocating for mandatory CPR training in all Scottish schools after tragically losing both of his parents to heart conditions. The teenager, Cameron McGerr, believes that knowing CPR could have potentially saved his father, who suffered a cardiac arrest earlier this year. He has already successfully convinced his own school to introduce the life-saving training and recently shared his story with Members of the Scottish Parliament to push for a nationwide initiative. His "Pulse of Life" campaign aims to equip all young people with the skills to act in a medical emergency.</p>

          <p>With England captain Harry Kane in prolific form, the question of who serves as his primary backup remains a point of discussion for the national team. An injury to Ollie Watkins, the only other dedicated striker in the current squad, has highlighted a perceived lack of depth in the traditional number nine position. Only seven English out-and-out strikers have played in the Premier League this season, prompting concerns from even the Under-21s manager about the development of goal-scoring forwards. As England nears World Cup qualification, the race to secure the role of Kane's deputy is intensifying.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan committee in the U.S. Congress has launched an investigation into Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet service over its alleged use by criminal scam centers in Myanmar. These compounds, which are linked to human trafficking and forced labor, are responsible for billions of dollars in global fraud. An investigation found that Starlink dishes became prevalent at these facilities around the time of a supposed crackdown, with data showing Starlink has rapidly become Myanmar's largest internet provider. The committee is probing the American company's role in enabling these transnational criminal operations.</p>

Key contributions came from high-value players like Freddie Freeman, who hit the go-ahead home run, and Blake Snell, who delivered a dominant pitching performance.
