            <p>A tragic cable car accident near Naples, Italy, resulted in the deaths of four people, including a British couple. The cable car plunged to the ground after a support cable snapped, prompting an investigation by Italian authorities. Sixteen other individuals were rescued from a second cabin on the line. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed condolences to the families of the victims, as the Mount Faito cable car, operating since 1952, has experienced similar incidents in the past, with a 1960 accident resulting in four fatalities.</p>

            <h2>NHL Playoff Format Faces Scrutiny Over Predictable Matchups</h2>

            <p>The NHL's playoff format, implemented in 2014, is under scrutiny for leading to repetitive and predictable matchups, frustrating fans and raising questions about its fairness. The current system, which prioritizes divisional matchups, often eliminates top teams early in the postseason. Some propose a 3-2-1 points system in the regular season to incentivize regulation wins and potentially alter playoff seedings. Commissioner Gary Bettman defends the current format, but with league expansion and relocation since its implementation, a reevaluation might be warranted, as the predictability diminishes the excitement of the playoffs.</p>

The signing follows previous negotiations complicated by political tensions, with the US seeking to ensure its investments are protected and contribute to Ukraine's post-war recovery.

            <p>An estimate of Social Security's 2026 Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) has been revised, with tariffs potentially impacting benefits. The annual COLA, which helps seniors keep up with rising costs, is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Tariffs could affect the CPI-W, influencing the COLA amount. While some advocate for using the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E) for a more accurate reflection of senior expenses, the CPI-W remains the standard for calculating Social Security adjustments.

            <p>America's only rare earths mine, Mountain Pass, has experienced increased interest from companies after China imposed export limits on these critical minerals. The trade war between the two countries could lead to shortages if China maintains or expands its export controls. MP Materials, which operates the Mountain Pass mine, will halt ore shipments to China for processing due to tariffs and export restrictions. The US is working to develop additional mines and reduce dependence on China for rare earth elements.</p>
