          <p>A proposed bill in Congress would introduce federal work requirements for Medicaid recipients aged 19 to 64 who are enrolled through Affordable Care Act expansion. These individuals would need to work or participate in qualifying activities for 80 hours per month, with exemptions for those with dependent children or medical conditions. The House version of the bill estimates $344 billion in federal spending cuts over 10 years, while the Senate version includes stricter requirements for parents. Current law prohibits basing Medicaid eligibility on work requirements, though some states have implemented them through waivers. (not investment advice)</p>

The search is shifting to focus on finding Decker's remains, with the possibility that he died in the wilderness during the intense search.

          <p>NATO leaders are set to release a joint statement on a collective defense spending hike, pushing member nations to increase their expenditure from 2% to 5% of GDP by 2035. While most members are expected to approve the hike, some, like Spain and Belgium, seek exemptions or flexibility. Secretary General Mark Rutte has reassured allies of the U.S.'s commitment to NATO, despite President Trump's past frustrations with defense contributions. Several heads of state expressed confidence in achieving unity, though some acknowledged the difficulties in reaching a consensus.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned welfare changes, which aim to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments. More than 130 MPs, including 120 Labour MPs, have signed the amendment, citing concerns about the number of people the plans are expected to push into poverty and a lack of consultation. Cabinet ministers have reportedly been calling Labour MPs to persuade them to vote with the government, but only one MP has removed her name from the list. The Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill is set to be voted on next Tuesday.</p>

          <p>Former US President Donald Trump stated that there has been "great progress" in negotiations to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. This comes after recent strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, which Trump claims have set Iran's nuclear ambitions back by "decades." Despite a CNN report suggesting the strikes failed to destroy Iran's underground facilities, Trump labeled the reports as "fake news."

          <p>Relationships with in-laws can be complex, ranging from close and friendly to strained and distant, and expectations for these relationships are often unclear. Cultural and familial traditions significantly influence in-law dynamics, and interactions are largely shaped by one's partner's example. Conflict can arise due to varying expectations and a lack of clearly defined norms, particularly regarding involvement and traditions. Maintaining a cordial relationship with in-laws is often valuable for the sake of one's spouse or children, provided there is mutual respect.</p>

The article discusses examples such as Jerry Seinfeld and Elon Musk's father, highlighting problematic dynamics when significant power imbalances or questionable circumstances are involved.

          <p>A new study reveals that nearly one in five food and beverage products in the U.S. contain synthetic dyes, often in items marketed to children. These dyes, derived from petroleum, are used to enhance visual appeal and maintain color consistency, but emerging research suggests they may have adverse neurobehavioral effects, especially in children. The study also found that products with synthetic dyes tend to be higher in added sugars and lower in nutritional quality. While some steps have been taken to ban or label these dyes, consumers must scrutinize ingredient lists to avoid them.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military's strike on nuclear facilities in Iran has likely diminished the chances of North Korea returning to denuclearization talks with the U.S., according to analysts. North Korea, which has a more advanced nuclear program than Iran, may see a working nuclear deterrent as the only guarantor of security. The attack on Iran has made old sticking points in negotiations, such as North Korea submitting a full list of its nuclear sites, even more onerous. Experts believe that North Korea may be willing to come back to the negotiating table for a freeze, though not a rollback, of its nuclear program.</p>
