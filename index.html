          <p>The D.C. Council has given final approval for the Washington Commanders to build a new $3.8 billion stadium at the former RFK Stadium site. This decision marks the team's planned return to the district by 2030 after nearly three decades of playing in Maryland. The project, championed by owner Josh Harris and Mayor Muriel Bowser, also includes plans for housing, retail space, and parkland, overcoming previous political hurdles related to the team's name. The vote solidifies a major urban redevelopment initiative for the city.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines CEO Dave Davis has informed employees of impending job cuts and a significant reduction in flights starting in November. The carrier plans to decrease its capacity by 25% compared to the previous year, aiming to cut costs and stabilize its finances following a second bankruptcy declaration. This move comes as the discount airline struggles with high costs, shifting travel demands, and increased competition after a failed acquisition by JetBlue. The company is now in negotiations with vendors and aircraft lessors to shrink its operations.</p>

          <p>An opinion article highlights the story of a Chinese student who chose culinary school over a traditional academic path, suggesting a positive shift in societal values. The piece argues that in a climate of intense academic competition, it is encouraging to see young people pursue their passions with family and societal support. It contrasts this with past narratives where such choices were seen as unusual, like the case of a Peking University graduate who became a butcher. The author calls for China to create more opportunities for its youth to follow their dreams beyond conventional routes.</p>

          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air indefinitely following public and political backlash against comments made by the host regarding the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The move came after the FCC Chair suggested the network's broadcast license could be at risk and Nexstar Media Group, a major affiliate operator, announced it would preempt the show. Kimmel had suggested in his monologue that the accused shooter was aligned with the MAGA movement, sparking widespread condemnation. The network's decision reflects the intense political sensitivity and repercussions surrounding commentary on the high-profile killing.</p>

          <p>Ohio State University has launched a new initiative called AI Fluency, which will require all undergraduate students to study artificial intelligence, regardless of their major. Starting with the class of 2029, the program aims to ensure graduates are proficient in both their chosen field and the practical applications of AI. This curriculum change is a response to the rapidly growing demand for AI skills in the job market, where listings have increased over 600% in the last decade. The university hopes this requirement will provide its students with a significant competitive advantage in the future workforce.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a new record high, driven by gains in technology and real estate stocks, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate. The Fed's quarter-point cut was framed as a "risk management" move, with indications of two more potential cuts by year-end. While Japanese markets reacted positively, other Asia-Pacific markets showed mixed results as investors digested the implications of the U.S. monetary policy shift. The Bank of Japan is also beginning its own policy meeting, where it is expected to hold its rates steady. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his administration will officially designate the loose affiliation of activists known as antifa as a "major terrorist organization." In a post on social media, the president also stated he would recommend a thorough investigation into individuals and groups that allegedly provide funding to antifa. The announcement did not specify the legal mechanism or timing for the designation. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is a decentralized movement rather than a formal, structured organization, which could complicate the legal implications of such a label.</p>

Harris writes that while Buttigieg would have been an "ideal partner," she felt the combination of their identities would ask too much of the American electorate. The candid admission offers a rare insight into the strategic and demographic calculations that influence major political decisions at the highest level of a presidential campaign.</p>

          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume fermented fruit containing low levels of alcohol. By testing the figs and plums that make up the primates' diet, scientists determined the alcohol content was about 0.3% by weight. Due to the large quantity of fruit they eat daily, this amounts to an intake of approximately 14 grams of ethanol, equivalent to nearly two standard alcoholic drinks for a human. The study supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, suggesting human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in our primate ancestors' diets.</p>

          <p>Liverpool defeated Atletico Madrid 3-2 in their opening Champions League match, thanks to a dramatic stoppage-time winner from Virgil van Dijk. The team once again surrendered a 2-0 lead, a recurring issue this season, before mounting a late comeback to secure the victory. The match also marked the debut of Liverpool's record £125 million signing, Alexander Isak, who showed promising signs before being substituted. Mohamed Salah was also a standout performer, consistently threatening the Atletico defense in a thrilling contest at Anfield.</p>

          <p>Enrique Tarrio, a key leader of the Proud Boys, has stated that the far-right group is actively working to get people fired from their jobs for celebrating the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Tarrio described an "extremely effective" network that scours social media to identify critics and then pressures their employers, a tactic he acknowledged was previously used against his own group. He claimed these efforts have resulted in over 100 dismissals, part of a broader right-wing campaign to punish those who spoke critically about Kirk's killing. The movement reflects an escalation of online cancellation tactics.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has publicly refuted a social media post by President Trump which claimed the state was finalizing approvals for low-income housing in the affluent Pacific Palisades neighborhood. Newsom's office called the claim a "straight up lie," clarifying that new housing developments of that type are currently banned in the area by an emergency order from Los Angeles's mayor. The executive order was issued to give local governments more control over rebuilding efforts following a major firestorm. Trump's post had suggested the state was unfairly prioritizing new projects over helping fire victims.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis article argues that the Federal Reserve's recent 0.25% interest rate cut will likely not be enough to satisfy President Trump or halt his ongoing pressure on the central bank. The move is seen as a moderate response to weak jobs reports, not a capitulation to Trump's demands for more drastic cuts. The article highlights the president's attempts to undermine the Fed's independence, including his effort to fire a board member and the unusual appointment of an active administration official. These actions represent a significant test of the central bank's commitment to non-political economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to hold its key interest rate at 4% during its upcoming meeting. This follows a rate cut from 4.25% in August, which brought the rate to a two-year low. Analysts believe that with UK inflation still running at 3.8%, nearly double the official 2% target, policymakers will be hesitant to risk further price increases by cutting rates again. The decision contrasts with the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate cut and reflects the unique inflationary pressures facing the British economy. (not investment advice)</p>
