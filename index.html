          <p>This Guardian article draws parallels between Trump's early second term actions and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's presidency in Iran.  Both leaders exhibited populist tendencies and authoritarian lurches, targeting institutions and suppressing dissent. However, the article acknowledges crucial differences, highlighting the vastly different contexts of the US and Iran, and ultimately concludes that Trump's actions are unprecedented in their scale and ferocity. The article displays a left-leaning bias, portraying Trump's actions in a strongly negative light and focusing on criticisms from his opponents.</p>
