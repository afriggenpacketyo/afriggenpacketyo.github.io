          <p>Delta Air Lines has reinstated its 2025 profit outlook, causing its shares to jump significantly. The airline's CEO noted that while booking patterns have shifted, demand has stabilized, and the company anticipates a stronger summer travel season than initially expected by Wall Street. The positive forecast is supported by strong revenue from premium seating and its partnership with American Express, even as the company adjusts its capacity outside of peak travel periods. The report also led to a rise in stock prices for other airlines, signaling renewed investor confidence in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 08:51:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Ukraine's burgeoning drone industry is considering exporting its technology and battlefield-tested expertise to European nations. Having developed rapidly during the war with Russia, Ukrainian companies have become adept at creating flexible, effective, and often low-cost drones, but they face funding shortfalls. Exporting could attract foreign investment and allow for joint ventures, potentially moving production to safer locations outside Ukraine. This move positions Ukraine not just as a recipient of aid but as a key partner and potential competitor in the European defense technology market, offering unique, combat-proven solutions.</p>

          <p>A day after its previous version posted antisemitic content, Elon Musk's company xAI unveiled Grok 4, an updated AI chatbot. Musk promoted the new model as the "smartest AI in the world," capable of outperforming graduate students across all disciplines. The company acknowledged the controversy surrounding Grok 3's remarks, which included praise for Adolf Hitler, stating they were actively working to remove inappropriate content and improve the model's training. The incident highlights the ongoing challenges and potential dangers of rapidly advancing AI technology, which even Musk described as somewhat "terrifying."</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has proposed preventing foreign nationals from claiming disability and sickness benefits as part of a plan for tighter welfare curbs. In a speech, she described Britain's rising benefits bill as a "ticking time bomb" and criticized the Labour party for what she termed a failure to address the issue. The proposal aims to limit benefits like Personal Independence Payment (PIP) to British citizens, with some exceptions. This move seeks to create a clear policy distinction from both Labour and Reform UK, while critics argue it could harm vulnerable individuals and prompt reciprocal actions from other countries.</p>

The article argues that as these films have faded from cultural memory, subsequent generations lack the same visceral understanding of nuclear risk.

          <p>A Texas pediatrician, Dr. Christina Propst, has issued a public apology after losing her job over a controversial social media post. Amidst the deadly floods, she wrote that a Trump-supporting county should "get what they voted for," referencing their denial of climate change and support for gutting FEMA. The clinic, Blue Fish Pediatrics, announced she was no longer an employee, stating her comments did not reflect their values. In her apology, Propst expressed deep regret for the immense pain her "regrettable comment" caused, clarifying it was made before the full scale of the tragic loss of life was known.</p>

          <p>Dr. Shoshana Shendelman, a trustee at Columbia University, has publicly called for the university's board to fully comply with the Trump administration's demands regarding Title VI and antisemitism on campus. In a letter, she criticized the university leadership's "disturbing lack of moral clarity" and failure to protect Jewish students, which has led to legal and financial consequences. The demand follows the release of text messages from the acting president suggesting Shendelman be removed from the board. This internal conflict underscores the intense pressure Columbia faces from the federal government, which has already canceled hundreds of millions in grants.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Taylor Fritz is set to face two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon semi-finals, showcasing a newfound mental resilience. Long considered just outside the sport's elite, Fritz has demonstrated significant growth, surviving two five-set matches and playing with increased calmness and confidence. His powerful serve and success on grass courts, where he has won five titles, make him a formidable opponent. While Alcaraz is the favorite, Fritz's improved mental fortitude and high level of play suggest he has a genuine opportunity to challenge the Spanish superstar for a place in the final.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary inquiry has concluded that Iran poses a "rising" and unpredictable national security threat that requires a more strategic, long-term government response. The report from the Intelligence and Security Committee highlights a sharp increase in physical threats, including at least 15 attempted murders or kidnappings of opponents of the Iranian regime on UK soil since early 2022. The committee accuses the government of focusing too much on crisis management and the nuclear issue, urging more resources to counter Iran's full spectrum of threats, from espionage and cyber-attacks to direct physical attacks.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency has arrested four individuals in connection with the recent, disruptive cyber-attacks on retailers M&S and the Co-op. The suspects, including a 20-year-old woman and three males aged 17 to 19, were apprehended on suspicion of blackmail, money laundering, and other computer misuse offenses. The hacks, which involved data theft and ransomware, caused significant operational chaos, leaving some store shelves bare and costing M&S an estimated £300m in lost profits. The arrests mark a significant development in the investigation into the attacks that also targeted luxury retailer Harrods.</p>

          <p>China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, has sharply criticized U.S. trade policies as "neither reasonable nor moral" while urging Southeast Asian (Asean) nations to unite in protecting free trade. Speaking in Bangladesh, Wang contrasted China's zero-tariff treatment for the developing nation with a 35% U.S. tariff, framing Beijing as a reliable partner for stability and development. His comments come as the region navigates the economic pressures of sweeping U.S. tariffs and the broader U.S.-China rivalry.

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has declared his readiness to match any tariffs imposed by the U.S. after President Donald Trump threatened a 50% import tax on Brazilian goods. Trump explicitly linked the tariff threat to the ongoing trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, whom he called a "highly respected leader," demanding an end to the "witch hunt." President Lula rejected the demand, asserting Brazil's sovereignty and stating that any unilateral U.S. tariffs would be met with reciprocal measures. The confrontation marks a significant escalation in tensions, blending trade policy with direct political interference.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports could lead to higher prices for a wide range of consumer goods, from appliances and electronics to electric vehicles. Economists and industry experts warn that because copper is a vital component in electrical wiring, plumbing, and manufacturing, the steep tariff will inevitably be passed on to consumers. The administration argues the tariff is necessary to rebuild the domestic copper industry, which is critical for national security and defense manufacturing. However, critics fear it will fuel inflation and raise costs for key infrastructure and the energy grid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comparison of two recent major floods in New Mexico and Texas reveals how preparedness can dramatically alter outcomes. In Ruidoso, New Mexico, where three people died, the community was anticipating floods due to recent wildfire "burn scars" and had plans in place, allowing for a swift return to near-normalcy. In contrast, the ferocity of the flood in Texas, which killed at least 120, caught many by surprise. Experts note that recent experience with a specific disaster type heavily informs a community's response, suggesting Ruidoso's recent wildfires made residents more vigilant and ready for the subsequent flooding.</p>

Another case involved an official selling documents to cover gambling debts. The announcement is part of Beijing's heightened focus on espionage amid worsening relations with the U.S. and other Western nations, who have in turn accused China of similar tactics.</p>

The legislation expands work requirements to older individuals and parents of teenagers, and also penalizes states for payment errors.

The letters, sent by the Attorney General, effectively claimed a presidential "dispensing power," the long-abolished prerogative of English kings to exempt friends from the law. This power was explicitly outlawed in the 1689 English Bill of Rights and rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court. Critics warn that this assertion of authority to nullify legislation under the guise of foreign policy sets a perilous precedent for the executive branch.</p>

Menzies, convicted of a 1986 murder, chose execution by firing squad decades ago. His lawyers are appealing, arguing his cognitive decline is so severe he cannot rationally understand his punishment, a standard the Supreme Court has previously upheld as a barrier to execution. The judge signed the death warrant despite the pending appeal but scheduled a hearing to re-evaluate Menzies' competency, setting up a legal and ethical battle over executing an inmate with a deteriorating mind.</p>
