            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy voiced skepticism regarding Vladimir Putin's announcement of a temporary Easter ceasefire, noting ongoing air raid alerts and Russian drone activity across Ukraine. Zelenskyy emphasized that Russia had previously ignored a US proposal for a 30-day truce. He stated Ukraine would reciprocate any genuine cessation of hostilities, proposing an extension of the ceasefire to 30 days for true confidence-building. Zelenskyy highlighted continued Russian assault operations and artillery fire, underscoring a lack of trust in Moscow's declarations. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Property owners impacted by recent wildfires in California are suing major insurance carriers, including State Farm, alleging antitrust and unfair competition law violations. The lawsuits claim insurers conspired to force homeowners into the California FAIR Plan, which offers limited coverage at higher premiums. Consumer advocates argue insurers are attempting to offload risk onto the FAIR Plan while continuing to collect premiums from all homeowners, with the FAIR plan facing potential losses of $4 billion from the January fires. The suits allege that insurers colluded to cancel plans, leaving homeowners underinsured with FAIR, seeking triple damages. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A woman in Spain, Lina, was killed by her ex-partner after a police algorithm, VioGén, assessed her risk level as "medium" despite her reporting threats. VioGén, used to allocate police resources, asks 35 questions about abuse and its intensity. The system's failure to accurately predict the threat has raised questions about the reliance on algorithms in domestic violence cases. Critics suggest police are abdicating decision-making to an algorithm, and studies haven't been done to understand how VioGén influences the courts or the police.</p>

            <p>Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins said he was "fuming" to only be a substitute for both of Villa's Champions League quarter-final ties against Paris St-Germain, but against Newcastle on Saturday he channelled his anger perfectly as he scored inside the opening minute and set up another to propel his side to a brilliant 4-1 win. Watkins has started just two of the club's past six games, a fact he is not best pleased with. When asked about Watkins' comments Emery replied: "It's fantastic to be angry and fantastic for him to play like he did [against Newcastle]."</p>
