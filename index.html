          <p>Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed, while State Senator John Hoffman and his wife were injured in targeted shootings. The suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, impersonated a police officer to gain access to the victims' homes. Authorities believe the attacks were politically motivated, and the suspect had a list of potential targets, including other lawmakers and abortion rights advocates. Boelter has been taken into custody after a manhunt, and the community mourns the loss of Hortman and condemns the violence. The Optimism score for this article is based on the fact that a suspect has been apprehended.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has blacklisted China's Huawei and SMIC, adding them to its "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," a move that aligns with U.S. trade policy amid tensions with Beijing. This action requires Taiwanese firms to obtain licenses before shipping products to these companies, reinforcing existing U.S. export restrictions. The decision aims to tighten loopholes and increase penalties for potential breaches, as TSMC has previously faced scrutiny for supplying chips to Huawei. This development occurs against the backdrop of ongoing geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and Mainland China, with China reiterating its stance on reunification. The stability in trade relations, even with restrictions, provides a certain level of predictability.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers two-way star Shohei Ohtani is scheduled to make his pitching return against the San Diego Padres, marking his first MLB game as a pitcher since August 2023. His return has been expedited due to injuries in the Dodgers' bullpen, despite initial expectations for a post-All-Star break comeback. Ohtani has been progressing well in practice and expressed eagerness to pitch in games again, leading the team to utilize his "bullets" in a real game. The Dodgers' manager also mentioned that there is no timeline for the return of rookie right-hander Roki Sasaki, who is currently on the injured list with a shoulder issue.</p>

          <p>The CEOs of Baker Hughes and Woodside Energy are closely monitoring the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel but are hesitant to make firm predictions about oil prices. Both CEOs acknowledged the fluidity of the situation and the potential for significant market impacts, especially concerning supplies through the Strait of Hormuz. While historical geopolitical events have influenced oil prices, forecasting future prices remains uncertain. The CEOs stated that their companies will adopt a wait-and-see approach to project developments, focusing on monitoring and adapting to the evolving situation.

          <p>Shared ownership schemes, intended to help people get on the property ladder, are facing increased scrutiny due to a surge in complaints regarding repairs, costs, and selling difficulties. Many shared owners report feeling trapped, with limited rights and increasing financial burdens. The Housing Ombudsman has seen a significant rise in complaints, particularly in London and the South East, with common issues including service charge increases and slow repair times. While some find shared ownership a necessary option, others describe it as unaffordable and unsustainable, highlighting the need for improved transparency and support for shared owners.</p>

          <p>A commentary in the Los Angeles Times criticizes the Los Angeles Dodgers for remaining silent on recent ICE raids that have instilled fear in the Latino community, which makes up over 40% of their fan base. The article contrasts the Dodgers' silence with statements from other local sports teams, like Angel City FC and LAFC, who expressed solidarity with affected residents. The author accuses the Dodgers of being ungrateful, disrespectful, and cowardly for not offering comfort to their fans during this time of distress. The team's lack of comment is attributed to a fear of offending a portion of their fanbase, highlighting a perceived abdication of social responsibility.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, driven by government subsidies and increased online shopping.

However, industrial output slowed, and fixed-asset investment growth remained below forecasts, with property investment continuing to contract.
