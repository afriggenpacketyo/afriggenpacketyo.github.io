          <p>More than 100 people are reported missing in India's Uttarakhand state after a cloudburst caused severe flash floods in Dharali village. Rescue operations are underway but are hampered by heavy rains and damaged infrastructure, which has prevented disaster response teams from reaching the affected area. The sudden surge of water from the Kheerganga river submerged roads and buildings, and at least 10 soldiers stationed at a nearby army base are among the missing. Officials have not yet recovered any bodies, though local media has reported four fatalities.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of India has decided to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 5.5%, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. This decision comes as India navigates escalating trade tensions with the United States, including threats of new tariffs from President Trump. The central bank had previously made a significant 50-basis-point cut and has now shifted to a "neutral" stance, indicating it will carefully monitor economic data before making future moves. Despite low inflation, the RBI is pausing to assess the macroeconomic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A high-ranking UN official has issued a stark warning about the potential for "catastrophic consequences" if Israel proceeds with a full-scale reoccupation of the Gaza Strip. The warning came in response to reports that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is pushing for such a plan, which would endanger both Palestinian civilians and the remaining Israeli hostages. The official emphasized the severe humanitarian crisis, with thousands facing starvation and inadequate aid access. This potential military escalation has reportedly caused division within Israel's own security leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 41% tariff rate on Syria, the highest for any country, just months after lifting long-standing sanctions. While bilateral trade is minimal, analysts say the move is a significant symbolic blow to a nation desperately needing foreign investment for reconstruction after 13 years of civil war. Experts suggest the tariffs may be a political tool to maintain leverage over Syria's new transitional government, potentially to pressure it on issues like relations with Israel. This policy could endanger the fragile state's recovery and stability. (not investment advice)</p>

The Sparks, who have now won eight of their last nine games, capitalized on the absence of Fever's star rookie Caitlin Clark, who was sidelined with a groin injury. Despite Clark's vocal support from the bench, Indiana could not overcome a strong performance from the fully healthy Sparks roster. The win helps move the Sparks closer to securing a playoff berth in the league.</p>

          <p>Italy's cabinet has passed a draft law that would tighten regulations on gender-affirming medical treatments for individuals under 18. If approved by parliament, the legislation would require that medications like puberty blockers and hormones be dispensed only after approval from a national ethics committee, pending new health ministry protocols. The measure, which also establishes a national registry to monitor treatments, is part of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's socially conservative agenda. Transgender rights advocates have protested the proposed law, which is likely to pass given the government's majority.</p>

          <p>Lebanon's government has directed its army to formulate a plan by the end of the year to ensure that only state institutions possess weapons, a move that would effectively disarm the militant group Hezbollah. This decision is a key component of implementing a November 2024 ceasefire agreement that followed over a year of hostilities with Israel. Hezbollah, an Iran-backed political party and the country's most powerful military force, has indicated it will not disarm while facing what it calls Israeli aggression, setting the stage for a potential internal conflict.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker AMD reported second-quarter financial results that saw revenue of $7.69 billion, exceeding analyst expectations. However, its adjusted earnings per share of 48 cents missed estimates, causing the company's stock to fall about 5% in after-hours trading. The company saw strong performance in its PC and gaming divisions, but its AI chip business declined year-over-year, partly due to U.S. export restrictions on sales to China. AMD's outlook for the current quarter anticipates sales of $8.7 billion, which is above market predictions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to reallocate over $4 billion in disaster relief funds from FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The injunction was granted in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued that unlawfully ending the program would cause "irreparable harm" to communities relying on the funds for flood mitigation and other resilience projects. The judge stated that the court was not convinced Congress intended for the money to be repurposed, halting the transfer while the case proceeds.</p>

          <p>Sources close to Sean "Diddy" Combs' legal team report that the rapper, who was recently convicted on prostitution-related charges, has contacted Donald Trump about a potential presidential pardon. President Trump confirmed in an interview that he had been approached but expressed doubt about granting clemency, citing Combs' past political hostility. Combs was denied bail ahead of his sentencing in October, where he faces up to 20 years in prison. This development adds a political dimension to the legal troubles of the once-dominant hip-hop mogul.</p>

          <p>A state-owned Chinese corporation has announced significant progress on the Mes Aynak copper mine in Afghanistan, with extraction potentially starting this year. The project, holding one of the world's largest untouched copper deposits, was awarded to the company in 2008 but has been stalled for 17 years due to security challenges and the presence of ancient Buddhist archaeological sites. The Taliban government has reportedly agreed to a costlier underground mining process to protect the historical relics, clearing a major hurdle for the long-delayed venture.</p>

While violent and property crimes have decreased, experts note that the rate of aggravated assaults remains higher than pre-pandemic levels.

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed 82 degrees Fahrenheit. This ordinance is designed to protect vulnerable tenants from the increasing danger of extreme heat waves driven by climate change. The law will take effect next month but will not be enforced until 2027, giving landlords time to comply, with an emphasis on passive cooling solutions like reflective roofing and blackout curtains over just air conditioning.

The scathing 300-page report faults OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, who perished in the incident, for negligence, ignoring safety warnings, and using an inadequately designed vessel with a carbon fiber hull. Investigators found a lack of proper certification, maintenance, and inspections, stating that Rush would likely have faced criminal charges had he survived.
