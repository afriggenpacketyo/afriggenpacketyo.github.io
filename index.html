          <p>Minnesota State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were shot a combined 17 times during an attack at their home. The attack occurred shortly before the alleged gunman, Vance Luther Boelter, murdered Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. The Hoffmans were at a Democratic fundraising dinner earlier that evening and were asleep when Boelter began pounding on their door, identifying himself as a police officer. The couple is recovering in the hospital, while Boelter faces multiple charges, and police are investigating a potential political motive for the attacks. Optimism is present in the fact that the couple is recovering, and that their daughter, Hope, was able to call 911, alerting the authorities to the incident.</p>
