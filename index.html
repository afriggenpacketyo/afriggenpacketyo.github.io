          <p>The Pinellas County Medical Examiner's Office has confirmed that actor Julian McMahon, known for his roles in "Nip/Tuck" and "Charmed," died from lung metastasis resulting from head and neck cancer. His death, at age 56, was ruled natural, and his wife, Kelly McMahon, had previously announced he passed away peacefully after a valiant battle with the illness. McMahon, the son of a former Australian prime minister, had a prolific career in television and film, including playing Doctor Doom in the "Fantastic Four" movies. His family has requested privacy while expressing gratitude for the joy he brought to his fans and loved ones.</p>

          <p>A 54-pound meteorite, confirmed to be the largest piece of Mars on Earth, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's with an estimated value of up to $4 million. The rock, designated NWA 16788, was discovered in Niger's Sahara Desert in 2023 after a 140-million-mile journey through space, likely dislodged from Mars by an asteroid impact. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, constituting only about 0.6% of all meteorites found on our planet. This particular specimen represents a significant portion of all known Martian material on Earth, offering valuable data for scientific research.</p>

          <p>Tensions flared in Ventura County, California, as federal immigration agents clashed with protesters during a raid on an agricultural farm. The incident, which saw agents use crowd control measures and detain at least one person, is one of several recent large-scale immigration operations in the region. These enforcement actions follow President Trump's directive for a mass deportation program, which has included the deployment of thousands of troops to California. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass criticized a similar recent operation in the city as a political act intended to provoke fear.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new 35% tariff on all goods imported from Canada, set to take effect on August 1. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump cited Canada's retaliatory tariffs as the reason for the new measure, which will be applied on top of existing sectoral tariffs. The President also linked the tariff to the flow of fentanyl, suggesting the rate could be adjusted if Canada cooperates on stopping the drug's trafficking. He further warned that any increase in Canadian tariffs would be added to the 35% duty. (not investment advice)</p>

The sample, a hockey-puck-shaped piece of vertebra, was found over 750 feet deep and is believed to belong to a small, plant-eating dinosaur from about 67.5 million years ago. Museum officials described the find as incredibly rare, likening the odds to hitting a hole-in-one from the moon.

Many of the families being helped have already had a member detained or deported.

          <p>President Trump's threat of a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports is based on a contentious use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a law already central to a court challenge against his administration. The IEEPA grants presidents economic powers to address foreign threats, but critics argue Trump is misusing it for political purposes, such as retaliating against Brazil for the prosecution of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro. Legal experts and Democratic senators have called the move an abuse of power, noting it falls far outside the president's legal authority. The action further complicates the administration's aggressive and legally contested trade agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

The eight most resonant words are identified as: people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together. Bruni-Lowe argues these words act as "emotional shortcuts" that work across different cultures and political ideologies, though they don't guarantee victory on their own.

He argues that as machines think for us, human brains atrophy, turning people into "dumbed down machines that are taking instructions." In an interview, Welsh reflected on the 1990s as an era when "people had lives," contrasting it with today's internet-dominated culture, which he sees as a controlling rather than enabling force. He is publishing a new novel, "Men in Love," which returns to the characters of his most famous work.</p>

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, an opinion article reflects on the international community's recurring declaration of "never again" in the face of mass atrocities. The author, Ed Husic, shares the story of a Srebrenica survivor and highlights the painful cycle of witnessing unimaginable suffering, followed by belated international action and legal recognition of genocide. The piece draws a direct parallel between the horrors of past events like the Holocaust, Rwanda, and Srebrenica and the current suffering of civilians in Gaza. It questions how much longer this pattern will continue before meaningful, preventative action is taken.</p>

          <p>Tesla has submitted an application to test and deploy its Robotaxi service in the Phoenix metropolitan area, a market where rival Waymo has operated since 2020. The move signals Tesla's intent to expand its autonomous vehicle program beyond its initial pilot in Austin, Texas. The Arizona Department of Transportation is expected to make a decision on the application by the end of July. Tesla's approach, which primarily relies on cameras rather than more expensive sensors like lidar, is part of its strategy to make autonomous vehicles more economically viable, though its Austin pilot has experienced some documented incidents.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing an exceptionally warm 2025, with the warmest spring on record and the third heatwave of the year already underway. This article explains that these are not isolated events but part of a clear trend driven by human-influenced climate change, which makes extreme heat more frequent and intense. Scientists note that a 1°C rise in global average temperature can translate to heatwaves that are 3-4°C warmer in the UK. The piece debunks the idea that this is "just summer," pointing out that current heatwaves are hotter and more widespread than historical events like the summer of 1976.</p>

          <p>Despite South Korea having the world's lowest birth rate, its fertility clinics are experiencing a significant boom, with treatments rising nearly 50% between 2018 and 2022. This paradox is driven by a shift in attitudes, as more individuals and couples delay starting families due to social and financial pressures, then turn to treatments like IVF later in life. While the government is subsidizing procedures to combat the demographic crisis, patients still face high out-of-pocket costs and workplace pressures. The trend suggests a persistent desire for children that is constrained by economic and cultural barriers.</p>

          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals that the duration of heat waves is increasing at a rate faster than the overall pace of global warming. The findings indicate that the longest and rarest heat waves are showing the greatest increases in frequency, meaning even small increments of planetary warming will have a disproportionately large impact. This non-linear effect underscores the urgent need for accelerated adaptation strategies to protect people, agriculture, and infrastructure from extreme heat. The study warns that without this, the risks associated with longer, more intense heat waves will grow significantly faster than anticipated.</p>

Critics, including the National Head Start Association, warn this will create fear and confusion among all families and is part of a broader strategy to make life more difficult for immigrants.

          <p>President Trump's recent threat to impose a 50% tariff on Brazil was reportedly driven by a combination of political factors, not trade deficits. According to sources, Trump's anger was fueled by Brazil's role in the BRICS coalition of emerging economies, which he views as a threat to the U.S. dollar, and his personal support for former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. The formal letter announcing the tariff cited Bolsonaro's ongoing prosecution as a "Witch Hunt." This use of trade policy for overtly political goals highlights the administration's strategy of leveraging economic tools to achieve non-trade-related foreign policy objectives.</p>
