        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has fired Desiree Leigh Grace, who was appointed by federal judges as the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. This decision came hours after the judges selected Grace, a career prosecutor, over President Trump's preferred candidate, former personal attorney Alina Habba, whose temporary appointment had expired. The move sets up a potential conflict over presidential appointment powers, with the Justice Department asserting its authority against what it termed a decision by a "partisan bench." The administration has indicated it will not recognize the judges' appointment.</p>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the legendary vocalist for the heavy metal band Black Sabbath and a successful solo artist, has passed away at the age of 76. His family confirmed his death, which followed a public battle with Parkinson's disease and other health issues that led to his retirement from touring. Known as the "Prince of Darkness," Osbourne's career spanned over five decades, marked by iconic music, controversial stage antics, and a later-in-life resurgence as a beloved television personality. He was a two-time inductee into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos recently held a private meeting at the White House that lasted for over an hour. The discussion's specific topics were not disclosed, but it occurs amidst a changing dynamic between the two, who were often at odds during Trump's first term. This meeting also takes place as Bezos reportedly seeks to leverage a recent falling-out between Trump and fellow billionaire Elon Musk. Both Bezos's Blue Origin and Musk's SpaceX are competitors for government contracts in the aerospace sector.</p>

          <p>Following England's 13-run loss to India, which resulted in a 2-1 series defeat, former legendary bowler Katherine Sciver-Brunt has questioned the team's mentality. She suggested that some players appear "timid" and occasionally "lazy," lacking the on-field passion she was known for during her career. Sciver-Brunt pointed to fielding errors and a fear of failure as potential signs of a deeper mental issue within the squad. She clarified that while she believes the players want to win, they may need to be stronger and more outwardly competitive.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated he is considering the elimination of the federal capital gains tax on profits from home sales. This potential policy change, championed by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, aims to address the housing market's inventory shortage by incentivizing homeowners, particularly seniors, to sell. Currently, individuals can exclude up to $250,000 and joint filers up to $500,000 in gains. Critics argue that removing the tax would primarily benefit wealthy Americans, while supporters claim it would unlock housing supply for all buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of the department store chain Kohl's experienced a dramatic and volatile surge, closing up 37% after more than doubling at one point. The wild trading, which occurred without any apparent corporate news, resembled past meme stock rallies, fueled by discussion on social media platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. The stock is heavily shorted, making it a target for a potential short squeeze by retail investors. Despite the share price jump, analysts note that the company's underlying business fundamentals remain weak amid falling sales. (not investment advice)</p>

Democrats have fiercely rejected these claims, accusing Gabbard of misrepresenting intelligence to fit a political narrative and noting that multiple bipartisan reviews have confirmed Russia's efforts to influence the election.</p>
