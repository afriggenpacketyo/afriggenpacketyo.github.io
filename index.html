          <p>In response to escalating protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), President Trump deployed Marines to Los Angeles, a move opposed by California Governor Gavin Newsom.  A federal appeals court temporarily delayed an order requiring the return of National Guard control to Newsom, providing a reprieve for the Trump administration's policy. Tensions remain high between the president and the governor as protests continue across multiple U.S. cities. The deployment of Marines marks a significant escalation of the situation.</p>
