        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's sweeping tariff policy has sent shockwaves through global markets, particularly impacting Europe.  The EU faces 20% duties, while the UK receives a lower 10% due to its more balanced trade relationship.  Luxury goods, food and beverage manufacturers, automakers, and banks are among the hardest hit sectors, while some European currencies experienced a temporary rally.  The long-term economic consequences remain uncertain, with widespread predictions of slowed growth and fractured trade ties.</p>
