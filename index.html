          <p>Hinge Health, a digital physical therapy startup, successfully priced its IPO at $32 per share, reaching the high end of its projected range and raising approximately $273 million. Founded in 2014, the company offers software-based remote rehabilitation services and will be listed on the NYSE under the ticker 'HNGE'. While its IPO valuation is lower than its previous private market valuation, Hinge Health's revenue has grown significantly, reporting a net income of $17.1 million in the first quarter, a notable turnaround from the previous year. The IPO is being closely monitored as a potential sign of recovery for the digital health sector after a period of slowdown.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is preparing to transport Abrams tanks and other military vehicles to Washington, D.C., for a parade commemorating its 250th anniversary, an event coinciding with President Trump's birthday and triggering speculation about its purpose. The parade, which will feature historical reenactors and military displays, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million, with additional security expenses expected. The Army plans to mitigate potential road damage by using rubber treads and metal plates, while soldiers will be housed in federal buildings with provided stipends and meals.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas lawmakers have moved forward with a bill to clarify medical exceptions within the state's restrictive abortion ban, which currently only permits abortions to save the mother's life. The bill specifies that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment, defining a 'life-threatening' condition as one capable of causing death. While not expanding abortion access or including exceptions for rape or incest, the bill represents a shift for Texas Republicans who have long defended the existing law. The legislation aims to address confusion among doctors, though some abortion-rights advocates remain skeptical about its impact.</p>

Khalil was only able to meet his month-old baby behind glass, prompting outrage from his wife, Noor Abdalla, who described the situation as deliberate violence. Khalil, a legal permanent resident, was arrested in New York in March and detained without due process, marking the first in a series of ICE arrests targeting pro-Palestinian students and scholars.

The flight carrying the deportees landed in Djibouti, East Africa, and included citizens from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, South Sudan, Burma, and Vietnam, all convicted of crimes including murder, sexual assault, and robbery.

Investors are demanding higher yields on U.S. debt to compensate for the increased risk, with the 30-year bond yield topping 5% and the 10-year note nearing 4.6%.

          <h2>"Tush Push" Play Remains Legal in NFL After Vote Fails</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 17:59:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NFL has decided to keep the "tush push" play legal after a proposal to ban it failed to gain the required majority vote at the spring league meetings. The Philadelphia Eagles are particularly successful with this play, which involves pushing the quarterback forward on short-yardage situations. The Green Bay Packers had requested the ban, citing player safety and pace of play, but the NFL has previously stated that no injuries have been reported on the play. Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie defended the play, emphasizing the importance of the health and safety of the players.</p>

          <p>The FDA's new approach to COVID-19 vaccines, influenced by new leadership, may limit access to initial COVID-19 vaccine series for healthy children. The agency will require new clinical trial data for approving new formulations of COVID shots for healthy individuals under 65, potentially affecting the availability of vaccines for children. Experts express concern that this policy shift could leave children vulnerable to the virus without initial protection, despite the proven safety and benefits of the vaccines. The FDA's decision has sparked controversy, as it deviates from the established practice of recommending vaccines for children against preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has invalidated regulations mandating that most U.S. employers provide workers with time off and accommodations for abortions, siding with conservative lawmakers and religious groups. Judge David Joseph ruled that the EEOC exceeded its authority by including abortion among pregnancy-related conditions in regulations implementing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The ruling marks a victory for opponents of abortion rights, who argued that Congress did not intend for the law to cover abortions. The decision has been condemned by women's rights advocates, who view it as an attack on reproductive freedom.</p>
