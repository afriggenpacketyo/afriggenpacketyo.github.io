        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has reached an agreement with the Trump administration to reduce prescription drug costs for Medicaid. The deal involves adopting "most-favored-nation" pricing, which aligns U.S. prices with the lowest costs paid in other developed nations. In exchange for this and a commitment to expand U.S. manufacturing, including a $4.5 billion facility in Virginia, the company will receive exemptions from certain tariffs. This agreement follows a similar deal with Pfizer and is part of a broader administration effort to lower drug costs, which includes a planned "TrumpRx.gov" website for direct-to-consumer sales.

The arrangement will allow Qatari pilots to train alongside U.S. military personnel, enhancing interoperability between the two allied nations. The decision has drawn criticism from some right-wing activists, citing past allegations of Qatar financing terrorism, which the nation denies. This development is another sign of the deepening relationship between the U.S. and Qatar under the current administration, which also includes recent security guarantees and gifts from the Qatari government.</p>

          <p>A significant increase in the arrival of Chagos Islanders claiming British citizenship has created a financial strain on Hillingdon Council in London, which is legally obligated to provide temporary housing. The council reports spending millions to support over 600 new arrivals since last July, warning that the cost is straining its resources. Many Chagossians are leaving Mauritius, citing safety concerns after the UK agreed to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands. The UK government maintains that the arrivals are unrelated to the deal and that individuals were expected to arrange their own housing.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced plans to implement a new 100% tariff on all goods imported from China, set to take effect on November 1. This move is a direct response to what the administration describes as China's "extraordinarily aggressive" decision to impose wide-ranging export controls on its products, including rare-earth minerals. The announcement, which also includes new U.S. export controls on critical software, triggered a significant selloff in the stock market. The president also suggested he might cancel an upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, escalating the ongoing trade war between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has confirmed that mass firings of federal employees, known as reductions-in-force, have begun as the government shutdown continues. Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought announced the start of the layoffs, with the president stating they would be "Democrat-oriented," a claim that drew sharp criticism. The American Federation of Government Employees, a major federal workers' union, condemned the move as "disgraceful" and "illegal," noting that such an action during a shutdown is unprecedented. The firings escalate the political standoff with Congress, which has yet to reach a funding agreement.</p>

          <p>Navan, a company specializing in corporate travel and expense software, has set its initial public offering price range at $24 to $26 per share. This pricing would give the company a market capitalization of up to $6.5 billion, which is notably lower than its private valuation from 2022. The company, formerly known as TripActions, is proceeding with its IPO despite the ongoing government shutdown, which has impacted some operations at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Navan joins a recent resurgence of tech IPOs in 2025, planning to trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol "NAVN." (not investment advice)</p>

The blast occurred Friday at a plant owned by Accurate Energetic Systems, which specializes in producing high-grade military explosives like C-4 and TNT. Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis described the scene as total devastation, with nothing left of the building where the explosion happened. The cause of the blast is currently under investigation by multiple local, state, and federal agencies, including the FBI and ATF, in what is being called a "slow and methodical" process.</p>

          <p>The recent federal indictments of two prominent Donald Trump critics, New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey, have fueled concerns that the Department of Justice is being used for political retribution. The cases are being pursued by a newly installed prosecutor who, according to the article, appears to be acting on the White House's wishes, bypassing internal DOJ norms that typically prevent such politically charged prosecutions. This situation reflects a breakdown of the post-Watergate standards for maintaining law enforcement independence from the presidency, potentially leading to a hollowing out of talent at the DOJ as experienced prosecutors leave.</p>

          <p>A peace deal between Israel and Hamas was achieved through President Trump's unconventional diplomatic approach, which combined personal relationships, bellicose threats, and a disregard for traditional foreign policy norms. The administration's 20-point plan was drafted by a team including Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff, who leveraged ties with both Israel and Arab nations to push for an agreement. Trump's volatility and frustration with an unauthorized Israeli airstrike in Qatar created pressure on all sides, ultimately leading to a breakthrough where previous efforts had failed. The deal marks a significant diplomatic event, though its long-term stability remains uncertain.</p>

Instead, signs of strain are reportedly appearing among Republicans, who have been caught off guard by some of the White House's messaging.

The court determined he did not understand his potential fate, leaving him in a state of legal limbo for three decades.

The movie brings sentient computer programs into the real world but struggles to explore its themes about artificial intelligence with any depth. While the action sequences and neon-drenched aesthetic are impressive, the story is undercut by a "charisma vacuum" performance from star Jared Leto as the titular AI character. The review concludes that the film, like its predecessors, prioritizes its glossy, futuristic look over a coherent or compelling narrative, resulting in an ultimately shallow experience.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has officially taken effect, with the Israeli military confirming a partial withdrawal of its forces to agreed-upon positions within Gaza. Following the implementation of the deal, thousands of displaced Palestinians have begun traveling back to the heavily bombarded northern parts of the Strip. The agreement, brokered by the U.S., requires Hamas to release all Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. It also stipulates that up to 600 aid trucks should be allowed into Gaza daily to address the severe humanitarian crisis and famine conditions.</p>

          <h2>White House Denounces Nobel Committee for Awarding Peace Prize to Venezuelan Activist Over President Trump</h2>

          <p>The White House has strongly criticized the Nobel Committee for awarding the 2025 Peace Prize to Venezuelan pro-democracy activist María Corina Machado instead of President Donald Trump. A White House spokesperson accused the committee of prioritizing "politics over peace," arguing that the president deserved the award for his role in brokering the recent Gaza ceasefire and other global peace deals. President Trump has long expressed a desire for the prize, and many of his international allies have publicly supported his candidacy. Machado, in her acceptance, thanked President Trump for his support of her cause.</p>

          <h2>Families of D.C. Plane Crash Victims Advocate for Aviation Safety Reform on Capitol Hill</h2>

          <p>Family members of those who died in the January plane crash over the Potomac River were on Capitol Hill this week to push for aviation safety reforms, expressing concern that the government shutdown could delay progress. The victims' families met with senators and the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board to advocate for legislation that would require all aircraft, including military ones, to use tracking technology. The Black Hawk helicopter involved in the fatal collision was not using this equipment. The families emphasized that aviation safety is a nonpartisan issue and that essential transportation systems should not be compromised by political gridlock.</p>
