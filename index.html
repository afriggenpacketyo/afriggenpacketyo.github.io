        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court ruled that the Trump administration can restrict journalists' access to certain areas of the White House based on their viewpoints. The 2-1 decision overturned a previous ruling that required the White House to grant the Associated Press full access to covering the president. The court stated that the restricted spaces are not First Amendment forums and the White House retains discretion over journalist admittance. A dissenting judge warned that this decision could harm press freedom and prevent critical journalism, while the majority opinion argued it protects the president's independence. Optimism about the future of journalism is low.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed executive orders designed to bolster America's drone industry, enhance airspace security, and strengthen military readiness. These orders could potentially exclude Chinese manufacturers like DJI and Autel Robotics from the US market. The administration cited concerns about foreign-made drones endangering the public and compromising critical infrastructure. The orders also call for federal investment in US drone production to revitalize a domestic sector overshadowed by Chinese competition, however, the directives did not name specific countries or companies. This move expands on previous efforts to restrict drones linked to foreign adversaries.</p>

          <p>The article explains the role of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nonpartisan agency that analyzes the budgetary impacts of proposed legislation. Republicans have criticized the CBO's projection that their signature legislation would increase federal deficits by $2.4 trillion over a decade. The CBO was established in 1974 to provide Congress with objective information, acting as a counterbalance to the executive branch's Office of Management and Budget. While CBO cost estimates are advisory and don't make policy recommendations, critics on both sides of the aisle have questioned the agency's accuracy, but many defend its nonpartisanship.

          <p>Apple's AI strategy is under scrutiny as its initial response to generative AI, Apple Intelligence, has been underwhelming compared to competitors like OpenAI and Google. Investors are urging Apple to make significant strides in AI, especially after executives suggested AI could replace the iPhone in the future. The rollout of Apple Intelligence features has been rocky, with delays and the removal of a text summarization tool due to inaccuracies. The company is also facing class-action suits from customers who claim they were misled into buying new iPhones based on advertised AI features, and its best chance to quickly catch up may be to acquire a company, and turn it into a killer feature.</p>

This endorsement comes after the first mayoral primary debate, where Cuomo faced attacks over his handling of nursing home deaths and sexual harassment allegations during his time as governor. Ramos's endorsement has been met with dismay from her progressive allies, while Cuomo stated he would not be returning the endorsement.</p>

This anti-managerialism seeks to roll back bureaucratic control in various sectors, from government to corporations, and is essential for understanding the Trump administration's efforts to transform America's institutions.</p>

          <p>England secured a 21-run victory against the West Indies in the first T20 international match held in Chester-le-Street. Liam Dawson marked his return to international cricket with four wickets, while Jos Buttler contributed a superb 96 runs. England successfully defended a total of 189, with the West Indies collapsing from 91-2 to 115-6 due to Dawson's skillful bowling. This win extends England's successful start under new captain Harry Brook, who replaced Buttler, and the team now aims to clinch the T20 series in the upcoming match in Bristol.</p>

          <p>"We Are Guardians" is a documentary that examines the ongoing deforestation crisis in the Amazon and the efforts of Indigenous people to combat illegal logging and mining. The film follows MarÒ«al, a family man from the Arariboia territory, and Puyr TembÃ©, an activist working to increase Indigenous women's political representation. It also features perspectives from a logger and a landowner, highlighting the complexities of the issue. While the documentary effectively underscores the problem and the push-back efforts, it is more of a highlighting of issues than a documentary journey.</p>

The Trump administration's attempts to eliminate visa programs threaten Harvard's ability to maintain its international academic community, and the reality of Harvard is far from Trump's perception.</p>

This decision followed Musk's tenure as head of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and preceded Musk's increased criticism of Trump's tax and spending bill. Trump accused Musk of being irritated by cuts to electric vehicle tax credits and suggested he suffers from "Trump derangement syndrome." Despite Politico's report of a slated phone call, Trump stated he would not be speaking to Musk, and the feud highlights the complex dynamics between politics and industry.</p>

Relations between the two countries deteriorated after former PM Justin Trudeau accused India of involvement in the killing of a Sikh separatist leader on Canadian soil. While India strongly rejected the allegations, the invitation to the G7 summit suggests a willingness to re-engage in dialogue.

They also criticized the administration's proposed budget, which slashes spending for medical services while increasing funding for private sector care. Speakers highlighted concerns about declining quality of care and the impact on vulnerable veterans, and the event was held on the anniversary of D-day to honor the sacrifices of veterans.</p>
