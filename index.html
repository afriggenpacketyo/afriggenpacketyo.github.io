        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated a significant reorganization by laying off over 1,300 civil service and foreign service employees. This move is part of a broader Trump administration plan to reduce the department's domestic workforce by about 15% and streamline operations by consolidating offices, such as those handling sanctions. Critics, including Democratic senators and the American Foreign Service Association, argue the cuts could undermine U.S. diplomatic capabilities and national security, particularly as they affect bureaus focused on human rights, refugees, and foreign assistance. The administration maintains the changes are necessary to eliminate redundancy and focus on core missions.</p>

          <p>A 52-year-old man from San Antonio, Texas, has been arrested for allegedly posting violent threats against President Donald Trump on Facebook. The threats were made in response to a news post about the president's planned visit to survey flood damage in Kerrville. The suspect allegedly commented "I won’t miss" under a photo related to a previous assassination attempt and posted a picture of himself with a rifle. Federal officials charged him with making threats against the president and interstate threatening communications, emphasizing that such actions are not protected by free speech.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania's statewide Next Generation 911 network suffered intermittent connectivity issues, causing sporadic failures in emergency call processing. While some calls connected normally, others lacked critical data like caller location or callback numbers, prompting officials to issue public alerts. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA) activated a monitoring bridge with all call centers and vendors to address the problem. While the cause is under investigation, officials do not suspect a cyberattack and have advised residents to use local seven-digit emergency numbers as a backup, urging against test calls to the 911 system.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the fatal Air India crash that killed over 270 people found that the fuel cutoff switches for both engines were activated shortly after takeoff. According to the report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, the cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot questioning the other about the action, which led to a loss of thrust. The flight lasted only 32 seconds. While the report does not assign cause or intent, aviation experts suggest this points away from a mechanical failure with the Boeing aircraft or its engines and toward a deliberate or inadvertent human action in the cockpit.</p>

          <p>The western Mediterranean Sea is experiencing an unprecedented marine heatwave for this time of year, with sea surface temperatures exceeding 30°C, several degrees above the norm. Scientists express grave concern over the potentially devastating impact on marine life, as prolonged, intense heat can lead to mass mortality events for species like seagrasses, which are vital to the ecosystem. This phenomenon, driven by climate change, also poses risks to fisheries and can increase the spread of harmful bacteria. The early and intense heat suggests a longer, more severe summer, highlighting the Mediterranean's vulnerability as a climate change hotspot.</p>

Powell has defended the renovation project, stating that claims of extravagant features like private elevators and rooftop gardens are inaccurate.

This recalibration comes as his government faces domestic debate over the AUKUS security pact and defense spending.

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to proceed. The lawsuit alleges that the social media platform intentionally uses manipulative and addictive design features to exploit young users, keeping them engaged for longer to increase ad exposure and drive e-commerce sales. The judge ruled the state's claims were valid as they focused on the app's allegedly dangerous features, not its user-generated content. This case is part of a broader trend of states targeting the design and safety policies of tech companies rather than content, which has greater legal protection.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is facing criticism over his strategy in trade negotiations with the U.S. after President Trump threatened a new 35% tariff on Canadian goods. Carney, who won an election promising to be assertive with the U.S., has recently made concessions, such as scrapping a planned digital services tax, which have not yet appeared to de-escalate the trade conflict. While some analysts urge patience, others argue that Canada's concessions have achieved "less than nothing" and question the effectiveness of the government's approach. The ongoing negotiations are a major test for Carney's leadership amid unpredictable pressure from the Trump administration.</p>
