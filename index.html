          <p>ABC has taken 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' off the air for an indefinite period following controversial comments made by the host. During a monologue, Kimmel linked the man accused of killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement, sparking significant backlash. The decision followed pressure from the FCC chairman, who suggested ABC's broadcast license could be at risk, and a move by Nexstar Media Group to preempt the show on its affiliate stations. Disney, ABC's parent company, reportedly plans to speak with Kimmel before he returns to the air, indicating he has not been fired.</p>

          <p>With a government shutdown looming on October 1, congressional Democrats have presented a counteroffer to the Republican funding plan. The Democratic proposal would fund the government through October 31 and includes key priorities like extending Affordable Care Act subsidies and restoring certain funding cuts. Meanwhile, House Republicans are advancing their own bill to keep the government open until November 21, which also allocates funds for increased security for lawmakers. The significant policy differences, particularly over health subsidies, highlight the partisan impasse as the deadline approaches without bipartisan negotiations underway.</p>

          <p>Orca Wiesblatt, a 25-year-old minor league hockey player, has passed away following a traffic accident in British Columbia, Canada. His agency and former team, the Athens Rock Lobsters, confirmed the tragic news, remembering him for his passion, kindness, and humility. Wiesblatt and his siblings were known for raising awareness for the deaf community, as their parents are both deaf. He had recently signed with the Allen Americans of the ECHL, and the hockey community is mourning the loss of a player described as having an infectious smile and momentum-changing presence on the ice.</p>

          <p>A UK Education Select Committee report is urging the government not to eliminate Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) for children with special educational needs. The report emphasizes that these legally binding plans serve as a crucial accountability measure for parents. In addition to preserving EHCPs, the committee recommends establishing national minimum standards for special needs support in schools, increasing teacher training, and boosting per-pupil funding. This comes as the government prepares to announce reforms for a system that has been criticized as financially unsustainable despite a rising number of children requiring support.</p>

          <h2>California's Poverty Rate Remains Highest in the U.S., Report Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 19:30:03 EDT</div>

          <p>A new report from the California Budget and Policy Center reveals that California, along with Louisiana, continues to have the highest poverty rate in the United States. In 2024, approximately 17.7% of residents could not afford basic necessities, a significant increase from a historic low of 11% in 2021. The report attributes this surge to the expiration of pandemic-era aid programs like the enhanced federal child tax credit, arguing that poverty is a direct result of policy choices. With federal and state budget cuts looming, the authors warn that poverty rates could rise further without bold action from state leaders.</p>

          <p>Florida has executed David Pittman for the 1990 murders of his estranged wife's parents and sister. Pittman, 63, was pronounced dead after receiving a lethal injection. This marks the 12th execution in Florida in 2025, the highest number in a single year since the state reinstated capital punishment. Governor Ron DeSantis has signed more death warrants this year than any of his predecessors. Pittman was convicted of stabbing the three victims, setting their house on fire, and stealing a car. His final appeals, which argued he had an intellectual disability, were denied by the courts.</p>

          <p>Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone stated he regrets his reaction at the end of a dramatic 3-2 Champions League loss to Liverpool but claimed it was provoked by insults from home supporters. After Virgil van Dijk scored the winning goal in stoppage time, Simeone was seen complaining to the fourth official and had to be separated from fans by stewards before being sent off. While acknowledging that managers should not react in such a way, he called for action against the insults he claims to have received throughout the game, questioning what it's like to be insulted for 90 minutes.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is reviewing numerous social media posts allegedly from U.S. service members that mock or celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has publicly condemned such commentary as "completely unacceptable," and several service members have already been suspended or removed from duties pending investigation. While civilian employees have broad free speech rights, uniformed personnel operate under the stricter Uniform Code of Military Justice. Legal experts note that while the code is broad, proving a violation in a court-martial for such posts could be challenging for prosecutors.</p>

          <p>A man is in custody after allegedly ramming his car into the entrance gate of the FBI's field office in Pittsburgh in what an official initially called a "targeted attack." The suspect, identified as Donald Henson, crashed the vehicle early Wednesday morning, then reportedly threw an American flag over the gate before leaving on foot. He was apprehended later. The FBI stated that Henson had recently visited the office to make a complaint that lacked a federal nexus and is believed to have a history of mental health issues. No injuries were reported in the incident.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva declared that he has "no relationship" with U.S. President Donald Trump, signaling a breakdown in communication between the leaders of the two largest economies in the Americas. Lula criticized Trump's recent imposition of 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods as "eminently political," stating he learned about them through newspapers rather than diplomatic channels. He contrasted this with his relationships with other world leaders, asserting that Trump's connection is with former president Jair Bolsonaro, not with Brazil as a nation.</p>

          <p>The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is set to convene under intense political scrutiny following a complete overhaul of its membership by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The panel, now composed of many allies who have previously questioned vaccine safety, will vote on recommendations for MMRV, hepatitis B, and COVID-19 vaccines. Public health experts are concerned that the committee's decisions could be driven by political ideology rather than scientific consensus, potentially restricting vaccine access and eroding public trust at a critical time.

          <p>Birdie G’s, a highly praised Santa Monica restaurant known for its inventive blend of Midwestern, Jewish, and Californian cuisine, will permanently close in December. Chef-owner Jeremy Fox attributed the decision to a combination of factors, including the restaurant's large size, its challenging location within the Bergamot Station complex, and sustained economic pressures. A significant drop in business following the nearby Palisades fire in January was described as the "nail in the coffin." Despite earning critical acclaim and a spot on the L.A. Times 101 list, the restaurant struggled to maintain consistent business in recent years.</p>

This declaration follows a recent UN commission report that reached a similar conclusion. Sanders called for an end to U.S. complicity, demanding an immediate ceasefire, a surge in humanitarian aid, and an end to military aid for what he termed a "genocidal government."</p>

          <p>Amid widespread distrust in the CDC under the leadership of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., public health experts are directing Americans to alternative sources for reliable health guidance. With the CDC's credibility in question, particularly on vaccines, experts recommend turning to professional medical organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. These groups develop independent, science-based recommendations. While no single institution can fully replace the CDC's role in creating a national consensus, these organizations are seen as crucial for navigating the fragmented information landscape.</p>
