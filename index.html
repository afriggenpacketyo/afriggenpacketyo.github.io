        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The use of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is rapidly expanding, with nearly half of Americans having tried them. These services offer consumers short-term, interest-free installment plans, posing a direct challenge to the revenue models of traditional credit card companies. Banks and credit institutions are wary, as BNPL transactions reduce credit card usage and create a significant gap in their understanding of a consumer's overall credit risk. This lack of visibility into BNPL debt is described as a "giant black hole" in consumer credit profiles, complicating risk assessment for lenders.</p>

          <p>Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen experienced a concerning moment during the first quarter against the New York Jets, appearing to hit his head on a player's knee during a run. After leaving the field with a profusely bleeding nose, he was briefly replaced by backup Mitchell Trubisky. Allen returned at the start of the second quarter and successfully led his team to a decisive 30-10 victory. Despite the injury scare, he finished the game with 148 passing yards and 59 rushing yards, helping the Bills advance to a 2-0 season start.</p>

          <p>The final stage of the Vuelta a España cycling race was abruptly abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters breached the course in central Madrid, knocking down barriers and occupying the road. The demonstrations, which were part of ongoing protests against the Israel-Premier Tech team's participation, led to safety concerns and clashes with police. As a result of the cancellation, race leader Jonas Vingegaard of Denmark was declared the overall winner without a formal podium presentation. The incident has sparked political controversy in Spain, with officials debating the role of government rhetoric in encouraging the disruptive protests.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has brought renewed attention to a recent Utah law permitting individuals with concealed-carry permits to openly carry firearms on college campuses. The legislation, which passed in August, added to the state's already permissive gun laws, which include permitless carry and a lack of red-flag laws. While the suspect's legal right to possess the rifle on campus is unclear, the incident highlights the ongoing debate over campus safety. Critics argue that such laws are inadequate against politically motivated violence, while proponents believe an armed populace can deter attacks.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley has reportedly invested millions of his NFL earnings into a diverse portfolio of tech startups and venture capital funds. Following the example of other financially savvy athletes, Barkley has directed his capital into high-profile companies like AI firm Anthropic and Elon Musk's Neuralink. To manage his finances, he lives off his endorsement deals, which are estimated at $10 million annually, while investing his nearly $80 million in career salary and bonuses. This strategy is part of his plan to build long-term generational wealth beyond his professional football career. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision signals a shift in expectations for the Bruins' football program, which has struggled for consistent success, as the athletic department begins a national search for a permanent replacement.</p>

In an interview with the BBC, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, stated that the Duke of York has not faced sufficient consequences despite being publicly shamed and stripped of his royal duties. He argued that everyone, regardless of status, must be held accountable under the law. Prince Andrew has consistently denied the allegations and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 without any admission of liability.</p>

          <p>In municipal elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is projected to win, securing around 34% of the vote.

The results are seen as a key test for Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government and reflect a broader rightward shift in German politics. In contrast, the Green Party experienced significant losses, dropping from 20% in 2020 to under 12%.</p>
