          <h2>Connecticut Law Permitting Swift Sale of Towed Vehicles Faces Criticism</h2>

          <p>A law in Connecticut is drawing criticism for allowing towing companies to sell impounded vehicles after only 15 days, a practice critics describe as predatory. Residents in working-class neighborhoods of Waterbury report being targeted by companies like MyHoopty.com LLC, which allegedly towed over 1,000 cars from one apartment complex in two years. Despite community efforts like a neighborhood watch, the company's owner defends his actions as enforcing the private property rules of the complexes. The situation highlights a legal framework that can disproportionately affect individuals who cannot quickly afford the high fees to retrieve their vehicles.</p>

          <p>California is battling its largest wildfire of the year, the Madre Fire, which has scorched over 70,800 acres in a rural area of San Luis Obispo County. As of Friday, the blaze was only 10% contained, threatening 50 structures and forcing over 200 people to evacuate their homes. Fueled by hot and windy conditions, the fire's cause remains under investigation while more than 600 personnel, 46 fire engines, and air tankers are deployed to combat it. The fire's scale surpasses other recent major fires in the state, underscoring the severe wildfire risk.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever head coach Stephanie White received a technical foul and a fine for yelling at officials during a recent game, and she has suggested that star player Caitlin Clark offered to pay for it. The incident occurred during a win against the Las Vegas Aces, a game Clark missed due to a groin injury. This event is part of a broader narrative of the team adopting a more rebellious and confident identity in Clark's second year. The article also notes other instances of the team's defiant attitude, including celebrations after their Commissioner's Cup win.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Clarifies "Big, Beautiful Bill" Does Not Eliminate Social Security Taxes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite claims that President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security, the reality is more nuanced. The legislation does not repeal the tax on benefits but instead introduces a new, temporary "bonus" deduction for seniors aged 65 and older. This deduction, which applies to all income and not just Social Security, is available for individuals with incomes up to $75,000 and couples up to $150,000, expiring in 2028. Policy experts note this primarily benefits higher-income seniors and does not help low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax. (not investment advice)</p>

The discovery was made after coroner's personnel gained access to the site, though no positive identifications have been confirmed yet.

The investigation has revealed that the warehouse, located on property owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant, lacked the necessary local licenses to store or operate with fireworks, adding a layer of regulatory failure to the tragedy.</p>

The controversy has drawn attention to the struggles of these artisans, who face rising costs and competition, and has sparked a broader debate about protecting cultural heritage.

          <p>New research highlights the significant role of zooplankton in combating global warming through their unique life cycle in the Southern Ocean. These tiny creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean to hibernate, effectively locking away vast amounts of carbon. This process, known as the seasonal vertical migration pump, is estimated to sequester 65 million tonnes of carbon annually, equivalent to the emissions of about 55 million cars. The study underscores the importance of these "unsung heroes" in regulating the climate, even as they face growing threats.</p>

          <p>Germany began their Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. While the win was a positive start, it was overshadowed by a potentially serious knee injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the pitch in tears during the first half. Gwinn has a history of two previous ACL injuries, casting significant doubt on her ability to continue in the tournament. The team's performance was also described as wasteful, and they will need to be more clinical in their upcoming group stage matches against tougher opponents.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart attacks has shared a list of five common foods he considers "toxic" and does not feed his children. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemicals in the bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs because of sodium and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. The doctor emphasizes making healthier choices, such as air-popped popcorn and plain Greek yogurt, to establish lifelong healthy eating habits.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team narrowly defeated India by five runs in a dramatic T20 match at The Oval, keeping the five-match series alive. Chasing 172, India needed six runs off the final ball, but England seamer Lauren Bell secured the win by dismissing India's captain. England's innings was a story of two halves, with a massive opening partnership of 137 followed by a shocking collapse where they lost nine wickets for just 31 runs. A pivotal spell of fast bowling from England's Lauren Filer in the second innings changed the game's momentum, leading to the tense finish.</p>
