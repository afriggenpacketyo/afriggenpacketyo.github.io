          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 12:26:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a period of strengthening, the growth of single-family home rents in the U.S. began to slow in July, with a year-over-year increase of 2.3%, falling below the pre-pandemic average. This cooling trend is observed across most major metropolitan areas and price tiers, with Miami showing no rent growth at all, a stark contrast to its pandemic-era boom. Economists suggest this slowdown indicates that landlords may need to adjust to a struggling consumer base. The shift could also impact the strategies of single-family rental REITs, which had been expanding to meet previous high demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a combative speech at the United Nations General Assembly, former President Donald Trump heavily criticized the international body, accusing it of being ineffective and creating problems like uncontrolled migration. He touted his administration's achievements, casting himself as a global peacemaker while also threatening new tariffs on Russia and condemning China and India for their role in the Ukraine war. Trump also urged world leaders to reject green energy initiatives, which he called a "scam," and reiterated his stance against the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, demanding Hamas release all hostages. The address covered a wide range of geopolitical issues from his critical perspective.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, former Vice President Kamala Harris stated that she was "reckless" for not voicing her concerns to former President Joe Biden about his decision to run for re-election. Harris explained that she hesitated because she feared raising the issue would appear self-serving, though she now reflects on it as a mistake. She clarified that her concerns about his campaign viability were separate from her confidence in his capacity to serve as president, which she said never wavered. Harris also reflected on a past interview where she struggled to differentiate herself from Biden, admitting she didn't fully appreciate the public's desire to see a distinction.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study predicts that Americans will face higher home heating costs this winter, with average energy bills expected to rise by 7.6% to $976. Households using electricity or natural gas will see the largest increases, at 10.2% and 8.4% respectively, while those using heating oil or propane may see a slight decrease. The rising costs are attributed to grid maintenance, higher natural gas prices, and increased electricity demand. This follows a summer of high air-conditioning bills and contributes to growing household debt, as energy arrearages have surged by 31% since the end of 2023. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Global Health Organizations Dispute Claims Linking Tylenol Use During Pregnancy to Autism</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>International health experts are refuting the Trump administration's announcement that links acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, to an increased risk of autism when used during pregnancy. The European Medicines Agency, the UK's regulatory agency, and Australian health officials all released statements confirming there is no new or robust scientific evidence to support this causal link, and they continue to recommend the medication as a safe option for pain and fever. Spain's Minister of Health and a World Health Organization spokesperson also criticized the claim for lacking evidence. These positions are supported by large-scale studies, including one in Sweden that followed 2.5 million children.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed further changes to the H-1B visa program, following the recent introduction of a controversial $100,000 fee. The new proposal would alter the visa allocation process to prioritize applications from employers offering higher wages, once the annual quota of 85,000 visas is met. According to the Department of Homeland Security, this change is intended to better protect American workers from unfair wage competition from foreign labor. This move adds to the uncertainty surrounding the H-1B program, which is crucial for the tech industry and is predominantly utilized by workers from India.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has endorsed Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, providing a significant boost to the Democratic Socialist candidate. Her support is notable as other prominent Democrats, including Senate Leader Chuck Schumer and House Leader Hakeem Jeffries, have remained silent, distancing themselves from Mamdani's progressive policies and critical stance on Israel. Mamdani, who won the Democratic primary, has called for higher taxes on the wealthy and a rent freeze. Despite the internal party division, polls show Mamdani with a commanding lead over his rivals, including former Governor Andrew Cuomo and current Mayor Eric Adams.</p>

          <p>Palestinian and Jordanian authorities have reported that Israel will indefinitely close the Allenby Bridge crossing, the only direct land route for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank to Jordan. The closure follows a recent incident where a truck driver shot and killed two Israeli military personnel at the crossing. Although Israeli authorities have not officially commented, the crossing has been intermittently shut down since the attack. The Allenby Bridge is a crucial gateway for Palestinians in the West Bank, as it allows them to travel internationally without entering Israel proper, and its extended closure will have significant implications for travel and commerce.</p>

          <p>A satirical opinion piece responds to news of an FBI sting operation where former border czar Tom Homan allegedly accepted $50,000 in cash. The author humorously suggests that if Trump administration officials are susceptible to bribes, perhaps taxpayers should adopt the same strategy to influence policy for the national interest. The article mockingly proposes offering officials cash-filled CAVA bags to encourage them to act humanely or appoint qualified individuals to scientific committees. While acknowledging the absurdity, the piece critiques a political environment where it claims financial incentives appear to be a primary language, contrasting it with policies that seem to offer no public benefit.</p>

Davey painted a stark picture of a potential Farage government, warning of threats to the NHS, environmental protections, and human rights. He urged his party to embrace patriotism and speak for Britain's "decent silent majority" against what he described as divisive politics. The speech heavily focused on Farage, whom Davey mentioned 31 times, framing the next election as a fundamental battle for the country's values.</p>

The book reveals her private belief that Joe Biden's decision to run for re-election was "recklessness" and details a fractured partnership where she felt sidelined by his staff. Harris admits to campaign errors, including a damaging interview on "The View" where she failed to differentiate herself from Biden. The memoir also discloses that Pete Buttigieg was her first choice for a running mate, but she deemed a ticket with a Black woman and a gay man "too big of a risk."</p>

Emil's journey attracted thousands of online fans who followed his movements through videos and posts.

          <p>Despite Germany's consistent success in international and club football, a German player has not won the Ballon d'Or since Matthias Sammer in 1996. One primary reason is the award's overwhelming preference for attacking players, a category where Germany has lacked the world-class talent it produced in previous eras. Furthermore, the nearly two-decade dominance of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo created an insurmountable hurdle for all other contenders. With their era now fading, there is new hope for young German talents like Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz to potentially end the country's long drought for football's most prestigious individual prize.</p>

While the White House clarified that the one-time fee applies only to new applications and not to current visa holders, immigration attorneys report that gray areas remain. There are concerns about whether current H-1B holders who travel abroad while an extension or change of employer is pending could be subject to the fee upon re-entry. Due to this ambiguity, some lawyers are advising their clients' H-1B employees to avoid international travel until further guidance is issued by the government.</p>
