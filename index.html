          <p>Kenya has converted US$5 billion in Chinese railway loans to Chinese yuan, a move expected to reduce annual debt-servicing costs by US$215 million. The loans, taken in 2014 and 2015 from the Export-Import Bank of China, financed the Standard Gauge Railway. As of June 2024, about US$3.5 billion remained unpaid, with Kenya spending US$1 billion annually on servicing its Chinese debt. The new yuan loan is expected to halve the existing 6.37% interest rate under the dollar-denominated agreement, potentially drawing other debt-stressed African countries closer to China. This financial restructuring aims to alleviate Kenya's debt burden and foster stronger economic ties with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew faces further scrutiny due to a newly revealed email suggesting continued contact with Jeffrey Epstein, conflicting with his previous claims. The email intensifies calls for royal sanctions, prompting questions about the King's potential actions, such as exclusion from family events and removal from Royal Lodge. Despite past efforts to pressure Andrew, including cutting off funding, he has maintained financial independence through various business connections. Removing Andrew's titles would require parliamentary intervention, and while he has lost some privileges, the Palace prefers a subtle approach to managing his status. The Palace is concerned about the scandals overshadowing their projects, with campaigners calling for a wider investigation into the Royal Family's knowledge of Andrew's ties to Epstein.</p>

Despite the large amount of blood, first responders didn't observe any lacerations on Kevin's head, which prompted a doctor to alert the coroner's office, leading to an autopsy that revealed multiple skull fractures.

          <p>Shohei Ohtani faced challenges at the plate during the Dodgers' National League Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, raising concerns about his approach. He struggled against left-handed pitching, striking out frequently and failing to reach base consistently. Manager Dave Roberts emphasized the need for Ohtani to improve his at-bat quality and be more aggressive within the strike zone. The Dodgers rely on Ohtani's performance to win the World Series, and his ability to adjust and recalibrate is crucial for their success. </p>

This is Woods' second back surgery in just over a year, adding to a list of injuries that include a ruptured left Achilles. Woods has not played since the Open Championship in 2024 and had to withdraw from the Genesis Invitational due to his mother's death. </p>
