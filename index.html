          <p>China has stated it will use its anti-sanctions law in response to potential US bans on Chinese-made chips, viewing the US measures as "unilateral bullying and protectionism." The Ministry of Commerce warned that organizations or individuals enforcing the US guidelines would face legal repercussions and potential prosecution. This action is in response to the US Bureau of Industry and Security releasing guidelines restricting the use of some Chinese chips globally and limiting the use of US chips to train Chinese AI models. China views these measures as a violation of international laws and a harm to the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned after facing public criticism for stating that he never had to buy rice because he received it as gifts, a comment that was poorly received amid rising rice prices. The remark came at a sensitive time when Japan is grappling with soaring rice prices due to inclement weather and protectionist policies. This resignation adds to the challenges faced by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government, which is already dealing with low approval ratings and ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. The article notes that former Environment Minister Koizumi Shinjiro will succeed Eto.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new satellite analysis indicates that the world's tropical forests experienced record losses in 2024, primarily due to fires, surpassing land clearances from agriculture for the first time. The destruction of 67,000 sq km of old-growth forests, an area nearly the size of the Republic of Ireland, released 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases. The Amazon rainforest was particularly affected due to a record drought, raising concerns about its resilience and potential transition to savanna. However, South East Asia bucked the trend, with government policies helping to reduce forest loss in Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans for the "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, an ambitious project aimed at expanding the country's air defense system, with a predicted completion by the end of his term. The project, a priority for Trump since taking office, intends to create a defense system against foreign threats similar to Israel’s Iron Dome. Experts, however, cite logistical and financial hurdles, with cost estimates ranging from $175 billion to $542 billion. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the project a "game changer" and a "generational investment in the security of America."</p>

          <p>Malaysia, a key player in the global semiconductor industry, is caught in the crosshairs of President Trump's trade policies as it aims to produce high-end chips. The article details how potential tariffs on Malaysian exports to the United States could undermine the country's ambitious plan to move into chip design and cutting-edge manufacturing. American companies like Intel and Oracle are reportedly discussing strategies with the Malaysian government to navigate Trump's trade measures. The uncertainty surrounding these tariffs is causing concern among companies operating in Malaysia, which exported $16.2 billion worth of chips to the U.S. last year.</p>

This shift reflects a growing disillusionment among young people who are prioritizing quality of life over guaranteed career success.

O'Connor had positioned himself as a pragmatic candidate who would get the city working again while it tried to rebuild a tax base devastated by the pandemic downturn in commercial real estate.

Kent aimed to insulate President Trump and the director of national intelligence from criticism after Trump claimed the Venezuelan government controlled the gang. The final memo still contradicts Trump's claim, but Kent's actions have raised concerns about the politicization of intelligence analysis. The issue centers on Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport people accused of being gang members, despite intelligence suggesting the gang is not controlled by the Venezuelan government.</p>

          <p>Matthew Lee Johnson was executed in Texas for the 2012 murder of Nancy Harris, a convenience store clerk he set on fire during a robbery. Johnson admitted to the crime at his trial, expressing remorse for his actions. His execution took place exactly 13 years after the attack, and his lawyers' final appeals were rejected. Harris, a great-grandmother, suffered extensive burns and described the suspect before her death. Johnson's case highlights the complexities and consequences of capital punishment.</p>
