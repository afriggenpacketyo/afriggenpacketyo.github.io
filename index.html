        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has imposed sanctions on five U.S.-based subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, causing the company's shares to drop over 8%. The sanctions are a response to the subsidiaries' alleged assistance in a U.S. government investigation into China's maritime and shipbuilding industries. This move prohibits Chinese entities from conducting business with the sanctioned companies and represents an escalation in the ongoing trade dispute between Beijing and Washington. The action follows retaliatory port fees imposed by both nations on each other's vessels, further straining economic relations.</p>

          <p>General Motors announced it will take a $1.6 billion charge in its third-quarter results, reflecting a significant pullback from its previous electric vehicle ambitions. The charge includes $1.2 billion in noncash adjustments to EV capacity and $400 million in cash for contract cancellation fees. GM attributes the slowdown in EV adoption to recent U.S. policy changes, such as the termination of certain consumer tax credits and less stringent emissions regulations. This move follows a similar multi-billion dollar write-down by Ford, signaling a broader industry reassessment of the EV market's immediate growth potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a firsthand account of President Donald Trump's whirlwind diplomatic trip to Israel and Egypt to mark a new ceasefire agreement in the Gaza conflict. Trump hailed the deal as a historic achievement, suggesting it could lead to "everlasting peace" after two years of war. However, the reporter observes that the trip was more of a victory lap than a detailed negotiation, leaving critical questions about the long-term governance of Gaza and the stability of the truce unanswered. The visit highlighted Trump's focus on grand declarations over the complex realities of securing a lasting resolution to the conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon identified recent bankruptcies in the automotive sector, including parts firm First Brands and subprime lender Tricolor Holdings, as an "early sign" of excessive risk in corporate lending. He noted that after a prolonged credit bull market since around 2010, these failures suggest that a potential economic downturn could expose significant credit issues. While JPMorgan's overall credit metrics remain stable, the bank incurred a $170 million charge-off from its lending to Tricolor. Dimon's comments serve as a caution to the financial industry about potential hidden risks in the corporate credit market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new investigation by Consumer Reports has revealed that many popular protein powders and shakes contain unsafe levels of lead and other toxic heavy metals. The analysis of 23 products found that over two-thirds contained more lead in a single serving than the recommended daily safety limit. Plant-based protein supplements were found to have the highest concentrations of lead on average.

          <p>With three weeks until Election Day, the 2025 gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey have been significantly impacted by recent controversies. In Virginia, the Democratic campaign of Abigail Spanberger is on the defensive after her party's attorney general nominee, Jay Jones, made threatening remarks about a Republican lawmaker. Meanwhile, in New Jersey, Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill has accused her Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, of complicity in the opioid crisis, leading to threats of a defamation lawsuit. These developments have injected fresh volatility into the nation's only two gubernatorial contests this year.</p>

The reforms, which raised the retirement age from 62 to 64, had sparked widespread protests and were pushed through parliament without a final vote. Lecornu needs the backing of Socialist MPs to maintain his government, and they have made a full suspension of the pension changes a key demand. This potential reversal marks a significant political maneuver to stabilize the government amid intense opposition.</p>

          <p>Cody Balmer, the man who set fire to the Pennsylvania governor's mansion while Governor Josh Shapiro and his family were inside, has been sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison after pleading guilty. Balmer admitted to charges including attempted murder, terrorism, and arson for the April attack, where he used gasoline-filled beer bottles to ignite the residence. The fire caused millions of dollars in damage but resulted in no injuries. Balmer told police he had also planned to attack the governor with a sledgehammer if he had encountered him during the break-in.</p>

          <p>The UK is hosting a three-day conference focused on planning the reconstruction of Gaza following the recent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The event brings together representatives from business, civil society, and governments, including Germany, Saudi Arabia, and the Palestinian Authority, to coordinate efforts for the massive rebuilding task, estimated to cost $50 billion. While the U.S. and Israel are not in attendance, the conference signals the UK's intent to play a significant role in the post-conflict peace process. Experts suggest that for any reconstruction to be successful, it will require long-term international cooperation and the involvement of all key parties.</p>

          <p>China has announced new restrictions on rare earth exports, specifically targeting materials used by foreign militaries, a move that could significantly disrupt the U.S. defense industry. Rare earth magnets are critical for numerous U.S. weapons systems, including F-35 jets and Tomahawk missiles. As China dominates over 90% of the global refining capacity for these minerals, the restrictions give Beijing powerful leverage in trade negotiations with Washington. The U.S. is heavily dependent on China for its rare earth supply, and this policy threatens to reignite the trade war between the two economic superpowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Iranian court has convicted and jailed two French nationals, identified as Cecile Kohler and Jacques Paris, on charges including espionage for France and assisting Israeli intelligence. The sentences are reported to be as long as 20 years, though under Iranian law they would serve the longest of their concurrent sentences. France has condemned the detentions as arbitrary and has been advocating for their release for years, accusing Iran of using them as political bargaining chips. The convictions come amid ongoing tensions and stalled negotiations over a potential prisoner swap between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Retired England bowler Stuart Broad has stirred up the pre-Ashes rivalry by stating that Australia's current team is their "worst" since 2010, the last time England won a series down under. Broad's comments came in response to Australian player David Warner's prediction of a 4-0 series win for the home side. He pointed to question marks over the Australian team's lineup and the fitness of their captain, Pat Cummins, as reasons for his assessment. While acknowledging Australia are still favorites at home, Broad believes the matchup between a strong England side and a weaker Australian one will make for a brilliant and competitive series.</p>

          <p>The military in Madagascar has seized power after weeks of growing protests forced President Andry Rajoelina to flee the country. An army colonel announced on national radio that the military was dissolving most government institutions and would establish a committee of officers to run the presidency. The coup follows a large, youth-led protest movement that initially focused on utility shortages but escalated into calls for the government to resign. The same elite army unit that has now taken charge was also instrumental in the 2009 coup that originally brought Rajoelina to power.</p>

          <p>In the New York City mayoral race, Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa is resisting pressure to drop out, a decision that could inadvertently help secure a victory for democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani. Polling shows Mamdani with a strong lead over former governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent. Some of Cuomo's wealthy backers believe that if Sliwa, who is polling up to 18%, were to exit, his voters would shift to Cuomo. However, the eccentric Guardian Angels founder has vehemently refused, claiming he has even been offered bribes to quit the race.</p>
