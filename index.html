          <p>Rodney Hinton Jr. has been charged with aggravated murder after allegedly intentionally striking and killing a sheriff's deputy in Ohio. The incident occurred the day after Hinton's 18-year-old son was fatally shot by police. Prosecutors claim Hinton's actions were premeditated, while his attorney acknowledges the emotional nature of the situation, citing the death of Hinton's son. The judge ordered Hinton Jr. held without bond until his next hearing on May 6, and the Hinton family has hired attorneys to investigate the death of Ryan Hinton.</p>

He suggests that the process, while ancient, is a "rather brilliant device" for finding the right leader. Harris also highlights the importance of including female voices in the process.</p>

          <p>An eight-month pregnant Guatemalan immigrant who gave birth in Arizona avoided fast-track deportation after intervention by Arizona's governor, Katie Hobbs. The 24-year-old woman gained attention after her lawyer said he was denied access to her in a Tucson hospital after she gave birth and that she was set for rapid removal. The case prompted concerns about the treatment of mothers and babies caught in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.</p>

          <p>Israel announced it would mobilize thousands of reserve soldiers to reinforce its campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, signaling a potential shift in tactics. The call-up heightened fears in Gaza, where humanitarian aid has been restricted for months. The announcement also sparked concern among families of hostages, who fear the fighting could endanger their loved ones. International mediators have struggled to broker a cease-fire, as both sides have stipulated contradictory conditions for a deal.</p>
