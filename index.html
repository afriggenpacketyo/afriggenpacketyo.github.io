          <p>House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris voiced his opposition to the Senate's version of legislation aimed at advancing President Trump's agenda, citing concerns over spending cuts. Harris advocates for the House and Senate to develop their own versions of the plan, emphasizing the need for meaningful deficit reduction. The legislation, dubbed "one big, beautiful bill," seeks to address border security, defense, energy, and taxes through the budget reconciliation process. Harris remains open to supporting the Senate's work if it delivers on its promise of deficit reduction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>White House trade advisor Peter Navarro dismissed Vietnam's offer to eliminate tariffs on U.S. imports, citing concerns about non-tariff cheating, such as Chinese products being routed through Vietnam. He also mentioned intellectual property theft and value-added taxes as issues. Navarro indicated that the value-added tax would be a point of contention in tariff negotiations with the European Union. The administration's stance reflects a focus on broader trade practices beyond just tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

The chocolate behemoth, on display at Cadbury World in Birmingham, is made of real chocolate and gooey fondant filling. The only non-authentic part is the painted wrapping, due to the lack of a foil piece large enough. The creation took two and a half days to craft by hand.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are destroying a pillar of American global power, and it will further isolate the country at a moment when others stand ready to fill the vacuum. Trump's tariffs are the culmination of a decades-long shift in political perceptions in the United States, in which trade has gone from an unalloyed good to the source of all ills. The likely outcome of Trump’s policy will be high prices for what Americans make and buy, whether produced at home at greater cost than abroad or imported from overseas with a punitive tax. Other countries long accepted U.S. leadership because they saw Washington as a proponent of global economic progress.</p>

          <p>China's stronger-than-expected response to President Trump's latest tariff barrage reflects careful planning and reduced dependence on the American market. Analysts suggest that China's swift retaliation indicates its preparedness and unwillingness to be rushed into negotiations with Washington. China is focused on expanding domestic demand to offset the impact of the trade war. While China remains open to negotiations, it is also prepared for a prolonged trade conflict.

          <p>The UK government is relaxing electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to support the car industry in response to US tariffs imposed by President Trump. While the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales remains, manufacturers will have greater flexibility on annual targets and face reduced fines. Smaller British firms like Aston Martin and McLaren will be allowed to keep selling petrol cars beyond the 2030 deadline. The government said it had worked with UK car manufacturers to simultaneously "strengthen its commitment to the phase out" while introducing "practical reforms to support industry meet this ambition".</p>
