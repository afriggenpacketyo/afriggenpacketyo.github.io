          <p>A public feud erupted between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, with Trump threatening to withdraw government contracts from Musk's companies after Musk criticized the Republican tax-cut and spending bill. Bill Ackman urged Trump and Musk to reconcile for the country's benefit, while Steve Bannon suggested Trump should seize SpaceX through the Defense Production Act. Mark Cuban seemingly endorsed Musk's proposal to create a new political party, and Andrew Yang pitched an "Independent '28 presidential primary." Ian Bremmer stated that "Trump is more powerful than elon, but far less competent." The optimism score is 45.</p>

          <p>Opposition is growing among Members of Parliament (MPs) in England and Wales regarding the Assisted Dying Bill, which would allow terminally ill adults with less than six months to live to receive medical assistance to die. Several MPs who initially supported or abstained from voting on the bill have now indicated they are likely to vote against it, citing concerns about protecting vulnerable individuals. These MPs are worried that the bill may be overextended to include those who could improve their quality of life through alternative means. They also fear that the legislation could pressure people who feel like a burden to their families to end their lives. The optimism score is 40.</p>

          <p>Ispace, a Tokyo-based company, declared its private lunar lander mission a failure after losing communication with the spacecraft during its attempted touchdown on the moon. The lander, named Resilience, was carrying a rover designed to gather lunar dirt and deploy a small Swedish-style house on the moon. A preliminary analysis suggests that the lander's laser altitude measurement system malfunctioned, causing it to descend too rapidly and likely resulting in a hard landing. Despite the setback, Ispace plans to continue with future lunar missions, viewing this attempt as a stepping stone towards larger, NASA-involved projects. The company aims to learn from this second failed landing to improve its technology and mission success rate. The optimism score is 55.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk initially announced that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft due to threats from President Trump to cancel government contracts. However, hours later, Musk reversed his decision after receiving advice on X to "cool off." The initial tweet followed an escalating dispute with Trump over a major tax bill. Dragon is the only U.S. option for delivering crew to and from the International Space Station. Musk's about-face raises questions about the future of SpaceX's relationship with the government and the fate of the Dragon spacecraft. The optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention, unlike adults in the criminal justice system. In about two dozen states, time spent in detention doesn't count toward any incarceration they may face, adding months to their confinement. This practice is justified by the rehabilitative focus of the juvenile system, but policy experts argue it leads to unequal application of rights and allows kids to languish without proper services. The lack of credit for time served has negative impacts on young people, affecting their education and increasing the likelihood of reoffending. The optimism score is 30.</p>
