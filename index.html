          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' legal team filed a motion for a mistrial, alleging prosecutorial misconduct during his federal trial. The defense claims the prosecution knowingly presented false testimony regarding an alleged 2016 balcony incident involving Cassie Ventura's friend, Bryana "Bana" Bongolan. Diddy's lawyers argue that inconsistencies in Bongolan's testimony undermine her credibility and create a false narrative. The defense previously requested a mistrial based on questions related to the alleged destruction of fingerprints Kid Cudi provided to the Los Angeles Police Department following an incident at his home.</p>

Hong Kong currently leads the world in IPOs, followed by India, prompting HSBC to expand its services to cater to the growing wealth management clientele in the region.

          <p>The Mossad's operation involving explosive pagers and the subsequent assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah have significantly weakened Iran's influence in the Middle East. The loss of key leaders and fighters has crippled Hezbollah's capabilities, leading to a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. This has also led to the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, cutting off Iran's access to a critical corridor for supplying weapons.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain faces an energy bills crisis due to the electricity grid's inability to handle renewable energy, leading to energy firms being paid significant sums to not provide power. The system compensates companies like Ocean Winds when their wind turbines' output is restricted due to grid overload. This balancing act has cost the country over Â£500 million this year, potentially reaching Â£8 billion annually by 2030. The government is considering a radical solution: regional markets instead of a national one, gambling that this could make the system more efficient and deliver cheaper bills, although this is not guaranteed and could lead to some people paying more.

          <p>The NHS is calling for 200,000 new blood donors to maintain a safe and reliable supply, as the number of regular donors needs to rise to over one million. Supplies have remained low, prompting concerns and an "amber alert" last year due to unfilled appointments and increased demand. There is a pressing need to avoid a "red alert," which would threaten public safety, and the NHS is particularly seeking more black donors. The appeal aims to address the challenging blood shortage and ensure the NHS can continue treating patients who rely on regular transfusions.</p>

          <p>During the Emergency in the mid-1970s, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government considered reimagining India as a centralized state with a presidential system.

The idea, though never fully realized, influenced constitutional amendments that expanded Parliament's powers and limited judicial review.
