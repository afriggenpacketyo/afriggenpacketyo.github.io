          <p>Ongoing sectarian clashes between Druze and Bedouin communities in Syria's Suweida Province persist despite a presidentially announced ceasefire. Over 900 people have been killed in the violence, which prompted Israeli military intervention against Syrian government forces accused of siding with Bedouins. The US-brokered pact, which included a halt to Israeli strikes, appears fragile as gunfire and looting were reported after its announcement. Israel's foreign minister expressed skepticism about the Syrian government's commitment to protecting minorities in the region.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler has taken a commanding four-shot lead heading into the final round of The Open Championship at Royal Portrush. Demonstrating remarkable consistency with a third-round 67, he sits at 14 under par, reinforcing the perception of his inevitable victory. His closest competitor is Li Haotong, while others like Matt Fitzpatrick and Rory McIlroy face a significant deficit. Scheffler's unflappable performance draws comparisons to Tiger Woods' era of dominance, positioning him for a fourth major title.</p>

He had previously served as a Boynton Beach city commissioner and had announced plans to run for a Palm Beach County Commission seat in 2026.

          <p>Former professional wrestling star Marcus "Buff" Bagwell, 55, has had his right leg amputated above the knee. The surgery was necessary due to complications from injuries sustained in a 2020 car crash that never fully healed, according to a friend. Bagwell was a prominent figure in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) during the 1990s, where he was a five-time tag-team champion and a member of the popular New World Order (nWo) faction. The wrestling community has expressed widespread support for Bagwell as he begins his recovery from the life-altering procedure.</p>

          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy towards stronger European cooperation, particularly with France and the United Kingdom, forming a trio known as the "E3." This strategic shift, highlighted by a new bilateral treaty with the UK, is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty over the United States' commitment to NATO under a potential Trump presidency. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has emphasized the need for Europe to become more self-reliant in defense, viewing the nuclear capabilities of France and the UK as a potential supplement to the US security guarantee. This move aims to bolster European sovereignty while navigating complex relations with allies like Poland and the US.</p>

Lawyers and human rights advocates point to gaps in the system, such as psychiatric records not being in the central medical database without patient consent.

          <p>A community fundraiser has raised over £20,000 to support families affected by a tragic school coach crash in Somerset that killed a 10-year-old boy. The coach, returning from a Minehead Middle School trip, was carrying about 70 people when it overturned near Wheddon Cross. Six children and three adults remain hospitalized following the major incident. The funds, raised by a local resident, are intended to provide urgent financial and emotional support to those injured and directly impacted by the devastating crash that has shaken the local community.</p>

          <p>Former major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have voiced criticism over the R&A's inconsistent enforcement of slow-play rules at The Open. Both golfers were warned about their pace during the third round, a day after Shane Lowry received a controversial penalty. Stenson noted the inconsistency of being pushed for being minutes over schedule on Saturday after first-round groups ran nearly an hour over. DeChambeau advocated for a more transparent system that times every shot for every player, arguing the current approach is unfair and that officials are reluctant to expose habitually slow players.</p>

          <p>According to Gaza hospital officials, Israeli forces opened fire near crowds seeking food, killing 32 Palestinians at two separate locations close to distribution hubs run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Witnesses reported indiscriminate fire as people massed near the sites, while the Israeli military stated it fired warning shots at suspects who approached troops and ignored orders. The GHF, an organization backed by the US and Israel, denied any deadly incidents occurred at its sites, claiming the shootings happened far away and before opening hours.

          <p>A group of young, college-aged Christian activists from the organization Generation Life spent a weekend on the Jersey Shore promoting a message of chastity. Engaging with beachgoers, they sought to redefine chastity not merely as abstinence but as a way to foster deeper, non-transactional relationships in an age dominated by social media. The activists, often framing their message as a "countercultural" response to modern dating pressures, found a mixed reception. Their outreach highlights a generational effort to adapt a traditional religious message for Gen Z, a cohort grappling with the effects of technology on intimacy and relationships.</p>

          <p>As Japan heads into an election, far-right parties like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. These groups are fanning concerns over unruly tourists and crimes allegedly committed by foreigners, echoing nationalist movements in the US and Europe. While defenders of immigration highlight Japan's critical labor shortages due to a declining birthrate, nationalist politicians argue against relying on foreign workers. They advocate for preserving Japanese cultural purity and national security, creating a contentious political climate around the issue of immigration.</p>

          <p>A South African government report has concluded that the building collapse in George that killed 34 construction workers last year was "entirely preventable." The investigation revealed multiple failures, including the use of substandard materials and the ignoring of serious safety concerns, such as structural cracks, that were raised long before the tragedy. A health and safety officer had even resigned in protest, but work continued. Public Works Minister Dean Macpherson called for criminal accountability for the negligence that led to the disaster, pledging legislative reform to improve construction oversight.</p>

          <p>On "The Ramsey Show," a pregnant stay-at-home mom called for advice about a car loan, revealing a deeper issue of financial strain due to her husband's spending habits. Despite a $156,000 household income, she stated they struggle to afford groceries because he spends up to $700 monthly on tobacco and marijuana. Host Dave Ramsey challenged her framing of the problem, urging her to treat her husband's behavior as a serious addiction that requires intervention, not just a budget line item. He pointed out that with their income, the spending, while problematic, was not the sole cause of their financial stress. (not investment advice)</p>

Though first expected to miss six weeks, Muncy is already running, playing catch, and taking swings, with manager Dave Roberts suggesting a return "a lot sooner than anticipated." The injury, sustained in a slide at third base, fortunately avoided major ligament damage. Muncy's return is crucial for the Dodgers' offense, which has struggled significantly in his absence, averaging less than three runs per game and slumping to a 3-8 record since he was sidelined.</p>

The disqualification came after American sprinter Antonio Pettigrew confessed in 2008 to doping during that period.

          <p>The US has reportedly revoked the visas of eight Brazilian Supreme Court judges in a move seen as an attempt to support former president Jair Bolsonaro. The action, announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, targets judges involved in the prosecution of Bolsonaro for an alleged coup attempt, including lead justice Alexandre de Moraes. This follows President Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, which Brazilian President Lula da Silva has condemned as "unacceptable blackmail." The escalating pressure from the US has sparked nationalist backlash in Brazil, with critics decrying it as foreign interference in the nation's judicial sovereignty.</p>
