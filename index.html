        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sources indicate that President Trump considered a plan to strike an Iranian nuclear facility, a decision that was met with reservations from Steve Bannon, who advised caution regarding Israeli intelligence and the effectiveness of bunker-buster bombs, while also citing concerns about potential retaliation against U.S. troops in the Middle East. A White House official stated that Trump had already decided to hold off on the strike by the time he met with Bannon. The situation highlights the internal debates and considerations within the Trump administration regarding military actions against Iran. This article provides insight into the decision-making processes and the varying perspectives that influenced the administration's approach to dealing with Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>An expert on Middle East and U.S. national security suggests that Iran may attempt a "face-saving" retaliation against the U.S. following strikes on its nuclear facilities, but lacks the capability for significant escalation due to previous Israeli actions. Potential responses could include cyber-attacks or attacks on regional infrastructure, though no immediate aid from Iran's proxies has been observed. The expert estimates the U.S. operation could set back Iran's nuclear program by up to a decade, depending on future actions and agreements. The U.S. launched a surprise strike using B-2 stealth bombers on Iranâ€™s Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear facilities on Saturday.</p>

          <p>A suicide bomber detonated explosives inside the Mar Elias Church in Dweil'a, Syria, resulting in at least nine fatalities and several injuries, marking the first attack of its kind in Syria in years. The Syrian Interior Ministry attributed the attack to an extremist from the Islamic State group, who fired at people before detonating an explosives vest. Syrian Information Minister Hamza Mostafa condemned the attack as a terrorist act, reaffirming the government's commitment to combating criminal organizations and protecting society.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the U.S. is not at war with Iran, but rather with "Iran's nuclear program," following U.S. strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, as Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that Iran reserves all options to defend itself. Vance emphasized that the U.S. desires peace, but only in the context of Iran not possessing nuclear weapons, the extent of the damage to the nuclear facilities remains unknown. Vance declined to provide specific intelligence details but expressed confidence that the strikes have significantly delayed Iran's nuclear weapons development. The remarks aim to clarify the U.S. objectives and to de-escalate tensions while maintaining a firm stance against nuclear proliferation.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio discusses the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, emphasizing it was not an attack on Iran or its people, but a targeted effort to degrade Iran's nuclear weaponization ambitions, as the U.S. is ready to negotiate if Iran chooses diplomacy. Rubio insists Iran has everything needed to build a nuclear weapon, regardless of whether an order to weaponize has been given, while also stating that the U.S. will defend its interests and allies in the Middle East. He also stated that Iran's closure of the Strait of Hormuz would be a "suicidal" move, while emphasizing that the U.S. is open to a diplomatic solution that allows Iran a civilian nuclear program, but not enrichment on its own soil.</p>

          <p>Representative Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, described the U.S. attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities as a "massive gamble" by President Trump, citing past U.S. military actions in the Middle East. Himes expressed concern over the lack of congressional approval for the strikes, emphasizing Congress's constitutional authority to declare war. The representative cautioned against premature optimism, noting the often-unforeseen costs and consequences of U.S. military interventions in the region. The remarks reflect broader concerns about the long-term implications and the constitutional basis for the U.S. military actions in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Tens of millions of people in the U.S. Midwest and East Coast are facing dangerously high temperatures as a rare June heatwave persists, with heat advisories issued across a wide region. The National Weather Service forecasts heat indices exceeding 100F in many areas, prompting cities like Philadelphia to declare heat emergencies and open cooling centers. The extreme heat is attributed to a heat dome, a large area of high pressure trapping heat and humidity, with meteorologists noting the unusual extent of the affected area. The heatwave is expected to continue into the coming week, with temperatures potentially reaching 100F in major cities like New York and Washington D.C.</p>

          <p>Satellite images of Iranian nuclear sites show new craters and potential damage, but don't confirm claims of complete destruction, with a U.S. Air Force General stating that final battle damage assessment will take time. IAEA inspectors have not been able to verify the location of Iranâ€™s stockpile of near-bomb-grade uranium for over a week, and Iranian officials acknowledged moving it to an undisclosed location. The IAEA has called for a cessation of hostilities in order to address the situation, as the bombing complicates the task of tracking uranium and ensuring Iran doesnâ€™t build a weapon. The strikes have also degraded the tools that monitors will be able to use.</p>

          <p>Middle Eastern markets mostly closed higher on Sunday, despite the U.S. military entering the war between Israel and Iran by striking three key Iranian nuclear sites, Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, driven by expectations that Washington's involvement would expedite a resolution, while Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experienced a slight decline. Analyst Fadi Arbid suggests the Gulf region has distanced itself from the conflict, supporting a peaceful resolution, which has helped it isolate itself from any significant short-term market impact. Egypt's EGX30 was the major gainer in the region, closing 2.7% higher on Sunday (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The United States has escalated the Israel-Iran conflict by bombing key Iranian nuclear enrichment sites, leading to mixed international reactions and domestic political divides. President Trump claimed the strikes were a spectacular success, but the extent of the damage is yet to be verified, as concerns about potential radiation leaks have emerged. The US Defense Secretary stated the attack resulted from a plan that took months and weeks of positioning and preparation in anticipation of a call by Trump, with the US reiterating that it does not seek war with Iran. While regional governments and traditional US allies have urged de-escalation and diplomacy, Iran has warned of "everlasting consequences" for the US.</p>

While there are no specific, credible threats at this time, the bulletin notes the potential for cyber attacks by pro-Iranian hacktivists and attacks by individuals motivated by the Israel-Iran conflict. The bulletin also cautions that the likelihood of violent extremists mobilizing to violence would likely increase if Iranian leadership issued a religious ruling calling for retaliatory violence against the United States. The bulletin is intended to communicate information directly to the public about threats and resources for staying safe during the heightened threat environment.</p>

The operation involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers flying from Missouri to Iran, with decoys sent elsewhere, as the bombers dropped 14 "bunker-buster" bombs on sites at Fordo and Natanz, while Tomahawk missiles targeted Isfahan. The chairman warned Iran against retaliation, as the Defense Secretary called the attack "an incredible and overwhelming success", with the strikes aimed at devastating the Iranian nuclear program, but not targeting Iranian troops or the Iranian people.</p>

          <p>Sergei Tikhanovsky, the husband of Belarus' opposition leader, has called on US President Donald Trump to "just say the word" and ask for all political prisoners in Belarus to be released. The opposition activist was freed unexpectedly on Saturday and reunited with his wife in Lithuania, as he broke down in tears as he described his five years in solitary confinement and called for the freedom of more than 1,000 political prisoners still behind bars. He was arrested in 2020 as he planned to run for president against Lukashenko in that summer's elections, as he said he had been held in what he described as the "strictest possible regime", cut off from all contact with the outside world. He called on the US president for more help, as Trump has such power and such possibilities, that with one word he could free all political prisoners.</p>

          <p>After years of studying over 200 parent-child relationships, Reem Raouda, a leading voice in conscious parenting, shares five phrases that instantly make kids not want to listen. Traditional parenting phrases often trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, activating the part of the brain focused on survival rather than learning. Instead, Raouda suggests using language that makes children actually want to cooperate, creating the conditions where cooperation feels natural. She emphasizes that children thrive when they feel respected, emotionally safe and involved in the process, which reduces power struggles and raises children who trust us, regulate themselves more easily, and grow into emotionally resilient adults.</p>

Durant, despite his age, averaged 26.6 points for the Suns last season, as the Rockets were Durantâ€™s favored destination. The Rockets finished second in the Western Conference but were eliminated by the Warriors in the first round of the playoffs, as Durant has one year left on his current contract and is due to earn $54.7m next season. This marks a significant move in the NBA landscape, positioning the Rockets as a rising force in the Western Conference.</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to debut its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, offering a select group of people the chance to ride in its Model Y Robotaxis. The pilot program, launching on June 22, will involve a small number of cars operating in a "geofenced area" and will be limited to investors and enthusiasts who have been invited to participate in the pilot. Safety concerns have been raised by government officials and advocacy groups, as Tesla is under scrutiny from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with Tesla's stock regaining some lost ground since Musk said he would return his focus to Tesla. The robotaxi rollout could help Tesla reach a $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026, or double its current valuation (not investment advice).</p>

More than 125 aircraft participated in the mission, including refueling tankers, fighter escorts, and drones that provided Intelligence, surveillance and target acquisition, as Israeli forces had spent about 10 days crippling Iran's air-defense capabilities prior to the mission.</p>

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez opposed the deal, citing that the 5% figure would be unreasonable and counterproductive, while also facing political pressure at home.

The question of how Iran will respond has raised fears that the regime could seek to block ships from traveling through the Strait of Hormuz, which is used to transport about 20% of oil used around the world.

He added that the Iranians may have managed to move the nuclear material out of Fordo, and it's sitting in a warehouse right now. Himes also said that he was "disturbed" by the fact that the strikes were undertaken without the approval of Congress, which holds the sole authority to declare war.</p>
