          <p>Journalism, the 8-5 favorite, won the 150th Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course after finishing second in the Kentucky Derby. Overcoming a challenging track dried by recent rain, Journalism surged from behind to defeat Gosger, Sandman, and Goal Oriented. Jockey Umberto Rispoli, the first Italian jockey to win a Triple Crown race, celebrated his first victory in the series, while trainer Michael McCarthy secured his second Preakness win. Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty did not compete, ending hopes for a Triple Crown this year, but a Journalism-Sovereignty rematch is anticipated at the Belmont Stakes. This year marks the final Preakness at the historic Pimlico before its reconstruction.</p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen responded to President Trump's recent attacks during a concert in Manchester, England, reaffirming his criticism of the administration's policies. Springsteen addressed the audience with a resolute speech, highlighting concerns about the erosion of American democracy and the persecution of individuals exercising their right to free speech. He specifically cited the defunding of American universities, the rollback of civil rights legislation, and the abandonment of the world's poorest children. Despite Trump's apparent threat, Springsteen concluded with a message of hope, emphasizing the enduring greatness of America and its people, and referencing James Baldwin's belief in the inherent humanity of the world.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, dramatically reducing visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue dust storm warnings, a first for Chicago. The storm, driven by winds up to 70 mph, originated near Bloomington, Illinois, and created near-zero visibility conditions on major highways. Meteorologists attribute the phenomenon to exceptionally dry soil conditions, reminiscent of the Dust Bowl era, with soil moisture levels at historic lows. This event follows a similar dust storm in 2023 that resulted in a major traffic accident and highlights the increasing risks associated with drought and extreme weather.</p>

          <p>Federal courts are increasingly pushing back against the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, emphasizing the importance of due process for immigrants. The Supreme Court recently criticized the administration for providing inadequate notice to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation, highlighting the constitutional right to challenge removals. This decision follows several cases where courts have insisted on due process, even as the administration considers measures like suspending habeas corpus. The courts' stance underscores the fundamental principle that all individuals, regardless of citizenship, are entitled to due process before being deprived of liberty, a principle that legal scholars worry is being undermined.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma's new social studies curriculum, influenced by State School Superintendent Ryan Walters, will require high school students to identify "discrepancies" in the 2020 election results. This revision, part of a broader Republican effort to promote ideologies sympathetic to Donald Trump, has raised concerns about the misrepresentation of factual information. The curriculum also includes references to the Bible and national pride, while removing education about Black Lives Matter and George Floyd's murder. Despite criticism from some Republicans, a lawsuit from parents and educators, and the involvement of conservative groups like Moms for Liberty, the standards have been approved, sparking debate among teachers about the potential for biased instruction.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart after the retailer warned that it would have to raise prices due to tariffs, urging the company to absorb the costs instead. Walmart CFO John David Rainey noted the challenging environment created by the magnitude and speed of price increases. Trump's remarks follow similar warnings from other companies, including Microsoft and Mattel, about the impact of tariffs. Walmart affirmed its commitment to keeping prices low but acknowledged the reality of small retail margins. The situation highlights the ongoing tension between the administration's trade policies and their potential effect on consumers.</p>

The discovery reveals that Mosura had a more complex body structure than previously known for radiodonts, including a multi-segmented abdomen-like region with gills. This find provides new insights into the diversity of animal life before the Cambrian explosion, highlighting the rapid evolution occurring at that time.</p>
