          <p>The UN's World Food Programme has issued a stark warning that almost one in three people in Gaza are going days without eating, causing malnutrition to surge. The report highlights that 90,000 women and children are in urgent need of treatment, with the death toll from malnutrition rising. Amidst international calls for Israel to lift aid restrictions, a former security contractor has also alleged witnessing war crimes by the IDF and US contractors at food distribution sites, a claim the involved foundation denies.</p>

          <p>China has completed the design for its first commercial fourth-generation gigawatt-level fast neutron reactor, known as the CFR-1000. The project, which now awaits final approval, is a significant step in the country's plan to develop more fuel-efficient and advanced nuclear power sources. This development places China alongside other major powers like the US and Russia, who are also pursuing next-generation reactor technology, with the new facility expected to be operational after 2030.</p>

          <p>A double-decker bus traveling from Lima crashed after going off the road and falling into a ravine, resulting in at least 15 deaths and about 30 injuries. The bus was carrying over 60 passengers when the accident occurred in the Palca district. Authorities note that such fatal crashes are common in Peru, with a government report citing reckless driving, excessive speed, and poor road conditions as the primary causes of the thousands of traffic-related deaths recorded annually.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has strongly condemned Hong Kong's latest offer of cash rewards for information leading to the arrest of 19 pro-democracy activists living abroad, including in Britain. In a joint statement, the Foreign and Home Secretaries described the move as an act of "transnational repression." The bounties are for individuals accused of violating Beijing's national security law, and the UK reaffirmed its commitment to protecting the rights and safety of those who have made Britain their home.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Iowa experienced a life-threatening medical ordeal after a spider bite from his summer job led to a severe infection, a 103-degree fever, and the inability to walk.

After losing 35 pounds and at times being unable to speak, the teenager's kidneys began functioning again, and he is now recovering at home with support from his community.</p>

          <p>An Illinois judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city policies, which limit local police cooperation with federal immigration agents. The judge ruled that the city's Welcoming City Ordinance is lawful and protected by the Tenth Amendment. Chicago's mayor praised the ruling, stating that the city is safer when it is not compelled to cooperate with what he termed the administration's "reckless and inhumane immigration agenda."</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society examines the impact of the Hollywood blacklist, which began in the 1940s during the Red Scare. The exhibit tells the story of the "Hollywood Ten" and other artists who were imprisoned and had their careers destroyed after being investigated for alleged Communist ties by the House Un-American Activities Committee. The display raises important questions about free speech, democracy, and the consequences of punishing individuals for holding unpopular political views.</p>

          <p>A feature article examines how President Donald Trump uses the sport of golf as more than just a leisure activity, but as a critical tool for business and politics. Described as fiercely competitive, Trump leverages his privately owned courses around the world to network with political allies, business leaders, and foreign dignitaries in an environment removed from public and media scrutiny. For Trump, golf is a transactional space where he can build relationships and conduct affairs on his own terms.</p>

          <p>In a significant conservation effort, wildlife biologists in Texas have successfully relocated dozens of bighorn sheep to a new, isolated mountain range to save them from a disease that has wiped out half the state's population. The sheep were captured from the last remaining disease-free herd and airlifted to their new home. A recent follow-up confirmed the animals are surviving and that new lambs have been born, offering a monumental victory and renewed hope for the species' future in Texas.</p>

          <p>A new article explores the validity of widely accepted health benchmarks, such as walking 10,000 steps a day, drinking eight glasses of water, and getting eight hours of sleep. Health experts suggest that while these targets are based on beneficial principles, they shouldn't be treated as rigid, all-or-nothing rules. The consensus is that it's better to view them as flexible guidelines, focusing on consistency and adapting them to fit one's individual lifestyle and needs rather than fixating on hitting a specific number.</p>

While the boxes contain sufficient calories for survival, they primarily consist of dried goods that require clean water and fuel, both of which are critically scarce. Experts warn the diet is deficient in essential vitamins and minerals, which could lead to widespread "hidden hunger" and diseases like anemia and scurvy with prolonged consumption.</p>
