          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 20:10:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and EU are engaged in negotiations over a "youth mobility scheme" that would allow young people to move freely between the UK and EU for up to four years, a right that was lost post-Brexit. The UK government is wary of the impact on immigration numbers, with some officials suggesting limiting visas to one year to avoid impacting immigration figures. Fishing rights are also a key point of contention, with the EU seeking an extension of current arrangements while UK fishing groups advocate for changes to benefit their industry, including restricting EU vessels' access to coastal waters and easing access to EU markets. </p>

          <p>The article discusses how the Doom franchise is adapting to the modern gaming landscape with its latest installment, Doom: The Dark Ages. Developers aim to attract new players by offering a shorter, more accessible experience compared to "forever games" like Fortnite. The game incorporates customization options and a new "Medieval sci-fi" setting to broaden its appeal. The article also addresses the ongoing debate over game pricing, with Doom's producers arguing that a one-time purchase can be more cost-effective than free-to-play games with microtransactions. </p>

          <p>Ten inmates, considered "armed and dangerous," escaped from the Orleans Parish Jail in New Orleans, with authorities suspecting inside help. The inmates breached a wall and scaled down the facility, with one inmate later apprehended through facial recognition while hiding under a car. Law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and U.S. Marshals, are actively searching for the remaining escapees, who are believed to still be in the New Orleans area. The sheriff's office is blaming the city for not funding prison security upgrades, claiming they have been requesting help for five years. </p>

          <p>Tesla has amended its corporate bylaws to require shareholders to hold at least 3% of the company's outstanding shares to file derivative lawsuits for breach of fiduciary duty. This change, enabled by Texas state law, significantly raises the barrier for investors seeking legal action against Tesla's board or executives. Ann Lipton, a corporate law expert, notes that this move contrasts with Tesla's previous incorporation in Delaware, where lawsuits could be brought with minimal share ownership. The move follows Tesla's relocation of its incorporation to Texas after a court ruling against Elon Musk's compensation package. </p>

          <p>Moody's Ratings cut the United States' sovereign credit rating down one notch to Aa1 from Aaa, citing the growing burden of financing the federal government's budget deficit and the rising cost of rolling over existing debt amid high interest rates. The rating agency said that successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. The downgrade came as the GOP-led House Budget Committee rejected a sweeping tax cut package as part of President Donald Trump's economic agenda, including extending tax cuts first enacted in 2017. </p>
