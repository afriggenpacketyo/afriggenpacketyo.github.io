          <p>A BBC reporter worked undercover as a cleaner in Castlehill, a luxury care home in Inverness, revealing severe neglect, understaffing, and a lack of dignified care for residents, especially those with dementia. The investigation, prompted by a family's secret camera footage, found residents left in soiled conditions, desperate for basic assistance, and enduring emotional distress. Experts warn of a care sector in crisis due to underfunding and staff shortages, with calls for a national conversation on its future. Despite management's claims of recent improvements and investment, the article highlights the systemic issues and the profound impact on vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed trading activity following a US government shutdown, with Wall Street remaining largely unaffected. Spot gold prices saw a slight increase, hitting a new record. In Japan, the third-quarter Tankan survey, a key indicator of business sentiment, revealed that optimism among large manufacturers rose slightly to +14, though it fell short of economists' expectations. However, Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices both experienced declines, indicating a complex economic landscape across the region.</p>

While affirming commitment to existing treaties, Starmer emphasized adapting laws to current circumstances, citing issues like the deportation of foreign criminals. His comments, made during a Labour Party conference, also touched upon internal leadership challenges and the need to tackle youth unemployment linked to mental health issues, aiming to position Labour against the Reform UK party.</p>

          <p>Qian Zhang, a successful professional, shares her experience of leaving the U.S. for Portugal after years of living on an H-1B work visa, citing the anxiety and feeling of being a "second-class citizen" under restrictive immigration policies, particularly during the Trump administration. The article highlights a broader trend of high-skilled foreign workers seeking opportunities elsewhere due to visa uncertainties and a perceived decline in American openness. This shift is influencing international student enrollment and prompting a re-evaluation of the U.S.'s global appeal for talent.</p>

          <p>A civilian U.S. Department of Navy employee, Malika Brittingham, has been charged with falsely reporting an active shooter at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey.

          <p>China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) has finalized a US$1.4 billion deal to rehabilitate the Tazara Railway, a critical 1,860km line connecting Zambia’s Copperbelt to Tanzania’s port of Dar es Salaam. This significant investment aims to upgrade tracks, workshops, and rolling stock, enhancing the railway's capacity for copper and cobalt shipments to the Indian Ocean. The deal strategically positions China in the race for key African trading corridors, providing an alternative to congested routes and competing with US-backed projects in the region.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ruled that Sigal Chattah, the top federal prosecutor in Nevada appointed by President Trump, is "not validly serving" as acting U.S. attorney, disqualifying her from supervising certain criminal cases. The Justice Department had attempted to circumvent a 120-day legal limit on temporary appointments by shifting Chattah to a different role. The court found this maneuver illegal under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which aims to prevent executive overreach in filling such posts, marking the second time a Trump-appointed prosecutor has been partially sidelined.</p>

          <p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has called for the Global Sumud Flotilla, carrying aid to Gaza, to stop its journey, warning it could jeopardize a fragile U.S. peace plan to end the Israel-Hamas war. Meloni suggested the flotilla's attempt to break the Israeli naval blockade might provide a pretext to undermine peace efforts. The flotilla, which includes Greta Thunberg, reported increased drone activity and unidentified vessels approaching it. Despite calls to reroute aid to a safer port, the activists affirmed their commitment to continuing their mission.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has sued the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, alleging "unreasonable delays" in processing concealed carry weapon (CCW) licenses violate residents' Second Amendment rights. The lawsuit claims the department takes an average of 281 days to begin processing applications, far exceeding the state's 90-day requirement. The Sheriff’s Department disputes the claim, citing a transition to an online system, a backlog inherited from previous administrations, and a "significant staffing crisis" while asserting compliance with state and local laws.</p>

          <p>The global coffee industry is confronting significant challenges, including the shrinking of suitable farming land by 50% due to climate change, a waning labor force, and new U.S. tariffs. Rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, and increased pests are forcing farmers to adapt, but many struggle with financial constraints and unstable international prices. The article highlights the historical exploitation in coffee production and the potential for new climate-resilient varieties like stenophylla, robusta, and even synthetic coffee to become more mainstream, altering the future of coffee consumption.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County supervisors expressed strong criticism of a $1.9-million external report on government failures during the January wildfires, deeming it "inadequate" and full of "gaping holes." Residents and supervisors alike questioned why evacuation alerts were delayed, especially in west Altadena where 18 deaths occurred, and why key non-county agencies refused to participate. The report acknowledged a lack of clear responsibility for evacuations and inconsistent warnings, prompting supervisors to push for immediate implementation of recommendations to clarify roles and improve disaster response, despite the report's perceived shortcomings.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump shared photos on Truth Social displaying "Trump 2028" hats on the Resolute Desk during an Oval Office meeting with Democratic leaders, hours before a government shutdown. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson blamed "radical Democrats" for the shutdown, accusing them of demanding a "nearly $1.5 trillion wish list." Democrats, in turn, blamed Trump and Republicans for refusing to protect healthcare, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer calling Trump's behavior "erratic and unhinged."

Antoni, a conservative fellow, had previously criticized the BLS and suggested suspending its monthly jobs report, raising concerns about the politicization of federal data agencies.</p>
