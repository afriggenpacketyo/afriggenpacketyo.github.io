          <p>The Department of Justice charged New Jersey congresswoman LaMonica McIver with assaulting federal agents during a clash outside a Newark immigration detention center and dismissed a trespass charge against Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka. According to U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, McIver assaulted, impeded, and interfered with law enforcement. McIver has claimed that the charges are politically motivated and mischaracterize her actions. Habba stated that she had invited the mayor to tour Delaney Hall, stating the government has nothing to hide at this facility, and she would personally accompany the mayor so he can see that firsthand. This New York Times article provides a comprehensive overview of the incident and the legal actions taken.</p>

          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, decreasing the one-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the five-year LPR to 3.5%. This move is part of a broader stimulus package aimed at boosting the Chinese economy amid trade tensions and deflationary pressures. The rate cuts came as state-backed lenders reduced deposit rates to protect their net interest margins. Despite near-term upside, Nomura cautioned of a potential "double whammy" from a housing slump and renewed U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill advanced in the House after conservatives initially stalled it over insufficient spending cuts. Negotiations led to some minor modifications, allowing the bill to move forward. The legislation would extend tax cuts from Mr. Trump's first term while temporarily ending taxes on tips and overtime. The tax measures, as well as increased spending on the military and border security, would be offset partly by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and clean energy subsidies. The legislation faces further hurdles in the Rules Committee and potential obstacles in the Senate.</p>

          <p>A Mexican naval ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in the deaths of two crew members. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident, focusing on the ship's sudden acceleration before the collision. The ship was moving at six knots when it hit the bridge, and investigators are working to determine the cause of the acceleration. The damaged vessel is currently docked at Pier 36 in Manhattan, and officials are working with Mexican counterparts to access the ship and interview crew members.</p>

The artifacts, including a Sumerian vessel and two Babylonian ceramic sculptures, were recovered following criminal investigations into looted art. The artifacts were returned in an official ceremony attended by Met officials and representatives from Iraq. The Manhattan district attorney's office said the investigation into Robin Symes led to the seizure of 135 antiquities valued at $58 million.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed the Take It Down Act into law, which imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation, including the use of AI to create fake images. The bill makes it a federal crime to knowingly publish or threaten to publish intimate images without consent, requiring websites and social media companies to remove such material within 48 hours. Melania Trump, who advocated for the bill, called it a "national victory" to protect children from online exploitation. Critics, however, argue that the bill is too broad and could lead to censorship.</p>
