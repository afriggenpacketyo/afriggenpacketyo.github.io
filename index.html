          <p>A UK court has sentenced Constance Marten, an aristocrat, and her partner Mark Gordon to 14 years in prison for the gross negligence manslaughter of their newborn daughter, Victoria. The couple went on the run to prevent the baby from being taken into care, living in a tent during freezing winter conditions, which led to the infant's death. The judge described their actions as "neglect of the gravest and most serious type," noting their focus was on themselves rather than the baby's welfare. The child's body was later found in a shopping bag in a shed.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, numerous individuals across various industries have been fired or disciplined for their public comments about the event. Legal experts note that private employers generally have the right to terminate employees for statements that could harm the company's reputation or violate workplace policies. The incidents, involving a sports reporter, a university employee, and an MSNBC analyst among others, highlight the professional risks of speaking out on politically charged issues and the limited First Amendment protections for private-sector workers.</p>

          <p>The town of Madison, New Jersey, faced public criticism, notably from former Jets player Nick Mangold, for not lowering its American flag to half-staff following the assassination of Charlie Kirk. In response, town officials stated they were adhering to the state of New Jersey's official flag status, which indicated "full staff" at the time. The incident sparked a debate over protocol and respect, with Madison officials reaffirming their condemnation of political violence while maintaining they followed the state's directive.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut appearing imminent, financial experts are advising savers to reposition their funds to maximize returns before rates on savings vehicles decline further. The article suggests moving significant sums, such as $10,000, out of traditional savings accounts, which offer minimal interest. Three recommended alternatives are Certificates of Deposit (CDs) for their fixed rates, high-yield savings accounts for a balance of high returns and accessibility, and money market accounts for their check-writing features. Proactive measures are encouraged as current high rates are not expected to last. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese market regulators have accused Nvidia of violating antitrust laws concerning its $7 billion acquisition of Mellanox Technologies in 2020, a deal crucial to Nvidia's data center and AI networking strategy. The probe is seen by some analysts as politically motivated amid ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S. and China. Separately, cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks received a positive outlook after being added to Wedbush Securities' "best ideas" list, with analysts citing its strong platformization strategy and the potential of its recent CyberArk acquisition.

          <p>Shares of AI cloud infrastructure provider CoreWeave increased by up to 8% after the company revealed a significant purchase agreement with Nvidia valued at a minimum of $6.3 billion. Under the deal, Nvidia is obligated to buy any of CoreWeave's unsold cloud capacity through April 2032. This development underscores the strong partnership between the two companies, as CoreWeave is a major customer for Nvidia's GPUs and Nvidia is a key investor in CoreWeave. The company, which went public in March, has seen its stock triple in value.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The IRS deadline for third-quarter estimated tax payments is September 15, a crucial date for freelancers, gig workers, and those with investment income not subject to withholding. Tax experts advise that recent tax breaks enacted by the Trump administration for 2025 could complicate calculations for some filers, potentially leading to overpayments if not adjusted properly. To avoid underpayment penalties, taxpayers should generally pay at least 90% of their current year's tax liability or 100-110% of the previous year's, depending on income. Consulting a tax professional is recommended to ensure accurate payments.</p>

UK Defence Secretary John Healey described Russia's actions as "reckless" and stated the response shows that when the alliance is threatened, its members respond together. The incident has significantly heightened tensions across Europe.</p>

          <p>Valentino Luchin, a 62-year-old chef from San Francisco, has been arrested on suspicion of robbing three banks within the city's Central District on a single day. According to police, Luchin allegedly entered a bank on Grant Avenue and passed a note to an employee demanding money before fleeing with the cash. Investigators identified him as the suspect and linked him to two other similar robberies that occurred the same day. Luchin, who previously worked as a chef at local restaurants, was booked on two counts of robbery and one count of attempted robbery.</p>

          <p>President Trump's nomination of economic adviser Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve Board is generating significant controversy ahead of a Senate vote. Critics are alarmed by Miran's past writings advocating for less central bank independence and his plan to take an unpaid leave of absence from his White House role rather than resigning if confirmed. Democrats and watchdog groups argue this could give the president undue political influence over monetary policy, which is intended to be independent. Miran has stated he would act independently, but his nomination is seen as part of a broader effort by Trump to influence the Fed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article discusses the firing of Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah, reportedly for her social media posts following Charlie Kirk's assassination, as part of a broader media retrenchment from pro-democracy and racial equity coverage. The author argues that major news outlets are swinging to the right and embracing a "both sides" model to avoid appearing biased, which mutes honest coverage of the Republican party's anti-democratic turn. This shift creates a hostile environment for Black journalists, whose voices are vital for forthrightly discussing America's shortcomings on both democracy and racial inequality.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary argues that the public response to Charlie Kirk's assassination, particularly from President Trump, highlights a severe deterioration of democratic norms and civil discourse in the U.S. The author contrasts the current climate of blame and division with the sense of shared national mourning that followed assassinations in the 1960s. The article criticizes Trump for weaponizing the tragedy to attack political opponents rather than promoting unity and for fostering a climate of fear that undermines free speech. It concludes with a fear that these actions are lowering the flag on American democracy itself.</p>

          <p>Colorado-based family influencer Kyana Miner is offering advice on how families can save money on skiing and snowboarding for the upcoming winter season. She recommends programs like the free Epic SchoolKids Colorado Pack for K-5 students and the low-cost Colorado Ski Country USA pass, which provide numerous days of access to multiple resorts. Miner also suggests booking packages that combine lodging and lift tickets, skiing on weekdays, visiting smaller resorts, and renting equipment for children who grow quickly. Planning ahead is key, as waiting until later in the season often leads to higher prices.</p>

The Prime Minister defended the initial due diligence process but admitted the new information revealed a relationship far different from what was understood at the time of the appointment, which he said cuts across his government's stance on violence against women.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Trymaine Lee explores the profound personal and physical toll of spending over a decade reporting on gun violence and the deaths of Black Americans. A near-fatal heart attack at age 38 forced him to confront the stress and trauma of repeatedly covering stories of young victims who resembled him, which he describes as seeing himself "repeatedly gunned down." Lee's book traces the history of Black Americans' relationship with firearms and serves as a plea for the country to recognize the humanity of the victims and address its "lust for these guns."</p>

          <p>This opinion piece frames the assassination of Charlie Kirk as a grim reflection of modern influencer culture, where political discourse has become a form of entertainment and public figures foster a sense of intimacy with their audience. The article notes the reaction of leftist streamer Hasan Piker, a peer of Kirk's, who processed the event live on his stream, highlighting the personal risks creators face from the very culture they shape. The author suggests Kirk's death could have a chilling effect on face-to-face political debate, pushing discourse further into the virtual realm and fostering more radicalization and dehumanization.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by budgeting app Empower indicates that Americans' emergency funds are shrinking, with the median amount saved dropping to $500 from $600 a year ago. One in three Americans report having no emergency fund at all, suggesting increased financial precarity likely due to inflation and rising prices. Even higher earners are saving less, with another survey showing a $5,000 decrease in the median emergency savings for full-time employees with retirement accounts.
