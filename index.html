          <p>The Kremlin has confirmed that a meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin has been agreed upon and is expected to take place next week. This follows Trump's statement expressing a "good chance" of meeting with both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to address the ongoing war in Ukraine. The announcement comes as a Friday deadline approaches for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face significant U.S. sanctions. The potential summit marks a shift in tone after weeks of Trump expressing frustration with Russia's lack of progress in ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods due to India's continued oil trade with Russia, but India's government and markets have shown little panic, viewing the move as a pressure tactic. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has gained domestic support to resist the measures, vowing not to compromise the interests of the nation's farmers, a key point of contention in trade talks. While the tariffs could significantly impact sectors like gems, jewelry, and textiles, India's economy is bolstered by strong domestic consumption.

The airline confirmed the problem was resolved and that it was working to restore normal operations, though residual delays were expected to persist. The Federal Aviation Administration acknowledged the disruption was specific to United and not part of a broader air traffic control system failure.

          <p>The well-preserved body of Nasiruddin, a 31-year-old father who vanished in 1997, has been found on a melting glacier in Pakistan, bringing closure to his family. He had reportedly fallen into a crevasse while fleeing a village dispute with his brother, who survived. The discovery highlights a growing trend where receding glaciers, a consequence of climate change, are revealing the remains of individuals who went missing decades ago. The article notes several similar discoveries in recent years on mountains like Everest and in the Swiss Alps, linking these findings to rising global temperatures.</p>

The decision was narrow, with the Monetary Policy Committee voting 5-4 in favor of the reduction, reflecting a division among policymakers. The central bank is navigating a complex economic environment, balancing higher-than-expected inflation with a cooling labor market and stagnant GDP growth. Officials reiterated that future rate cuts will be cautious and dependent on the continued easing of underlying inflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly raised its full-year 2025 financial outlook after reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by massive demand for its diabetes and weight loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. The pharmaceutical company now projects sales between $60 billion and $62 billion for the fiscal year. However, the company's stock fell in premarket trading after late-stage trial data for its experimental oral obesity pill, orforglipron, showed results that were below analyst expectations. The strong performance comes as the company prepares for potential U.S. tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peloton reported an unexpected profit for its fiscal fourth quarter, signaling a potential turnaround under its new CEO, Peter Stern. The positive earnings were attributed to better-than-expected sales and significant cost-cutting measures.

Stern outlined a new growth strategy that includes opening smaller "micro-stores," expanding its used hardware marketplace, and increasing the presence of its instructors at in-person events.

          <p>This article explores the cultural and political history of survivalism, tracing its roots from 1970s counter-culture figures to modern-day billionaire "preppers." It examines how fiction, from "Robinson Crusoe" to "The Last of Us," has shaped our understanding of survival, distinguishing between the temporary survivor who seeks to rejoin civilization and the permanent "survivalist" who often desires its collapse. The piece contrasts the individualistic, often violent fantasies of some preppers with real-world disaster studies showing that communities tend to respond with mutual aid and solidarity. It critiques the often paranoid and misanthropic worldview promoted by the survivalist genre.</p>

Education advocates argue the administration is weaponizing federal funds to enforce ideological conformity on campuses, which they describe as a threat to the core mission of higher education. The settlements are seen as a victory for the administration's campaign to reshape what it calls an adversarial university sector.</p>

          <p>The startup Neurable is pioneering non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, embedding electroencephalography (EEG) sensors into everyday devices like headphones to monitor brain activity. Their first product, in partnership with Master & Dynamic, can track a user's focus levels and prompt them to take breaks, with future applications aimed at monitoring broader brain health, including early detection of conditions like Alzheimer's. Unlike invasive BCIs, this technology interprets electrical signals rather than thoughts and is being developed with a strong emphasis on data privacy and anonymization. The goal is to make neurotechnology an accessible platform for health tracking and device control.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has publicly called for a direct meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating that "real solutions" to the war can only be achieved at the leadership level. His appeal follows a "highly productive" meeting between Putin and a U.S. envoy, after which President Trump suggested a potential summit could happen soon. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for Russia to take concrete steps to end the aggression it initiated. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has confirmed that preparations for a Trump-Putin summit are underway but reiterated that the prerequisites for a meeting with Zelenskyy have not yet been met.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new legislative measure capping federal graduate school loans has sparked concern among medical professionals, who argue it will create significant financial barriers for aspiring doctors. The law sets a lifetime limit of $200,000 for professional programs, a figure below the average cost of medical school. The American Medical Association's president called the change a "punch in the face," warning it could worsen a projected physician shortage by deterring qualified candidates, especially those from lower-income backgrounds. While some experts believe the caps will control soaring tuition costs, others predict students will be forced to rely on less flexible private loans. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Harvard Medical School reveals that a deficiency of the metal lithium, which occurs naturally in the brain, may be a key factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The research found that lithium levels were markedly lower in the brains of people with Alzheimer's, and that this depletion was one of the earliest detectable changes. In mice, restoring lithium levels with a compound called lithium orotate, which is effective at very low doses, helped restore memory. The findings suggest a new potential strategy for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the neurodegenerative disease.</p>

The BBC's decision to air the pre-recorded episodes has been controversial. Critics have noted that the show feels awkward and lacks its usual energy, speculating that it may have been re-edited to minimize the presenters' roles and jokes.</p>

The move would be an embarrassing rebuke, but officials hope a receiver can cut through the red tape that has stalled past reform efforts.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Los Angeles should pull out of hosting the 2028 Summer Olympics following President Trump's appointment to head a federal task force for the games. The author contends that Trump, who has a history of hostility towards the city, will use the event and its security apparatus to further his political agenda and potentially deploy the military, as he did during recent deportation operations. The piece criticizes LA28 chair Casey Wasserman for praising Trump and suggests that the city's resources would be better spent on solving its own problems rather than staging a spectacle that could be co-opted.</p>

Supporters argue this provides necessary convenience and choice, while critics, including some Democrats and veterans' groups, worry that diverting federal funds to the private sector could weaken the specialized VA health system. The debate centers on balancing accessibility for veterans with the goal of maintaining a strong, direct-care VA infrastructure.</p>
