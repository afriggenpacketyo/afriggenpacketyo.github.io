          <p>Democrats in Texas are strongly criticizing a new congressional map proposed by Republicans, labeling it as a "grossly unfair" and "deeply undemocratic" plan. They argue the map is a partisan gerrymander designed to dilute the voting power of minority communities, particularly Black and Latino populations, to secure more seats for the GOP. Critics warn that this move could set a dangerous precedent, potentially triggering similar partisan redistricting efforts in other states across the country. The plan aims to shift five Democratic-held districts into Republican-leaning territories, a move supported by former President Trump.</p>

          <p>Filipina-Australian artist Loribelle Spirovski has won the People's Choice Award for Australia's prestigious Archibald Prize for her portrait of musician William Barton. Spirovski created the work by painting with her fingers, as a nerve injury had made it painful for her to hold a brush. She expressed her joy and gratitude, stating the experience was a "beautiful reprieve" after a difficult period. The award-winning portrait was created while listening to Barton's music, which inspired her to use her hands directly, making the process almost painless and creatively fulfilling.</p>

          <p>India has remained firm in its trade negotiations with the United States, resisting pressure to grant greater market access to American agricultural products despite facing new tariffs. The Indian government's stance is primarily driven by the need to protect its local farmers, who represent a significant and influential voting bloc. Officials have stated that national interest comes first and they will not be rushed by deadlines, signaling that sensitive sectors like agriculture are a clear red line. Analysts suggest that the US has a strategic interest in not alienating India, viewing it as a key partner in the Indo-Pacific and a potential manufacturing alternative to China.

          <p>A jury in Colorado has convicted dentist James Craig of first-degree murder for poisoning his wife, Angela Craig, with arsenic and cyanide placed in her protein shakes. Prosecutors presented evidence of Craig's incriminating internet searches and a financial motive, including a struggling dental practice and $4 million in life insurance policies. The defense had suggested the possibility of suicide, but the jury found him guilty on all charges, including soliciting an inmate to murder the lead investigator. A first-degree murder conviction in Colorado carries an automatic sentence of life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>Airlines are demanding answers from NATS, the UK's air traffic control provider, after a radar-related system failure caused widespread flight cancellations and delays across the country. The incident, which NATS said was resolved in 20 minutes by switching to a backup system, led to over 150 cancellations and grounded thousands of flights. This is the second major outage in two years, prompting severe criticism from airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet, who called the situation "outrageous" and "extremely disappointing." The government is now working with NATS to understand the cause of the failure and prevent future disruptions.</p>

          <p>China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.3 in July, indicating a fourth straight month of contraction and a worse-than-expected result. The decline is attributed to factors like a traditional off-season, extreme weather events such as heatwaves and flooding, and ongoing trade tensions with the United States. Sub-indexes for employment, new orders, and raw materials inventory also contracted, signaling broad weakness in the sector. Analysts express concern, suggesting the economic impact of tariffs will become more apparent in the coming months and that the data points to a worrying situation for China's economy.

          <p>According to a former senior Chinese diplomat, the European Union's policy of "de-risking" from China may inadvertently increase its economic and security dependence on the United States. Shi Mingde, China's former ambassador to Germany, argued that the EU's recent trade deal with Washington reinforces this reliance and undermines the bloc's goal of achieving strategic autonomy. Speaking at an event in Beijing, Shi criticized the logic that greater reliance on China leads to greater risk, while the EU's even stronger dependence on the US is overlooked. This perspective comes as Beijing continues to reject the EU's de-risking strategy as a veiled attempt to contain its growth.</p>

          <p>A plan by Elon Musk's Boring Company to build a 10-mile underground transit loop in Nashville has sparked a conflict between state and local politicians. The project, announced with the support of Tennessee's Republican Governor, is being promoted as privately funded at no cost to taxpayers. However, Democratic lawmakers in Nashville are demanding more information, raising concerns about the lack of public input, environmental assessments, and transparency regarding the "no cost" lease of public land to the company. The controversy highlights tensions over the project's approval process, which appears to be fast-tracked at the state level.</p>

          <p>Following an outcry from residents, Los Angeles city leaders have moved to restrict the construction of duplexes on single-family lots in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, which is rebuilding after a major fire. The decision came after Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order allowing fire-affected areas to be exempt from SB 9, a state law promoting housing density. Residents expressed fears that increased density would worsen evacuation routes in future fires and alter the community's character. Pro-development groups have criticized the move, arguing it uses legitimate fire safety concerns to block a housing law that powerful residents oppose.</p>

          <p>A New Mexico judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin against prosecutors and investigators involved in the fatal "Rust" movie set shooting case. Baldwin had alleged malicious prosecution and civil rights violations.

An attorney for Baldwin stated that the dismissal was a procedural matter, as they have been engaged in good-faith settlement discussions and will refile if those talks are not resolved favorably.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan put forth by the airport's owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which they claim would avoid the costly and disruptive need to reroute the M25 motorway. The company argues their proposal offers reduced risk and would prevent spiraling costs, estimating a cost under £25 billion. This marks the first time a competing bid has been formally submitted for the airport's expansion, introducing a new dynamic to the long-debated infrastructure project.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis explores the multifaceted impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on the U.S. and global economy. While the tariffs have significantly increased U.S. government revenue and are projected to reduce future borrowing, they have also contributed to a widening of the trade deficit, as companies stockpiled imports to avoid the tax. The policies have notably reduced Chinese exports to the U.S., but China has found new markets elsewhere. Economists warn that the tariffs are beginning to push up U.S. consumer prices on certain imported goods, and the Congressional Budget Office projects they will shrink the overall size of the U.S. economy.

The Fed is navigating a complex economic environment, weighing the inflationary effects of new tariffs against signs that the economy is losing momentum.

          <p>Following a major earthquake in Russia that triggered Pacific-wide alerts, this article explains the science of how tsunamis are formed and what to do if one occurs. A tsunami is typically generated by a strong underwater earthquake, at least magnitude 6.5 to 7, that causes vertical movement of the sea floor. While challenging to predict accurately, scientists use tide gauges and deep ocean pressure sensors to forecast their path and potential impact. For safety, officials advise moving immediately to higher ground—at least 30 to 100 feet above sea level—upon receiving a warning, as the waves can travel at jet-speed and are extremely powerful.</p>

This life is not fueled by sunlight but by chemicals like methane seeping from the ocean floor. The findings challenge previous assumptions about the limits of life and suggest that such "chemosynthetic" ecosystems may be widespread in the planet's deepest trenches.</p>
