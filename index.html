          <p>A man has been sentenced to life with a minimum of 28 years in prison for the murder of his estranged wife, Kulsuma Akter, in Bradford. The attack occurred in broad daylight as she was pushing their infant son in a pram, with the judge noting the brutal and merciless nature of the stabbing. Ms. Akter had been residing in a women's refuge prior to the attack, and the court heard that her husband, a Bangladeshi national, will likely face deportation proceedings.</p>

The company noted that economic uncertainty has impacted consumer confidence, but it narrowed its full-year earnings forecast to the higher end of its previous range. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The projected cost for constructing the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk has surged to £38 billion, a significant increase from the previous £20 billion estimate. The government, which holds a major stake, confirmed new investment from partners like Centrica, with the project expected to add about £1 per month to household energy bills during its decade-long construction. This massive cost escalation raises concerns about taxpayer liability, especially as it follows similar issues with its predecessor, Hinkley Point C. (not investment advice)</p>

The sweeping changes would impact millions of workers, potentially rolling back minimum wage and overtime protections for home health aides and weakening safety standards for construction workers and miners.

Beyond its cooling effects, shade fosters social cohesion and community life, yet it is a resource often overlooked in modern urban planning.</p>

          <h2>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's Political Influence in Washington Reportedly Surpasses Tech Peers</h2>

          <p>This article posits that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has emerged as a more politically influential figure in Washington than other prominent tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook and Tesla's Elon Musk. His ascendance is attributed to the critical importance of Nvidia's AI chips to the global economy and his effective lobbying of the Trump administration, which recently led to eased restrictions on chip sales to China. Huang's ability to navigate the complex U.S.-China trade relationship has solidified his role as a key business-to-government envoy.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the Center for Working-Class Politics suggests that Democrats could win back a significant portion of working-class Trump voters by adopting a "social populist" platform. The research finds that while these voters are often socially moderate, they hold strongly progressive views on economic issues like minimum wage increases and job protections. The report identifies that approximately 11% of Trump's working-class supporters fit this profile, representing a potentially election-swaying segment of the electorate that could be persuaded by a worker-focused economic message.</p>

The enhanced subsidies that made plans more affordable, passed during the pandemic, are set to expire at the end of 2025.

          <p>A recent ruling from a federal appeals court is being described as an existential threat to the 1965 Voting Rights Act, one of the nation's most consequential civil rights laws. The decision in *Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians v.

If the Supreme Court upholds this ruling, enforcement would be left almost exclusively to the Justice Department, effectively nullifying the law's primary enforcement mechanism.</p>
