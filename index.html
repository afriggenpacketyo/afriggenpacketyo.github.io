          <h2>Oil Prices Surge Following US-China Tariff Reduction Agreement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 07:50:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Crude oil prices experienced a 4% increase after the United States and China reached an agreement to reduce tariffs, easing trade tensions between the world's two largest petroleum consumers. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that further meetings are expected in the coming weeks to work towards a more comprehensive agreement. The tariff reductions, which will remain in place for 90 days, aim to stimulate economic growth and address concerns about a potential recession that had previously driven oil prices to four-year lows. Bessent also noted progress in discussions with China regarding fentanyl precursor drugs. Optimism spurred by the trade pause announcement also drove global financial markets sharply higher.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has announced its plans to tighten immigration controls, prioritizing skilled workers with degree-level qualifications for work visas. The proposed policy aims to reduce immigration by approximately 39,000 annually by 2029. While loosening visa rules for 'high potential individuals' and research interns, the new measures include doubling the residency period required for indefinite stay applications to 10 years, abolishing the care visa due to exploitation concerns, and implementing stricter English language requirements for visa applicants and their adult dependents. Despite aiming to reduce net migration, the government has refrained from setting an overall cap, emphasizing a 'controlled, selective, and fair' system.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to reduce import tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days, signaling a temporary de-escalation in their trade war. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer announced that the U.S. would cut tariffs on Chinese goods from as high as 145% to 30%, while China will reduce its tariffs on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. This move follows negotiations in Geneva and has triggered a rally in global financial markets, with investors expressing optimism about potential trade agreements with other U.S. partners. While the pause eases threats of recession and inflation, some analysts caution that the 90-day period may not be sufficient to reach a lasting resolution.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs is facing a trial in New York City on charges of sexual assault trafficking and racketeering, accused of running a criminal enterprise that coerced women into commercial sex acts. The trial is expected to feature testimony from singer Casandra Ventura (Cassie), who previously filed a lawsuit against Combs alleging sexual assault and physical abuse. Security video of Combs attacking Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016 is expected to be a key piece of evidence.

          <p>The White House is reportedly in discussions with Qatar's royal family to potentially receive a luxury Boeing 747 jet for use as Air Force One, raising legal and ethical questions. Qatar has stated that the transfer of an aircraft for 'temporary use' is under discussion, while the White House insists any gift would be accepted in compliance with all applicable laws. Democrats and some Trump allies have criticized the move, citing constitutional restrictions on accepting gifts from foreign states without congressional approval. The potential value of the plane is estimated at $400 million, and it would require retrofitting and security clearances before use.</p>

          <p>Claire Hoffman's biography, *Sister, Sinner*, examines the life of Aimee Semple McPherson, a world-famous evangelist who vanished in 1926 and later reappeared with a tale of abduction. The book draws parallels between McPherson and modern-day influencers, highlighting her ambition, technological savvy, and ability to connect with followers. However, the review notes the book's reluctance to offer a critical opinion of McPherson's actions, particularly regarding the hoax and its consequences. The review also touches on the broader theme of how society treats famous women, either lionizing or vilifying them, and argues for a more nuanced perspective.</p>

          <p>Hamas is expected to release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, the last remaining U.S. citizen captured by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, who is believed to still be alive. The release is part of what Hamas says is a step toward reaching a ceasefire agreement with Israel, aiming to open Gaza's border crossings and bring aid to the region. While President Trump hailed the release as a step taken in good faith, Israel denies it must offer concessions in exchange. The U.S.-Hamas deal is the latest in a series of major decisions Trump has taken in the Mideast while sidestepping Israel's leadership.</p>

          <p>Ukraine reported that Russia launched over 100 drones in nighttime attacks, despite calls for a 30-day ceasefire. The Ukrainian air force said Monday, after the Kremlin rejected an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in the war. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has challenged President Vladimir Putin to meet for peace talks in Turkey, though there has been no response from the Kremlin. The U.S. and European governments have been pushing for a ceasefire, but Russia has instead offered direct talks with Ukraine on Thursday, without confirming Putin's participation.</p>

          <p>Bridgend council in Wales is under scrutiny for creating a PowerPoint presentation intended for use in schools that appeared to endorse strangulation during sex. The presentation included a slide stating, 'It is never OK to start choking someone without asking them first,' raising concerns that it normalized an illegal and dangerous act. Although the council claims the slide was part of a draft version that was never shown to children and was later removed, experts and politicians have questioned why such content was ever considered appropriate. Critics emphasize that non-fatal strangulation is a criminal offense and that sex education materials should prioritize safeguarding and accurate information.</p>

          <p>President Trump's upcoming trip to the Middle East is primarily focused on securing business deals, rather than advancing a strategic vision for the region, according to news analysis. The trip, which includes stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, aims to announce deals worth over $1 trillion. While Trump's aides insist he still wants to broker a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel, the focus is largely on financial transactions that will produce jobs for American workers. The visit also aligns with the Trump family's expanding business plans in the region, including real estate and cryptocurrency ventures.</p>

          <p>Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, has intimated that parents are to blame for their children’s autism, and that they are responsible for researching every aspect of their children’s lives that could affect their development. He has told parents to “do their own research” when it comes to vaccinating their kids, stating that scientists are still trying to understand whether the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes severe side effects like brain swelling (they know; it doesn’t). Critics argue that these statements perpetuate harmful myths and place undue burden on parents, particularly mothers.

          <p>A contested North Carolina state supreme court race that took nearly six months to resolve has revealed a strategy for candidates to challenge election results retroactively. Despite a federal judge halting the effort, the state court's initial embrace of disenfranchising voters could encourage similar challenges in the future.

          <p>American air travel is experiencing a period of increasing difficulties due to outdated technology and staffing shortages within the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Incidents such as radar system failures, near misses, and aborted landings are becoming more frequent. The FAA's air traffic controllers rely on outdated systems, including copper wiring, floppy disks, and paper flight records, making it difficult to modernize the network and maintain safe operations. There are also problems with staffing and employee morale, leading to more time off and less experienced controllers working the control panels.

NOAA has lost at least 2,000 workers since January due to layoffs, buyouts, and retirements, and faces potential budget cuts of nearly 30%. These reductions could hamper efforts to improve forecast accuracy and compromise existing forecasts, impacting critical sectors like air travel, farming, and emergency preparedness.
