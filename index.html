          <p>A recent New York Times article highlights concerns about the White House's approach to science funding and research integrity. The administration's executive order, intended to "restore a gold standard for science," has been met with criticism from thousands of scientists, academics, physicians, and researchers. Critics argue that the administration's previous actions, including budget cuts to scientific research, contradict the stated goal of promoting scientific excellence. This raises questions about the administration's commitment to evidence-based policymaking and the potential impact on scientific advancements. The article suggests a disconnect between the administration's rhetoric and its actual policies regarding scientific research.</p>

          <p>A glacier collapse in Switzerland has wiped the village of Blatten off the map, leaving residents displaced and the area unstable. The event, described as an "explosion" by evacuees, buried homes and businesses under millions of cubic meters of rock and ice debris. While the 300 residents were evacuated in time, one life was thought to have been claimed and the community faces the challenge of rebuilding their lives and livelihoods. Experts attribute the collapse to a combination of factors, including melting glaciers and permafrost due to climate change, which are increasing the frequency of natural hazards in mountain regions. The long-term impact on the local culture and traditions is a major concern for residents.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Credit card issuers are lowering credit limits for consumers due to rising credit card debt, delinquencies, and defaults, reflecting increased caution in today's economy. Issuers can reduce credit limits with little or no notice, even for customers with good payment histories, and this can negatively impact credit scores. Common reasons for credit limit reductions include inactivity, a drop in credit score, high balances, missed payments, or changes in income. Consumers affected by this can ask for an explanation, request a credit limit increase, review their credit utilization, monitor their credit reports, or consider switching to another card. Taking proactive steps can mitigate the damage to one's credit score.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced that 287 child sexual exploitation cases, previously dropped by local police forces, will be re-examined. These cases have been handed to a national police taskforce to determine whether to reopen them and pursue new lines of inquiry. The review was initiated in January, with Cooper requesting all police forces in England and Wales to reassess historic gang exploitation cases where no further action was taken. Half of the police forces have reported back so far, leading to the identification of these 287 cases for review.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has voiced concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on inflation and the labor market. Cook anticipates that President Trump's trade policies could lead to higher inflation and a cooling labor market, complicating the Fed's monetary policy decisions. She noted that while progress has been made on inflation, the broad range of tariffs could make further progress difficult in the near term. Cook's comments come ahead of the Fed's next policy meeting, where interest rates are expected to remain on hold, and she emphasized the importance of remaining a student of economic history during periods of uncertainty.

Hill violated the agreement by claiming on social media that Bauer indirectly paid her an insurance sum to drop her countersuit.

          <p>Saudi authorities are implementing high-tech solutions like drones, AI, and facial recognition to enhance safety during this year's Hajj pilgrimage. The measures aim to manage crowds, prevent overcrowding, and ensure only permitted individuals enter certain areas, especially after last year's deadly heatwave. However, the increased reliance on technology raises concerns about data privacy, state surveillance, and potential cybercrime. Critics argue that mandatory technologies, combined with Saudi Arabia's data protection laws, could compromise pilgrims' data safety and privacy, with little recourse for individuals to question their use. The integration of technology may also detract from the spiritual essence of the Hajj, transforming it into a "cyber experience."</p>

This follows Trump's previous warning to Governor Gavin Newsom about cutting federal funding if a transgender athlete competed in the girls' track and field championship. The California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) amended its rules to accommodate female athletes who finished behind the trans athlete, granting them qualification and podium finishes. The Department of Justice has also announced a federal probe into California over potential Title IX violations.

          <p>The head of the UN's nuclear safety watchdog, Rafael Grossi, stated that the conditions for restarting Ukraine's Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are not currently in place. The lack of water for cooling and an unstable power supply prevent the plant from resuming operations. Grossi noted that water would need to be pumped from the Dnipro River, and a thorough inspection of the plant's machinery, which has been inoperable for three years, is necessary. Despite Russian interest in restarting the plant, it is unlikely to occur anytime soon, according to the IAEA chief. The nuclear plant has been occupied by Russia since March 2022.</p>

          <p>In this "Dear James" column from The Atlantic, a reader laments feeling disconnected from the world due to their punk rock sensibilities clashing with their mundane, middle-aged life. James Parker responds with humor and philosophical insight, suggesting that embracing this world-weary vision can be a stimulant for life rather than a philosophical dead end. He advises the reader to use their cynicism to sharpen their senses and refine their language, finding joy in small pleasures and helping others. Parker recommends the band Godflesh for music and the TV show "Friendship" for entertainment, offering a blend of nihilism and practical advice.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is hiring over 100 employees to "stabilize operations" after significant job cuts ordered by the Trump administration earlier in the year. The new hires will fill critical positions in meteorology, hydrology, and electronic maintenance, addressing staffing shortages that affected field offices and weather data collection. Some field offices were no longer staffed around the clock, and weather balloon launches were reduced, impacting forecasting capabilities. While this is a positive step, the NWS is still short several hundred positions, and it may take months to fill the newly created roles.</p>

The OECD suggested closing tax loopholes and re-evaluating council tax bands based on updated property values. While UK economic growth strengthened between January and March, the OECD cautioned that "momentum is weakening" due to "deteriorating" business sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>
