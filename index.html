          <p>Several European and NATO leaders have announced they will accompany Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Washington for discussions with President Trump. This collective visit is seen as a strategic move to show unified European support for Ukraine, aiming to prevent a repeat of a contentious previous meeting. Key figures like European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte will attend, underscoring Europe's desire to be involved in peace negotiations. The presence of these leaders is intended to bolster Zelenskyy's position and ease concerns about Ukraine being pressured into an unfavorable peace deal with Russia.</p>

          <p>Protesters across Israel conducted a nationwide strike, blocking roads and closing businesses to demand a ceasefire deal with Hamas and the release of remaining hostages in Gaza. The demonstrations, which led to dozens of arrests and confrontations with police, reflect growing public frustration after 22 months of war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the protests, claiming they benefit Hamas, while far-right cabinet members remain opposed to any deal that leaves Hamas in power. The article also highlights the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with rising deaths from malnutrition and ongoing Israeli military preparations for a new offensive.</p>

          <p>Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund was not included in the squad for the Premier League match against Arsenal, a decision reportedly made by coach Ruben Amorim. This move comes amidst intense speculation about the 22-year-old's future at the club, particularly after the high-profile signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig. Although Hojlund has previously stated his desire to stay, his opportunities for playing time appear limited with the new additions. AC Milan is reportedly among the clubs interested in signing the Danish striker, but no formal agreement has been reached yet.</p>

          <p>In a recent television interview, Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that ending the war in Ukraine will require concessions from both Russia and Ukraine. Following a summit with Vladimir Putin, Rubio indicated that while significant progress wasn't made, there was enough movement to justify follow-up meetings with Ukrainian and European leaders. He stated that the U.S. aims to facilitate a peace deal that ends the conflict and allows Ukraine to rebuild with security guarantees. The administration's goal is to broker an agreement that addresses territorial disputes, security alliances, and reconstruction, acknowledging the difficulty of achieving peace without compromise from all parties.</p>

Originally hauled up by university students in the late 1970s as a quiet place to study with a view, it now serves as a landmark for introspection. Visitors leave messages and reflections in notebooks stored in the desk's drawer, which are later archived at Sul Ross State University. The journey to the desk and the vast desert landscape it overlooks provide a therapeutic experience, allowing people a space to meditate, process their thoughts, and leave their worries behind.</p>

          <p>A free-kick goal by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze against Chelsea was disallowed by VAR due to a specific rule regarding player positioning. The decision was made because a Palace player was standing less than one meter away from Chelsea's defensive wall when the kick was taken. According to Law 13 of the International Football Association Board, introduced in 2019, attacking players must maintain at least a one-meter distance from a defensive wall of three or more players. The rule was implemented to prevent time-wasting and management issues caused by attackers positioning themselves within or too close to the wall.</p>

          <p>The recent corruption investigations into several senior officials from ethnic minority communities in China may indicate a significant policy shift. Traditionally, top administrative posts in autonomous regions were reserved for non-Han officials to promote ethnic inclusion, but recent high-profile cases suggest this leniency is ending. Observers believe the downfall of these officials is part of a broader push for stricter political discipline across the board, signaling that ethnicity no longer provides protection from President Xi Jinping's anti-graft campaign. This development reflects a move towards enforcing uniform standards of conduct for all officials, regardless of their ethnic background.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed timeline of the case against Bryan Patrick Miller, known as the "Zombie Hunter," who was convicted for the murders of two young women in Phoenix in the early 1990s. The murders of Angela Brosso in 1992 and Melanie Bernas in 1993 remained unsolved for over two decades until a breakthrough in 2014. Using genetic genealogy, investigators linked DNA from the crime scenes to the surname Miller, eventually leading them to Bryan Patrick Miller. An undercover sting operation at a restaurant successfully obtained his DNA, confirming he was the killer and leading to his arrest and eventual death sentence.</p>

          <p>An elaborate undercover operation at a Chili's restaurant was instrumental in the capture of Bryan Patrick Miller, the man responsible for the Phoenix "canal murders" of the early 1990s. Cold case detective Clark Schwartzkopf posed as a security consultant and arranged a meeting with Miller, who was a person of interest after genetic genealogy pointed to his surname. During the meeting, investigators discreetly collected a water glass used by Miller, and the DNA from it provided a definitive match to evidence from the crime scenes. This crucial evidence led to the arrest of Miller, who was known locally for his "Zombie Hunter" persona, solving the decades-old murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas.</p>

          <p>In the trial of Bryan Patrick Miller, the "Zombie Hunter" convicted of the Phoenix canal murders, his defense team presented a unique argument: that severe childhood abuse by his mother created a monster. While admitting Miller committed the murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas, his lawyers argued for insanity, claiming the abuse led to dissociative amnesia, leaving him with no memory of the killings. Prosecutors countered this by highlighting Miller's clear memory of other violent incidents and presented testimony from his ex-wife about his deviant and violent behavior. Ultimately, the judge found Miller guilty and sentenced him to death, acknowledging the childhood abuse but stating it did not excuse his actions.</p>

          <p>According to this opinion article, the recent summit in Anchorage, Alaska, was a strategic victory for Russian President Vladimir Putin over Donald Trump. The author contends that Trump returned empty-handed, failing to secure his primary goal of a ceasefire, and instead accepted Putin's framing that a comprehensive peace agreement must come first. By agreeing to further bilateral talks without Ukraine, Trump has potentially sown more distrust between the U.S. and its European allies. The summit ultimately bolstered Putin's position, allowing Russia to continue its military aggression while keeping Trump engaged in diplomatic processes that favor Russian interests.</p>

          <p>Many individual investors fail to achieve the average returns of the stock market, such as the S&P 500, due to several key behavioral and structural factors. Emotional decision-making often leads investors to buy high during rallies and sell low during downturns, significantly hindering long-term growth. Attempts to time the market are also detrimental, as missing just a few of the best-performing days can drastically reduce overall returns. Furthermore, chasing trendy "meme" stocks, paying management fees for funds, and the inherent difficulty of picking consistently winning individual stocks all contribute to this performance gap.

          <h2>Advocates Argue Trump's Law-and-Order Approach to DC Crime Ignores Proven Prevention Strategies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Violence prevention advocates argue that the Trump administration's focus on militarized law enforcement to combat crime in Washington D.C. and other cities is misguided and ineffective. They contend that this approach ignores decades of data showing that community-based violence intervention programs are more successful at creating long-term safety. These programs, which recently received federal support under the Biden administration, work directly with individuals most at risk of committing violence to de-escalate conflicts and address root causes. Critics say Trump's rhetoric and recent funding cuts to these programs show a disconnect from the realities of the communities most affected by crime.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected the Department of Justice's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from the Ghislaine Maxwell case, stating they contain no significant new information about Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking network. Judge Paul Engelmayer noted that only two law enforcement officers testified and that the public would be "disappointed and misled" by their contents, remarking, "There is no 'there' there." This decision has intensified public frustration and speculation about a cover-up, with critics arguing that the Trump administration could release a wealth of other non-grand jury investigative files but is choosing not to for political reasons.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flight operations after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by over 10,000 flight attendants that caused widespread cancellations. The Canadian Industrial Relations Board ordered staff back to work and mandated binding arbitration to resolve the dispute, a move the union criticized as "caving to corporate pressure." The flight attendants, represented by CUPE, are seeking higher wages and pay for ground time, arguing the airline's latest offer is below inflation and market value. The airline stated that while flights will begin resuming, it will take several days to fully stabilize its schedule.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has lodged a formal complaint with Japan after several cabinet members paid tribute at the Yasukuni Shrine, which honors convicted war criminals among others. The visit and a ritual offering sent by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the 80th anniversary of Japan's WWII surrender were described by Beijing as a "blatant provocation against historical justice." China's foreign ministry urged Japan to confront its history of aggression and sever ties with militarism. The shrine is a persistent source of diplomatic tension between Japan and its neighbors, who view it as a symbol of past military aggression.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been transformed into a luxury party venue and is now on the market for £3 million. Purchaser Mike Conner bought the abandoned 19th-century fortress in 2017 and undertook a challenging five-year renovation, overcoming logistical hurdles like having no running water or electricity. The historic building, originally built to defend against French naval attacks, is now equipped with 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub. Conner hopes the next owner will utilize its potential as a unique tourist attraction or event space.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Sparks forward Cameron Brink has revealed that creating vision boards was a key mental tool during her 13-month recovery from a torn ACL. The practice, suggested by teammate Dearica Hamby, helped Brink maintain a positive outlook and visualize her goals, from returning to the court to personal aspirations. By focusing on a collage of images representing her desired future, she was able to combat the mental strain and anxiety of a long and lonely rehabilitation process. This mental rehearsal is credited with her strong and confident return to the WNBA, where she has made an immediate impact for the team.</p>

          <p>Germany has suspended its humanitarian visa program, leaving approximately 300 Russian and Belarusian dissidents, including Kremlin critics and anti-war activists, in limbo. Many of these individuals had already received preliminary approval from the German Foreign Office, but the Interior Ministry has halted the issuance of visas, citing a review based on the new government's stricter migration policy. Activist groups express concern that these individuals, many of whom are in former Soviet countries, face a significant risk of extradition or abduction if they cannot reach safety in Germany. The program had previously provided refuge to over 2,600 people fleeing persecution since the start of the Ukraine war.</p>

          <p>A debate over how to expand Germany's armed forces has created a rift within the ruling coalition government. Chancellor Friedrich Merz's center-right CDU/CSU bloc favors a return to some form of compulsory military service, which was suspended in 2011, to meet NATO personnel targets. However, their coalition partners, the center-left SPD, strongly oppose compulsion and are pushing a bill to make voluntary service more attractive with better pay and training. The SPD's proposal includes a mandatory questionnaire for all 18-year-old men, but CDU lawmakers argue this is insufficient to address the current security threats facing Europe.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued after spending two days trapped in a cave behind a powerful waterfall in California's Tulare County. Ryan Wardwell was rappelling down a series of falls known as the Seven Teacups when the river's strong hydraulics pushed him off his lines and into the hidden space. After he was reported missing, search teams used a drone to locate him behind the cascade of water. A California Highway Patrol helicopter crew then performed a hoist rescue, lifting him to safety where he was treated for dehydration and minor injuries.</p>
