          <p>A non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis of a major Republican budget bill estimates it could cause nearly 12 million Americans to lose health insurance coverage. The report also projects the legislation would add $3.3 trillion to the national debt. These figures have intensified the debate as the bill, a key priority for President Trump, faces a narrow and uncertain path to final passage in the Senate. The proposed legislation includes significant cuts to Medicaid and permanent tax reductions, which critics argue primarily benefit the wealthy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The president of the University of Virginia, Jim Ryan, has resigned following what Senator Mark Warner described as an "explicit" threat from the Trump administration. According to Warner, the university was told it would face severe cuts to jobs, research funding, and student aid if Ryan did not step down by a specific deadline. The pressure campaign was reportedly linked to a Justice Department investigation into the university's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, raising alarms about political interference in higher education.</p>
