          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, erected near her hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, has been stolen, with only the hacked-off feet remaining. The life-size sculpture, a replacement for a wooden statue that was set on fire in 2020, stood in a field outside Sevnica. Residents suspect vandalism or melting for cash, but do not believe it was politically motivated. The statue was commissioned by American artist Brad Downey as an interrogation of President Trump's stance on immigration, but was derided by locals as unesthetic. </p>

          <p>Two North Korean fishermen are stuck in South Korea after their boat drifted south of the maritime boundary, marking the longest period of reluctant defection in inter-Korean history. Despite repeatedly expressing their desire to return home, Pyongyang has refused to communicate with Seoul, reflecting strained relations and a policy shift designating South Korea as a "hostile state." Experts suggest the fishermen may remain stranded until relations improve, potentially after South Korea's upcoming presidential election, with concerns raised about the well-being of their families back in North Korea. The article notes that Seoul would be happy to see the fishermen return home, as supporting defectors is an expensive and extended commitment.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from modern-day Russia 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, revealing insights into population history, migration, and adaptation over thousands of years. The study also found that early settlers split into distinct groups that became isolated in different environmental settings, affecting the health of modern South Americans.</p>

The plants under consideration include the main Oppama plant, a pioneer in electric vehicle production, and the Shonan plant of Nissan Shatai Co., which manufactures commercial vehicles.

President Duda's vetoes and referrals to the constitutional court have hindered progress on issues like the rule of law and LGBTQ+ rights.

Combs denies the charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. The prosecution aims to prove sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, and racketeering through Combs's alleged use of his network to cover up crimes.</p>

          <p>The case of a Wisconsin judge charged with helping an undocumented immigrant evade immigration authorities is similar to a case in Massachusetts, raising questions about the balance between judicial discretion and federal immigration enforcement. Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan pleaded not guilty to federal charges that she helped an undocumented immigrant facing misdemeanor battery charges slip out of her courtroom to evade immigration authorities. Bringing criminal charges in a case like this is extremely rare, but a similar case has been unfolding in Massachusetts for more than seven years. The cases have sparked debate about whether judges are upholding the law or obstructing justice, with some arguing for equal justice and others emphasizing the need to protect vulnerable individuals. </p>

The UAE is looking to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels and sees Africa as an essential part of the plan.
