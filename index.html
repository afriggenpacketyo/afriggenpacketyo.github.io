            <h2>Trump Pauses Tariff Increases Amidst Market Concerns, Escalates China Trade Tensions</h2>

            <p>President Trump announced a 90-day pause on higher tariffs for most countries after facing market volatility and pressure from Republicans, while simultaneously escalating trade tensions with China by increasing tariffs to 125% in response to Beijing's retaliatory measures. Trump cited concerns about the bond market and acknowledged that people were getting "a little yippy" as reasons for the pause, which followed his earlier insistence on imposing sweeping tariffs. The move sent US stock markets soaring, but uncertainty remains about the long-term impact on global trade relations and the US economy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed the change was part of a grand negotiation strategy, while Democrats criticized it as a retreat. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump explained his sudden reversal on "reciprocal" tariffs by stating that "people were getting a little bit afraid," referring to market volatility and unease. Despite previously insisting his tariffs were here to stay, Trump emphasized the need to be flexible and acknowledged watching the bond market closely. White House officials framed the reversal as a strategic move to create negotiating leverage, while Trump maintained that he was "honored" to have imposed the tariffs and that China wants to make a deal. The pause lowers the baseline tariff level to 10% for negotiating countries, but increases tariffs on China to 125% after retaliatory taxes from Beijing.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>President Trump's decision to pause higher tariffs, celebrated by some as a brilliant negotiating tactic, was in reality driven by anxieties over the bond market and pressure from Republicans, according to White House sources. Trump himself admitted that people were getting "a little yippy" and that he was watching the bond market closely. While aides attempted to portray the move as a strategic maneuver to isolate China and secure trade deals, the reversal highlighted the economic realities influencing Trump's approach. The tariff on China will increase to 125 percent due to the Chinese retaliation, and the White House continues to claim that dropping tariffs will only further isolate Beijing and weaken the United States’ biggest economic rival.</p>

            <p>President Trump has directed the Justice Department to investigate Miles Taylor and Chris Krebs, former homeland security officials who refuted claims of election fraud. Taylor, who wrote anonymously against Trump in the New York Times, is accused of leaking classified information, while Krebs, who secured the 2020 election, is accused of weaponizing his position against free speech. Trump accused Taylor of treason and Krebs of being a "disgrace," repeating debunked claims of a rigged election. Critics argue Trump is using the Justice Department for revenge, raising concerns about civil liberties and the suppression of dissent.</p>

            <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer shared four lessons from the market turmoil caused by President Trump's tariffs, emphasizing the importance of staying calm, avoiding greed, and recognizing the president's tendency for drama. Cramer advised investors not to panic, as staying the course is how they make the biggest money, and noted that the market action punished negative investors and rewarded those who stuck with their investments. While stability is not expected with Trump in charge, investors should assume he will change course if his policies hurt the economy. Finally, Cramer cautioned against betting against good companies, as mega-cap tech corporations are bound to rebound. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Volodymyr Zelensky, known for his effective lobbying for Western support, faces new challenges as Trump returns to the political stage. While Zelensky successfully secured aid by appealing to allies and presenting a rigid message, this approach may not work with a Trump-era diplomacy. Experts believe Zelensky's diplomatic tactics need adjustment, as his reliance on demanding support has become less effective. Tensions between Zelensky and Trump have heightened, and their relationship is described as a "rollercoaster." Despite challenges, Zelensky's popularity remains high in Ukraine, and some believe he is willing to adapt to maintain support.</p>

Trump has frequently complained about inadequate water pressure, blaming federal regulations for the issue.

The decision demonstrates the council's commitment to overhauling the aging structure, which lacks the contiguous space needed for top-tier conventions. Business leaders and construction workers have voiced strong support for the renovation, citing its potential to boost the local economy. However, Councilmember Monica Rodriguez opposed the move, arguing that the city should prioritize addressing its budget deficit. The renovation, estimated at over $4 billion, is expected to begin by the end of the year and conclude in 2029, with a temporary halt during the 2028 Olympics.</p>

            <p>The 988 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, launched nearly three years ago, has become a critical resource for individuals facing mental health emergencies. The hotline has seen a 40% increase in calls since its launch in 2022, but is facing understaffing and underfunding issues that threaten its mission. A recent study highlights the need for increased access to care after initial calls, while public health services nationwide could face federal cuts. Advocates warn that funding cuts could lead to increased hospitalizations, deaths, and mental health issues.</p>

A jury will decide damages in a trial set to begin April 28, with Dominion seeking $1.6 billion. The ruling follows similar cases against other right-wing media outlets, including Fox News, which settled with Dominion for $787.5 million. Newsmax argued its coverage was based on newsworthy allegations made by President Trump and his allies, but the judge rejected this argument.</p>

            <p>US stocks experienced a significant rally after President Trump announced a pause on steep tariffs for most countries, opting instead for a 10% import tax rate. The S&P 500 soared 9.5% in its biggest one-day gain since 2008. The decision followed days of market turmoil triggered by the tariffs. Trump said the pause was intended to allow for trade negotiations with partners who had agreed to the terms. Tariffs on goods from China remain, presenting an ongoing economic challenge.
