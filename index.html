            <p>Hashem Abedi, the brother of the Manchester Arena bomber, attacked three prison officers at HMP Frankland, leaving them with life-threatening injuries. Abedi threw hot cooking oil and used homemade weapons in the assault. The Prison Officers' Association has called for a review of freedoms given to prisoners in separation centers, suggesting tighter control and containment measures. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood condemned the attack and vowed to push for the strongest possible punishment, emphasizing that violence against prison staff will not be tolerated. The incident has raised concerns about safety and security within high-risk prisons.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices from new tariffs, a move hailed as a "game changer" by some analysts. This decision comes after concerns from US tech companies that gadget prices could skyrocket due to manufacturing in China. The exemptions, retroactive to April 5, also include semiconductors, solar cells, and memory cards. The White House indicated the exemptions aim to provide companies more time to move production to the US, but analysts believe this is a huge relief for tech investors. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump has been targeting certain law firms with executive orders, leading to legal battles and firms cutting deals to avoid damage. This action raises concerns about the use of executive power and its impact on the American legal system. NPR's Justice Correspondent Ryan Lucas explores how this use of executive power is changing the landscape of the American legal system. Some firms have fought back, arguing the orders are unconstitutional, while others have sought to comply to mitigate the potential repercussions.</p>

            <p>The UK has recorded its warmest day of the year so far, reaching 24C in Northolt, London. Temperatures have been well above the April average, with Scotland and Northern Ireland also experiencing their warmest days of the year. However, large parts of England and Wales are seeing "very high" pollen levels, mainly due to Birch and Ash tree pollen. Hay fever sufferers can expect some relief by Wednesday as the weather turns more unsettled.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump has authorized the military to take control of land at the US-Mexico border to combat undocumented immigration. The memorandum allows the armed forces to take a more direct role in securing the border, including border-barrier construction and emplacement of detection equipment. It also grants the Department of Defense jurisdiction over federal lands, allowing troops to detain immigrants accused of trespassing. The order excludes native reservations and is the latest step in Trump's focus on immigration enforcement.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has announced that it will exclude some electronics like smartphones and laptops from “reciprocal” tariffs. This move is expected to help keep prices down for consumer electronics that are primarily manufactured outside of the United States. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors, and some chips would qualify for the exemption, which will benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too.</p>

Authorities hope to recover the main rotor, transmission, roof structure, and tail structure to determine the cause of the crash. A preliminary investigation suggests a rotor may have broken off, leading to the accident. The helicopter was carrying a Siemens executive and his family on a sightseeing tour of New York City.</p>

            <p>This article discusses Donald Trump's tariff strategy and its potential impact on the U.S. economy. It questions the feasibility of Trump's goal to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., particularly in the context of complex supply chains like the one for Apple's iPhone. The article uses TSMC's experience setting up a fabrication plant in Arizona as a case study, highlighting the challenges and costs associated with reshoring manufacturing. The author concludes that bringing manufacturing back home is more difficult and time-consuming than Trump suggests.</p>
