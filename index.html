          <p>Snap's stock value dropped by 15% after the company released its second-quarter earnings, which revealed that its global average revenue per user did not meet market expectations. While the company's daily active users slightly surpassed projections, it reported a net loss of $262.6 million for the quarter, an increase from the previous year's loss. Despite the current underperformance, Snap provided a more optimistic revenue forecast for the upcoming third quarter, projecting figures that exceed Wall Street estimates as it undergoes an internal restructuring of its engineering teams.

          <p>More than 2,300 members of the Writers Guild of America have signed an open letter criticizing the Trump administration's actions as an "unprecedented, authoritarian assault" on free speech. The letter cites attempts to silence critical media, defund public broadcasting like PBS and NPR, and leverage regulatory power to influence news content. Prominent signatories like Spike Lee, Adam McKay, and David Simon are calling on industry leaders and the public to resist what they term "un-American attempts to restrict" storytelling and dissent.</p>

          <p>A major political conflict is underway in Texas, where Democrats have left the state to prevent a vote on a Republican-led plan to redraw congressional districts. The proposed map could create five new Republican-leaning seats, a move with significant implications for the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives. This article explains that the fight is part of a broader national strategy, encouraged by Donald Trump, which could trigger a redistricting "arms race" with Democratic-controlled states like California and New York considering similar partisan measures.</p>

          <p>Shares of industrial supplier Eaton fell over 6% despite the company reporting a solid second quarter and raising its full-year outlook. The market reacted negatively because the positive results did not meet the exceptionally high expectations set by Wall Street for the AI-related stock. Although management raised its profit guidance midpoint, it slightly lowered the top end due to macroeconomic uncertainties, which concerned investors. The company's underlying performance, especially in its data center and electrical segments, remains strong with a multi-year growth runway. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump claimed that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, the two largest banks in the U.S., had previously rejected him as a customer. In a CNBC interview, Trump stated that JPMorgan gave him 20 days to move hundreds of millions of dollars and that Bank of America subsequently declined his business. The allegations revive the debate over whether financial institutions unfairly "de-bank" conservative clients, an issue the Trump administration is reportedly preparing an executive order to address. The banks have denied rejecting clients for political reasons.</p>

The program will target travelers from countries with high rates of visa overstays or where security screening information is deemed deficient, with Malawi and Zambia being the first announced. This measure, stemming from a Trump administration executive order, aims to enforce immigration laws but has drawn criticism for potentially deterring tourism and harming the U.S. travel industry.</p>

          <p>Over 240 supporters of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan were arrested during rallies marking the second anniversary of his detention. Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), had called for nationwide peaceful protests demanding his release, but authorities responded by banning gatherings and blocking roads. Police used tear gas to disperse crowds in several cities, including Karachi and Lahore, where the majority of the arrests took place. Khan, who was ousted in 2022, is currently serving sentences on multiple convictions he claims are politically motivated.</p>

The lawsuit stems from a Wall Street Journal article about Jeffrey Epstein. Trump's lawyers had sought an expedited deposition, citing the 94-year-old Murdoch's age and potential health issues. The deal postpones the deposition until after a judge rules on a motion to dismiss the case, requiring Murdoch to submit a sworn declaration on his current health condition.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, total U.S. credit card debt rose to $1.21 trillion in the second quarter of 2025, consistent with the all-time high set a year prior. The report also highlights elevated delinquency rates, with nearly 7% of balances transitioning into delinquency over the past year, particularly among subprime borrowers. Researchers suggest this trend is partly due to consumers overextending themselves as they dealt with high inflation after pandemic-era leniency from lenders ended. (not investment advice)</p>
