          <p>Paul Doyle, a former Royal Marine, appeared in court facing multiple charges, including wounding with intent and dangerous driving, following an incident where his car collided with a crowd after Liverpool FC's trophy parade. The incident resulted in injuries to 79 people, including two children, and prompted a fundraising campaign for the victims. Doyle was visibly emotional during the hearing and did not apply for bail, with a plea hearing scheduled for August and a provisional trial date set for November. The charges against Doyle may change as the investigation continues, with authorities interviewing witnesses and reviewing footage of the incident. </p>

          <p>A ban on disposable vapes in the UK, set to take effect on Sunday, is unlikely to significantly reduce vaping among teenagers, according to a campaign group. The head of Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) argues that reusable vapes are too similar to disposable ones, retaining the appeal factors for young people. The government maintains the ban will reduce the appeal of vapes to children, aiming to curb youth vaping rates and reduce electronic waste. The government's Tobacco and Vapes Bill seeks to regulate vape packaging, design, and advertising to further reduce their appeal to teenagers.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that President Trump can terminate the protected status of approximately 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela while an appeal is pending. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, criticizing the majority for undervaluing the consequences of uprooting the lives of these immigrants. The ruling follows a previous decision allowing the Trump administration to revoke the status of Venezuelan immigrants under the Temporary Status Program. The decision's impact on the affected communities is expected to be significant as they face uncertainty regarding their legal status and future in the United States.</p>

          <p>The completion of Donald Trump's Golden Dome missile defense program, featuring space-based weapons, is unlikely to occur before the end of his term, despite his earlier predictions. The Pentagon's implementation plan envisions a phased approach, focusing initially on integrating data systems before developing space-based weapons. While the foundations for a fully operational system may be in place within 18 months, the capability to intercept missiles using space-based weapons is not expected to be ready. The space-based network is likely to rely on SpaceX technology, but the core concept of intercepting missiles during their boost phase remains a challenge.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times explores the reasons why millennials are increasingly hesitant to have children, citing factors such as financial burdens, career priorities, and climate change concerns.
