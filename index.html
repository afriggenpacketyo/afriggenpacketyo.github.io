          <p>The Department of Justice is set to investigate Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook based on a criminal referral from a Trump administration housing official. The referral stems from allegations of mortgage fraud, which prompted calls from President Trump and his allies for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to remove Cook from her position. However, Powell does not have the authority to fire a board member, a power reserved for the president, and Cook has stated she has no intention of resigning over the accusations.</p>

          <p>Fujifilm Biotechnologies' new manufacturing plant in North Carolina exemplifies the significant time and investment required for drugmakers to increase U.S.-based production, a process that could take years to scale. The $3 billion facility, which began development long before recent tariff discussions, shows how difficult it would be for the pharmaceutical industry to quickly pivot manufacturing onshore in response to trade policies. Despite President Trump's push for domestic production, companies like Regeneron and Johnson & Johnson are making long-term investments that are not easily accelerated, underscoring the complexities of reshaping global supply chains.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 2% in July compared to June, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. A significant 15.7% year-over-year rise in housing inventory has helped moderate price growth, with the median home price seeing only a slight 0.2% annual increase to $422,400. This trend suggests the market may be reaching an inflection point, where improved affordability from rising wages and more housing choices could further stimulate sales activity.

          <p>A New York state appeals court has thrown out the more than $500 million financial penalty imposed on President Donald Trump and his company in a civil business fraud lawsuit. The court determined the fine was excessive and violated the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. While the monetary penalty was nullified, the court upheld the underlying fraud finding and the non-monetary sanctions designed to curb the company's business practices.

          <p>After serving nearly 30 years in prison for the 1989 murder of his parents, Erik Menendez appeared virtually before a California state parole board to argue for his release.

The brothers have long maintained they acted in self-defense following years of alleged abuse, a claim prosecutors contest. The parole board will determine if he poses a risk to public safety, with Governor Gavin Newsom having the final say on any recommendation for release.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive global study analyzing millions of birdsong recordings has found that light pollution is significantly altering the daily routines of birds. Researchers discovered that artificial light effectively lengthens the day for over 500 bird species by an average of 50 minutes, causing them to start singing earlier and stop later. Species with larger eyes, such as American Robins and Northern Cardinals, showed the strongest response to the increased light. While the long-term effects are still unknown, this research provides unprecedented insight into how human-created environments are impacting wildlife behavior on a massive scale.</p>

          <p>A political analysis suggests that Stephen Miller's intense focus on immigration enforcement may be counterproductive to President Trump's efforts to consolidate power. The article argues that while policies like the militarization of Washington, D.C. appear authoritarian, their primary application has been for immigration checks, which galvanizes opposition without effectively suppressing broader dissent. This approach is contrasted with more subtle, systemic changes that could erode democratic institutions. The piece posits that Miller's personal obsession with deportations leads to highly visible, cruel policies that generate significant public resistance, potentially hindering the administration's larger political goals.</p>

Experts suggest the demanding curriculum and a cycle of repeated failure are demoralizing for students and straining college resources.

          <h2>Report Explores the Disadvantages and Risks of Reverse Mortgages for Retirees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 13:13:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While reverse mortgages can provide a crucial income stream for retirees by tapping into home equity, they come with significant drawbacks that homeowners should carefully consider. The article highlights high upfront fees, compounding interest that erodes equity over time, and the risk of losing the home if obligations like property taxes and insurance are not met. Furthermore, these loans can substantially reduce the inheritance left to heirs, potentially depleting a family's accumulated wealth. Before pursuing a reverse mortgage, seniors are advised to evaluate their long-term financial stability and explore alternative options like downsizing or traditional home equity loans.</p>

          <p>A new survey reveals a growing trend of U.S. adults ordering from children's menus at restaurants, with 44% citing lower prices and smaller portion sizes as the primary motivations. This shift in consumer behavior comes as diners cut back on eating out amid heightened economic pressures and rising food costs. The trend highlights how inflation is impacting household budgets, compelling adults to seek more affordable options when dining out. For many, the simpler and less expensive kids' meal has become a practical choice for managing both their spending and their caloric intake.</p>

          <p>Country music superstar Morgan Wallen has chosen not to submit his massively successful album, "I’m the Problem," for Grammy Award consideration. The album has dominated the Billboard 200 chart since its release but will not be eligible for any awards at the upcoming ceremony. Wallen, despite his commercial success, has had a contentious history with the music industry and awards bodies following several public controversies. His only previous Grammy nominations were for a collaboration, and this move ensures his solo work remains outside the purview of the Recording Academy for another year.</p>

          <p>Hernandez Govan has been found not guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy in the 2021 ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph in Memphis. Prosecutors had accused Govan of organizing the fatal shooting at a local bakery, but the jury was not convinced by the evidence presented, including testimony from one of the admitted shooters. Govan's defense questioned the police investigation and argued there was no direct evidence linking him to the crime. Young Dolph, whose legal name was Adolph Thornton Jr., was a prominent figure in the Memphis community.</p>

          <p>Comedian Marc Maron has become an outspoken critic of what he calls the "Rogan-sphere," arguing that the rise of "anti-woke" comedy podcasts has degraded the craft and contributed to a rightward political shift. In a series of interviews and in his new special, Maron contends that podcasters who platform extremist figures and rely on punching-down humor are normalizing fascism and replacing thoughtful comedy with hackneyed shock value. He suggests this trend has not only dumbed down public discourse but has also actively facilitated a dangerous political environment by misrepresenting cultural pushback as a free speech crisis.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled approximately $12.3 million in federal funding for sex education programs in California, citing the inclusion of "radical gender ideology" in the state's curriculum. Federal officials claim the materials, which discuss transgender and gender non-conforming identities, are outside the scope of the grant's purpose. California officials have refused to revise the content, arguing it is medically accurate and was previously approved. The move represents another escalation in the ongoing conflict between the state and the federal government over LGBTQ+ issues and local control of education.</p>

          <p>Powerful waves generated by Hurricane Erin are threatening to collapse several beachfront homes in Rodanthe, North Carolina, highlighting the persistent danger of coastal erosion in the Outer Banks. Photographs show houses teetering on support beams as the surf churns beneath them, a recurring issue that has caused at least 11 other homes in the area to fall into the ocean since 2020. While the storm exacerbates the situation, officials note that the dynamic, shifting nature of the barrier islands makes such properties inherently vulnerable, with some areas losing up to 15 feet of beachfront annually.</p>
