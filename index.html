          <p>The latest installment in the Tron franchise, 'Tron: Ares,' maintains the series' tradition of stunning visuals but struggles with a muddled narrative. The film explores sentient computer programs entering the real world, touching on AI's potential without offering deep insights. Despite thrilling crossovers between digital and material realms, the article criticizes the screenplay's "rock-brained" logic and the lead actor's lack of charisma.
