          <p>Donald Trump has filed administrative claims demanding $230 million from the Department of Justice as compensation for federal investigations conducted after his first term. The claims, often a precursor to lawsuits, pertain to the probe into 2016 election interference and the 2022 search of his Mar-a-Lago residence for classified documents. The New York Times noted that any potential settlement could require approval from officials appointed by Trump during his second term, creating a unique political and legal situation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is defending the demolition of parts of the White House East Wing to construct a new, privately funded $250 million ballroom. Dismissing the public outcry as "manufactured outrage," the administration highlighted President Trump's enthusiasm for the construction project. In response to viral photos of the work, the neighboring Treasury Department has reportedly asked its staff to refrain from sharing images, citing potential security risks associated with revealing structural details of the White House complex.</p>

          <p>Following a brazen daytime robbery at the Louvre museum, a French criminologist predicts that authorities will likely apprehend the suspects but may never recover the stolen royal crown jewels. The thieves left behind significant DNA evidence and tools, including a crane lift used to access an upper-floor window, which should aid the investigation. The heist, which has been labeled a national embarrassment, has also exposed significant security vulnerabilities at the world-renowned museum, with reports indicating many rooms lacked camera surveillance.</p>

          <p>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk publicly criticized acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy, questioning his intelligence and suitability for the role after Duffy stated that SpaceX was behind schedule on its lunar lander contract. The conflict arose from NASA's concerns about the timeline for the Artemis III mission, which aims to return humans to the moon, prompting the agency to consider contracts with competitors like Blue Origin. The public spat highlights ongoing tensions and setbacks within the Artemis program, which has already faced significant delays and workforce reductions.</p>

          <p>With personal bankruptcy inquiries on the rise due to economic pressures, this article explains the income qualifications for filing Chapter 7, which can erase many unsecured debts. Eligibility is determined by a "means test" that compares a person's income to their state's median for a similar household size. If an individual's income is above the median, they are not automatically disqualified but must undergo a more detailed calculation of disposable income after expenses, which may still allow them to qualify for Chapter 7 relief.</p>

          <p>Lauren Taylor Wolfe, co-founder of activist investment firm Impactive Capital, stated that the market is currently in an artificial intelligence bubble that is destined to burst. She warned that the trillions of dollars being allocated for AI-related capital expenditures by major tech companies are not yet justified by clear returns on investment. Drawing parallels to the dot-com era, she argued that the math doesn't support current valuations and that many investors chasing the hype are likely to lose money when the correction occurs.

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to review Trump v. Illinois, a case concerning President Trump's authority to deploy federalized National Guard troops to manage protests. The administration argues the president has exclusive, unreviewable power to federalize the Guard to execute federal laws, a position that lower courts have rejected. The case's outcome could have profound implications for the balance of power, potentially granting the president unchecked authority to use military force against U.S. citizens on domestic soil for a wide range of situations.</p>
