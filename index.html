        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Campaigning has officially commenced for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, viewed as a prelude to the upcoming House of Councillors race. All eyes are on whether Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party can maintain its seats, given his sluggish popularity and Cabinet approval ratings sometimes dipping below 30 percent. No party currently holds a majority in the 127-member assembly, making this election crucial for the balance of power in the region. The outcome of this election could significantly impact Ishiba's political standing and the LDP's future prospects. </p>

          <p>A Marine Corps battalion of 700 Marines based at Twentynine Palms has completed training and could be deployed to Los Angeles by Friday to assist with protests. They will join approximately 2,100 California National Guard soldiers already protecting federal buildings and personnel during the ICE protests that began on June 6. The National Guard troops can accompany ICE on missions but do not participate in law enforcement, while the Marines will temporarily detain individuals until civilian law enforcement arrives. Governor Newsom and local officials strongly oppose the federalization of the National Guard and the deployment of Marines to L.A. County, calling it a brazen abuse of power.</p>

          <p>A "Trojan horse" therapy, belantamab mafodotin, will be available on the NHS in England, marking a world-first treatment for the blood cancer myeloma. This therapy delivers toxic drugs directly inside cancer cells, halting the disease for nearly three times longer than current treatments while reducing side effects. Paul Silvester, one of the first patients to receive the treatment, reported that it has been "life-changing," allowing him to plan history-themed adventures. Clinical trials have demonstrated that this therapy can halt myeloma for three years, compared to 13 months with existing therapies.</p>

          <p>The WNBA has experienced a significant decrease in TV ratings while Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark is sidelined with a quadriceps injury sustained last month. Clark has missed five consecutive games, impacting not only the Fever's performance but also the league's viewership.

Despite this overall decline, the Fever's recent game against the Chicago Sky drew 1.92 million viewers on CBS, marking the third-highest viewership for a game on the network. </p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has dismissed the expert committee advising the CDC on vaccine recommendations and is replacing members with individuals holding skeptical views on vaccines. This move is seen as undermining the scientific consensus on vaccination, with concerns that it will erode trust in immunization. New appointees include figures who have spoken against COVID vaccines, claimed vaccine injuries, and falsely linked COVID shots to deaths. Experts warn that this could lead to altered vaccine guidelines and reduced access to essential immunizations. </p>

          <p>Democrats are expressing outrage after California Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed and handcuffed at Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's press conference in Los Angeles. Padilla, who interrupted the conference to ask questions about immigration policies, was taken to the ground by law enforcement officers. Noem claimed that law enforcement reacted because Padilla approached her without identifying himself, while Padilla stated he was there peacefully to seek information. Democratic colleagues have criticized the incident as an assault on democracy and an abuse of power, while Republicans have admonished Padilla's behavior as inappropriate.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's decision to deploy military forces to Los Angeles to quell protests against federal immigration sweeps is drawing criticism for overriding local control. Despite Governor Gavin Newsom's opposition, Trump activated the state's National Guard, a move seen as an escalation of using troops to suppress protests. Trump claims the intervention was necessary to protect ICE officers, while Newsom denounces it as a brazen abuse of power that inflames the situation. The deployment has raised concerns about the politicization of the military and the erosion of local authority.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicates that President Donald Trump's proposed megabill would disproportionately benefit wealthy households while reducing resources for the poorest Americans. The analysis reveals that the lowest-earning 10% of U.S. households would experience an income cut of approximately $1,600 per year. In contrast, households in the top 10% would see annual gains of around $12,000. Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is defending the deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles amid objections from Democrats. </p>

          <p>Boeing's reputation is under renewed scrutiny following the Air India crash, which killed 242 people, raising questions about the plane maker's safety practices. Although the cause of the crash is yet to be determined, the incident has prompted concerns given Boeing's recent history of safety crises and quality control issues. The company is already grappling with financial losses and legal battles related to previous crashes, and this latest tragedy adds to the challenges facing Boeing's leadership. Boeing shares were down nearly 5% when stock markets closed in New York on Thursday.</p>

The federal government argues that the president complied with the Title 10 statute, while California contends that the deployment is an expansive and dangerous conception of federal executive power.
