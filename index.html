          <p>Donald Trump has stated he will not support a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the team reverts to its former "Redskins" name. In a social media post, Trump called the current "Commanders" moniker ridiculous and claimed his stance has been met with positive feedback. The statement has drawn criticism from Native American advocacy groups, who called it a distraction and reaffirmed that such mascots are dehumanizing. The team's managing partner has previously stated there are no plans to change the name again.</p>

De Gelder also recommends maintaining eye contact with the shark, as they prefer to attack unseen targets from behind. As a final measure, he suggests pushing the shark firmly on the nose rather than punching it. His advice comes amid recent shark sightings along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <h2>NHS England and Doctors' Union Clash Over Patient Safety During Planned Strike</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A dispute has erupted between NHS England and the British Medical Association (BMA) regarding the level of care to be provided during an upcoming five-day doctors' strike. NHS England has instructed hospitals to avoid canceling non-urgent care except in exceptional circumstances. However, the BMA warns this directive will put patients at risk by spreading non-striking senior doctors too thinly to safely staff emergency services. This new, more rigid approach from NHS leadership marks a departure from previous strikes, where non-urgent work was widely rescheduled to ensure emergency cover.</p>

          <p>Domino's Pizza CEO Russell Weiner stated that current economic headwinds in the restaurant industry are creating an opportunity for the company to gain market share. The chain reported a 3.4% increase in U.S. same-store sales, crediting its success to value-focused promotions that are attracting customers across all income levels, including frugal diners. Weiner contrasted Domino's strategy of offering deals on popular items with competitors who he claims discount less desirable products. The approach appears to be resonating as consumers increasingly prioritize value and choose to eat at home more often.</p>

          <p>State Senator Omar Fateh, a democratic socialist, has won the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party's endorsement in the Minneapolis mayoral race, defeating incumbent Mayor Jacob Frey. Fateh, the first Somali American and Muslim in the Minnesota state senate, ran on a platform focused on affordability and public services. The endorsement process was contentious, with Frey's campaign alleging voting irregularities and planning an appeal. Fateh's win gives momentum to the progressive left, following a similar victory by Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral primary. The general election will be held in November.</p>

          <p>A county coroner has officially ruled the death of Phillip Reeder, a 52-year-old white man from Irondale, Alabama, as a homicide. The autopsy report concluded Reeder died of heart failure associated with cocaine use and restraint during an altercation with police last August. Attorneys for Reeder's family, who have viewed unreleased body camera footage, state that an officer kneeled on his neck for over three minutes as he said "I can't breathe." They are drawing direct comparisons to the death of George Floyd, arguing the case demonstrates a continued crisis in police tactics.</p>

          <p>Marcus Rashford's loan move to Barcelona marks a sad end to his long career at Manchester United, the club he joined as a boy. This article analyzes the complex factors leading to his exit, noting that a fresh start was needed after a significant decline in form and a breakdown in his relationship with the club. While the deal is financially sensible for a cash-strapped Barcelona, it leaves many questions about why the relationship between United and its homegrown star soured so badly. The departure is seen as a result of both on-field struggles and off-field issues, including a perceived lack of commitment from the player.</p>

          <p>Following State Farm's announcement of a 27.2% increase in homeowners insurance rates, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and other officials are calling for legislative action. Lawmakers are now considering a bill that would grant the state's Department of Insurance the authority to review and reject excessive rate hikes for home and auto insurance. Currently, Illinois is one of the few states without such a regulatory mechanism. While consumer advocates support the move for transparency and protection, the insurance industry argues that more regulation could stifle competition and lead to fewer choices for consumers.

The author contends this clarity is long overdue, as it distinguishes legitimate criticism of Israeli policy from anti-Zionism, which singles out the Jewish state for elimination.
