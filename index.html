          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake occurred in northern New Jersey, causing minor shaking across parts of the New York City metropolitan area. The U.S. Geological Survey located the epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights. While no damage was reported, the event prompted many residents to report the tremors. This follows a larger, more significant 4.8 magnitude earthquake that shook the region in April 2024, reminding residents that seismic activity, though rare, does occur on the East Coast.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has confirmed it is investigating former special counsel Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act, which prohibits government employees from engaging in political activities. The probe was initiated following a request from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's investigations into Donald Trump were politically motivated to influence the 2024 election. The OSC is an independent agency separate from the special counsel role Smith held, and this investigation is not a criminal one.</p>

          <p>Over 30 years after the brutal murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, the case remains unsolved, continuing to torment the victims' families and investigators. The article recounts the 1991 crime, the initial investigation, and the complex legal history involving four men who were arrested and later released after their convictions were overturned. Advances in DNA technology found a male DNA profile that did not match the suspects, leaving the case at a standstill and renewing focus on two unidentified men seen at the shop that night.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a sophisticated electronic warfare technique using drone swarms to create an "electromagnetic storm eye." This system can simultaneously jam enemy communications while creating a protective bubble around friendly forces where signals remain clear. By precisely manipulating signal properties, the drones can generate a null zone, effectively neutralizing interference for allied units. This represents a significant advancement over traditional jamming methods that indiscriminately disrupt all communications within range.</p>

He shared the news on Instagram, stating he considered ending his recent tour but decided to continue, finding that the joy of performing outweighed the physical stress. Lyme disease can cause flu-like symptoms, joint pain, and neurological issues but is typically treatable with antibiotics.

          <p>Shayna Glassman, whose father was a neighbor and target of David Berkowitz, has formed a relationship with the "Son of Sam" killer, visiting and corresponding with him in prison. Her father, Craig Glassman, was harassed by Berkowitz and helped police identify him in 1977. Shayna, who was only four when her father died, sees the connection as a way to understand her father's story. She describes their relationship as non-romantic but deeply psychological, finding Berkowitz to be a changed man with a sense of humor.</p>

The author reflects on the collective trauma associated with the event, noting how recent films have introduced this history to younger generations. The massacre is described not just as a historical tragedy but as a moral wound, one that many Chinese feel has never been properly acknowledged by the Japanese government.

          <p>The long-standing mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill died during its voyage from Australia in 1943 has finally been solved. The animal, named Winston, was a secret diplomatic gift during World War II, but perished days before reaching the UK. While wartime rumors blamed shock from a Nazi U-boat encounter, newly analyzed archival records, including the ship's logbook, suggest a different cause. Researchers now believe the platypus died from heatstroke, as water and air temperatures recorded during the journey across the equator far exceeded safe levels for the species.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly relying on major theme parks to stimulate its economy and drive consumer spending, as evidenced by the recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort. The country already has over 4,400 amusement facilities, with the industry projected to grow significantly in the coming years. According to the global theme park association IAAPA, these attractions have a substantial multiplier effect on local economies. The parks serve as key drivers for tourism, hospitality, and retail sectors as the government seeks new avenues for economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lebanon is mourning the death of Ziad Rahbani, a celebrated musician, composer, and playwright, who passed away at age 69. Born to famous musical parents, Rahbani carved his own path with art that was deeply political, satirical, and critical of the sectarianism that fueled Lebanon's civil war. He blended jazz and other world music styles with traditional Arabic forms, creating a unique sound. Rahbani was also a key collaborator with his mother, the iconic singer Fairuz, helping to shape a more personal and human phase of her legendary career.</p>

          <p>Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute argues that President Trump's foreign policy, which views allies as a burden, is dangerously isolating the United States. In an interview, she contends that this approach reduces American power by discouraging cooperation from other nations, who are beginning to hedge against U.S. unpredictability. Schake emphasizes that it is crucial for principled conservatives to challenge this "post-American" worldview. She warns that allowing the current international order to collapse would make the world less safe and prosperous for America.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "From The Clinics To The Capitol," Professor Carol Mason argues that the anti-abortion movement has become increasingly intertwined with white nationalist and insurrectionary politics. Mason traces the evolution of rhetoric from "overturn Roe" to "ignore Roe," suggesting a growing disregard for the rule of law. She connects the tactics and ideologies of anti-abortion groups to the January 6 Capitol riot, pointing to shared conspiracy theories and a belief in obeying "God's law over man's law." The book posits that the movement has facilitated intersections among various far-right factions.</p>
