          <p>A bipartisan delegation of senior U.S. senators from the armed services committee has arrived in Taiwan to reinforce the security partnership between Washington and Taipei. The visit, led by Republican Senator Roger Wicker, comes at a sensitive time as both Taiwan and China are navigating trade relations with the U.S. under the Trump administration. The senators are scheduled to meet with President Lai Ching-te to discuss regional security and cooperation. This trip underscores the ongoing U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense, despite not officially recognizing it as a sovereign nation, which continues to be a point of contention with Beijing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights has determined that Denver Public Schools violated Title IX by converting a girls' restroom into an all-gender facility at East High School. The investigation, initiated after Donald Trump returned to the White House, concluded that this action and the policy of allowing students to use facilities based on gender identity created a hostile environment. The federal government has proposed a resolution requiring the district to revert the bathrooms to sex-specific designations and adopt biology-based definitions for male and female. This finding aligns with the Trump administration's broader efforts to enforce sex-based distinctions in schools.</p>

          <p>South Korean prosecutors have indicted former first lady Kim Keon Hee on multiple charges, including bribery, stock manipulation, and violating political funding laws. She is accused of illegally amassing over $720,000 through a stock scheme and accepting bribes, marking the first time a South Korean first lady has been indicted. The charges are connected to a wider investigation into her husband, former President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached and arrested over a controversial martial law declaration. This development adds another layer to the political turmoil that has recently engulfed the nation's former ruling family.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially ended the "de minimis" exemption, which previously allowed parcels valued at $800 or less to enter the United States without tariffs. The White House stated the change closes a "catastrophic loophole" used to evade duties and import illicit goods like synthetic opioids. This policy shift now applies globally, extending a similar suspension that was earlier placed on imports from China and Hong Kong, affecting e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu. A six-month transition period will allow postal shippers to pay a flat duty fee, but the move is expected to generate significant new tariff revenue.</p>

          <p>Australian reality TV star Matt Wright, known for the show "Outback Wrangler," has been found guilty on two counts of perverting the course of justice. The charges relate to his actions following a 2022 fatal helicopter crash that killed his co-star, Chris Wilson. Prosecutors argued Wright lied to investigators and pressured the injured pilot to falsify records to conceal that the helicopter had run out of fuel, potentially due to his practice of disconnecting flight-hour meters. Wright, who pleaded not guilty and plans to appeal, was released on bail after the verdict was delivered on his 46th birthday.</p>

          <p>British small businesses are expressing significant concern over the United States' decision to eliminate its "de minimis" tax exemption for parcels valued under $800. The rule change, effective Friday, introduces new tariffs and creates logistical uncertainty, prompting some UK firms to halt shipments to the U.S. entirely. Companies that previously relied on American customers, such as a hand-dyed wool business in Wales and a London-based gift shop, report that the inability to provide customers with upfront costs makes trading unfeasible. The Federation of Small Businesses has warned that this move will push up costs and create new barriers for UK exporters.</p>

Previously, parents had to pay up to £200 for the vaccine privately.

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed on Friday, diverging from Wall Street's performance as investors processed a variety of local economic data. In Japan, Tokyo's core consumer prices rose 2.5% in August, a slower pace than the previous month but still above the central bank's target, causing the Nikkei 225 to slide. South Korea's Kospi also declined following news of the indictment of the former first lady on corruption charges. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained ahead of a high-profile meeting between the leaders of India and China over the weekend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, has filed a second criminal referral with the Department of Justice against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. This new referral alleges misrepresentations on government ethics forms concerning a condominium in Massachusetts, adding to a previous referral about mortgages on other properties. The move comes as President Donald Trump seeks to remove Cook from the Fed's board, an effort she is challenging in court. Pulte's actions are seen as part of the administration's broader pressure campaign against the Federal Reserve and its leadership over monetary policy.</p>

          <p>Authorities have revealed that the individual who attacked a Minneapolis church school, killing two children and injuring 18 others, was "obsessed with the idea of killing children." Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara stated that the attacker, Robin Westman, appeared to hate everyone and lacked a specific motive beyond the desire to kill children. The 23-year-old suspect, a former student at the school, used three firearms to shoot through the church windows before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Investigators found a note but believe a definitive motive may never be fully understood, describing the attack as an act of hate-filled domestic terrorism.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador and now facing charges in the U.S., have asked a federal judge to prohibit top Trump administration officials from making "baseless public attacks" against him. The motion claims that officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Attorney General Pam Bondi, have made false and inflammatory statements calling Garcia a gang member and predator, thereby violating his right to a fair trial. Garcia was released from pre-trial custody only to be detained again by ICE for potential removal, a move his lawyers are also fighting in a separate case.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court is set to rule on the fate of suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, threatening to plunge the country into political paralysis. The case stems from a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader, Hun Sen, in which she allegedly undermined the Thai military, leading to accusations of ethical violations. If the court removes her from office, it would be the fifth time in 17 years a Thai prime minister has been ousted by a court ruling. The decision comes just weeks after a ceasefire ended deadly border clashes between the two nations, and her removal could trigger significant political turmoil.</p>

The appointment comes amid significant turmoil at the agency, following the firing of Senate-confirmed director Susan Monarez and the resignation of four other senior leaders. Monarez's lawyers are contesting her removal, arguing that only the president can legally fire her and that she was targeted for resisting unscientific directives.

The roles, which included teaching skills like cake decorating and ballooncraft to detainees, drew sharp criticism from the opposition Labour Party, who called the spending indefensible. Home Office Minister Seema Malhotra stated that the government did not believe all the roles were necessary. Mitie defended the services, noting a recent inspection report found that such provisions helped individuals manage the stresses of detention.</p>
