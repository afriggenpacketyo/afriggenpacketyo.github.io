          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reports that recent immigration raids have instilled deep fear throughout the city, which has a large Latino and immigrant population. She described how neighborhoods feel like ghost towns and criticized the tactics of federal agents, who she said operate in unmarked cars without clear identification, causing confusion and panic. While the Trump administration's deportation efforts officially target those with criminal records, data shows an increasing number of non-criminals are being arrested. Bass contrasted the disruptive federal presence with the community-based approach of the local police department.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged to continue in his role despite projections showing his ruling coalition has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament. The defeat for the Liberal Democratic Party and its partner Komeito reflects public frustration over rising prices and potential U.S. tariffs. Analysts note the loss undermines Ishiba's authority and could lead to a leadership challenge from within his party, potentially destabilizing the government during critical trade negotiations. The election also saw a decline in support from conservatives who view Ishiba as not nationalistic enough.</p>

          <p>Representative Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, reiterated his call for the Department of Justice to release evidence related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. He emphasized the need for transparency while cautioning that the identities of victims and innocent individuals should be protected. Burchett pushed back against President Trump's recent criticism of Republicans seeking the files' release, stating he was "ticked off" but undeterred. He characterized the Attorney General's subsequent move to unseal some evidence as "a start" but expressed skepticism that the full truth would ever be revealed.</p>

          <p>The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the AFC/M23 rebel group have signed a declaration in Doha, committing to a permanent ceasefire and negotiations for a comprehensive peace agreement. The deal, mediated by Qatar, calls for the restoration of state authority in rebel-held areas and sets a timeline for talks to begin in August. However, experts and the rebels themselves have cast doubt on its implementation, with a rebel leader stating they will not withdraw from their current positions. This disagreement highlights the significant challenges ahead, as past agreements have failed due to a lack of political will.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has committed to a new target of halving the number of sewage discharges from water companies by 2030. This pledge follows a 60% rise in serious pollution incidents in 2024 and widespread public outrage over the state of the nation's waterways. The minister acknowledged that the water sector is "broken" and stated that the industry's regulator, Ofwat, is "clearly failing." The announcement comes ahead of a landmark review that may recommend overhauling the regulatory system, as water companies face scrutiny for paying large executive bonuses while environmental performance declines.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance, known for his memoir about the Appalachian "hillbillies," is reportedly planning a family vacation in the Cotswolds, a picturesque and affluent region of England. The choice of destination is notable given Vance's previous criticisms of European governments and his remark that London was "not English any more." During his trip, which is also expected to include a visit to Scotland, he may face a mixed reception due to his past comments about the UK and Scottish policies. The visit comes as tourism from the UK to the US has reportedly declined under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>While few companies explicitly cite artificial intelligence as the reason for layoffs, employment experts suspect AI is a larger factor than publicly acknowledged. Firms often use vague terms like "restructuring" or "optimization" to describe job cuts that coincide with the adoption of new AI technologies. This messaging strategy helps companies avoid public and employee backlash while still pursuing automation-driven efficiencies in roles like customer service, HR, and content creation. Experts note that while AI can automate many tasks, companies sometimes overestimate its capabilities, leading them to quietly outsource the work that still requires a human touch.</p>

They eventually learned he was alive but hospitalized in Guatemala, a country with which he has no connection, after being held in a Minnesota detention center.

The piece suggests that a more accurate picture of economic health would come from tracking income from all sources, using real-time data from tax returns and private companies.

          <p>Fauja Singh, a centenarian marathon runner who gained international fame for completing nine full marathons after the age of 89, was killed at 114 in a hit-and-run incident in his native Punjab, India. Singh, who began running to cope with grief, became an inspiration and was featured in an Adidas campaign. His death has highlighted the severe problem of India's dangerous roads, where over 150,000 people are killed annually. While a suspect has been arrested, experts point to systemic failures in road engineering and a lack of pedestrian safety as root causes of the country's high traffic fatality rate.</p>

          <p>The families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza are voicing increasing frustration and a deep sense of mistrust toward Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government. Campaigners and relatives feel the government is not prioritizing the lives of the hostages, pointing to failed opportunities for their release and the influence of far-right coalition members who they say value land over human life. Many now place more hope in U.S. intervention to secure a deal with Hamas. The sentiment reflects a painful belief that the Israeli ethos of "leaving no one behind" is being abandoned by its current leadership.</p>

          <p>England soccer player Jess Carter has revealed she has been subjected to extensive racial abuse on social media throughout the Euro 2025 tournament. In response, the 27-year-old defender announced she would be taking a step back from social media. The Football Association condemned the "hate crime" and confirmed it is working with police to bring the perpetrators to justice. The incident prompted the Lionesses to announce they would stop taking a knee before matches, stating a new approach is needed to combat racism, and has drawn support from teammates and the UK Prime Minister.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Me, But Better," documents author Olga Khazan's journey to redesign her personality, moving from being highly neurotic and introverted to more calm and extroverted. The article explores the science behind personality change, citing experts who argue that core traits are not fixed and can be altered through conscious, sustained effort. The process involves identifying desired traits and then consistently acting in ways that align with them, such as a shy person forcing themselves into social situations. This "fake it 'til you make it" approach, while difficult, can lead to lasting changes in how a person thinks, feels, and behaves.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan criticism for reinstating the Confederate-era names of several U.S. Army bases, an action that appears to circumvent a 2021 federal law. The Pentagon claims it is complying with the law by renaming the bases after different historical soldiers who coincidentally share the same last names as the original Confederate namesakes. This move has been labeled an "insult" by some in Congress, who passed a measure to block the renaming. The article highlights the problematic legacies of figures like Braxton Bragg, for whom Fort Bragg was named, who was widely considered an incompetent and hated commander.</p>

          <p>A personal essay argues that to understand America, one must understand Oklahoma, a state whose history is a foundational story of ambition, violence, and reinvention. The author recounts learning a sanitized version of the state's history, which celebrates "Sooners" who claimed land seized from Indigenous nations. The piece explores the forgotten dream of creating an all-Black state in the territory and how Oklahoma's legacy of pitting marginalized groups against each other continues to reflect broader national conflicts. The state is presented not as a "flyover," but as a crucial testing ground for America's deepest political and cultural battles.</p>

          <p>In a new memoir and interview, Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate, recounts her groundbreaking career and the challenges she faced. She recalls incidents of racism, such as Senator Jesse Helms singing "Dixie" to her, and argues that sexism remains a more difficult barrier to overcome than racism in American politics. Moseley Braun, who served from 1993 to 1999, also reflects on her presidential run and expresses concern that the Democratic party is "walking around in a daze" in its efforts to counter Donald Trump. Despite recent political backsliding, she remains optimistic about the resilience of American democracy.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's deportation program has fallen, with a majority now believing it targets more than just dangerous criminals. This declining approval, especially among Hispanic Americans, has contributed to a slide in the president's overall job rating. The poll also shows that most Americans, feeling the pressure of inflation, want the administration to focus more on lowering prices rather than on tariffs or spending cuts. Despite this, Trump's base remains strongly supportive, particularly of his immigration policies, and largely dismisses the Epstein case as unimportant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An essay by a naturalized U.S. citizen expresses growing fear and uncertainty amid the Trump administration's pledge to "maximally pursue" denaturalization cases. The author reflects on how the distinction between natural-born and naturalized citizens is being exploited, creating a climate where fundamental rights feel precarious. The piece questions whether the principles of American democracy, such as the rule of law and freedom of speech, still hold true when the government can threaten to revoke citizenship. The author warns that even if few are denaturalized, the policy is enough to chill the speech and political participation of millions of Americans.</p>

The individual, who works for the U.S. Commerce Department's Patent and Trademark Office, was reportedly detained in Chengdu in April while on a personal trip to visit relatives. While the exact reason for the exit ban is unconfirmed, sources suggest it may be related to national security concerns or an alleged failure to disclose his government employment on his visa application.

          <p>Japan's ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, suffered a significant defeat in the upper house parliamentary election, losing its majority. The loss is attributed to public discontent with inflation and political scandals, but also to the notable rise of the right-wing populist Sanseito party. This "Japanese First" party, which gained traction spreading conspiracy theories online, appealed to voters with its anti-immigration and anti-globalist rhetoric, securing at least seven seats. Despite the defeat, Prime Minister Ishiba has vowed to remain in office to handle critical trade negotiations with the United States.</p>
