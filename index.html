          <h2>Stock Market Declines Amid Trump's Criticism of Fed Chair and Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-21 20:42:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The stock market experienced a significant downturn on Monday, influenced by President Trump's renewed criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and ongoing uncertainty regarding tariffs. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq Composite all fell sharply, reflecting investor anxiety over potential economic impacts from trade policies and monetary policy conflicts. Trump's pressure on Powell to lower interest rates, coupled with tariff-related trade standstills, has fueled concerns about weakening investor confidence and potential disruptions to the existing world order. Investors are also closely monitoring upcoming earnings reports from major technology companies amidst this volatile economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pope Francis' last will and testament, dated June 29, 2022, was released following his death, outlining his preferences for his burial. He requested to be interred in the Papal Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary where he often prayed after his international trips. Francis specified a simple tomb in the side nave, marked only with his name, foregoing any mention of his papacy. He also expressed his hope that those who loved him would continue to pray for him, offering his suffering for world peace and brotherhood.</p>

          <p>Pope Francis passed away at the age of 88 due to a cerebral stroke, which led to a coma and subsequent irreversible heart failure, according to the Vatican. The pontiff had a history of health issues, including the removal of part of one lung as a young man and several hospitalizations in recent years for respiratory illnesses. Recent health challenges included a bout of bilateral pneumonia which led to kidney failure and a bronchospasm, which caused him to inhale vomit, before ultimately succumbing to the stroke and heart failure.</p>

          <p>A minke whale died from domoic acid poisoning linked to a toxic algal bloom off Southern California, adding to the toll on marine life, including sea lions and dolphins. Test results confirmed high levels of domoic acid in the whale's urine, consistent with other affected marine mammals. The algal bloom, attributed to an ocean upswell and potentially exacerbated by climate change and runoff from recent fires, has caused seizures and other neurological symptoms in hundreds of animals, marking the fourth consecutive year of such events, with this year's bloom starting unusually early.</p>

          <p>A federal court in Denver is hearing a case challenging the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants. Immigrants' rights groups argue that the administration is providing insufficient notice for individuals to fight their deportation orders, violating due process rights. The ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network are challenging the deportations, arguing that 24 hours' notice is not "reasonable," as ordered by the U.S. Supreme Court. The case highlights the legal rights of migrants to challenge the government's allegations before being removed from the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Department of Education announced that approximately 5 million Americans with defaulted student loan payments will have their loans sent for collections starting May 5. This marks the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic that the department will collect debts from borrowers who defaulted before the pandemic. The announcement coincides with the termination of numerous Federal Student Aid (FSA) employees, raising concerns about the department's capacity to assist borrowers during this transition. Officials emphasize that the effort will protect taxpayers from shouldering the cost of federal student loans that borrowers "willingly" undertook.</p>

          <p>The Trump Administration will resume collections on defaulted student loans on May 5 after a five-year hiatus. The U.S. Department of Education says it will begin notifying borrowers who are in default via email over the next two weeks, urging them to make a payment or to enroll in a repayment plan, and referring them to a government website providing information on how to do so. The department will begin referring borrowers who remain in default to a collections program run by the Treasury Department, and will begin the process of garnishing wages later this summer.</p>

He argued that the government is biased against Apple and Nvidia, with the White House caring more about cutting off China than advancing U.S. interests. Cramer noted that Apple is caught in the crosshairs of the trade war, while Nvidia is perceived as not doing enough to prevent China from accessing its products. Cramer said investors don't want to bet on Nvidia and Apple because they're companies "where the government's mandating weaker numbers."(not investment advice)</p>
