          <p>A draft of an upcoming "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) report does not recommend severe restrictions on pesticides or ultra-processed foods, a departure from the strong rhetoric of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This potential shift is seen as a victory for the agriculture industry, which lobbied against such recommendations, and a setback for health advocates concerned about chemical additives in the food supply. The document, obtained by ABC News, suggests more targeted pesticide applications and further research rather than outright bans, though White House officials have cautioned that the language is not final and could change before its official release.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed lowering the minimum required sugar content in pasteurized orange juice for the first time since 1963. This change aims to support American citrus growers, whose oranges now have naturally lower sugar levels due to severe weather and citrus greening disease. The proposal would reduce dependency on sweeter imported juice used for blending, potentially saving producers over $50 million annually with minimal impact on taste for consumers. The move is part of a broader FDA review of food standards to align them with current agricultural realities and scientific understanding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an interview on "Face the Nation," Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan framed the U.S.-Russia summit in his home state as a demonstration of American strength, intended to pressure Vladimir Putin into negotiating a ceasefire in Ukraine. He argued that Putin is at the negotiating table due to the threat of severe sanctions and that Alaska's military presence and energy resources project the power Putin understands. Sullivan emphasized that a successful outcome would be securing a ceasefire, which would then pave the way for more complex negotiations involving Ukraine and European allies, and he highlighted the strategic importance of developing Alaska's natural resources for national security.</p>

          <p>Following a high-stakes summit with Vladimir Putin, Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that ending the war in Ukraine will require concessions from both sides, as a deal where one side gets everything it wants is "called surrender." He indicated that progress was made during the talks, justifying a follow-up meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders to discuss potential breakthroughs. While details remain scant, Rubio outlined that key areas for agreement include security guarantees for Ukraine, territorial boundaries, and reconstruction, emphasizing the administration's goal is to narrow the gap between the two warring nations.</p>

          <p>Special Envoy Steve Witkoff has claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and European nations to provide Ukraine with "Article 5-like" security guarantees as part of a potential peace deal. This development, described as a significant concession, would address a key Ukrainian demand for protection against future aggression, which was a primary reason for its NATO aspirations. The statement comes after President Trump's meeting with Putin, which did not yield an immediate ceasefire but reportedly covered most other issues necessary for a comprehensive peace agreement, signaling a potential shift in Russia's long-held stance on Ukraine's security alignment.</p>

          <p>The article highlights the monumental work of Dr. Alieu Kamara, the sole neurosurgeon for Sierra Leone's eight million people, as he performs the country's first-ever spine surgery. It details the immense challenges, including frequent power outages and improvised equipment, faced during the operation on a man paralyzed and slowly suffocating from a tumor. This groundbreaking procedure was made possible by a global grassroots network of medical professionals and non-profits like Mission Brain, which facilitated Dr. Kamara's training and supplied crucial equipment.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly reaching Category 5 intensity. Despite the drop in wind speed, the storm has grown in size, leading to a tropical storm warning for the Turks and Caicos Islands and bringing heavy rain and strong winds to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The National Hurricane Center notes the storm is undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," which can cause temporary weakening before potential re-intensification. While not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast, its large size could generate dangerous rip currents and coastal flooding.</p>

According to Law 13 of the game, introduced in the 2019-20 season, when a defensive wall consists of three or more players, all attacking players must maintain a minimum distance of one meter. This rule was implemented to prevent management problems and time-wasting, as attackers in the wall were deemed to serve no legitimate tactical purpose.</p>

Previously, senior posts in autonomous regions, such as regional chairman, were often reserved for non-Han cadres as a measure of ethnic inclusion, and these officials were rarely targeted in anti-graft campaigns. However, the downfall of figures like Qizhala from Tibet and Liu Hui from Ningxia suggests that this ethnicity-based leniency is ending.

Investigators then conducted surveillance and a sting operation at a Chili's restaurant to obtain Miller's DNA, which matched evidence from both crime scenes.

          <p>Recent economic data revealing a surge in both wholesale and consumer prices for July has some economists concerned, even as markets remain hopeful for an interest rate cut. The Producer Price Index (PPI) hit a three-year high, driven largely by services inflation, a trend also seen in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This places the Federal Reserve in a difficult position, as the hotter inflation data argues for monetary restraint, while a separate, downwardly revised jobs report suggests a softening labor market that could warrant a rate cut. The conflicting signals create uncertainty ahead of the Fed's next policy decision. (not investment advice)</p>

The author contends that Trump returned empty-handed, failing to secure his primary goal of a ceasefire and instead accepting Putin's framing that a comprehensive peace deal must come first. By appearing at the summit, Putin broke his international isolation and may have ensured that further U.S. sanctions remain unenforced. The outcome has sown greater mistrust between the U.S. and its European allies, leaving Ukraine and Europe in a more vulnerable and perilous position.</p>

          <p>Mayors of major Democratic-run cities are preparing for potential confrontations with the Trump administration following the president's recent deployment of the military in Washington D.C. and his rhetoric targeting cities he deems "liberal hellholes." City leaders are coordinating with police chiefs and governors and preparing legal challenges, arguing that Trump is using crime as a pretext to unlawfully usurp local authority and create chaos. While acknowledging the need to address crime, mayors from Seattle to Minneapolis assert that federal partnerships should be collaborative, not hostile takeovers, and that Trump's actions are a distraction from his own administration's failures.</p>

          <p>Evie Parts, a transgender long-distance runner, has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA, Swarthmore College, and several athletics officials, alleging she was illegally removed from the women's track team. The lawsuit claims the NCAA's policy banning transgender athletes from women's sports is "bigoted" and lacks legal authority over federal and state anti-discrimination laws. Parts was removed from the team on the same day the NCAA issued its new policy, and her complaint alleges the action caused her severe emotional distress, leading to self-harm. She was later reinstated and competed until her graduation, but the lawsuit seeks damages for the ordeal.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece calls for Chinese authorities to strictly adhere to legal procedures when investigating business figures, following a concerning string of suicides among prominent private entrepreneurs. The article highlights the case of Wang Yan, chairman of home-furnishing giant Easyhome, who took his own life just days after being released from detention by anti-corruption investigators. The author argues that while fighting corruption is necessary, the current methods can create immense pressure and uncertainty, harming the already beleaguered private sector. Protecting the legal rights and personal safety of entrepreneurs during investigations is crucial for restoring confidence in China's business environment.</p>

          <p>A new poll indicates that a significant portion of the German population anticipates the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party into executive power. The survey found that 68% of Germans expect the AfD to lead a state government within the next few months, with 43% believing it will happen in at least one state. This sentiment comes as the AfD consistently polls strongly at the national level, challenging the mainstream parties that have so far maintained a "firewall" by refusing to form coalitions with the far-right party. The poll also showed a divided opinion on this firewall, with 47% supporting it and 40% opposing it.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Community violence prevention leaders are criticizing President Trump's focus on militarized law enforcement as the solution to crime in major cities, arguing it ignores proven, community-based strategies. Advocates state that true safety is built through investment in local infrastructure and programs that address the root causes of violence, not just through police response. They point to the success of violence intervention models in cities like Baltimore and Oakland, which have seen homicides decrease. The criticism is sharpened by the Trump administration's recent decision to cut nearly $170 million in federal grants to these very gun violence prevention organizations, undermining their work.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has asserted that the grand jury transcripts from the Ghislaine Maxwell case are not an "untapped mine lode" of new information, dashing hopes that their release would reveal bombshells about Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking network. With the judge stating "there is no 'there' there," attention is shifting to the vast trove of other investigative files held by the Department of Justice. Critics and victims' advocates are increasing pressure on the Trump administration to release these documents, arguing that the Attorney General and FBI Director have the power to do so and that continued secrecy fuels public conviction of a cover-up involving powerful figures.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flights after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by more than 10,000 of its flight attendants, which had caused approximately 700 flight cancellations. The Canadian Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) ordered the cabin crew back to work and the Jobs Minister invoked federal labor laws to force binding arbitration to resolve the dispute. The union, which is seeking higher salaries and pay for ground time, accused the government of "caving to corporate pressure." The airline has cautioned that while flights will begin resuming, it will take several days to fully stabilize its schedule.</p>

          <p>China has lodged a formal complaint with Japan after several cabinet members visited the controversial Yasukuni Shrine and the Prime Minister sent a ritual offering on the 80th anniversary of Japan's World War II surrender. The shrine honors convicted war criminals among Japan's war dead, and visits by officials are seen by China and other neighboring countries as a sign of militaristic revisionism. China's foreign ministry called the act a "blatant provocation against historical justice," urging Japan to reflect on its history of aggression and "completely sever ties with militarism" to maintain stable regional relations.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been meticulously renovated into a unique, off-grid luxury property and is now on the market for £3 million. The new owner, Mike Conner, purchased the historic, 100-man fort in 2017 for £555,000 and spent five years overcoming significant logistical challenges to make it habitable, including installing running water and electricity. The transformed island now features 40 beds and its own nightclub, reviving its past reputation as a party destination while preserving the magnificent Victorian construction. The project has been a labor of love for Conner.</p>
