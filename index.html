          <p>An angel investor recounted his 2022 decision to back AI voice startup ElevenLabs after just one 30-minute meeting with a co-founder, well before the generative AI boom. He was convinced by the founder's technical expertise and unique vision in a market that other venture capitalists were largely ignoring at the time. The company, which specializes in advanced text-to-speech and voice cloning technology, has since grown to a multi-billion dollar valuation, validating the early, high-conviction bet.</p>

          <p>Following the Los Angeles Dodgers' decisive 11-4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series opener, speculation has emerged that a seven-day break may have disrupted the team's rhythm. Historically, teams entering the championship after a long layoff have often struggled. While the manager and players have publicly dismissed rust as a factor, the subpar performance of key pitchers suggests the extended rest could have negatively impacted their sharpness and contributed to the loss.</p>

          <p>Despite achieving some macroeconomic goals like curbing hyperinflation, Argentinian President Javier Milei is facing considerable political and social backlash ahead of key parliamentary elections. His radical austerity policies have triggered a severe recession, diminished public purchasing power, and caused a spike in unemployment. This growing discontent is reflected in recent defections from his political party, with former allies citing concerns over alleged corruption and a disregard for the struggles of the middle class.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Royal Household Bureau has announced the death of Queen Mother Sirikit at the age of 93. As the long-reigning consort to the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej and mother to the current King Vajiralongkorn, she was a central figure in the nation's modern history. For years, her health had been in decline, leading to a reduced public role. Her birthday, August 12, is celebrated as a national holiday and as Mother's Day in Thailand, honoring her legacy as the "Mother of the Thai Nation."</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico are legally challenging a Trump administration order to dissolve their joint partnership for U.S.-Mexico flights. The Department of Transportation mandated the termination of the nearly decade-old venture by January 1, citing concerns about anti-competitive practices. The airlines argue in their appeal that the order is "arbitrary and capricious" and will harm consumers by causing flight cancellations and eliminating up to $800 million in annual benefits.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier to deploy to the waters off South America, significantly increasing U.S. military firepower in the region. This move is part of an intensified campaign against alleged drug trafficking operations, which has recently included numerous rapid air strikes on suspected smuggling boats. The administration's framing of the mission as targeting "narco-terrorists" has heightened speculation about its broader strategic goals, including potential pressure on the Venezuelan government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is exploring a proposal to auction new offshore oil and gas leases in coastal waters that have been protected for decades, including areas off California, New England, and the Carolinas. According to internal documents, lease sales could begin as early as 2026. The plan is already facing strong bipartisan opposition from governors and lawmakers in coastal states, who have voiced deep concerns about the potential for severe environmental and economic damage from offshore drilling activities.</p>
