            <p>As China and India commemorate 75 years of diplomatic ties, their ability to aid the Global South is being tested in Myanmar, which was recently struck by a devastating earthquake. Both nations aspire to lead the Global South, promoting initiatives like China's Belt and Road Initiative and India's "Mahasagar" framework. The earthquake in Myanmar, with a staggering death toll and widespread destruction, presents an opportunity for China and India to demonstrate their commitment to tangibly assisting other developing nations and solidifying their leadership roles on the global stage.</p>

However, the administration's actions are causing foreign scientists to reconsider coming to the US, while many scientists already in the country are considering leaving, which could have long-term negative consequences for American science, innovation, and economic competitiveness.</p>

            <p>With abortion access increasingly restricted in the US, some American doctors are traveling to Mexico for abortion training. Due to limited opportunities in the US, these doctors seek to gain hands-on experience in a guided setting. This trend underscores the growing divide between the US and the rest of the world on reproductive rights, as more countries liberalize their abortion laws while access diminishes in parts of the US.</p>

The tariffs, imposed on goods from various countries, will be compounded at each stage of the supply chain, from producers to retailers, resulting in higher retail prices for popular alcoholic beverages. Smaller producers are particularly vulnerable to the impact of these tariffs, which could devastate their businesses. (not investment advice)</p>
