          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Andrew Cuomo conceded to Zohran Mamdani after initial results showed Mamdani leading with 44% of first-choice votes. Cuomo, a former governor, acknowledged Mamdani's strong campaign, which resonated with younger voters. Despite the concession, the race will proceed to a ranked-choice count due to no candidate reaching the 50% threshold, with comprehensive results expected on July 1. Cuomo's campaign indicated he might consider an independent run in the general election, potentially complicating matters for the Democratic Party in the heavily Democratic city.</p>

          <p>Antoinette Lattouf, an Australian journalist, won her case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with a court ruling that she was unfairly dismissed over a social media post about the war in Gaza. Lattouf claimed the ABC cut her stint short due to her political views, race, and lobbying from pro-Israel groups after she shared a Human Rights Watch post accusing Israel of war crimes. The court found that the ABC sacked Lattouf for reasons including her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza. The ABC apologized to Lattouf, stating they had "let down our staff and audiences" in their handling of the matter, and she was awarded damages.</p>

          <p>Steve Witkoff, Special Envoy to the Middle East, suggested that an initial intelligence assessment of Iran's nuclear capabilities after U.S. strikes was leaked, calling the move "treasonous." The assessment, reportedly by U.S. Central Command and the Defense Intelligence Agency, concluded that the strikes did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program but set it back by a few months. Witkoff also assured that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding and dismissed concerns that Iran could resume its nuclear enrichment program quickly. He emphasized that no one is shooting at each other and the conflict is over.</p>

          <p>A severe heat wave is impacting eastern North America, leading to dozens of hospitalizations for heat-related illnesses.

Heat warnings are in effect from the US Midwest to the East Coast, as well as parts of Canada, affecting over 160 million people. Experts warn that the soaring temperatures, combined with high humidity, could aggravate the risk of heat-related illness, especially due to the lack of nighttime relief.</p>

          <p>California leaders reached a tentative agreement on a $321 billion state budget, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The deal reflects the political challenge of overhauling environmental regulations to speed up housing construction, despite resistance to changing the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The budget relies on borrowing money, tapping into state reserves, and shifting funding to offset a $12 billion deficit. Key elements include changes to Medi-Cal funding, such as requiring undocumented immigrant adults to pay monthly premiums, and a housing caveat that lessens environmental review requirements for building projects.</p>

          <p>Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies shows significant damage at three of Iran’s key nuclear sites, Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, following U.S. airstrikes. The images reveal craters along access roads and at tunnel entrances at Fordow, and destruction at the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center. At Natanz, craters believed to be caused by U.S. ordnance are filled and covered with dirt. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi confirmed that key buildings and underground systems at all three sites were hit, and American officials say Iran’s nuclear program has been severely set back.</p>

          <p>New York Democrats are choosing a nominee for mayor in a race with national implications for the party. The primary is largely a battle between state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani, endorsed by progressive figures, is focused on affordability, while Cuomo, hoping for a comeback, emphasizes experience. The race is being watched as a proxy war between left-wing and moderate factions within the Democratic Party, as the party seeks to hone its messaging after recent election losses.</p>

The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, indicated that the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities to be sealed off. The report also suggested that some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes. The White House has disputed the findings, calling the assessment "flat-out wrong."</p>

Using data from Europe’s Gaia space telescope, researchers studied thousands of stars and found that newly formed stars spin much faster than older ones. This faster spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form.
