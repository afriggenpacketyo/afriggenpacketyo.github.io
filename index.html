          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary order preventing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from conducting raids in several Southern California counties based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or language. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and immigrant rights groups, which alleged that federal agents were violating constitutional rights through racial profiling and warrantless arrests. The injunction also requires the Department of Homeland Security to provide detainees with access to legal counsel at a specific Los Angeles facility. This decision represents a significant, albeit temporary, legal check on the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement tactics in the region.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has permitted a lawsuit from two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo to move forward, marking a notable development in intellectual property rights concerning artificial intelligence. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, claim the company illicitly used their voices to create and sell AI-generated voice clones after they were hired for what they were told were internal or academic projects. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to the voices themselves, claims of breach of contract, deceptive practices, and copyright infringement related to training data will proceed. The case highlights the growing legal and ethical challenges surrounding AI's use of creative work and personal likenesses.</p>

          <p>Chinese law firms are significantly expanding their international operations, driven by a government push and increasing demand from Chinese companies operating overseas. The number of Chinese legal offices abroad has grown by 70 percent since 2018, as businesses prefer legal support from trusted domestic firms for their global ventures. While these firms are successfully serving their compatriots, they face challenges in attracting non-Chinese clients amid rising geopolitical tensions. This trend reflects China's growing integration into the global economy and the development of its professional services sector to support this expansion.</p>

However, an international foundation of experts contends that the historic bridge can be repaired in place for less money and with minimal disruption, preserving a crucial part of Prague's skyline.

          <p>The preliminary investigation into the deadly Air India crash in Ahmedabad has found that the fuel cutoff switches for both of the Boeing 787's engines were moved to the off position just seconds after takeoff. This action caused both engines to lose thrust, leading to the crash that killed at least 270 people. The report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, based on black box data, notes that the cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he had cut the fuel. The investigation has not yet determined how or why the switches were flipped but suggests the issue was not a mechanical fault with the aircraft or its engines.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened its new Wonsan Kalma beach resort, a large-scale development modeled after destinations like Spain's Benidorm, with the first group of Russian tourists arriving this week. The project, championed by leader Kim Jong Un, aims to attract over a million foreign visitors and boost the nation's sanctioned economy. However, the resort's rapid construction has drawn severe criticism from human rights groups and the UN, citing reports of forced labor by "shock brigades" working under brutal conditions. The development also highlights North Korea's strengthening ties with Russia, as it seeks to create new revenue streams and diplomatic partnerships.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An intense and prolonged marine heatwave in the western Mediterranean Sea has scientists deeply concerned about its impact on marine life. In late June and early July, sea surface temperatures regularly surpassed 30°C (86°F), reaching up to seven degrees above normal for the time of year. This extreme heat, driven by global warming, puts immense stress on species like foundational seaweeds and seagrasses, which can lead to mass mortality events and disrupt the entire food web, potentially affecting fish stocks. The Mediterranean is considered a climate change hotspot, and scientists warn these events are becoming more frequent and severe, acting as a "canary in the coal mine" for global oceans.</p>

          <p>A top Trump administration official has accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of overseeing an "ostentatious" and potentially unlawful renovation of the central bank's headquarters. In a letter, the Office of Management and Budget criticized the project's alleged features like rooftop gardens and premium marble, suggesting the Fed may have altered plans without proper approval. This criticism is the latest attack in a broader conflict, as President Trump has repeatedly assailed Powell for not cutting interest rates. Powell has previously testified to Congress that descriptions of the renovation were "misleading and inaccurate," stating that the project is a necessary overhaul of buildings not updated since the 1930s.

Speaking at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Wang described the 2016 case, which was brought by the Philippines and invalidated many of China's territorial claims, as a "farce" manipulated by external powers to destabilize the region. He asserted that China is committed to maintaining stability and is accelerating negotiations with ASEAN for a binding code of conduct.

          <p>Recent economic data and a stark report from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) suggest the United Kingdom is heading towards significant tax increases in the upcoming autumn Budget. The OBR issued a "daunting" forecast, warning that UK government debt could soar and that current spending promises are unaffordable without policy changes. This analysis, combined with a recent dip in monthly GDP and rising government borrowing costs, creates a challenging environment for the chancellor. The message from forecasters is that the government must make realistic and tough choices to stabilize the public finances, likely involving substantial tax hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final presents a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova. Swiatek, the world number one, has historically had an uneasy relationship with grass but has found formidable form, adjusting her tactics by playing slightly further behind the baseline to better utilize her powerful forehand. Anisimova, returning to prominence after a break for mental health, plays an aggressive, free-swinging game that could thrive in an underdog role. The final will likely be decided by who better manages the immense pressure of the occasion, with Swiatek's experience clashing with Anisimova's nothing-to-lose mentality.</p>

While reaffirming the importance of the U.S. alliance and the AUKUS security pact, his government is also engaging with Beijing, as evidenced by an upcoming state visit.

Lula's government has condemned the move as an illegal attempt to interfere in Brazil's domestic affairs and judicial system.

The move is part of a broader strategy of using tariffs to pressure dozens of countries, but the high rate targeting Canada is particularly notable.

Federal officials stated they rescued at least 10 minors from potential exploitation, while farmworker advocates decried the action as a terror campaign against agricultural workers. The event has put a spotlight on the cannabis company, the aggressive tactics of federal agents, and the dueling political narratives surrounding immigration and labor.</p>
