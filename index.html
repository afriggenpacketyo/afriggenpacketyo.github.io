          <p>A mayor from Teuchitl√°n, Mexico, Jos√© Murgu√≠a Santiago, has been arrested as part of an investigation into a suspected Jalisco New Generation cartel training camp, according to a federal official. The investigation was prompted by the discovery of human bones and clothing at the Izaguirre Ranch, dubbed the "ranch of horror" by local media, which was allegedly used by the cartel to train new recruits. The arrest raises questions about potential complicity between local authorities and the cartel, which is known for its extreme violence. The article notes that over 127,000 people are registered as missing in Mexico, with Jalisco having the highest number of cases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Damon Linker's article in the New York Times explores the philosophical underpinnings of President Trump's expansion of executive power during his second term. He argues that Trump's actions go beyond the traditional conservative unitary executive theory, drawing instead from a more radical right-wing tradition rooted in thinkers like Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss. Linker connects these intellectual influences to specific actions by the Trump administration, such as deploying the military to the border and invoking the Alien Enemies Act. The article concludes by warning that this expansive view of executive power threatens to transform the American presidency into a dictatorial office, urging a return to constitutional constraints and emphasizing the importance of character in those holding such power.</p>

          <p>Rodney Hinton Jr. has been charged with aggravated murder after allegedly intentionally hitting and killing a sheriff's deputy with his car a day after his 18-year-old son, Ryan Hinton, was fatally shot by Cincinnati police. The incident occurred outside the University of Cincinnati graduation ceremony, hours after Hinton and his family viewed police bodycam footage of his son's shooting. Police allege Ryan Hinton brandished a gun at officers during a stolen vehicle investigation, leading to the shooting, while the family's lawyer stated that Hinton became "understandably distraught" after watching the video. The Cincinnati Police Chief acknowledged a connection between the two cases, describing the situation as an "unimaginable tragedy."</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the upcoming boxing match between Canelo √Ålvarez and Terence Crawford, questioning whether it will be another unequal fight like Canelo's recent bout with William Scull. Crawford, a highly skilled boxer, is moving up two weight divisions to challenge Canelo, raising concerns about the size and strength disparity. Experts like Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez predict a knockout victory for Canelo, while others note that Crawford's style could make the fight more exciting than Canelo's recent lackluster performances. The article suggests that the fight is primarily driven by financial incentives for Crawford, potentially leading to a mismatch similar to Canelo's past encounters.</p>

          <p>In this transcript from "Face the Nation," H.R. McMaster discusses the recent departures from the National Security Council and the policy arguments within the Trump administration regarding America's role in the world. McMaster suggests a power struggle between internationalists who prioritize alliances and those favoring U.S. retrenchment and a focus on North American defense. He expresses concern that President Trump may view the National Security Council staff as an impediment to his agenda. The conversation also touches on the administration's stance on far-right political movements in Europe and the risks of replicating flaws from the Obama administration's foreign policy approach.</p>

Wasser argues that eminent domain is not the primary cause of the delays, but rather a symptom of deeper systemic issues.

          <p>Brazilian police arrested two suspects in connection with an alleged plot to bomb Lady Gaga's free concert on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro. The suspects, reportedly fans of the singer, were allegedly planning to use improvised explosives and were part of an online group promoting hate speech and violence. The arrests were part of Operation Fake Monsters, a joint investigation aimed at preempting any threat ahead of the concert, which drew over two million fans. Despite the threat, the concert proceeded without incident, and Lady Gaga's team stated they were unaware of the operation until after the event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Israeli military has begun calling up tens of thousands of reservists to "intensify and expand" its operations in Gaza, according to reports. The move comes as international negotiations have failed to reach a new ceasefire agreement with Hamas, and the stated goal is to pressure Hamas to release the remaining hostages and defeat the militant group. Critics express concern that the offensive has failed to secure the release of captives and question Prime Minister Netanyahu's objectives. The expanded offensive is expected to put further strain on reservists and raise concerns among families of hostages.</p>

The film is based around lesser-known superheroes who have to take on human and superhuman threats whilst fighting their own personal battles.
