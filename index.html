          <p>Bridgend council in Wales faced criticism for a PowerPoint presentation intended for schools that included a slide stating, "It is never OK to start choking someone without asking them first." The council claims it was a draft and never shown to children, designed to stimulate debate before clarifying that non-fatal strangulation is illegal. However, experts and politicians are concerned about the inclusion of such content, even in a draft, and are requesting the release of all versions of the presentation to ensure children are being taught properly. The article highlights concerns about the appropriateness of the material and the need for careful safeguarding in sex education.</p>

          <p>In Serbia, a student-led movement is challenging President Aleksandar Vucic's increasingly autocratic government through persistent protests and demonstrations. The movement was sparked by a tragic train station collapse in Novi Sad, which protesters believe was caused by corruption, and has since grown into a widespread expression of discontent. The article highlights a moment of solidarity when Muslim students from Novi Pazar relieved protesting students from Belgrade during Easter, and a war veteran's inclusive message resonated deeply. Despite government attempts to quell the protests, including offering loans to young people, the movement continues to gain momentum, advocating for early elections and setting an example of unity and horizontal decision-making.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen from a Japanese temple in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned, resolving a long-standing dispute. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over to temple representatives in South Korea following a South Korean Supreme Court ruling in favor of the temple's ownership. The artifact is now expected to be stored at a museum after a ceremony at the temple. The statue's return marks the end of a legal battle that began when a South Korean temple claimed it had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing stricter migration rules, including English language tests for adult dependents of foreign workers and restrictions on care homes recruiting staff from abroad. Prime Minister Starmer is quoted saying new immigrants must earn the "privilege, not right" to settle in the UK, a move analyzed as an attempt to regain control of the narrative from Reform UK. The proposals also include prioritizing residency rights for migrants who pay taxes on time, work in the public sector, or volunteer. The article also highlights criticisms from Conservatives who deem the plans insufficient and notes that Starmer plans to shut an ECHR migrant loophole.</p>

          <p>A measure in President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" aimed at restricting federal payments to abortion providers is facing potential opposition from moderate House Republicans. Rep. Mike Lawler questioned the definition of "large groups who provide abortion services" and argued that the Hyde Amendment already prevents federal funding for abortion services. Several moderate Republicans have reportedly communicated to House GOP leaders that they may oppose the bill if the provision is included, citing a desire to avoid reigniting the abortion debate. The legislation aims to redirect funds from "big abortion" to federally qualified health centers.</p>
