            <p>CBS Mornings co-host Gayle King described her recent Blue Origin spaceflight as a "bona fide freakin' flight", emphasizing her pride and the profound experience of viewing Earth from space. The all-women crew, assembled by Lauren Sánchez, included singer Katy Perry, who serenaded the group with "What a Wonderful World" after the zero-gravity portion of the journey. King, who overcame her fear of flying for the mission, highlighted the "true sisterhood" formed among the crew members during their shared experience. The flight reached an altitude of 346,802 feet and lasted approximately 10 minutes. </p>

            <p>Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley faced intense questioning from constituents at a town hall meeting regarding the Trump administration's policies on deportations, tariffs, and adherence to the rule of law. Many attendees voiced concerns about the administration's refusal to comply with court orders regarding the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from detention in El Salvador. Grassley defended his position, stating that Congress does not have the power to force El Salvador to comply with U.S. court orders, leading to heated exchanges and expressions of frustration from the audience. Constituents also raised concerns about the potential impact of Trump's tariff policies on Iowa farmers.</p>

The market volatility was fueled by conflicting signals from the White House, including a willingness to ease auto tariffs alongside plans to impose new tariffs on computer chips and pharmaceuticals. European markets, however, traded higher following the European Commission President's pause on planned tariff countermeasures. (not investment advice)</p>

The CDC report suggests that improved screening and access to autism services may contribute to the rise in diagnoses. The study also found higher autism prevalence among Asian, Black, and Hispanic children compared to White children, potentially due to disparities in factors like preterm birth and lead poisoning.</p>

            <p>This article discusses the Trump administration's increased deportation efforts, which have ensnared individuals who did not consider themselves targets. The administration's focus on deporting unauthorized immigrants with criminal records has expanded to include those with no criminal record and American-born children. The increased pressure to meet deportation goals has led to the arrest of people who many believe should be left alone. The article highlights cases of individuals with long-standing ties to the U.S. facing deportation, raising concerns about the administration's policies.</p>

Bukele's approach involves showy displays of force, while Orbán subtly manipulates the law to undermine democracy. Trump's treatment of migrants is likened to Bukele's tactics, while his efforts to influence American universities resemble Orbán's strategies. The article argues that Trump's combination of these styles could inflame resistance to his policies and ultimately undermine his goals.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is moving to fast-track asylum cases by allowing judges to dismiss "legally deficient" claims without a hearing. This policy change could lead to immigration judges denying asylum based solely on the asylum request form. Critics argue this will hurt those without legal representation, as complex asylum applications may be dismissed due to minor errors. The move comes as the administration seeks to deport more people without legal status, but the immigration court system faces a backlog of cases.</p>
