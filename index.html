          <p>Reform UK achieved significant gains in the 2025 local elections across England, securing control of 10 councils and winning a by-election by a narrow margin. The party's success came at the expense of both Labour and the Conservatives, who experienced substantial losses. The Liberal Democrats also made notable gains, while the Green Party more than doubled its number of councillors. The article also analyzes mayoral contests, highlighting Reform UK's victories in newly-created mayoralties and the close races in Labour-held areas. The results indicate a potential shift in voter sentiment and a loosening grip of traditional parties on the electorate.</p>

          <p>The German domestic intelligence agency's decision to designate the far-right AfD party as a "right-wing extremist" entity has drawn criticism from US officials, leading to a diplomatic dispute. US Vice President JD Vance accused Germany of rebuilding a "Berlin Wall," while Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the AfD designation "tyranny in disguise." The German Foreign Ministry defended the decision, stating it was a result of a thorough investigation to protect the constitution and prevent right-wing extremism. The AfD, founded in 2013, has gained popularity by capitalizing on fears over migration and is now Germany's largest opposition party.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports that water supplies ran dry during the Pacific Palisades fire due to a reservoir being offline for repairs. The city had attempted to reactivate a retired reservoir to compensate, but the plan was unsuccessful due to safety concerns. Emails show that the city was aware of the potential water shortage, but failed to rectify the problem before the fire. The inability to utilize either reservoir significantly reduced the available water supply, leading to firefighters reporting dry hydrants as the fire raged. The article mentions that this is central to legal claims surrounding the fire.</p>

The dilemma arises from the need to engage with a Syrian government that includes individuals identified as "terrorists" by the UN.
