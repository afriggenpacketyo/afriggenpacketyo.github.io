          <p>Shares in Japan's SoftBank Group surged by 13%, marking their best performance in five years and reaching a new record high. This significant stock increase followed the company's announcement of a fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen, which far exceeded analyst expectations. The positive results were driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, the largest since 2021, attributed to successful investments in companies like Grab Holdings and Swiggy. The firm anticipates further growth with upcoming IPOs for portfolio companies such as Lenskart and PayPay. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from $25 million to $50 million. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi accused Maduro of being a major narco-trafficker who collaborates with cartels to bring fentanyl-laced cocaine into the United States. This action escalates a 2020 federal indictment against Maduro for narco-terrorism. In response, Venezuela's foreign minister dismissed the increased bounty as a "pathetic" and "crude political propaganda operation" designed to distract from domestic issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered an increase in federal law enforcement presence throughout Washington, D.C., to address a recent surge in violent crime. The operation, set to last at least seven days, will involve agencies like the FBI and DEA focusing on high-traffic tourist areas and known crime hotspots. This initiative is part of the "Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force" established by an executive order earlier in the year. The White House stated the goal is to protect residents and visitors and restore safety to the nation's capital.</p>

The company's leadership cited cautious spending habits among U.S. consumers as a primary reason for the downturn, noting a decrease in foot traffic to their stores. Crocs also warned about a potential $40 million impact from tariffs for the rest of 2025 and mentioned that a portion of its customer base has become "super cautious" with discretionary purchases. This marks the stock's worst single-day performance in almost 15 years. (not investment advice)</p>

The 22-year-old fourth seed defeated Russia's Karen Khachanov in a tight three-set final with a score of 6-7(5), 6-4, 7-6(3). Shelton's path to victory included wins over several high-seeded players, making him the youngest American to win a Masters 1000 tournament since Andy Roddick in 2004. The match was a hard-fought battle, with Shelton rallying after losing the first set and overcoming a break in the second to force a decisive tie-break.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. This marks the fourth court decision to halt the policy, which seeks to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens or are in the country on a temporary basis. The judge certified a class action for all affected children, stating the plaintiffs were highly likely to win their argument that the order violates the 14th Amendment. The ruling follows a complex legal battle and a recent Supreme Court decision limiting nationwide injunctions.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Science Advances reveals that California's wildfire season now begins significantly earlier than it did in the 1990s, a shift largely attributed to human-caused climate change. Researchers found that in some regions, like the Cascade Range, the season starts as much as 46 days sooner. The primary drivers are identified as earlier snowmelt and the increased drying of flammable vegetation due to rising average temperatures. This research quantifies the anecdotal sense among residents that fire season is lengthening, confirming that it is a near year-round threat in parts of the state.</p>

The sheriff stated the jail is only 60% staffed and that her repeated requests for funding to make necessary security upgrades were ignored.

          <p>Recent actions by the Trump administration have pushed U.S. tariffs to their highest level in almost 100 years, with the average rate on imported goods reaching 18.3%. This is the highest since 1934, according to research from the Budget Lab at Yale. The implementation of these duties has prompted international reactions, with Brazil planning state aid for affected companies and Switzerland seeking new talks with Washington. Despite global uncertainty, the White House believes the policy will spur domestic investment and hiring, rebalancing the U.S. economy toward manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has begun detaining migrants who crossed the English Channel under a new deportation agreement with France. According to a government source, several dozen migrants have been detained and could be returned to France within weeks as part of the pilot scheme. The "one in, one out" deal involves the UK accepting an equal number of vetted asylum seekers from France in exchange for returning those who arrive illegally by small boat. The Home Office confirmed that transfers to immigration removal centers are underway, signaling the start of the 11-month program.</p>

          <p>Instagram's launch of a new map feature has triggered a significant backlash from users concerned about privacy and the sharing of their location data. The tool, similar to Snapchat's Snap Map, is designed to let users share their last active location with friends. Although Meta, Instagram's parent company, insists the feature is opt-in by default, many users reported concerns that their location was being shared without their explicit consent. Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, responded to the complaints, stating the company was investigating but believes the confusion arises from users seeing their own location on the map.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced that its experimental oral GLP-1 medication, orforglipron, successfully promoted significant weight loss in a Phase 3 clinical trial. Adults with obesity who took the pill lost an average of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks, with a safety profile consistent with existing injectable therapies. Common side effects included nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The company plans to submit the drug for FDA approval later this year, potentially making a more convenient and accessible pill-based alternative to injectable weight-loss drugs available by 2026.

          <p>The UK government is developing legislation to impose stricter geographical restrictions on serious violent and sexual offenders upon their release from prison. The new system would confine offenders to a specific, tailored zone where they are allowed to go, rather than just using exclusion zones they cannot enter. Monitored by enhanced electronic tagging, this approach aims to provide victims with greater peace of mind and the ability to travel without fear of encountering their attacker. Critics, however, have raised concerns about the increased pressure these plans will place on an already strained probation service.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at allowing high-risk assets like private equity and cryptocurrencies to be included in 401(k) retirement plans.

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is demanding regulatory and legislative action after State Farm announced an average 27% increase in homeowners insurance rates in the state. The governor expressed deep concern, suggesting the insurer is unfairly shifting costs from out-of-state catastrophes onto Illinois homeowners, as the company's loss numbers are inconsistent with state analysis. State Farm attributed the hike to rising costs and an increase in severe weather events, noting Illinois had a high number of hail damage claims. This move highlights growing affordability challenges in the insurance market due to climate-related risks. (not investment advice)</p>

The administration argues the ban harms its ability to enforce immigration laws in a district with a large undocumented population.
