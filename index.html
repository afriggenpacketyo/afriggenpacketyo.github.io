            <h2>Analysts: China Poised to Retaliate Strongly Against US Tariff Hikes</h2>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Following President Trump's threat of additional tariffs, analysts suggest China is likely to retaliate in the escalating trade war, as the economic impact of further tariffs on China diminishes with already high tariff levels. Experts note that tariffs exceeding 35% would eliminate most Chinese exporters' profit margins, prompting a firm response from Beijing. Despite Trump's aggressive stance, China is expected to stand its ground and implement countermeasures. The analysts believe that China will fight back strongly. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump announced the U.S. would impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports if China proceeds with its plan to levy a 34% retaliatory tariff on American products. China's commerce ministry has vowed to take countermeasures. This action would bring total tariffs on Chinese imports to 104%. Economists warn that the growing trade war could negatively impact economic growth and potentially trigger a recession, as consumers would likely bear the brunt of these tariffs through higher prices.

            <p>Iran announced it will engage in indirect talks with the United States in Oman this weekend, signaling a potential diplomatic avenue regarding Iran's nuclear program. This comes after President Trump indicated direct talks were imminent, although Iranian officials clarified the discussions would be indirect. The meeting is seen as a test of America's commitment, particularly given Trump's prior withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal. The success of these talks remains uncertain, with Iran emphasizing the need for the U.S. to rebuild trust.</p>

            <p>Prince Harry is appealing a court decision that denied him government-funded security in the UK. He lost his security detail in February 2020 after stepping down as a working royal and moving to the US. Harry argues that he and his family face danger in his homeland due to hostility and media attention. He previously lost a case seeking to privately pay for police protection, but won a libel case against a tabloid publisher for phone hacking.</p>

            <p>A former deputy governor of the Bank of England, Charlie Bean, has urged the central bank to cut interest rates by at least 0.5% to 4% in response to the financial turmoil caused by President Trump's trade tariffs. Bean believes an aggressive strategy is needed to combat the fallout from the tariff war. Another former Bank rate setter, David Blanchflower, suggested holding an emergency meeting to consider a deep rate reduction. The intervention comes as economists warn of a potential recession due to increased uncertainty and delayed business investments. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Analysts suggest President Trump's new tariffs could create an opportunity for China to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Trump's tariffs, which have shocked the world, may lead countries to close ranks against the US, potentially aiding China's application to join the CPTPP. The CPTPP is a 12-member trading bloc that includes countries like Australia, Canada, Japan, and Vietnam. China applied to join the grouping in 2021, but its bid remains pending.</p>
