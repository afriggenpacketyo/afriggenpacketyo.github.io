          <p>A new book by a former royal editor claims that Queen Camilla was the victim of an attempted sexual assault when she was a teenager. The book alleges she fought off her attacker on a train using her shoe and ensured the man was arrested. This revelation provides context for her extensive public work supporting victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, although sources state this specific incident was not her primary motivation. The Queen has reportedly kept the event private to avoid overshadowing the stories of the victims she now supports.</p>

          <p>Scientists from Tarim University have discovered brine shrimp, an ancient species dating back 400 million years, in a highly saline water source within the Taklamakan Desert. This finding in the Xinjiang region suggests the area has the natural conditions necessary for cultivating salt-tolerant organisms. The shrimp, also known as Artemia, are valuable in aquaculture as feed and also have uses in medicine and cosmetics. Researchers will now conduct laboratory studies to determine if this is a new species and to explore the potential for developing a local aquaculture industry.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck eastern Afghanistan, causing significant devastation in Kunar province. According to a Taliban government spokesman, the shallow quake has resulted in at least 610 deaths and 1,300 injuries, with numerous villages completely destroyed. The extensive damage is attributed to the quake's shallow depth, which tends to be more destructive. Rescue operations are currently underway, and officials expect the casualty figures to rise as more information becomes available from remote and inaccessible areas affected by the disaster.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has withdrawn its subpoena compelling former special counsel Robert Mueller to testify regarding the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. A committee spokesperson stated the decision was made after learning that Mueller has health issues that prevent him from appearing. Mueller's family later confirmed to The New York Times that he has been battling Parkinson's disease. The Republican-led committee had sought his testimony due to his role as FBI director from 2001 to 2013, a period during which Epstein was under investigation by the agency.</p>

          <p>Victoria Police allege that Dezi Freeman, a fugitive wanted for the murder of two police officers, is being actively assisted by community members to evade capture. The manhunt for the 56-year-old, described as a conspiracy theorist, has entered its seventh day after he escaped into dense bushland during a police raid on his property. Authorities have warned that anyone found to be harboring or assisting Freeman is committing a serious crime. The incident has renewed concerns in Australia about how to manage threats posed by individuals with anti-authority and sovereign citizen beliefs.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese tech giant Alibaba experienced a substantial surge of nearly 19% in Hong Kong trading following a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report. The strong performance was primarily fueled by a 26% year-over-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division, driven by high demand for AI-related products. While the company's core e-commerce business saw revenue growth, profitability was impacted by heavy investment in the competitive "quick commerce" sector. The positive results reflect investor confidence in Alibaba's strategy of balancing AI investment with growth in its traditional business segments. (not investment advice)</p>

Researchers identified specific markers of oxidative damage, including Heinz Bodies and "ghost cells," which had not been previously described in such detail in feline cases. The findings underscore the extreme toxicity of onions for cats due to their unique metabolic inability to process certain compounds, prompting calls for greater pet owner awareness.</p>

This policy, which follows a previous successful pilot, is intended to encourage more people to switch from cars to public transport, thereby reducing carbon emissions.

The author contends that the focus of anti-immigration rhetoric constantly shifts, from ending free movement to stopping small boats and now to mass deportations, with no policy ever being sufficient to appease critics. Drawing parallels with increasingly militarized enforcement in the United States, the piece suggests that the goal is not a specific number but a perpetual state of crisis.

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met during the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, signaling a renewed effort to normalize relations. This diplomatic engagement is viewed in the context of India's strained relationship with the United States, particularly following the Trump administration's imposition of tariffs on Indian imports. While the meeting resulted in agreements to resume direct flights and simplify visas, significant challenges remain, including unresolved border disputes and a large trade deficit favoring China. India's outreach is part of its "strategic autonomy" policy, balancing relationships with competing global powers.</p>

          <p>Following Inter Miami's 3-0 loss to the Seattle Sounders in the Leagues Cup final, striker Luis Suárez was involved in a post-match confrontation that ended with him spitting on a member of the Sounders staff. The incident occurred after Suárez had a heated interaction with Seattle midfielder Obed Vargas, which escalated into a larger melee between players and staff from both teams. This event is the latest in a career marked by controversy for Suárez. In the past, Major League Soccer has issued multi-game suspensions for similar actions, suggesting potential disciplinary measures could follow.</p>

          <p>The parliamentary leaders of Germany's two ruling coalition parties, Jens Spahn of the CDU/CSU and Matthias Miersch of the SPD, traveled to Kyiv to demonstrate cross-party solidarity with Ukraine.

During the trip, the lawmakers emphasized that a swift end to the war at the expense of Ukraine's sovereignty is not an option.

          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott stated he was not surprised by the trade that sent star defender Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers. Prescott commented that while he didn't initially expect a trade, the increasingly personal nature of contract negotiations between Parsons and the team's front office made the outcome understandable. Following the trade, Parsons signed a record-breaking four-year, $188 million contract with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL. The Cowboys received Green Bay's next two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark in the exchange.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has revoked the extended Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris, effective just days before the start of her national book tour. The move, seen by critics as political retaliation, ends the 18-month protection detail that had been authorized by former President Joe Biden. In response, California Governor Gavin Newsom has reportedly arranged for the California Highway Patrol to provide security for Harris, ensuring her protection continues. The decision highlights the ongoing political friction between Trump and his Democratic rivals, particularly those in California.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Private surveys indicate that factory activity across several key Asian economies, including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, contracted in August. The downturn is largely attributed to the impact of U.S. tariffs, which are weakening export demand and putting pressure on manufacturers. This trend overshadows a surprisingly positive manufacturing report from China, which bucked the regional decline. Analysts express concern that the negative effects of the trade dispute will intensify, particularly for countries that are heavily reliant on shipments to the United States, posing a significant challenge to the region's economic stability.

This provides a new perspective on the controversial removal effort, which was halted amid legal challenges from advocates who argued it violated the children's rights. The Guatemalan government asserted that its actions have complied with due process and considered the human rights of the minors involved.</p>
