          <p>Atlanta Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins playfully commented on Travis Kelce's noticeable back hair, which had recently gone viral on social media. Speaking with E! News, Cousins humorously acknowledged Taylor Swift's acceptance of Kelce's hairy physique, attributing it to "genetics" and expressing relief that he doesn't share the same trait. Kelce had previously discussed his body hair on the "New Heights" podcast, jokingly comparing himself to a "Yeti" during his college basketball days due to his extensive hair growth. Kelce is preparing for his 13th season with the Chiefs, coming off a 2024 season with 97 receptions, 823 yards, and three touchdowns, though the Chiefs lost the Super Bowl to the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>

          <p>An All Nippon Airways flight from Tokyo to Houston was forced to divert to Seattle after an unruly passenger tried to open an exit door mid-flight. The man was restrained by fellow passengers and crew members before the plane landed at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Port of Seattle Police determined the passenger was experiencing a medical crisis and transported him to a local hospital for treatment, while it remains unclear if the man will face any charges. A second unrelated incident involved another unruly passenger who was also removed by police in Seattle, before the flight continued to Houston after a delay of several hours.</p>

The strikes targeted areas such as Khan Younis, Jabalia, and Nuseirat, as the Israeli army increases operations in Gaza.

          <p>President Trump has again criticized Harvard University, days after a judge blocked his administration's attempt to revoke the school's ability to enroll international students. Trump claimed that some of Harvard's international students come from countries "not at all friendly to the United States" and "pay NOTHING toward their student's education," further stating that his administration wants to know the identities of these students. Harvard had argued that the revocation was a "blatant violation of the First Amendment" for rejecting government control over its governance and curriculum. A hearing is scheduled to determine whether the temporary restraining order should be extended.</p>

Graham Parsons, a former West Point professor who resigned in protest of the administration's changes, criticized Trump's decision to wear his "Make America Great Again" hat during the event. Parsons stated that the administration is attempting to indoctrinate rather than educate, censoring arguments to align with the ideological tastes of the Trump administration. He described the situation as a professional betrayal, noting that his research agenda was effectively banned and that the administration is telling professional scholars which areas of inquiry are legitimate.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the passage of the budget bill, calling it the "largest cut in spending in at least 30 years," while downplaying concerns about its potential to raise federal deficits. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis suggests the tax provisions in the package could increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next decade. Despite skepticism from Republican senators, Johnson rejected the CBO analysis, claiming it is "dramatically overstated," and he asserted that the bill will stimulate the economy by raising wages and incentivizing U.S. manufacturing.

          <p>President Trump's family has increasingly profited from his presidency, normalizing activities that once would have provoked scrutiny and investigations. Recent examples include a $28 million promotional film for Melania Trump financed by Jeff Bezos, a luxury jet from Qatar, and a $500,000-per-person club in Washington called the Executive Branch. Despite potential conflicts of interest, there have been few official investigations due to Trump's dismantling of ethical oversight and the Republican-controlled Congress's unwillingness to hold hearings. While some critics have voiced concerns, there has been little sustained public outrage, leading to questions about whether the public truly cares about government ethics.</p>

          <p>Novelist Anne Tyler discusses her "selfish motive" as a writer, which is to explore other lives and understand different perspectives. She explains that a serious book should transport the reader to another life, creating a believable lie that allows them to experience being someone else. Tyler, known for novels like "Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant" and "The Accidental Tourist," finds inspiration in overheard conversations and everyday people, which she jots down in her "blue box" of notes. Her latest book, "Three Days in June," focuses on a school administrator's life and reflects Tyler's love for setting her stories in Baltimore.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, killed at least seven of a doctor's ten children, with two more missing and presumed dead, according to Gaza health officials and the family. The doctor, Alaa al-Najjar, was working at Nasser Hospital when the strike occurred, and her husband, Hamdi al-Najjar, remains in critical condition with severe brain injuries. The Israeli military stated that it had struck a number of suspects near Israeli forces in Khan Younis, but was still checking if "uninvolved civilians were harmed." The family had stayed in their home despite evacuation orders, feeling that it was safer than a crowded tent camp.</p>

          <p>The Labour government cannot guarantee train ticket prices will decrease despite renationalising South Western Railway (SWR), the first train company to be nationalised under Labour. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that the day-to-day running of trains is already heavily subsidised by taxpayers, with the focus instead being on improving services and infrastructure. Current government plans aim to renationalise nearly all passenger rail services in England by 2027, with ministers hoping to find ways to cut the cost of rail travel once Great British Railways (GBR) is formally established. The first SWR service under public ownership featured the new GBR livery, but passengers expressed concerns about the lack of immediate price reductions.</p>

          <p>Dr. Timothy Johnson, former ABC News medical editor and founding editor of the Harvard Medical School Health Letter, criticizes the Trump administration's recent budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Johnson argues that these cuts, totaling over $1.8 billion in grants, will cause terrible damage to outstanding research programs and destroy the careers of many young medical scientists. He warns of a potential "brain drain" as researchers seek positions in other countries, advocating for a more surgical approach to savings that avoids destroying the research infrastructure that has served the country for decades.</p>
