          <p>The Gates Foundation, celebrating its 25th anniversary, faces significant threats to its global health initiatives due to the Trump administration's dismantling of foreign aid and attacks from influential figures like Elon Musk. Bill Gates has met with various government officials in an attempt to salvage the situation, but key partnerships have faltered. The foundation, known for its measured responses, is struggling to adapt to a chaotic world where decisions are driven by spite and vengeance rather than data-driven optimization, leading to a failure of imagination in anticipating the scale of changes.</p>

          <p>Representative Elise Stefanik's expected appointment as U.N. ambassador was rescinded, leading her back to Capitol Hill and igniting a conflict with Speaker Mike Johnson, who she accuses of dishonesty. Despite the setback, Stefanik's supporters see this as an opportunity, encouraging her to run for New York governor in 2026. Her relationship with Johnson has deteriorated, particularly after promises of a leadership position and a spot on the Intelligence Committee were not fulfilled. This situation underscores the precarious nature of loyalty in the current political climate.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a contraction in the first quarter of 2025, with GDP declining at an annual rate of 0.3 percent, largely due to the impact of tariffs and policy uncertainty instigated by the Trump administration. Consumers and businesses rushed to purchase goods ahead of tariff implementation, creating artificial economic activity. While underlying growth indicators remain solid, economists anticipate a slowdown in spending and investment as tariffs drive up prices and create uncertainty. Despite the economic headwinds, the U.S. economy has shown resilience, but potential layoffs could quickly deteriorate the situation.</p>

          <p>Jennifer French, paralyzed after a skiing accident, received a neurotech implant allowing her to stand, but the company commercializing the device struggled, leaving her future uncertain. This article explores the phenomenon of 'abandonment' experienced by neurotech implant patients when companies fail to support their devices long-term. While French was fortunate to receive ongoing support from researchers, many others are left with life-changing technology abandoned inside their bodies. The burgeoning neurotech industry faces the challenge of preventing future patient abandonment.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade war is affecting the golf cart industry, even though he frequently uses them himself. While companies like Club Car and E-Z-Go assemble golf carts in the U.S., they rely on components sourced from various countries, including China, which are subject to tariffs. The U.S. imported $709 million in fully assembled golf carts in 2024, with 99% coming from China. The tariffs will force domestic golf cart manufacturers to either raise prices or sacrifice profit margins, highlighting the complexity of global supply chains.</p>

          <p>The US economy experienced a contraction in the first quarter of 2025, with gross domestic product shrinking at a 0.3% annual rate due to businesses stockpiling goods ahead of President Trump's tariff policies. Economists suggest that the report might be skewed due to the surge in imports as companies tried to circumvent the tariffs. Some experts warn that the implementation of steep import fees could create headwinds for the economy later in the year. The decline in government spending, particularly through Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, also contributed to the economic downturn.</p>

          <p>Stocks experienced a significant decline after new government data revealed that the U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter of the year. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all fell sharply, reflecting investor concerns about the impact of tariffs and economic uncertainty. The GDP data, which showed a 0.3% annual rate decline, was worse than expected. Analysts suggest that the surge in imports ahead of tariffs contributed to the negative GDP number, and they warn that trade policies could continue to weigh on markets.</p>

          <p>New details have surfaced regarding the deportations of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador, revealing that President Nayib Bukele sought assurances from the Trump administration that the deportees were members of the Tren de Aragua gang.

The agreement between the U.S. and El Salvador involved the deportation of hundreds of migrants in exchange for financial support and the return of MS-13 leaders to El Salvador.

          <p>President Trump has attributed the recent economic downturn to his predecessor, Joe Biden, after new data showed a contraction in U.S. GDP. Trump defended his tariffs, claiming that a future economic boom is imminent. The Commerce Department reported that the GDP fell at a 0.3% annualized pace, driven by a surge in imports ahead of the new tariffs and a drop in government spending. Trump's attempt to shift blame mirrors his earlier efforts to take credit for stock market gains during Biden's administration.</p>

          <p>A new study by Aon suggests that the use of GLP-1 drugs, like Mounjaro and Ozempic, can lead to lower medical costs for employers within two years due to improved health outcomes among patients. The study, which analyzed medical claims data for 139,000 workers, found that the medical cost trend slowed by 7% on average for patients taking GLP-1s. The reduction in major adverse cardiac events and the onset of diabetes were significant drivers of these savings, demonstrating a potential economic return on providing insurance coverage for GLP-1s.</p>
