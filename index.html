          <p>The Norwegian Refugee Council reports dire conditions in Sudan, with people resorting to eating charcoal and leaves to survive after fleeing attacks, notably the destruction of the Zamzam camp near El-Fasher by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The journey to Tawila, a supposed safe haven, is proving deadly due to thirst and extreme temperatures, and there are reports of bodies lining the road. A particularly harrowing account details a young girl who walked alone from El-Fasher, was repeatedly sexually assaulted, and succumbed to her wounds upon arrival in Tawila, highlighting the brutal realities of the conflict and the urgent need for humanitarian intervention. The RSF denies committing atrocities.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos faces sentencing on Long Island after pleading guilty to federal wire fraud and identity theft charges, admitting to fabricating significant parts of his biography. Prosecutors are seeking 87 months in prison, citing his lies, theft, and defrauding of voters and donors, while Santos' lawyers request a 24-month sentence. Santos has expressed accepting responsibility but also claims he is unrepentant for his crimes and says he remains unrepentant. The case has cost him his seat, reputation, and the confidence of his supporters, and as part of his plea deal, he agreed to pay over $575,000 in restitution and forfeiture.</p>

          <p>NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe is facing a $50 million civil lawsuit alleging sexual assault and threats by a young woman, identified as Jane Doe, who claims a rocky consensual relationship turned abusive.

          <p>Japan is considering increasing imports of U.S. soybeans and corn as part of ongoing negotiations with the United States regarding tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on automobiles, steel, aluminum, and other goods. This move aims to offset excess supply created by declining U.S. exports to China due to trade friction between Washington and Beijing. By increasing these imports, Japan hopes to secure exemptions from U.S. tariffs. Japan's Emperor Naruhito conveyed condolences over the death of Pope Francis to the acting head of the Vatican, Cardinal Kevin Farrell.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering a law change that would allow cyclists who cause fatal accidents due to dangerous cycling to face life imprisonment. This amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill aims to align cycling offenses with driving offenses, currently, cycling offenders can be imprisoned for no more than two years under an 1861 law. The proposed changes would also allow for five-year jail sentences, fines, or both for serious injury caused by dangerous cycling or death by careless or inconsiderate cycling, with a two-year sentence for serious injury caused by careless cycling.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump denied that the bond market's reaction influenced his decision to pause aggressive "reciprocal" tariffs against U.S. trading partners, asserting that the move was to allow time for negotiation. He stated he wasn't worried despite market volatility following the initial announcement, where Treasury yields rose sharply. Trump added that he would consider it a "total victory" even if the U.S. has levies as high as 50% still in place a year from now. Yields have since moved lower, with the 10-year most recently around 4.28%, about a quarter percentage point higher than its recent low.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new species of carnivorous caterpillar on Oahu, Hawaii, dubbed the "bone collector," which adorns its silk case with the body parts of its spider prey. This unique behavior, unprecedented among caterpillars, may serve as camouflage, allowing the caterpillar to feed on insects trapped in spiderwebs without being detected. The origins of this species date back at least 6 million years, predating the Hawaiian islands themselves, and scientists urge conservation efforts to protect this unique lineage. Researchers found just 62 of the carnivorous caterpillars in over 20 years of observing.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, set to become Germany's next chancellor, faces low personal popularity despite his CDU's election victory, with many Germans distrusting him due to his approach to the far-right AfD.

His decisions to cooperate with the AfD and agree to debt brake reform have alienated some voters. Ursula Münch suggests that the circumstances are different than they used to be, and that the new government has a relatively small proportion of support among voters.</p>

Despite some analysts rating Sanders higher than Ward, he was passed over by teams needing a potential franchise quarterback. The Jaguars traded up to select Hunter, aiming for him to become the first full-time, two-way player in the NFL in decades. The draft also featured Will Campbell, who was emotional about protecting his quarterback, and several other notable picks.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk secured a significant legal victory that largely prevents compounding pharmacies from marketing or selling unapproved versions of Wegovy and Ozempic. A federal judge rejected a bid by compounding pharmacies to continue making copies of these drugs, upholding the FDA's determination that semaglutide is no longer in shortage. This decision means the FDA can now take action against pharmacies making compounded versions of semaglutide, protecting Novo Nordisk's market and addressing concerns about the safety of unapproved compounded drugs.</p>
