          <p>President Trump is scheduled to give his first broadcast interview to ABC News to mark his 100th day in office for his second term, with Terry Moran conducting the interview in the Oval Office. The interview is set to air as a primetime special, covering various issues including immigration, tariffs, and the Russia-Ukraine war. Recent polls indicate that Trump's approval rating is low, with a majority of Americans believing the economy has worsened under his leadership and anticipating a recession. The interview will also likely address criticisms about his administration's expansion of executive power, with a significant portion of Americans believing he has overstepped his authority.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are pressing the White House to disclose financial transactions made by senior employees before President Trump's recent pause on tariffs, citing concerns about potential insider trading. Senators Schiff and Levin led a group of Democrats in sending a letter to the White House chief of staff, requesting a commitment from employees to transmit securities transaction reports to the Office of Government Ethics and make them public. The request follows Trump's rollback of tariffs, which caused the stock market to soar, and a Truth Social post suggesting it was a "great time to buy." The White House dismissed the concerns and suggested Schiff investigate Nancy Pelosi instead.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has stated that Canada will only engage in trade and security talks with the US under President Trump on terms that respect Canada's sovereignty. Carney emphasized that he would only visit Washington when there is a serious discussion to be had, dismissing Trump's repeated suggestions of making Canada the "51st state" of America. He acknowledged the importance of the US as a major market for Canadian businesses but stressed the need to diversify trading relationships with the EU and the UK. Carney highlighted his experience handling global economic crises as beneficial in dealing with Trump's tariff policies.</p>

          <p>The US military intervention against the Iran-backed Houthi militia in Yemen, dubbed "Operation Rough Rider," has become the costliest ongoing American military operation, surpassing $1 billion. Despite US strikes, the Houthis are fighting back with diversified arms supplies, including Iranian missile systems. While CENTCOM reports a decrease in Houthi missile and drone attacks, the Houthis have managed to fend off several US MQ-9 Reaper drones. The US maintains it will continue to increase pressure until freedom of navigation and American deterrence are restored in the region, while the Houthis assert their right to defend their sovereignty.</p>

          <p>The White House criticized Amazon for considering displaying the cost of President Trump's tariffs next to product prices, labeling it a "hostile and political act." Following the White House's reaction, Amazon clarified that the idea was only considered for its budget-focused Amazon Haul section and was never approved. The White House press secretary questioned why Amazon hadn't taken similar action during the Biden administration when inflation was high.

          <p>Starting May 7, Americans will be required to present a REAL ID-compliant identification card to board domestic flights, a measure aimed at closing security gaps that terrorists could exploit. The REAL ID Act, passed in 2005, has faced numerous delays in implementation due to concerns about privacy, data security, and costs. The law mandates that states verify the authenticity of key documents and use security features resistant to tampering.

While current tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles will continue, new measures will prevent additional levies, such as tariffs on steel and aluminum, from "stacking" on top. Tariffs on auto parts are still scheduled to take effect, but there will be an ability for some reimbursements, equal to a percentage of the value of a U.S.-made car for one to two years before phasing out.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a leadership consultant, introverts often communicate more effectively because they think more deeply, plan more intentionally, and choose their words more carefully. Key phrases introverts use include admitting when they don't know something, seeking others' perspectives, presenting substance without theatrics, pausing to dig deeper, and clarifying underlying tensions. These communication habits foster honesty, collaboration, thoughtfulness, and clarity, making introverts valuable contributors in the workplace. The expert suggests that introverts' discomfort in social situations pushes them to be more precise and impactful in their communication.</p>

          <p>General Motors reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings but is reassessing its 2025 financial guidance and suspending stock buybacks due to cost increases and industry uncertainty related to Trump's auto tariffs. The company cited the potential significant impact of tariffs, including 25% levies on imported vehicles, as the reason for the reassessment. GM CFO Paul Jacobson said the company is awaiting additional clarity on the economic and regulatory environments before providing updated guidance. The company expects to complete a $2 billion accelerated stock buyback program but has suspended any future purchases.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will travel to Michigan with President Trump, despite recent scrutiny over sharing sensitive military details in Signal chats. Hegseth has faced calls for his resignation after it was revealed he shared classified information with individuals outside the government. Trump has signaled his support for Hegseth, dismissing the public scrutiny and calls for his removal. Hegseth's presence on the trip is seen as a show of support from the president, who personally fought for his confirmation.</p>

The U.S. consul general attended a reception with Vietnamese officials, though the U.S. ambassador was not present. Critics welcomed the change but insisted it was not enough, citing a lack of understanding about postwar reconciliation. The U.S. and Vietnam have elevated their ties due to shared interests in countering China's influence, but Trump's policies have strained the relationship.</p>

          <p>The Vietnam War, which ended 50 years ago, fundamentally altered our perception of war, particularly regarding its long-term psychological and social consequences. The recognition and understanding of the long-term psychological and social consequences of war, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), emerged as a significant aspect. Overcoming trauma is not just an individual issue but also a societal one, involving rituals of remembrance, popular narratives, reconciliation, and social recognition of atrocities. While Vietnam celebrates the end of the war, the country is still dealing with trauma and reconciliation.</p>
