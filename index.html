          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held bilateral talks in Beijing, emphasizing their "unprecedented" and "strategic" relationship, which has "withstood the test of international changes." Xi is preparing to host China's largest-ever military parade, marking the 80th anniversary of Japan's World War Two surrender. The leaders criticized Western governments, with Xi denouncing "bullying" and Putin defending Russia's Ukraine offensive, as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un also arrived for the parade. This meeting underscores their close ties amid global geopolitical shifts and US tariffs.</p>

          <p>Guyana held its presidential election, with nearly 750,000 citizens voting to decide leadership amidst the nation's newfound oil wealth. The incumbent People's Progressive Party faces challenges from A Partnership for National Unity and We Invest In Nationhood, with results expected by Thursday. The winning party will manage significant annual oil revenues, yet a large portion of the population still lives in poverty, making the rising cost of living a key voter concern. The election also occurs against a backdrop of escalating territorial disputes with Venezuela over the oil-rich Essequibo region.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United sold star striker Alexander Isak to Liverpool for a British record £125 million, while acquiring Yoane Wissa from Brentford for £55 million and Nick Woltemade. This move, driven by financial sustainability rules and Isak's desire to leave, reshapes the club's attacking lineup. The transfer window proved challenging for Newcastle, with several targets going elsewhere, but the club focused on signing players eager to join. This significant sale provides financial flexibility, allowing for future reinvestment and a new chapter for the team.</p>

          <p>Scotland is projected to retain its status as Europe's drug death capital for the seventh consecutive year, with experts warning that any slight decrease in 2024 figures will likely be temporary. The arrival of deadly synthetic opioids, known as nitazenes, poses a new threat, exacerbating a crisis rooted in socio-economic changes, joblessness, and public spending cuts. The issue is further complicated by generational trauma and a contentious debate between harm reduction and rehabilitation approaches. Addressing this deep-seated problem requires significant and sustained intervention to prevent further escalation.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.3 billion for Wednesday's drawing, with a cash value of approximately $589 million, after no tickets matched the winning numbers on Monday. This marks the 41st drawing without a grand prize winner, making it the fifth-largest jackpot in Powerball's history and potentially the ninth largest across all U.S. lottery games. A single winner would have the choice between a lump-sum payment or 29 increasing annual payments. The next drawing offers another chance for participants to claim this life-changing sum, with tickets available across 45 states.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasizes "delivery" as his priority, acknowledging public impatience with the pace of change. He plans a Downing Street team shake-up and aims to contrast Labour's approach with Reform UK, which gained prominence over the summer. Starmer's government has suspended family reunion applications for refugees, framing it as a thoughtful step, while Reform advocates for more radical solutions like withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights. This political tussle highlights the ongoing debate about the government's strategy and the appeal of insurgent alternatives.</p>

          <p>British pubs are facing an unprecedented crisis, with an estimated 378 closures projected for 2025, leading to over 5,600 job losses. This decline is attributed to a combination of reduced consumer spending and escalating operational costs, including increases in minimum wage, National Insurance contributions, and business rates. Pub managers are forced to pass these costs onto consumers, driving up prices like the average pint of beer. Industry bodies are urging the government to implement urgent measures, such as cutting business rates and VAT, to prevent further damage to this vital cultural and economic sector.</p>

          <h2>UK Justice Secretary Gains Veto Power Over Sentencing Council Guidelines</h2>

          <p>The UK government is amending the law to grant the Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, explicit veto power over new sentencing guidelines issued by the independent Sentencing Council. This reform, part of the Sentencing Bill, aims to ensure that policy is set by parliamentarians accountable to the public. The move follows a dispute where ministers blocked guidance requiring judges to consider the background of minority offenders in pre-sentence reports, which critics called "differential treatment." The changes also include measures to address prison overcrowding.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump intensified his criticism of India's trade relationship with the U.S., labeling it a "totally one-sided disaster" following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the SCO summit in China. Trump reiterated that India buys significant oil and arms from Russia while imposing high tariffs on U.S. exports. This comes after the U.S. imposed 50% tariffs on India, partly for its Russian oil purchases. India has called these tariffs "unfair" and highlighted that other nations criticizing it also trade with Russia. The comments underscore souring U.S.-India relations.</p>

          <p>Chinese state broadcaster CCTV has hinted that an upcoming Victory Day parade in Beijing may showcase improved versions of its YJ-21 and DF-17 hypersonic missiles, featuring enhanced penetration capabilities. Military commentators suggest an air-launched variant of the YJ-21 could be launched from bombers outside enemy air defense zones, effectively destroying targets before returning. This development points to a versatile family of land-, sea-, and air-launched hypersonic missiles. While satellite imagery suggests ongoing development, China has not yet confirmed these missiles are in service.</p>
