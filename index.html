          <p>A 16-year-old from Essex, named Lincoln, has fully adopted a 1940s lifestyle, from his clothing and music choices to his 1939 bicycle. His passion for the era stems from a childhood interest in the World Wars and an appreciation for the period's sense of community and elegance. For the past two years, he has worked at an antiques shop and a 1940s-themed tea room, where he is adored by customers and his employer for his extensive knowledge and authentic attire. Supported by his family, Lincoln aims to one day own a home decorated entirely with period-appropriate items and appliances, driven by a belief in honoring the sacrifices of that generation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to public pressure, President Trump has instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the unsealing of grand jury testimony related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, a move Bondi confirmed her office is prepared to pursue. This directive follows a report by The Wall Street Journal about an alleged lewd birthday letter from Trump to Epstein in 2003, which the president has vehemently denied and threatened to sue over. The move also comes after the Justice Department's recent announcement that no "client list" was found, a statement that angered some of Trump's supporters who believe in a wider conspiracy.</p>

          <h2>Congress Approves $9 Billion in Funding Rescissions, Eliminating Federal Support for Public Media</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 00:17:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives has narrowly passed a bill to rescind $9 billion in government funding, which includes the complete elimination of $1.1 billion in federal support for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). This cut effectively defunds NPR and PBS, a move that NPR's CEO Katherine Maher described as an "irreversible loss" that will dismantle local civic institutions. The legislation also slashes approximately $7.9 billion in foreign aid programs. Despite concerns from some Republicans about the impact on rural communities that rely on public stations for emergency alerts, the package now heads to President Trump for his signature.

          <p>Following a late-night session, the House of Representatives narrowly passed a $9 billion spending cuts package, sending the legislation to President Trump's desk just before a critical deadline. The bill, which passed 216-213, rescinds $8 billion for the U.S. Agency for International Development and $1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The vote was delayed by Democrats who attempted to force a vote on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a move Republicans labeled as political maneuvering. House leadership hailed the passage as a victory for fiscal responsibility and a step toward controlling government spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has strongly condemned President Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, labeling the move "unacceptable blackmail." Trump has linked the tariffs to the ongoing legal case against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, demanding charges be dropped. Lula asserted that any attempt to interfere in Brazil's justice system is a grave attack on its sovereignty and called Brazilian politicians who support Trump's stance "traitors." The diplomatic dispute intensifies as Trump also posted a letter of support for Bolsonaro, highlighting a growing feud between the two leaders.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on turning 35 and the realization that adulthood does not come with a manual, concluding that most people are simply "winging it." Using the French comedy series "Bref" as a bookend to his own journey as an American immigrant in France, he explores themes of aging, regret, and the process of becoming. The author notes the stark contrast between his personally fulfilling life and a world facing immense political and environmental crises. He concludes that while he lacks definitive answers, he embraces the ongoing process of building a life, much like constructing with Lego bricks or writing a story.</p>

Having managed a riverside dock for years, he was always fascinated by boats but felt a desire to create something that could go underwater.

However, legal experts note that releasing grand jury testimony is highly unusual and faces significant legal hurdles under federal rules that mandate secrecy. Critics, like Rep.

The most significant drop was in the sub-index measuring government-market relations, indicating increased state intervention in the economy.

Despite this, inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months, and the "core-core" rate, which also excludes energy, edged higher.

          <p>This article questions the official narrative that CBS is ending "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" for purely financial reasons. The author argues that the decision fits a broader pattern of the network's parent company, Paramount Global, capitulating to President Trump, especially as it seeks federal approval for a merger with Skydance. The piece cites the recent $16 million settlement of Trump's lawsuit against CBS and the departure of the "60 Minutes" chief as evidence of the network sacrificing its journalistic and editorial independence. It suggests that removing Colbert, a prominent Trump critic, is another move to appease the administration, undermining CBS's historical legacy.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Trump, 79, was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after noting mild swelling in his lower legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described CVI as a common and benign vein condition where leg veins struggle to return blood to the heart. This official disclosure aims to address public speculation fueled by images of Trump with swollen legs and a bruised hand, the latter of which was attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use. The presidential physician affirmed that Trump "remains in excellent health," as health concerns for both Trump and his predecessor continue to be a focus.</p>

          <h2>California Sues Trump Administration Over Cancellation of High-Speed Rail Funds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 21:38:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The state of California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for its decision to cancel $4 billion in federal funding for the state's high-speed rail project. The lawsuit, filed by the state's attorney general, claims the administration's action was "arbitrary and capricious" and politically motivated by President Trump's "personal animus" toward the project. Governor Gavin Newsom called the move a "heartless attack on the Central Valley" that threatens local jobs. The funding withdrawal followed a federal review that found significant budget shortfalls and delays, concluding there was "no viable path" for the beleaguered project.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the unsealing of grand jury records from the Jeffrey Epstein case, a move she confirmed her office would pursue. This action follows a Wall Street Journal report about an alleged lewd letter from Trump to Epstein, which the president has denied and threatened to sue over. The administration has faced criticism from its own base after a Justice Department review found no evidence of a supposed "client list" or conspiracy in Epstein's death. Trump has attempted to reframe the controversy as a politically motivated hoax orchestrated by Democrats to damage him.</p>

          <p>A former senior intelligence officer from the Defense Intelligence Agency has described China's research into creating "supersoldiers" as a disturbing reality. Nicholas Eftimiades stated that China has been exploring gene-editing and other methods to modify human physiology and behavior to create physically and mentally superior individuals for combat. While other nations have explored similar concepts, he noted that it is particularly concerning that this research is being conducted under the direction of the People's Liberation Army. The lack of transparency about the program's progress and ultimate goals adds to the concern among U.S. intelligence and defense officials.</p>

          <p>Police in Madison, Wisconsin, are searching for a group of female suspects who allegedly assaulted a woman at a Raising Cane's restaurant. The incident occurred shortly after midnight on June 8, when the suspects reportedly began punching the victim as she exited the restroom, allegedly because she had taken too long. A second individual who attempted to intervene in the fight was also attacked. Both victims required hospitalization for their injuries. Authorities are seeking to identify and arrest the suspects on charges including substantial battery, battery, and disorderly conduct, and are asking the public for any information.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has continued his public criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom he appointed, even floating the idea of firing him in a private meeting. Trump's frustration stems from the Fed's decision to maintain relatively high interest rates to combat inflation, a policy he believes is harming the economy. The president has also targeted Powell over a renovation project at the Fed's headquarters. While the legality of firing a Fed chair is untested, any such attempt would likely cause significant financial market turmoil and undermine the central bank's traditional independence from political pressure.

The enforcement action, which resulted in 11 arrests, was condemned by Governor Newsom's office as "illegal racial profiling."

          <p>The FDA has officially authorized Juul Labs to keep its tobacco- and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes on the U.S. market, reversing a previous ban order from 2022.

The decision is a major milestone for Juul, which was widely blamed for fueling the teen vaping crisis and has faced years of legal and financial turmoil. Anti-tobacco advocates heavily criticized the move, arguing the product responsible for the public health crisis should not be authorized for sale.</p>

Luna sought to reassure the community that his deputies do not assist with ICE's street-level enforcement operations that have recently spread fear.

          <p>President Trump has announced that Coca-Cola agreed to produce its soda with cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup, a move he framed as a personal victory. While the company has not fully confirmed the details, the announcement appears to be a political tactic to score an easy win amid other controversies. The article argues that while some consumers prefer the taste of cane sugar Coke, the health difference between the two sweeteners is negligible, as both are major contributors to obesity and diabetes. The move is seen as symbolic rather than a substantive public health achievement, fitting a pattern of the administration focusing on superficial changes.</p>

The decision has sparked a significant backlash on Chinese social media, with many users questioning the university's right to police a student's personal life and labeling the action as misogynistic and nationalistic. The incident has been linked online to videos posted by a Ukrainian professional gamer showing him with an Asian woman in a hotel room.

This follows the recent immediate removal of the requirement for passengers to take off their shoes during security screening. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanners at airports, which provide more detailed 3D images of bag contents, enhancing security while potentially allowing for less restrictive rules.</p>

Co-founded in 2009 by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor herself, the game has raised nearly $5 million.
