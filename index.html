          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the suspect in the Idaho quadruple murder case, took a selfie wearing a black robe just days before his arrest. The article, citing NBC's "Dateline," also reveals Kohberger's cellphone browsing history, which included searches for pictures of female students at Washington State University and the University of Idaho. The timeline of the murders is detailed, outlining the events from the suspect's arrival at the house to the 911 call placed by a roommate hours later. Kohberger faces first-degree murder charges in the deaths of Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen, and Ethan Chapin, as well as a felony count of burglary.</p>

          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending habeas corpus for migrants, a constitutional right to challenge the legality of detention.

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University doctoral student from Turkey, was released from immigration detention after a federal judge ruled her detention could chill the speech of noncitizens. The judge, William K.

Ozturk's lawyers accused the government of detaining her in retaliation for speech protected by the First Amendment, citing public outrage over her treatment.

          <p>A Los Angeles judge has scheduled a hearing for May 13 and 14 to decide whether Lyle and Erik Menendez should be eligible for release after more than three decades in prison.

The hearing was repeatedly postponed, but will now take place, with family members and correctional officials expected to testify.

The states argue that the improper permitting process will cause irreparable harm to state resources and the people who rely on them.
