          <p>President Trump announced a preliminary trade agreement with the United Kingdom, highlighting increased market access for American exports, particularly in agriculture. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed the deal would boost trade and create jobs. While the final details are still being written, the agreement includes a 10% tariff on UK cars, reduced from 27.5%, and eliminates tariffs on steel and aluminum, setting a quota of 100,000 UK vehicles that can be imported to the US at a 10% tariff.

          <p>India reported that it destroyed an air-defense system in Lahore, Pakistan, alleging that it was responding to Pakistan's attempts to target military installations in India using drones and missiles. The Indian government claimed its forces neutralized the air-defense radar and systems at multiple locations in Pakistan. Pakistan's foreign ministry has denied launching attacks on Indian military installations, dismissing India's claims as baseless and irresponsible. The incident has fueled speculation about the origin of the military equipment, with some suggesting it was Chinese-made.</p>

          <p>Attorneys allege that Mikal Mahdi, an inmate executed by firing squad in South Carolina, experienced a prolonged and painful death due to errors in the execution process. A forensic pathologist hired by Mahdi's attorneys claims that only two bullets struck Mahdi, missing the heart, and he likely remained conscious for up to a minute after being shot. Witnesses reported hearing Mahdi cry out and groan after the shots were fired. The lawsuit challenges the firing squad's method as cruel and unusual punishment, citing discrepancies between Mahdi's autopsy and that of the previous firing squad execution.</p>

          <p>Josh Raffaelli, a former fund manager at Brookfield Asset Management, has filed a lawsuit against the company, alleging fraud and attempted bribery. The suit claims Brookfield mistreated investors and improperly limited investments in one of Elon Musk's companies. Raffaelli alleges that Brookfield backtracked on investment pledges and vetoed a major foreign investment in his funds, limiting potential upside for clients. Brookfield denies the allegations, calling the suit meritless and vowing a vigorous defense. Raffaelli was fired shortly after filing a whistle-blower complaint with the SEC.</p>

          <p>Columbia University's response to a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Butler Library marked a significant shift in the university's approach to campus protests. Unlike previous incidents, campus security intervened aggressively, leading to arrests before the New York police arrived. Acting President Claire Shipman praised the officers' efforts, stating that the demonstrators had crossed a line between legitimate protest and actions that endanger others. The university's actions satisfied critics who felt Columbia's management of past protests was inadequate, but disturbed those who believed unarmed demonstrators should not be met with force.</p>

          <p>Kaja Sokola testified in court about multiple instances of sexual assault by Harvey Weinstein, beginning when she was a 16-year-old model seeking stardom in New York City.

She stated that the incident that occurred when she was a minor is too old to be the subject of criminal charges, but the later incident is part of the criminal case against Mr. Weinstein being heard in a retrial that began last month.
