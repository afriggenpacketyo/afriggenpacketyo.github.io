          <p>Ben Rhodes argues that American politics is becoming increasingly corrupt, resembling authoritarian regimes where leaders prioritize personal gain over the public good. He points to Donald Trump's increased wealth and foreign money flowing into his businesses as examples. Rhodes draws parallels with Vladimir Putin's Russia and Viktor Orban's Hungary, where political power is used to enrich leaders and their associates. The author contends that the checks and balances in the American system are weakening, and ethical frameworks are eroding, leading to a dangerous fusion of political and personal interests.

          <p>The Youth Sport Trust (YST) reports a "troubling decline" in physical education (PE) hours in England's secondary schools, with nearly 4,000 PE hours lost in the last year alone. The organization highlights a loss of almost 45,000 PE hours since the London 2012 Olympics and a 7% decrease in the number of PE teachers. The YST is urging immediate action to protect and prioritize PE, while the government asserts its commitment to breaking down barriers to accessing PE and school sports for young people.

          <p>A new study suggests that microplastics from polylactic acid (PLA), a widely used biodegradable material, can enter the metabolic cycle of bacteria and cells in the gut after ingestion. Researchers in China and the United States found that these microplastics altered gut metabolism and damaged the gut barrier in mice. The study indicates that exposure to PLA microplastics could potentially contribute to conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes.

          <p>Italy is holding a national referendum to reduce the time required to apply for citizenship from 10 years to five, a move supported by civil society groups but opposed by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. The referendum aims to integrate long-term foreign residents who contribute to the country, but requires a 50% voter turnout to be valid. Meloni's government, focused on cutting illegal immigration, views the current citizenship law as already "excellent." The article explores the sensitive issue of Italian identity and the potential impact of the referendum.</p>
