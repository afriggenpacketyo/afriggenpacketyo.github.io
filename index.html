          <p>Researchers in China have identified 37 young "de novo" genes, which arise from non-coding DNA and are linked to uniquely human traits like advanced cognitive abilities. These genes, not inherited through traditional duplication, are described as "dormant bombs" in the study published in Cell Genomics. The team found that the expression of these genes was significantly higher in tumors, and that deleting some of them could inhibit the growth of cancer cells, suggesting a complex evolutionary trade-off between intelligence and disease susceptibility.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially implemented higher tariffs on goods from over 60 countries and the European Union, with rates ranging from 10% to over 20%. While the White House anticipates this will boost the U.S. economy and manufacturing, economists express concern over potential negative consequences. Early data since the initial tariff announcements in April suggest a slowdown in hiring, rising inflation, and a decline in home values, indicating potential self-inflicted damage to the American economy.

          <p>India and China are pushing back against U.S. threats of secondary sanctions over their continued purchases of discounted Russian oil, a critical revenue source for Moscow. Since 2022, India's Russian oil imports have surged nearly nineteen-fold, saving the country an estimated $33 billion. New U.S. tariffs and the threat of wider sanctions could force India to scale back these purchases, potentially causing a significant spike in global oil prices and stoking inflation worldwide as markets scramble to replace Russian supply.

          <p>The United States has enacted a new wave of tariffs on imports from more than 90 countries, a move that experts warn could lead to increased consumer prices. The tax rates vary significantly, with Brazil facing one of the highest at 50% on most of its goods, and India is scheduled to face a similar rate later in August. While negotiations have resulted in a temporary reprieve for Mexico and an ongoing delay for China, Canada is already subject to a 35% tariff on many products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's trade data for July showed surprisingly strong performance, with exports growing 7.2% year-over-year, surpassing economists' forecasts. Imports also saw their most significant increase in a year, rising 4.1%, which suggests a potential recovery in domestic demand. This economic boost comes as a temporary tariff truce with the United States approaches its expiration date, with analysts noting that businesses may be front-loading shipments ahead of potential new levies, raising questions about the sustainability of this growth.

In contrast, electric vehicles are among the least stolen, likely because they are often parked in secure garages for charging and possess advanced connectivity features that make them easier to track.</p>

          <p>Councils in inner London are expected to be the biggest losers under a government plan to rebalance local authority funding, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). The think tank predicts that boroughs like Camden and Westminster could see funding fall by up to 12% after inflation. The overhaul, set to begin in 2026, aims to redirect funds to more deprived areas and urban centers outside the capital, such as Nottingham and Wolverhampton, by updating formulas that have not been changed in over a decade.</p>

          <p>Conductor Gustavo Dudamel made a celebrated return to the Hollywood Bowl for a performance marking the 20th anniversary of his U.S. debut with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The program skillfully blended the music of Duke Ellington with jazzy compositions by Ravel, featuring pianist Seong-Jin Cho. The concert was described as a joyful homecoming, though it was tinged with a bittersweet note due to the upcoming cancellation of his Venezuelan orchestra's visit, which will also prevent Dudamel from returning for the remainder of the season.</p>

The report highlights cases like Amy, a young woman with complex PTSD who has seen a psychiatrist only once in a decade despite multiple crises. While the government acknowledges the problem and points to plans for community-based care, experts warn that long delays worsen outcomes and increase costs for the healthcare system.</p>
