          <p>President Donald Trump announced he will posthumously award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated during a campus event in Utah. Speaking at a 9/11 remembrance ceremony, Trump called Kirk a "giant of his generation" and a "champion of liberty." The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the nation's highest civilian honor, awarded for meritorious contributions to the country. This tribute comes as law enforcement continues its search for the suspected shooter, who remains at large.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has prompted widespread condemnation from prominent political figures across the ideological spectrum, including President Trump, former Presidents Biden and Obama, and numerous governors. In a rare display of unity, leaders denounced the act as a horrific example of political violence that has no place in the United States. However, this bipartisan sentiment was briefly fractured by a contentious argument on the House floor over how to properly observe his death. The event has ignited a national conversation about the dangers of escalating political rhetoric and its potential consequences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than 100 global media outlets are urging the U.S. government to abandon a Department of Homeland Security proposal that would drastically shorten visa durations for foreign journalists from five years to just 240 days. In a joint statement, the organizations argued the change would disrupt international news coverage of American affairs, risking a vacuum that could be filled by narratives from rival nations. The move is viewed as part of a broader Trump administration effort to tighten immigration regulations and could undermine America's global standing on press freedom.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details how Charlie Kirk, through his organization Turning Point USA, became a pivotal force in conservative politics, particularly in mobilizing the youth vote for Donald Trump's 2024 election victory. It highlights his group's multi-million dollar get-out-the-vote efforts and the "Chase the Vote" initiative, which were instrumental in key battleground states. Kirk was credited not only with boosting turnout among young voters but also with helping to staff the new Trump-Vance administration. His work is recognized by both allies and opponents as having significantly shaped the modern conservative movement.</p>

          <p>The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits saw a significant jump, reaching 263,000 last week, the highest level recorded since October 2021. This sharp increase is interpreted by economists as one of the clearest signals to date that layoffs are rising and the U.S. labor market is cooling down. The data strengthens widespread expectations that the Federal Reserve will proceed with an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting to support the weakening job market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NATO is reinforcing its eastern flank with additional troops, artillery, and air defense systems after several Russian drones were shot down over Poland in what was called an unprecedented incursion. In response, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic are sending support to Poland, while Germany is deploying a brigade to Lithuania. The incident, which Poland's president deemed a deliberate Russian provocation, has significantly heightened regional tensions ahead of joint Russian-Belarusian military exercises.</p>

          <h2>Sniper's Analysis Suggests Charlie Kirk's Assassin Was an Inexperienced Marksman</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An elite military sniper, Sergeant Nicholas Ranstad, analyzed the assassination of Charlie Kirk, concluding the weapon was a high-powered rifle, not an AR-15. He suggests the shooter was likely an amateur, citing a critical error in aiming for the head but hitting the neck, possibly due to nerves and a failure to properly account for wind and firing angle. Ranstad described the shooter as an "internet shooter" with range practice but without the discipline of a trained soldier, providing technical insights into the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>Peter Mandelson has been dismissed from his high-profile role as the UK's ambassador to the United States following new revelations about the extent of his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Lord Mandelson was appointed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer specifically to build ties with the incoming Trump administration. This marks another dramatic downfall in his turbulent political career, which has been characterized by multiple resignations from powerful government positions over several decades.</p>

          <p>The Thai government has lifted a decades-long ban, granting approximately 80,000 long-term refugees from Myanmar residing in border camps the legal right to work in the country. This significant policy shift comes as crucial U.S. humanitarian aid for the camps has been cut off, creating a severe food crisis. The move is viewed by aid groups as a pragmatic and rights-based solution that allows refugees to become self-sufficient while also potentially helping to fill labor shortages in Thailand's economy.</p>

          <p>A new Goldman Sachs survey reveals that investment firms for the ultra-wealthy have increased their average allocation to public stocks to 31%, while concurrently reducing their investment in private equity from 26% to 21%.

The report also notes that investing in public equities and ETFs is the preferred method for these family offices to gain exposure to the artificial intelligence boom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This analysis explores Prime Minister Keir Starmer's decision-making process in appointing Peter Mandelson as U.S. ambassador, despite being aware of his controversial friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. The calculation was that Mandelson's exceptional networking skills and political acumen, particularly with the Trump administration, outweighed the significant political risks. However, the eventual release of detailed correspondence between the two forced Starmer to dismiss him, raising serious questions about the prime minister's initial judgment and risk assessment.</p>
