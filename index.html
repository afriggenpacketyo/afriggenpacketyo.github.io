          <p>Egg freezing is rapidly gaining popularity as a way for women to preserve fertility, shifting from a niche medical procedure to a mainstream option. The process involves hormone injections and a surgical retrieval, costing an average of $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, plus storage and future IVF fees. While celebrated as empowering, experts caution that it is not a guarantee of future motherhood, with success rates varying based on age and the number of eggs frozen. The article explores the emotional, financial, and ethical dimensions of the technology, which some bioethicists argue masks larger societal issues that pressure women to delay childbirth.</p>

He predicts AI will accelerate drug discovery to the point of curing all diseases and could eliminate scarcity, leading to an era of "radical abundance." The article showcases advances like the AI assistant Astra and the world-building model Genie 2, which can create interactive 3D environments from images. While optimistic, Hassabis also acknowledges the significant risks, including misuse by bad actors and the challenge of ensuring advanced AI systems remain aligned with human values.</p>

          <p>A vessel carrying approximately 154 Ethiopian migrants sank off the coast of Yemen, resulting in a significant loss of life. The UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that at least 68 people have died, with another 74 remaining missing and presumed dead. Despite a decade-long civil war, Yemen remains a critical transit route for migrants from the Horn of Africa seeking opportunities in wealthier Gulf nations. The IOM describes this route as one of the world's most dangerous, with migrants facing extreme perils from both the journey and the ongoing conflict in the region.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic political maneuver, Democratic state legislators have left Texas to prevent a vote on a new congressional map designed by Republicans. By fleeing the state, they deny the legislature the two-thirds quorum required to conduct business, effectively halting the special session called by Governor Greg Abbott. Democrats argue the proposed map is a partisan gerrymander intended to unfairly secure the GOP's majority in the U.S. House, while Republicans criticize the move as an abdication of duty. This action echoes previous quorum breaks in Texas politics, highlighting the intense and bitter partisan divide over voting rights and representation.</p>

          <p>A small earthquake with a magnitude of 3.0 was reported in the New York City metropolitan area, with its epicenter located near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. The U.S. Geological Survey confirmed the minor quake, which caused brief shaking and startled residents but resulted in no reports of significant damage or injuries. While earthquakes are uncommon on the East Coast, this event follows a more notable 4.8 magnitude quake that occurred in the same region in April 2024. Officials and seismologists reassured the public that a quake of this size is not considered a major threat.</p>

          <p>Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs has cautioned that persistent U.S. sabre-rattling against China could become a self-fulfilling prophecy leading to military conflict. He argues that the U.S. initiated the trade war and must now show prudence, as both nations possess economic leverage over the other. Sachs suggests that while a fragile truce may hold, long-term harmony is unlikely, and China should focus on expanding exports to markets outside of the U.S. and Europe. He views the ongoing friction as a significant risk to global stability and economic progress, urging a more rational approach to diplomacy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over 3,200 unionized Boeing workers in the St. Louis area, who assemble fighter jets and other defense systems, have voted to go on strike after rejecting the company's latest contract offer. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) stated the offer was insufficient, despite Boeing reporting it included a 40% average wage growth. The company expressed disappointment and confirmed it has implemented a contingency plan to continue supporting customers with its non-striking workforce. This marks the first strike at the critical defense hub since 1996, creating a new labor challenge for the aerospace giant.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has emerged as a leader in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity last year than traditional powerhouse California. This growth is driven primarily by utilities like Florida Power & Light, which are capitalizing on favorable economics and streamlined regulations for projects under 75 megawatts. However, the boom faces headwinds from new federal policies rolling back tax credits, which is expected to cause a sharp decline in rooftop solar installations. Despite policy uncertainty, the low cost of solar compared to natural gas continues to make it an attractive option for large-scale energy production. (not investment advice)</p>
