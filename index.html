          <p>The White House has detailed a proposed deal to prevent a US ban on TikTok, placing the app's American operations under a new US-based joint venture. This new entity will have a majority of American investors and board members, with software company Oracle serving as the security provider to monitor the platform and its algorithm. A senior official expressed confidence that China has approved the framework, which aims to address national security concerns by bringing the app's powerful recommendation algorithm and user data under US control. The president is expected to sign an executive order extending the ban's enforcement pause to finalize the deal.</p>

          <p>A 59-year-old man, Robert DeCesare, was killed and two others were injured in a shooting at a wedding in Nashua, New Hampshire. The suspect, a 23-year-old former employee of the venue, was quickly apprehended and faces a second-degree murder charge. While witnesses reported the shooter made statements like "free Palestine," authorities currently believe the motive was to create chaos rather than being hate-based. DeCesare's family described him as a beloved husband and father, and the club's owner hailed him as a hero for his actions during the attack.</p>

          <p>Anheuser-Busch's Michelob Ultra has surpassed Modelo Especial to become the best-selling beer in the United States, according to recent retail and restaurant sales data. This shift marks a significant turnaround for AB InBev, whose Bud Light brand lost the top spot two years ago following a controversial marketing partnership. Modelo's decline is attributed to several challenges facing its parent company, Constellation Brands, including tariffs and reduced spending from its core Hispanic consumer base. The change in market leadership is reflected in the companies' stock performance, with AB InBev's shares rising while Constellation's have fallen significantly this year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expected to announce a purported link between acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, and an increased risk of autism in children, but the claim is facing strong opposition from medical experts and the drug's manufacturer. Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, stated that sound science shows no causal link and warned that discouraging its use could lead pregnant women to use riskier alternatives for treating conditions like fever. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other medical professionals have affirmed that acetaminophen is considered the safest pain relief option during pregnancy, citing large-scale studies that found no increased risk.</p>

          <p>A memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was shot and killed, drew nearly 100,000 people in Arizona, functioning as both a religious event and a political rally for the MAGA movement. While Kirk's widow, Erika, delivered a widely praised speech on forgiveness, political figures like Donald Trump and Stephen Miller used the stage to deliver defiant and aggressive messages against their opponents. The event showcased a blend of Christian nationalism and political mobilization, which appeared to galvanize Republicans.

          <p>Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, has been removed as a patron or ambassador by six charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust and the British Heart Foundation. The decisions came after a 2011 email surfaced in which she referred to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend," seemingly apologizing for her prior public criticism of him. A spokesperson for the duchess claimed the email was sent under duress to fend off a defamation lawsuit threat from Epstein. This development follows years of scrutiny over the royal family's connections to Epstein, which previously led to Prince Andrew stepping down from public duties.</p>

He acknowledged Reform's rise in opinion polls and stated his party must actively challenge Farage on issues like immigration and the cost of living.

          <h2>New Federal Reserve Governor Argues for Aggressive Interest Rate Cuts</h2>

          <p>In his first major address, newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran made a strong case for significant cuts to the central bank's benchmark interest rate. Miran argued that current monetary policy is overly restrictive and risks harming employment, suggesting the rate should be nearly two percentage points lower. He cited disinflationary pressures from the administration's policies on taxes, immigration, and deregulation as factors that allow for more aggressive easing. His stance is in stark contrast to the consensus on the Federal Open Market Committee, where he was the sole dissenter in a recent vote, advocating for a larger rate cut.</p>

          <p>Meta's new AI-powered smart glasses are being adopted by members of the blind and visually impaired community as a tool to enhance their daily independence. The glasses can connect to apps like "Be My Eyes," which links users with volunteers for real-time assistance, and use optical character recognition to read text aloud from menus, signs, and mail. While users and advocates like the National Federation of the Blind praise the technology as a useful step forward, they also note it is a work in progress with limitations, such as battery life. The article highlights that while the glasses are a valuable aid, they do not replace the need for fundamental skills.</p>

          <p>A raid on a militant compound in Pakistan's northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province has resulted in the deaths of over 20 people, including at least 10 civilians. According to a local police officer, the raid targeted a location where the Pakistani Taliban allegedly stored bomb-making materials, which may have contributed to a large explosion that destroyed nearby homes. The incident has sparked a protest of around 2,000 people and drawn condemnation from local politicians, who described the operation as an attack on unarmed civilians. Neither the Pakistani government nor its military has officially claimed responsibility for conducting the raid.</p>

          <p>While the national median household income remained relatively flat, seven of the 50 largest cities in the U.S. experienced a decline between 2023 and 2024, according to a new analysis of Census Bureau data. Minneapolis saw the largest drop at just over 4%, with its median household income falling to $77,732. Other cities that saw declines include Denver, Seattle, and Austin, though their median incomes remain above the national average. An analyst suggests that big cities can be more prone to income volatility due to dynamic economic factors and demographic shifts, such as changes in household structure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut, average 30-year fixed mortgage rates have fallen to a nearly three-year low of 6.13%. For a borrower with a $1 million mortgage, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $6,079, which is about $600 less per month compared to the 7.04% average rate seen in January. Over the 30-year term of the loan, this lower rate could save a homeowner more than $200,000 in total interest costs. The rate drop also makes refinancing more attractive for existing homeowners looking to reduce their monthly payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pfizer has announced it will acquire Metsera, a biotech company specializing in weight loss drugs, in a deal valued at up to $7.3 billion. This strategic move aims to bolster Pfizer's position in the rapidly growing obesity drug market after it faced setbacks with its own drug candidates. Metsera brings a promising pipeline of oral and injectable treatments, including a GLP-1 drug that showed significant weight loss in early trials and is being developed as a once-monthly injection. The acquisition is seen by analysts as a way for Pfizer to accelerate its entry into a market that could be worth $100 billion by the 2030s.</p>

Key drivers include supply and demand dynamics, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and changes in central bank interest rates.

          <p>According to an analyst from a government-sponsored Chinese think tank, Beijing may consider land reclamation to build an artificial island at the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. Wu Shicun of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies stated that such a move would serve to strengthen China's assertion of sovereignty and administrative control over the strategically important area. The analyst also noted that Beijing's recent declaration of a nature reserve at the shoal is a tactic to limit the presence of Philippine vessels. This would reduce the cost and logistical burden of maintaining a constant law enforcement presence.</p>
