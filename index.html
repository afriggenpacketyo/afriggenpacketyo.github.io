          <p>China's Civil Aviation Administration has activated the W121 flight path, a new route in the Taiwan Strait that runs close to the unofficial median line. The move was made without consulting Taipei, with Beijing stating it is a technical adjustment to ease air traffic and improve safety. This action has raised alarms in Taiwan, which views it as a potential security risk and a unilateral change to the status quo in the sensitive region.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI has concluded that Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide and that investigators found no evidence of a so-called "client list" or proof that he blackmailed prominent individuals. The memo detailing the findings aims to dispel long-standing conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's death and his connections. Officials stated that while Epstein harmed over 1,000 victims, perpetuating unfounded theories does not serve justice, and no further disclosures are warranted.</p>

          <p>Dr. Kevin O’Connor, who served as President Joe Biden's physician, has requested to delay his testimony before a House committee investigating Biden's health while in office. His lawyer cited the need to protect doctor-patient confidentiality, arguing the committee has not accommodated their objections regarding privileged information. The House Oversight Committee is investigating Biden's mental fitness, and this conflict represents a broader struggle over the scope of the Republican-led inquiry and medical privacy principles.</p>

          <p>The government of El Salvador has told a United Nations working group that the United States holds legal responsibility for over 200 migrants sent to its CECOT mega-prison. This contradicts the Trump administration's claim that it cannot return the migrants because they are under Salvadoran authority. The migrants, mostly Venezuelans accused of being gang members, were deported under the Alien Enemies Act as part of a deal where the U.S. paid El Salvador to house the detainees, creating a complex international legal and jurisdictional dispute.</p>

          <p>While marking the six-month anniversary of major Southern California wildfires, Governor Gavin Newsom called for $40 billion in federal recovery aid that has stalled in the U.S. House. He simultaneously offered a blistering critique of the Trump administration's recent immigration raids in Los Angeles's MacArthur Park, calling them a "disgrace" and proof of a "polluted heart." The situation highlights Newsom's conflicting position of needing bipartisan support for disaster funds while sharply condemning the federal government's actions on other fronts.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats have tabled an amendment to the UK's Football Governance Bill that would require at least 10 Premier League matches per season to be broadcast on free-to-air television. The proposal aims to tear down the "expensive paywall" for the country's top football league, making it more accessible to the general public. The amendment, which also includes several key playoff finals, seeks to establish a new independent regulator with the power to enforce this requirement, though the government has previously indicated it does not plan to intervene.</p>

          <p>As part of its national strategy to counter trade pressures and reshape its economy, China is focusing on developing its interior provinces, such as Guizhou, historically one of its poorest. Provincial leaders are aligning with the "strategic hinterland strategy," introduced in late 2023, which aims to leverage the comparative advantages of these inland areas. This initiative is a key component of China's new five-year development plan, intended to bolster economic resilience and strategic depth amid ongoing global trade disputes.

An amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will void any confidentiality clauses that seek to prevent workers from speaking out about such allegations. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated it was time to "stamp this practice out," a move praised by campaigners who have long argued that NDAs are used to cover up criminality and abuse of power.</p>
