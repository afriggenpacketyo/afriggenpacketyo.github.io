          <p>Patrick Crusius, the gunman responsible for the 2019 El Paso Walmart shooting that killed 23 people, will avoid the death penalty.  A plea deal was reached due to the majority of victims' families desiring closure, resulting in a life sentence without parole.  This decision comes despite some survivors and family members expressing their disapproval.</p>
