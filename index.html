          <p>A federal judge in Colorado temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, who is accused of attacking demonstrators in Boulder. The judge, citing potential irreparable harm, issued the order after the family was taken into custody by ICE. Soliman's family, Egyptian citizens, entered the U.S. in 2022 and sought asylum. Lawyers for the family argued that punishing individuals for the crimes of relatives violates democratic justice principles, referencing the right to file habeas petitions under the U.S. Constitution. The judge scheduled a hearing for June 13. </p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested the FDA Commissioner Marty Makary to review the latest data on mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill. The FDA confirmed the review but did not specify the scope or start date. Concerns about the drug's safety have been raised, fueled by a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center. Experts, however, argue that these concerns are misguided, as instances described as "adverse events" are questionable. The Supreme Court previously rejected a challenge to the availability of mifepristone in 2024. </p>
