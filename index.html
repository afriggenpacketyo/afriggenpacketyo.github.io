          <p>The Vatican has announced that Carlo Acutis, who died at age 15 in 2006 from leukemia, will be canonized as the first millennial saint on September 7. Acutis was known for his devotion to the Church and community, teaching Catholicism and volunteering to help the homeless. He also used his computer skills to create a website documenting over 100 eucharistic miracles recognized by the Church. His canonization follows recognition of two miracles attributed to his intercession, including the healing of his mother and a Costa Rican woman with a serious brain injury, solidifying his place in Catholic history.</p>

          <p>Barry J. Brock, a former OB/GYN at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, has surrendered his medical license following accusations of negligent care and sexual abuse. The Medical Board of California filed an accusation against Brock regarding a former patient's treatment, leading to the surrender agreement which bars him from practicing medicine in California for life. At least 176 women have filed lawsuits alleging that Cedars-Sinai and other facilities concealed Brock's misconduct, which included inappropriate touching and medically unjustifiable procedures.

While some view these flags as an affront, others argue they represent solidarity with immigrants and pride in heritage for Americans with roots in those countries. Satirist Lalo Alcaraz notes that the flag-wavers are often younger-generation American citizens supporting their immigrant parents. This contrasts with 2006 protests where organizers encouraged waving American flags, reflecting a shift in how communities express their identity and resistance to perceived persecution.</p>

The preliminary injunction prevents the government from deporting Khalil due to Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that his presence compromises U.S. foreign policy interests. The judge found that Khalil's career and reputation are being damaged, and his speech is being chilled. The administration may still attempt deportation on other grounds, but the ruling is a blow to their efforts to remove pro-Palestinian campus activists.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges in Tennessee, after being brought back from detention in El Salvador. Federal prosecutors allege he transported undocumented migrants, including minors, within the U.S. as part of a conspiracy. The judge heard arguments over whether to hold a pre-trial detention hearing to determine if Abrego Garcia should remain in custody. The case involves a 2022 traffic stop and scrutiny of Abrego Garcia's alleged ties to MS-13, which his attorneys deny, arguing that the government's motion for detention is without merit.</p>

Iran's response, including missile barrages, highlights its ability to strike back, but the effectiveness of its capabilities and the involvement of its proxies are unclear.

          <p>Following Israel's strikes against Iran, questions arise about the potential for U.S. involvement in the conflict. While President Trump initially opposed the Israeli operation, he has since expressed support and associated himself with its success. The extent of U.S. involvement could escalate depending on Iran's response and Israel's needs for military assistance. The conflict's trajectory will depend on Iran's retaliation, the potential for attacks on American forces, and Trump's evolving stance toward the situation.</p>
