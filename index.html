          <h2>Experts Analyze Demographics of 'No Kings' Protests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 16:00:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to experts, the "No Kings" protests in Washington, D.C., were primarily attended by educated White women in their 40s, who organized via social media. Psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert suggests these protests serve as a form of group therapy, providing a sense of community and validation for shared grievances. However, Alpert cautions that this catharsis can mask personal unhappiness and project anger onto others, and he added that some participants inaccurately equate the movement with the Civil Rights movement, distorting their perspective. The rallies also featured individuals in inflatable costumes, a tactic intended to draw attention without inciting violence, which began in Portland during protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations. The article highlights the blurring lines between emotional expression and civic engagement in contemporary activism. Optimism score is not directly related to the article's content.</p>

          <p>Catherine Connolly has been elected as the 10th president of Ireland, securing a landslide victory and becoming the first president to secure over 900,000 votes. Connolly, an independent backed by left-wing parties, pledged to be an inclusive president who listens and reflects, advocating for peace, neutrality, and action on climate change. The election saw an unprecedented number of spoiled votes and a turnout of 46%, as Humphreys conceded defeat. Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Simon Harris congratulated Connolly, while Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald hailed it as a victory for the combined opposition, as Connolly will be inaugurated on November 11, succeeding Michael D. Higgins. The article details the political landscape of Ireland during the election.</p>

          <p>June Lockhart, known for her iconic roles as a mother on television shows such as “Lassie” and “Lost in Space,” passed away at the age of 100. Lockhart's career spanned decades, during which she happily played supportive roles to children, animals, and robots. She also worked as an unofficial member of the White House press corps, attending briefings and traveling with presidents. The article highlights her ability to adapt to different roles, and her lasting impact on television, as Lockhart's career included roles on “Full House,” “Las Vegas,” and “Grey’s Anatomy,” and is survived by her daughters and grandchildren, and the family requests donations to the Actors Fund, ProPublica, and International Hearing Dog Inc.</p>

          <p>Timothy Mellon, an heir to a Gilded Age banking family, has been identified as the anonymous donor who contributed $130 million to support U.S. military troops during the government shutdown. The donation, revealed by President Trump, aims to cover salaries and benefits but may violate the Antideficiency Act, as it is equivalent to roughly $100 per service member. Mellon is a longtime Trump donor, and is known for contributing significant sums to conservative causes, as the article notes concerns raised by Senator Chris Coons regarding anonymous donations funding government spending.

          <p>UCLA's football team suffered a significant setback, losing 56-6 to Indiana in a game marked by missed tackles, penalties, and an ineffective offense. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava struggled, facing constant pressure and throwing an early interception that was returned for a touchdown. The Bruins, who had previously shown signs of improvement, regressed to their early-season form, failing to establish a running game and allowing three sacks. Indiana dominated on both sides of the ball, as the Hoosiers secured a decisive victory, leaving UCLA with a 3-5 overall record and the Bruins offense averaged only 3.8 yards per play, highlighting their struggles.</p>

          <p>Negotiators from China and the U.S. have initiated a new round of trade discussions in Malaysia, preceding a highly anticipated meeting between President Trump and President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea. Trump expressed his hope for a productive meeting with Xi and expects China to negotiate a deal to avoid additional tariffs, while Beijing recently implemented tighter export controls on rare earths and other critical minerals. Trump also stated his openness to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, potentially their first meeting since 2019, though Kim has stated that he would only be open to meeting with Trump if Washington recognizes the country as a nuclear state. Seoul's reunification minister believes there is a considerable chance that Trump and Kim will meet.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approval rating among Hispanic adults has significantly declined since the beginning of his second term, according to a new poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The survey indicates a drop in favorability from 44% to 25% among Hispanic adults, accompanied by increased pessimism about the nation's direction. Hispanic adults also expressed less confidence in Trump’s handling of the economy and immigration, and negative perceptions of Trump have grown among younger Hispanics and men. Immigration remains a top personal concern for Hispanic adults, with only about one-quarter supporting the deportation of all immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An X post is circulating with a bar graph purporting to show the UK as having the highest rate of sexual assault in Europe, but this claim is misleading due to differences in legal definitions, reporting practices, and cultural factors. The UK's high rate is more reflective of its reporting practices and legal definitions than actual prevalence, and some countries have very narrow legal definitions requiring proof of physical attack, threat, or coercion. Criminologists recommend victim surveys, which ask representative samples of people about their experiences, as a better way to measure sexual assault rates. The claim that uncontrolled mass immigration is driving the higher rates of sexual assault is false, and there is no evidence to suggest that that's the case at all.</p>

Economists suggest that the low-fire, low-hire labor market may persist in the near term, and there were 7.4 million people unemployed in August, but only 7.2 million job openings were available.

          <p>The "VOO and chill" investment strategy, which involves passively investing in ETFs tied to market indexes, may be losing its appeal as investors seek greater diversification. Tidal Financial Group's Gavin Filmore notes that many clients are no longer satisfied with simply buying the index in an ETF, such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, and Strategas Securities' Todd Sohn contends that the S&P 500 is becoming increasingly imbalanced, with technology stocks dominating the index. Investors are showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, and the Russell 2000 has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past six months. Major tech companies are due to report earnings next week.</p>

          <p>Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and major financial backer of Donald Trump, has been identified as the anonymous donor who gave $130 million to help pay U.S. troops during the federal shutdown. Trump described the donor as a "friend" and "great American" but refused to name him, and the Pentagon confirmed the donation was accepted under the "general gift acceptance authority." The donation, equating to about $100 per service member, may violate the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending funds in advance or in excess of congressional appropriations. Mellon has donated significant sums to support Trump and other Republican candidates, as the article notes ethical concerns raised by accepting anonymous donations.</p>

          <p>The ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur will address regional economic integration, the environment, and digital developments, but is overshadowed by growing tensions between the US and China. President Trump's attendance is expected, primarily to witness a peace settlement between Thailand and Cambodia, which highlights US influence in the region. The geopolitical competition between the two superpowers involves Taiwan and the South China Sea, and trade tensions are exacerbating the rivalry, putting ASEAN countries in a difficult position. ASEAN countries are trying to avoid being forced into a choice between the two superpowers, but many politicians are dismayed by Trump's tariff policies and China's aggressiveness in the region.</p>

          <p>The European Union is actively working to reduce its reliance on rare earth elements from China, according to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. China is the top producer and exporter of rare earths, vital for various technologies, and has recently imposed new license requirements and curbs on exports. The EU says the curbs are forcing some of the bloc's companies to suspend production and are inflicting significant economic damage, and von der Leyen said the EU was still trying to find solutions with China in the "short term," but she warned that the bloc was "ready to use all the instruments in our toolbox to respond if needed." The EU plans to secure alternative sources, promote recycling, and establish partnerships with countries that produce critical raw materials.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban suggests that buying consumables in bulk is a smarter financial move for the average person than trying to pick the right stock. Cuban argues that saving 40% on household items like toothpaste and toilet paper can result in significant savings over a year, he suggests people use credit cards for purchases they can't pay off immediately. He emphasizes the importance of practical money management over flashy investments, as the article highlights Cuban's logic rooted in what actually works, not what sounds good, and he has been open in the past about how getting his own card cut up was one of the toughest lessons he ever learned.</p>

          <p>Christopher Moynihan, a pardoned Capitol rioter, has been arrested for allegedly threatening to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at an event in New York City. Moynihan allegedly sent text messages stating his intent to "eliminate" Jeffries, and he faces a felony charge of making a terroristic threat. Jeffries noted that Moynihan had been pardoned by President Trump, and the alleged threat is part of a growing wave of threats against legislators. Moynihan was previously convicted of obstructing an official proceeding for his role in the January 6th Capitol riot, and his arrest highlights concerns about recidivism among pardoned rioters.</p>

          <p>California's Proposition 50, which proposes redrawing congressional district lines, may prevail due to strong anti-Trump sentiment among California voters. The measure aims to counterbalance Republican gerrymandering efforts in other states, and Democrats are framing it as an opportunity to "screw Trump". Polls suggest rising support for the measure, with many voters motivated by their opposition to Trump, as the "yes" side has significantly outraised the "no" side, and even Arnold Schwarzenegger's opposition has proven ineffective. The article examines how political polarization influences ballot initiatives.</p>

          <p>A commentary in a key Communist Party publication suggests that digital currency is emerging as a powerful tool in global geopolitics, potentially reshaping the financial battlefield. The article notes that cryptocurrencies, including those issued by central banks and private sector entities like Bitcoin, offer fast, secure, and anonymous transaction features. The author highlights the US National Defence Authorisation Act, which authorized a Pentagon initiative known as the Defence Blockchain Internal Testing Programme, which meant that digital currencies could become a “significant strategic tool for future financial defence”. The article explores the potential for digital currencies to be used for military applications and to circumvent sanctions.</p>
