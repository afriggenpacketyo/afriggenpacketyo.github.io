          <p>An Argentine court declared a mistrial in the homicide case against Diego Maradona's medical team after a judge recused herself due to ethical conflicts. Judge Julieta Makintach's appearance in a television documentary about the case raised concerns among prosecutors about a tainted trial. Maradona's death in November 2020 at the age of 60 shocked the nation and led to the legal proceedings against his medical team, but now the case faces further delays and uncertainty due to the mistrial declaration. The prosecutors argued that the situation created a conflict that tainted the trial.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter earnings revealed strong sales growth, particularly in its data center division driven by demand for GPUs in AI software. However, U.S. export controls are hindering Nvidia's potential in China, a $50 billion market. Despite these challenges, cloud providers remain crucial customers, comprising about half of Nvidia's data center revenue. CEO Jensen Huang emphasizes the surging demand for AI inference, where Nvidia's GPUs serve AI models to millions of customers; Blackwell chips are designed for this purpose, promising substantial growth in reasoning AI.

          <p>The Trump administration, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, announced plans to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students at U.S. universities. This move escalates the administration's dispute with Harvard University, following earlier actions to terminate the school's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification. The administration alleges Harvard is fostering an unsafe environment hostile to Jewish students and promoting pro-Hamas sympathies, while also employing racist diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. These actions are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to exert pressure on universities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court to pause a federal court ruling that blocked many of President Trump's tariffs. This action follows a strong rebuke from top aides who criticized the judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade for striking down his tariffs. The administration claims the ruling undermines national security and economic interests, arguing that the trade court's interpretation of presidential tariff authority is dangerously flawed. The ruling invalidated numerous country-specific tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released a final report revealing that a failed Alaska Airlines landing gear, which caused passengers to scream during landing, was due to incorrect maintenance work. The incident occurred when the left main landing gear collapsed upon hard touchdown in Santa Ana, California, during Tropical Storm Hilary. Investigators found a fatigue crack in a metal trunnion pin caused by excessive grinding during a 2018 maintenance overhaul. The report emphasized that even mild heat exposure from grinding can lead to cracking and subsequent failure of landing gear components.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is giving Harvard University 30 days to challenge the revocation of its certification to enroll international students. This follows an earlier announcement by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to terminate Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification due to alleged non-compliance and an unsafe campus environment. A U.S. District Judge plans to issue a preliminary injunction prohibiting the administration from immediately revoking Harvard's SEVP certification. Harvard alleges that the revocation violates its First Amendment rights and is retaliatory for rejecting government demands to control its governance and curriculum.</p>

Unlike typical pulsars, this star also sends out X-rays, puzzling researchers about its nature.

The article highlights the moral imperative of lab-grown meat as a means of eliminating torture from the food system and addresses concerns about potential bans on traditional meat. The author ultimately contends that these fears are misguided, as lab-grown meat would only displace farmed meat if it becomes superior in both taste and cost.</p>
