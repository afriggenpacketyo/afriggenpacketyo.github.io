            <p>A helicopter crash in the Hudson River near Lower Manhattan resulted in the deaths of six people, including a family of Spanish tourists and the pilot. The chopper, operated by New York Helicopter Tours, went down shortly after departing from the Wall Street Heliport. Video footage indicates that the helicopter may have been missing a tail rotor or main rotor blade before it crashed. Investigations are underway by the FAA and NTSB to determine the cause of the accident, and local officials are raising concerns about air traffic safety over the Hudson River.

            <p>China announced it is raising tariffs on U.S. goods to 125% in response to escalating trade tensions with the United States. The Chinese Commerce Ministry criticized the U.S.'s tariff policies as a violation of international trade rules and basic economic principles, stating that rising U.S. tariffs are a "joke" and that they would not respond to future U.S. tariff hikes. The move has caused concerns about recession risks, with analysts suggesting that China's retaliatory actions indicate a lack of willingness to negotiate a settlement. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Lando Norris of McLaren set the fastest time in the first practice session at the Bahrain Grand Prix. The session was largely unrepresentative due to daylight conditions and high temperatures, which differ from the twilight conditions of qualifying and the race. Several teams used the session to fulfill requirements to run young drivers, further reducing its relevance. The session was also marked by a near collision between Williams drivers Alex Albon and Luke Browning.</p>
