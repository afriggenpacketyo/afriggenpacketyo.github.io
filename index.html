          <p>Jeffrey Rupnow, the father of Natalie Rupnow, who killed two people in the Abundant Life Christian School shooting in Madison, Wisconsin, last year, has been arrested and charged with felonies. The charges include contributing to the delinquency of a child and providing a dangerous weapon to a person under 18, resulting in death. Natalie Rupnow, 15, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after the attack, which also wounded at least six others. Authorities are still investigating the motive behind the shooting, but the father is now being held accountable for his role in the tragic event.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan are engaged in escalating military confrontations, marked by attacks on military sites and heavy shelling across their border. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has emphasized the urgent need for de-escalation, reflecting international alarm over the potential for the conflict to spiral out of control. Both countries claim they are not seeking further escalation, but actions on the ground, including thwarted drone and missile attacks, suggest otherwise. The situation remains tense, with residents near the border experiencing panic and taking shelter as both sides brace for further conflict.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 15:38:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is decommissioning its database that tracks billion-dollar weather and climate disasters, citing evolving priorities and staffing changes. This decision comes amid criticism regarding the database's methodology and concerns over its potential to mislead regarding climate change justifications. Critics like Roger Pielke Jr. argue that economists should oversee the data to address quality-control issues, while NOAA's Rick Spinrad suggests a collaboration between economists and NOAA scientists. The database has been a popular tool for government, the insurance industry, and media, so its discontinuation raises concerns about the future availability of comprehensive data on the economic costs of extreme weather events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will cease tracking the costs of disasters causing at least $1 billion in damage, a move criticized for potentially crippling efforts to understand patterns and economic consequences of major events like hurricanes and wildfires. Researchers and lawmakers express concern that this decision, part of broader Trump administration efforts to restrict climate research, will leave policymakers and insurance companies without crucial information. The database, which showed an increasing frequency of billion-dollar disasters, provided a consistent record of climate-related economic losses. Without this data, assessing the risks and costs associated with climate change becomes significantly more challenging.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied bail to rapper Lil Durk, whose legal name is Durk Devontay Banks, pending his trial on murder-for-hire charges. The decision was influenced by reports indicating that Banks violated jail rules by using other inmates' phone accounts and engaging in three-way calls. Prosecutors allege Banks ordered the murder of Tyquian Bowman, a Georgia rapper, in 2022 and may be linked to a second murder in Chicago. While Banks' attorney argues that the removal of lyrics from the indictment weakens the case, the prosecution maintains that the case is about Banks' conduct, not his music.</p>

The law aims to protect children, but critics argue it violates religious freedom and could deter victims from seeking help through confession.

          <p>Cameron Hamilton, the acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), was removed from his position after publicly disagreeing with the Trump administration's plan to eliminate the agency.

          <p>Despite President Trump's claim that foreign exporters will absorb the costs of tariffs, economic data suggests that many companies plan to pass those costs on to American consumers. Surveys from Apollo Global Management and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas indicate that a significant percentage of Texas manufacturers intend to increase prices to offset tariff-related expenses. Economists and analysts predict that these tariffs, coupled with retaliatory measures from other countries, are likely to drive up consumer prices in the coming months. The Center for American Progress estimates that the tariffs could cost households an average of $5,200 annually.</p>

          <p>Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) can be a cost-effective borrowing option for homeowners, but they often come with minimum draw requirements that can impact their affordability. Lenders may require an upfront draw, ongoing minimum usage during the draw period, and minimum balance requirements. These rules can affect interest costs and repayment plans, potentially leading to higher expenses if borrowers are forced to draw more funds than they need.
