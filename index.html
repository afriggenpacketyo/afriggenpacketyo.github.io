          <p>AOL is officially ending its iconic dial-up internet service, a technology that introduced many American households to the online world in the 1990s. The service, known for its distinct modem sounds, will be discontinued for subscribers in the US and Canada on September 30. This decision reflects the overwhelming shift to broadband, with government data showing fewer than 300,000 dial-up users compared to over 300 million with high-speed connections. The company, now owned by Apollo Global, was once a dominant force with over 30 million subscribers at its peak.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of lithium companies saw a significant rally after reports that Chinese battery giant CATL suspended production at its Yichun Project mine. The temporary shutdown, caused by an expired permit, has tightened the global lithium supply, as the mine accounts for about 4% of the world's projected 2025 output. Consequently, investors anticipate higher lithium prices, which drove up stock values for miners like Albemarle and the Sprott Lithium Miners ETF. CATL has stated it is working to renew the permit and will resume production upon approval. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of C3 AI dropped nearly 26% after the company released disappointing preliminary first-quarter revenue estimates and announced a sales organization restructuring. CEO Thomas Siebel labeled the sales performance "completely unacceptable," attributing the shortfall to the disruptive effects of the reorganization and his own reduced involvement due to health issues. The company anticipates a significantly wider operating loss compared to the previous year. Siebel, who is also searching for a successor, expressed confidence in the company's future despite the current setbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate of high interest rates, certificates of deposit (CDs) present a safe and predictable investment alternative to a volatile stock market. This article calculates the potential interest earnings for a $50,000 CD across various term lengths, from three months to five years, based on today's top rates. For example, a one-year CD at 4.40% could yield $2,200, while a five-year CD at 4.15% could earn over $11,000. These fixed-rate, FDIC-insured accounts offer reliable returns for savers seeking stability for their funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cannabis-related stocks experienced a major rally after President Trump announced he is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less dangerous drug category under federal law. Companies like Canopy Growth and Tilray Brands saw their shares surge over 25% and 41% respectively. Such a change, likely moving cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, would significantly benefit the industry by altering tax regulations and boosting investor interest.

          <p>The Austrian energy drink company Red Bull is set to take over the Newcastle Falcons rugby club, which will be rebranded as the Newcastle Red Bulls. The move has generated significant excitement among fans, who hope Red Bull's record of transforming sports teams will elevate the struggling club. While the takeover is seen as a major boost for the team and the league, which recently faced the collapse of three other clubs, experts caution that a return to glory may be slow. The immediate focus will be on stabilizing the roster before pursuing major signings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a guide for individuals whose bank accounts have been frozen by a debt collector, a legal but jarring action that can cut off access to necessary funds. It outlines five crucial steps to regain control, starting with contacting the bank to confirm the freeze and gather information about the court order. The guide advises reviewing the judgment for errors, claiming any legally exempt funds like Social Security, and attempting to negotiate directly with the creditor. For more severe situations, it suggests considering professional debt relief or bankruptcy consultation.</p>

          <p>The government of Niger has launched an investigation into the recent $5 million auction of the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, claiming it may have been illegally smuggled out of the country. The 54-pound meteorite was discovered in the Sahara Desert in Niger in 2023. While auction house Sotheby's maintains the rock was exported legally, Nigerien officials are exploring whether the sale constitutes "illicit international trafficking" under heritage laws. The dispute highlights the legal ambiguities surrounding the ownership and trade of meteorites discovered on sovereign territory.</p>

          <p>Despite winning the FA Cup, Crystal Palace has been demoted from the Europa League to the lower-tier Uefa Conference League after losing an appeal. The punishment was enacted by Uefa due to a breach of multi-club ownership rules, as the club's former majority stakeholder, John Textor, also owns French club Lyon, which also qualified for the Europa League. The club missed a deadline to prove its ownership had been restructured. Pundits suggest that while the demotion is a blow, the club's recent successes could help galvanize the team for the upcoming season.</p>

The issue drew criticism from Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and the governor of Oaxaca.
