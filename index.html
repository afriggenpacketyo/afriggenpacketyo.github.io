          <p>Storm Amy has swept across the UK, unleashing heavy rain and strong winds that led to an amber warning for northern and western Scotland, where gusts hit a powerful 96 mph. The severe weather has already caused significant travel disruptions, power cuts, and tragically, one fatality in the Republic of Ireland due to a weather-related incident. Notably, the storm established a new record for the deepest area of low pressure recorded in the UK for October, registering 947.9hPa and surpassing a 1988 record. Despite the storm beginning to move eastward, substantial damage and ongoing disruption are anticipated throughout Saturday, with widespread wind speeds up to 65 mph in exposed areas and continued heavy rain in the north.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old conservative, has been elected as the new leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, positioning her to become the nation's first female prime minister. She faces the formidable task of uniting a struggling party after recent scandals and election defeats, revitalizing a sluggish economy plagued by inflation and stagnant wages, and navigating complex US-Japan relations. A staunch conservative and protégé of former leader Shinzo Abe, Takaichi advocates for his "Abenomics" economic vision and aims to revise Japan's pacifist constitution. Her confirmation by parliament is anticipated, despite the LDP's weakened majority in both legislative chambers.</p>

          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is experiencing a notable surge in support, particularly among ethnic Germans who resettled from the former Soviet Union, known as Russia Germans. A study by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation indicates that 31% of Russia Germans are prepared to vote for the AfD, significantly higher than the average migrant-background support. This demographic's shift, observed since 2015-2016 amid the refugee crisis, is linked to their strict views on German citizenship, emphasizing ancestry, and the AfD's Russia-friendly stance. The AfD has actively targeted and recruited this voter group through direct outreach and Russian-language programs, successfully engaging citizens often disengaged from politics.</p>

          <p>Former Sunderland manager Peter Reid has reflected on the BBC's 1998 documentary "Premier Passions," which candidly chronicled the club's turbulent 1996-97 season, culminating in their relegation from the Premier League. The series offered a rare, unfiltered look into football's changing face, from Reid's intense, expletive-filled dressing room rants to the club's commercial aspirations and emotional departure from Roker Park. Reid acknowledges his management style wouldn't be acceptable today but maintains positive relationships with former players. The documentary, which also covered the building of the Stadium of Light, is remembered fondly for its transparency and for boosting the club's profile, showcasing the deep commitment of the team and community despite the on-field heartache.</p>

The court evidence was so harrowing that jurors were excused from future service, highlighting the profound impact on investigators. The case tragically underscores failures in social services, as Ethan, on the child protection register, was not seen for weeks leading up to his death, echoing similar child fatalities during the Covid-19 pandemic. Michael and Kerry Ives received life sentences, while Shannon Ives was sentenced to 12 years.</p>

          <p>Early sales of mooncakes, traditional treats for China's Mid-Autumn Festival, have softened compared to previous years, signaling a continued struggle for re-energized domestic demand. The exchange of these non-essential goods is widely seen as a bellwether for consumer enthusiasm, particularly for discretionary spending. A Guangzhou corporate consulting firm, for instance, reported a 40% drop in its per-person budget for Mid-Autumn gifts this year, citing an "extremely sluggish" industry that has forced client losses and staff layoffs. This trend suggests Chinese consumers are increasingly cutting back on non-essential purchases amidst ongoing economic challenges, impacting traditional holiday markets.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is offering unaccompanied migrant children aged 14 and older a $2,500 stipend to voluntarily return to their home countries, allocating $250 million for these deportations. This initiative, starting with 17-year-olds and excluding Mexican minors, aims to provide financial support for their return home after an immigration judge's approval. However, rights advocates strongly criticize the program as a "cruel tactic" that undermines protections for children fleeing violence and legal processes. Concerns are particularly raised that the significant financial incentive, potentially the largest sum many children have ever seen, could prevent them from adequately assessing the long-term risks of voluntary deportation versus seeking asylum in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A growing concern over deteriorating crowd behavior at public events, exemplified by the Ryder Cup where golfers faced homophobic slurs and insults, is prompting social scientists to question if acceptable norms have shifted. While incidents of taunting, spitting, and heckling are widely reported, some experts caution against "moral panic," noting that data often shows such extreme behavior remains exceptional. Theories like "deindividuation" and "convergence" attempt to explain crowd aggression, while post-pandemic socialisation and the pursuit of social media attention are cited as potential modern factors. Ultimately, the issue reflects a broader societal fraying of agreed norms, serving as a "canary in the coalmine" for social contracts.</p>

          <p>A new defense pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan is creating a complex nuclear dilemma for China, which maintains strong relations with both nations and collaborates with Riyadh on its civilian nuclear program. Analysts suggest Beijing would be wary of further developing this nuclear partnership to avoid provoking the US or appearing to encourage nuclear proliferation. A senior Saudi official indicated the pact would "encompass all military means," raising concerns about Saudi Arabia potentially falling under Pakistan's nuclear umbrella. The widespread belief in Israel's regional nuclear monopoly and perceived US reluctance to protect allies like Qatar are fueling Riyadh's unease and driving its pursuit of such agreements.</p>

Interpreting the response as readiness for lasting peace, Trump demanded Israel immediately halt bombing for hostage release, placing Prime Minister Netanyahu "in a corner." This move, driven by Trump's pragmatism, deal-making ambition, and a desire for a Nobel Peace Prize, also reflects evolving US public opinion and his personal frustration with Netanyahu after an attack on Hamas negotiators.

The article emphasizes that rapid and sustained emission reductions, achieved by quickly moving away from fossil fuels and animal agriculture, are crucial to prevent future deaths.

The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has fought for these rights through employment tribunals and the European Court of Justice, eventually allowing firefighters who served between 2000 and 2006 to claim pensions for their entire careers.

          <p>Morocco's Gen Z population is actively protesting government priorities, demanding improved social services like healthcare and education over lavish spending on infrastructure for the 2030 World Cup. Coordinated through platforms like Discord and TikTok, the leaderless movement, Gen Z 212, emerged after the tragic deaths of eight women in a maternity ward, highlighting severe deficiencies in medical care. Protesters chant slogans prioritizing hospitals over football stadiums, despite police responses that have included mass arrests and violence, resulting in three deaths. Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch has expressed openness to dialogue, but the movement vows to continue until concrete changes are implemented, drawing parallels to past youth-led movements.</p>

          <p>Hip-hop mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs has been sentenced to 50 months (over four years) in prison after being convicted on two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution. The judge, Arun Subramanian, emphasized the need for a significant deterrent and rejected the defense's portrayal of Combs' relationships as intimate and consensual, stating he "abused them, physically, emotionally and psychologically." Combs, who was acquitted of more serious racketeering and sexual assault charges, apologized to his victims and family in court, expressing remorse and begging for mercy for a second chance. He will receive credit for 13 months already served and faces a $500,000 fine, with his legal team planning an appeal.</p>

          <p>The FBI is reportedly considering a "showy" public arrest and "perp walk" for its former director, James Comey, who was recently indicted for lying to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. This unprecedented move comes after public pressure from President Trump, a long-time adversary of Comey. Sources indicate an agent was suspended for refusing to participate, deeming it inappropriate for a white-collar defendant. The plan has faced resistance from other FBI supervisors, raising concerns about the politicization of law enforcement tactics. Comey's indictment follows days of upheaval in the U.S. Attorney's office involved, with some staff arguing against the charges.</p>

          <p>Scientists are making significant strides in biocomputing, developing "wetware" computers powered by lab-grown human brain organoids derived from stem cells. Researchers at FinalSpark lab in Switzerland are cultivating these mini-brains, which are clusters of neurons, and connecting them to electrodes to process simple commands. The vision is to create energy-efficient data centers that mimic AI learning, although challenges remain in sustaining the organoids, which currently survive up to four months. Eerie findings include a "flurry of activity" before their demise, similar to human brain activity at end-of-life. While promising for drug development, experts believe biocomputing will complement, not replace, silicon AI.</p>

          <p>This article provides a personal narrative illustrating the dramatic evolution of China's education system, contrasting the author's rural 1980s experience, where "knowledge is power" was a creed for escaping poverty, with the modern challenges faced by her children. Her father's bewilderment at selling an apartment for her granddaughter's schooling highlights the intense competition in Beijing, where housing prices are directly linked to access to top-tier universities. The shift from a single key high school per county to Beijingers "picking and choosing" among numerous prestigious institutions underscores the profound changes in educational access, cost, and parental investment across generations in China.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion and fire at the Chevron oil refinery in El Segundo, California, has deeply rattled residents in the city historically intertwined with the facility. While officials reported no injuries and minimal damage, one worker has filed a lawsuit claiming injury, and locals express ongoing concerns about unseen airborne toxins and methane odors. The dramatic blaze, which occurred in the refinery's Isomax complex, prompted some residents to evacuate their homes, shaking their sense of safety and creating a "big blast." Despite checking air quality apps, the incident served as a stark "wake-up call" for many, highlighting the inherent risks of living adjacent to a major industrial operation that produces a fifth of Southern California's motor fuels.</p>

Participants, equipped with sanitary pads and feminist literature, humorously exaggerated aesthetic choices associated with this trend. The event, which included explaining book choices and performing romantic songs, served as a cathartic experience for some women who found it a playful way to mock awkward dating encounters. Beyond the humor, the contest reflects deeper societal discussions about the political gap between young men and women and the rejection of misogynistic ideologies, even as some question the sincerity of such displays.</p>

The report links these trends to human activity and dirty energy sources, which contribute to global warming. In response, Australia has set a target to reduce polluting gases by 62% below 2005 levels by 2035, aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050, aligning with efforts by other nations to mitigate future effects.</p>

Crucially, brands are leveraging China's unique social commerce ecosystem, particularly platforms like Douyin and Xiaohongshu, which offer extensive consumer data and rapid sales growth.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a landmark measure allowing the state's 800,000 rideshare drivers to unionize as independent contractors, marking the largest expansion of private-sector collective bargaining rights in California history. This legislation represents a significant compromise in the long-standing battle between labor unions and tech companies like Uber and Lyft, which, in exchange, will see reduced insurance requirements, potentially saving $200 million. Newsom contrasted California's move with federal actions stripping worker protections, emphasizing the state's commitment to empowering workers. The new law requires gig companies to bargain in good faith over issues like driver deactivations, paid leave, and earnings, aiming for shared prosperity for drivers.</p>

Allegations of contract clauses banning material critical of the royal family or religion highlight free speech concerns.

The Department of Homeland Security hailed the decision as a "win for the American people and commonsense," arguing TPS was abused as a de facto amnesty program.

          <p>Electric vehicle (EV) sales in the UK reached a record high in September, with pure battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales growing by almost a third and plug-in hybrids increasing even faster. Electrified vehicles now account for over half of all new car registrations, marking the best September since 2020. This surge is attributed to carmaker discounts, a wider model choice, and the government's £3,750 grant scheme designed to encourage the switch from petrol and diesel. While businesses and fleets account for the majority of BEV purchases, private buyer numbers are rising. The industry, navigating challenges like US tariffs and cyberattacks, sees investment in EVs "paying off" despite consumer demand still "trailing ambition."</p>
