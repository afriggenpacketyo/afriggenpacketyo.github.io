          <p>The U.S. is launching a 12-month pilot program requiring some business and leisure travelers to post bonds of $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000 to enter the country. This measure targets visitors from nations with high rates of visa overstays, aiming to test the feasibility of such a system and encourage foreign governments to improve compliance. The State Department estimates a small number of travelers, around 2,000, will be affected during the trial period, which begins on August 20, 2025. The specific countries impacted will be announced 15 days before implementation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the consensus view on China's economy oversimplifies the role of consumption and investment. It pushes back against the narrative that China's development model inherently prioritizes industrial power over household welfare, suggesting this is an ideological portrayal. The author contends that becoming a "consumption-oriented economy" is not an end in itself but that China needs more intelligent, targeted investment to unlock domestic demand. This is presented as a more complex challenge than simply reducing state-led investment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The fifth season of "The Hundred" cricket tournament is underway, but significant changes are on the horizon due to private investment. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has confirmed sales of stakes in six of the eight teams, with many new owners linked to Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises. These changes, set to take effect in 2026, could lead to team rebranding, increased player salaries, and a potential shift from the current draft system to an auction format. While the 100-ball format and team count will remain for now, the new investment signals a major evolution for the English cricket landscape.</p>

          <p>Diageo, the parent company of brands like Guinness and Johnnie Walker, has reported a nearly 28% drop in annual operating profit. The beverage giant is also expanding its cost-cutting measures and searching for a new CEO following Debra Crew's departure amid shareholder discontent. The company reiterated its warning of a potential $200 million annual impact from U.S. tariffs on its products, although it believes it can mitigate about half of this. The poor performance is attributed to a sales slump, changing consumer habits, and supply chain issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, has refrained from setting a target for the number of migrants to be returned under a new agreement with France. The pilot scheme allows the UK to return some migrants who arrive via small boats in exchange for accepting vetted asylum seekers directly from France. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has promoted the deal as a significant diplomatic achievement, while critics argue the numbers returned will be too low to act as a deterrent. The government is under pressure as Channel crossings in 2025 have significantly surpassed last year's figures.</p>

          <p>India has responded to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of higher tariffs by defending its significant purchases of Russian oil. The Indian foreign ministry stated it was being unfairly "targeted," arguing that it only began importing Russian oil after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe following the 2022 Ukraine invasion. New Delhi pointed out that both the U.S. and E.U. continue to trade with Russia and that the U.S. had previously encouraged India's purchases to stabilize global energy markets. Bilateral trade between India and Russia has surged to a record $68.7 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennessee is scheduled to execute Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate, in what may be the first case of a person being put to death with a working implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Despite legal challenges from his attorneys, who argue the device could activate and cause unnecessary pain during the lethal injection, the governor has declined to grant a reprieve. The state contends that even if the device were to deliver a shock, Black would be unaware. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters.</p>

          <p>The Scottish adoption charity Birthlink has been fined £18,000 after destroying approximately 4,800 personal records, including "irreplaceable" items like photographs and handwritten letters from birth parents. The files were shredded four years ago to create more filing space, a decision the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) called "inexcusable." The lost material was described as deeply personal and, in some cases, the only existing link to an adopted person's history. The charity's board has issued a deep apology and stated it is implementing new policies to prevent such an event from happening again.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis piece argues that England's chances of winning the upcoming Ashes series in Australia depend almost entirely on the performance and fitness of captain Ben Stokes. The article notes England's poor record in Australia over the past decade and the inexperience of the current squad in those conditions. With Stokes as the team's "beating heart," his all-around contribution as a player and leader is seen as essential to counter a formidable Australian bowling attack. Winning the series on Australian soil is framed as what would be Stokes' "greatest miracle" given the historical and current challenges.</p>

Stewart, who was acquired from the Minnesota Twins at the trade deadline to bolster the bullpen, entered a tie game in the ninth inning but gave up the go-ahead run on three hits. It was a difficult homecoming for the right-hander, who was originally drafted by the Dodgers but had been away from the team for six years.

          <p>Thirty years after "Operation Storm," Croatia and Serbia maintain starkly different views of the pivotal 1995 military offensive. In Croatia, the event is celebrated as a heroic victory that reclaimed occupied territory and was crucial to ending the war, marked this year by a large military parade in Zagreb. In Serbia, it is commemorated as a "pogrom," mourning the expulsion of approximately 200,000 Serbs and the war crimes committed against civilians who remained.

After two years of talks, key disagreements remain, particularly over whether to cap plastic production, a measure supported by nearly 100 countries but opposed by oil-producing nations like Russia and Saudi Arabia. The treaty also seeks to ban harmful chemicals and establish universal design and recycling standards. This summit is seen as a crucial opportunity to curb plastic's environmental and health impacts.</p>

The authors argue that less than two years after the ousting of the Law and Justice party, enthusiasm has waned, evidenced by a populist-backed presidential win and Tusk's falling approval ratings. The piece suggests that post-populist governments often get bogged down in reversing their predecessors' damage and fail to offer a compelling future vision.
