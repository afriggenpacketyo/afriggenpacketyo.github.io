          <p>Reports suggest the newly merged Paramount Skydance is preparing a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, with sources speculating an offer could be in the $22 to $24 per share range. This potential acquisition follows Warner Bros. Discovery's recent announcement to separate its TV networks from its streaming and studio businesses. The deal, if it proceeds, would create a massive media conglomerate by combining two major film studios and extensive portfolios of pay TV networks and sports rights. The timing and final price of the offer remain speculative. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have responded to excerpts from Vice President Kamala Harris's new book, "107 Days." Shapiro stated Harris will need to explain why she didn't publicly voice concerns about President Biden's fitness to campaign, a topic she addresses in the memoir. The book also details Harris's thought process in selecting a running mate, where she notes Buttigieg would have been an "ideal partner" if not for the perceived political risk of adding a gay man to the ticket. Buttigieg expressed surprise at this reasoning, emphasizing that voters care more about policy impact than identity categories.</p>

          <p>Estonia's foreign minister reported that three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated the country's airspace for over 12 minutes on Friday. The jets, which were carrying Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missiles, flew approximately five nautical miles inside Estonian airspace near the capital, Tallinn. Italian F-35s from a NATO mission intercepted and escorted the Russian aircraft out of the area. In response to what it called an "unprecedentedly brazen" act, Estonia is considering invoking Article 4 consultations with its NATO allies, a serious diplomatic step to address threats to its security.</p>

This year's festival is marked by record beer prices, with a one-liter stein, or Mass, costing over €15 at most vendors. Alongside the traditional festivities, organizers are advancing sustainability goals, aiming for the event to be climate-neutral by 2028 through green electricity and improved recycling. Despite the high costs, the event continues to be a major cultural and tourist draw, featuring a mix of traditional and modern attractions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has introduced its 19th package of sanctions against Russia, which notably includes measures targeting Chinese companies that purchase Russian oil. The proposals aim to further curtail Russia's energy revenues, which have already seen a 90% reduction from European sources since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. This move expands the scope of the EU's economic pressure by focusing on third-country entities that facilitate Russia's war economy.

          <h2>Investigation Reveals Walmart's Online Marketplace Growth Fueled by Lax Vetting, Leading to Counterfeit Goods</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CNBC investigation has found that Walmart's rapid expansion of its third-party online marketplace involved relaxing its seller vetting processes, leading to an influx of counterfeit products and sellers using stolen identities. To compete with Amazon, Walmart reportedly made it easier for vendors to join its platform, which inadvertently allowed bad actors to sell fake goods, including potentially dangerous health supplements and beauty products. The report details instances where fraudulent sellers impersonated legitimate businesses, causing confusion and potential harm to consumers who trusted the Walmart brand. In response to the findings, Walmart has recently tightened vetting for some health and beauty product sellers.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased on Friday, with the 10-year note yield climbing to its highest point in two weeks, reaching 4.145%. This upward movement occurred just two days after the Federal Reserve implemented its first interest rate cut of the year, a move that typically pushes yields lower. Analysts suggest the rise in long-term yields reflects investor focus on broader economic factors beyond short-term rates, including expectations for GDP growth, inflation, and government debt issuance. The market is interpreting recent economic data as signs of a resilient economy, counteracting the Fed's easing signal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Vox article argues that the Trump administration's actions leading to Jimmy Kimmel's suspension represent a more profound threat to the First Amendment than prior controversies, such as the Biden administration's engagement with social media on COVID misinformation. The analysis asserts that FCC Chair Brendan Carr's explicit threat to revoke broadcast licenses of ABC affiliates constitutes direct government coercion aimed at suppressing critical speech. The piece refutes the claim that the FCC has legitimate regulatory authority in this case, arguing Kimmel's comments do not meet the legal definition of a "broadcast hoax."

          <p>President Trump's announcement to designate antifa as a "major terrorist organization" is likely to encounter significant legal and practical challenges. Legal experts note that the president lacks the authority to create a list of domestic terrorist organizations, as such a mechanism does not exist in U.S. law, partly due to First Amendment concerns. Antifa is described as a decentralized movement or ideology rather than a formal organization, making a blanket designation difficult to apply and enforce. While the administration could prioritize investigations into individuals acting on antifa ideology, it cannot legally prosecute the ideology itself.</p>

          <p>A DW fact-check has determined that recent claims circulating on Chinese social media that Poland is sending troops to Ukraine are false. The misinformation appears to stem from a misinterpretation of comments made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who mentioned that Polish military representatives would come to Ukraine for consultations on drone defense. The Polish Ministry of Defense later clarified that any joint training activities would take place exclusively on Polish territory. These false narratives were amplified by content farms to create a misleading impression of escalating conflict, highlighting the spread of disinformation.</p>

          <p>The death of Demartravion “Trey” Reed, a 21-year-old Black student found hanging from a tree on the Delta State University campus, has been ruled a suicide by the Mississippi state medical examiner’s office. The finding is consistent with the initial police investigation, which stated there was no evidence of foul play. The case had drawn calls from civil rights advocates for a thorough and transparent investigation, given Mississippi's history of lynchings. While the official manner of death has been determined, toxicology results are still pending, and the case files have been turned over to the FBI for review.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced a new "high-powered demography mission" to counter what he describes as a "conspiracy" of irregular migration, particularly from Bangladesh. The ruling BJP party has framed this migration as a national security threat that leads to demographic shifts and harms local communities. Critics, however, argue that the mission is a pretext to target Muslim populations and other minority groups perceived as outsiders. This initiative follows other controversial measures like the Citizenship Amendment Act, which opponents say are designed to engineer the electorate and consolidate the BJP's Hindu nationalist base.</p>

          <p>Canada's retail sales dropped by 0.8% in July, reversing most of the gains from the previous month, according to Statistics Canada. The decline was broad-based, with eight of nine subsectors reporting lower sales, led by decreases in clothing and grocery purchases. The only sector to see growth was motor vehicles and parts. Despite the weak July figures, the agency's advance indicator suggests that retail sales are likely to rebound with 1.0% growth in August. This potential recovery could signal that Canada's economy may avoid a contraction in the third quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to hold a call to finalize an agreement that would allow the social media platform TikTok to continue operating in the United States. The call follows the establishment of a deal "framework" earlier in the week, aimed at addressing U.S. national security concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. A federal law had mandated that ByteDance divest its U.S. operations or face a ban, but President Trump, a vocal supporter of the app, has repeatedly extended the deadline.

The article highlights that Boeing has secured major orders from airlines in allied nations and anticipates a potential large order from China.

A map reveals a heavy concentration in the southeastern part of the state, particularly near Milwaukee, driven by proximity to the Great Lakes' freshwater supply. However, the growth has sparked environmental concerns over the massive water and energy consumption of these facilities. For example, two approved projects alone are projected to use more energy than all of Wisconsin's households combined, raising questions about sustainability and the long-term impact on local resources.</p>

He explained that his more dovish stance is based on his growing confidence that President Trump's tariffs will have only a one-time, rather than a persistent, effect on inflation. Kashkari also cited a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations as reasons for supporting further policy easing. Despite core inflation running above the Fed's 2% target, he believes these factors provide sufficient room for the central bank to lower its benchmark rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An in-depth report from The Guardian details how the Trump administration is dismantling established immigration court protocols to accelerate deportations. The strategy involves government lawyers getting cases dismissed in court, which removes judicial oversight and allows ICE to reclassify migrants for "expedited removal," even those who have lived in the U.S. for years. This tactic, combined with arresting migrants at courthouses and pressuring immigration judges to align with enforcement priorities, has created chaos and stripped away due process protections. Critics describe these actions as a "full-frontal assault" on the justice system.</p>
