          <p>China has sanctioned five U.S.-based subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, causing the company's shares to fall over 8%. Beijing alleges these subsidiaries assisted the U.S. government in its investigation into China's maritime and shipbuilding industries, a move China's Commerce Ministry called a violation of its sovereignty. The sanctions prohibit Chinese entities from conducting business with the targeted companies. This action represents an escalation in the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China, which has also seen new port fees and restrictions on rare earth exports. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), average wage growth in the UK slightly decreased to 4.7% in the three months to August, while the unemployment rate edged up to 4.8%. This data suggests a stabilization in the UK's volatile job market, with job vacancies falling for the 39th consecutive period. Analysts believe the softening labor demand could lead to an easing of cost pressures, though persistently high wage growth might delay interest rate cuts by the Bank of England. The ONS noted the increase in unemployment was primarily driven by younger people. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After signing a historic peace agreement to end two years of conflict in Gaza, President Donald Trump declined to endorse a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, stating, "We’ll have to see." Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump emphasized his immediate focus is on rebuilding Gaza and coordinating with international partners on future steps. The U.S.-brokered deal led to the release of 20 hostages, and the U.S. will deploy around 200 troops to help monitor the fragile ceasefire. Critical issues like Gaza's postwar governance and Hamas's disarmament remain unresolved. </p>

          <p>A report by the National Audit Office (NAO) has revealed significant failures in two UK government home insulation schemes, leaving tens of thousands of homes requiring remedial work. The watchdog found that 98% of homes fitted with external wall insulation under the ECO4 and Great British Insulation Scheme have problems that could lead to damp and mould. The failures were attributed to an under-skilled workforce, corner-cutting by businesses, and weak oversight from the consumer protection scheme TrustMark. The government has acknowledged the "unacceptable, systemic failings" and promised that repairs will be made at no cost to consumers.</p>

Norway's foreign ministry called the decision "regrettable" but emphasized its desire to maintain dialogue and noted the Nobel Prize is independent of the government. This diplomatic fallout follows heightened tensions between Caracas and Washington and recalls China's reaction to a dissident's Nobel win in 2010.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers won Game 1 of the National League Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers 2-1, overcoming a bizarre fourth-inning double play that cost them a potential grand slam. The team's victory was anchored by a masterful performance from pitcher Blake Snell, who threw eight scoreless innings, allowing only one hit and striking out ten. A sixth-inning solo home run by Freddie Freeman provided the decisive run. Despite a tense ninth inning where the bullpen allowed one run, the Dodgers' star power and dominant pitching ultimately secured the crucial opening win of the series.</p>

James, who has dismissed the charges as "baseless," was met with a standing ovation and delivered a defiant speech, stating, "I will not bow, I will not break, I will not bend." Without mentioning President Trump by name, she vowed to press forward and not give in to "pettiness and revenge."

          <p>European leaders are confronting a period of intense global chaos, characterized by a disruptive United States, an assertive China, and an aggressive Russia. The instability has led some officials to draw parallels with the "three-body problem" from Chinese science fiction, a notoriously unpredictable and unsolvable scenario. This metaphor reflects the continent's struggle to find a stable trajectory as the U.S. undermines the global order it created, China uses its economic power strategically, and Russia wages war on Europe's border. The challenge for Europe is not to solve the chaos but to navigate and survive it.</p>

          <p>The Atlanta Falcons defeated the Buffalo Bills 24-14, propelled by a standout performance from running back Bijan Robinson, who rushed for a career-high 170 yards. Robinson's 81-yard touchdown run in the second quarter, the longest of the NFL season, was a key play in the game. The Falcons' defense successfully contained Bills quarterback Josh Allen, who threw two interceptions. In another Monday night game, the Chicago Bears secured a last-second 25-24 victory over the Washington Commanders with a 38-yard field goal from kicker Jake Moody as time expired.</p>

Australian authorities are investigating the data breach, which has been described as "obviously concerning" by the opposition leader's office. It remains unclear how the private information was obtained, but Australia has experienced several major data breaches in recent years.</p>

Tina, 59, suffered a severe fall in 2018 that left her in a coma and with impaired speech. After moving to a retirement village, she participated in a BBC series where she learned BSL, which she says has helped her express words she cannot speak and regain confidence. The experience has been transformative, not only for Tina but also for her husband, Mark, who now leads BSL practice sessions for other residents in their community.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts of 1.9%, though this marks a slowdown from the previous quarter's 4.5% expansion. The growth was tempered by a flattening manufacturing sector and softer construction activity. Concurrently, the Monetary Authority of Singapore maintained its current policy settings but warned that GDP growth is expected to moderate in 2026 to a near-trend pace as global trade normalizes. Core inflation is projected to ease in the short term before gradually rising in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>
