          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn a court order that reinstated Education Department employees who were terminated as part of a restructuring effort. The administration argues that a U.S. District Judge lacked the authority to mandate the rehiring of these workers, which totaled over 1,300 individuals. The staff reduction, according to the administration, aligns with the policy of streamlining the department and delegating discretionary functions to the states. A federal appeals court had previously declined to lift the judge's ruling.</p>

While the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that Trump's tariffs could reduce the deficit, this projection assumes the tariffs remain permanent. Experts warn that the shifting nature of the tariffs and legal challenges could undermine any projected benefits. The report also found that in exchange for trillions in deficit reduction, household wealth would drop, and the economy would shrink each year over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Annuities can provide predictable retirement income by converting a lump sum into guaranteed monthly payments, but payouts vary based on factors like age, gender, and investment amount. Single-life immediate fixed annuities offer payments that begin right after purchase and continue for life. Generally, older individuals receive larger monthly payments, and men typically receive higher payouts than women due to differing life expectancies. Consulting with a financial advisor can help determine if an annuity is a suitable addition to a retirement portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scottish Labour has gained the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse constituency from the SNP in a closely contested by-election. Davy Russell, the Labour candidate, secured 8,559 votes, with a majority of 602 over the SNP. The by-election was triggered by the death of SNP MSP Christina McKelvie. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar hailed the victory, stating that his party had "proven the pollsters wrong". Reform UK finished third in the by-election, while the Conservatives came in fourth.</p>

          <p>An investigation into a collision between a farm trailer and a train traveling at 80mph in Herefordshire revealed that the tractor driver had requested permission to cross the tracks prior to the incident. The driver contacted the signaller using a telephone at the Nordan Farm level crossing, as directed. Despite this, the trailer was struck by an oncoming train, resulting in damage to the train, trailer, and lineside equipment. Six passengers were treated for minor injuries, and a 32-year-old man was arrested in connection with the incident.</p>

          <p>The stock market is experiencing a rebound following a positive update on nonfarm payrolls, with the U.S. economy adding 139,000 jobs in May and the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%. The report alleviated concerns stemming from suboptimal reports on the labor market. The U.S. economy, driven by consumer spending, benefits from sustained low unemployment. The jobs data wasn't so weak that a recession seems imminent, but not too strong that Federal Reserve rate cuts in the coming months become more difficult to envision. (not investment advice)</p>
