          <p>Violent protests erupted outside an asylum seeker hotel in Dublin, where a police van was set ablaze and officers were attacked with missiles and fireworks. Thousands gathered at the Citywest Hotel, prompting the deployment of riot police and the first use of a water cannon in two years. Ireland's Justice Minister Jim O'Callaghan condemned the "unacceptable" violence, vowing to bring those involved to justice and stressing that such criminality does not represent the local community. The incident underscores escalating tensions and the government's firm stance against violent demonstrations, highlighting broader challenges in managing asylum seeker accommodation and public sentiment.</p>

          <p>The White House dismissed public criticism regarding President Trump's privately funded $250 million ballroom addition as "manufactured outrage." Demolition work on parts of the East Wing for the 90,000-square-foot project generated viral photos and strong condemnation from Democrats, who called it a "disgrace" and indicative of a "Second Gilded Age." The administration defended the ballroom as a "bold, necessary addition" consistent with historical White House improvements. Concurrently, the Treasury Department instructed its staff not to share images of the complex, citing concerns over revealing sensitive security features or confidential structural details during the construction process.</p>

          <p>North Carolina's state senators approved a new GOP-drawn congressional map, which is expected to make a Democratic-held House district more favorable to Republicans. This redistricting effort aligns with a broader national strategy by Republican leaders to enhance their party's chances in upcoming midterms and maintain control of the House. Despite the state having a Democratic governor, his veto power is limited, suggesting the map will likely pass. Democrats, including Rep. Don Davis, whose district is specifically targeted, have condemned the map as "beyond the pale," while GOP leaders assert it respects the will of North Carolina voters.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance and Jared Kushner expressed unexpected optimism regarding the U.S.-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire, despite recent flare-ups of violence. They are in Israel to reinforce the fragile peace plan, which has facilitated the release of all 20 living Israeli hostages and the return of 165 Palestinian bodies. Vance called for patience concerning the retrieval of remaining deceased hostages, acknowledging the challenges of locating them. Conversely, an ex-Israeli official voiced strong skepticism, suggesting Prime Minister Netanyahu was coerced into the agreement and might resume military operations, given Hamas's continued armament and a profound lack of trust between the warring parties.</p>

          <p>Netflix shares plummeted after the company reported a third-quarter earnings miss, primarily attributing the weaker-than-expected results to an expense related to an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities. Despite this, revenue increased by 17%, driven by membership growth, strategic pricing adjustments, and rising ad revenue, with similar growth anticipated for the fourth quarter. The company subsequently revised its full-year operating margin forecast downwards due to the Brazilian tax issue. Analysts are now questioning the sustainability of Netflix's price-hiking strategy, even as the streamer prepares a robust content slate and expands consumer product partnerships for its popular animated titles.

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly demanding $230 million in compensation from the Department of Justice for its criminal investigations conducted against him after his first White House term.

Trump alluded to the "very strong" lawsuit, acknowledging the unusual position of effectively suing his own administration.

Research by Jobs for the Future, Gallup, and others underscores a significant gap in official labor statistics, suggesting that the majority of American workers are not in positions that adequately support their well-being. Only 40% reported having quality jobs, with many experiencing unpredictable schedules and financial difficulties.

Hamas attributes delays in returning all remains to difficulties in locating bodies amidst Gaza's rubble.

          <p>General Motors (GM) stock soared over 15% after the automaker elevated its 2025 financial guidance and significantly exceeded Wall Street's third-quarter earnings expectations. GM reported robust revenue of $48.59 billion and an adjusted earnings per share of $2.80, comfortably beating analyst estimates. CEO Mary Barra attributed the strong performance to the team's collective efforts and a compelling vehicle portfolio, expressing confidence in the company's future trajectory. GM also reduced its anticipated impact from tariffs, with Barra acknowledging President Trump for "important tariff updates." Despite a substantial $1.6 billion charge related to a pullback in all-electric vehicle investments, which halved net income, GM is making notable progress in EV sales and aims to restore North American profit margins to 8-10%.

          <p>A study by investment firm Schroders indicates that 90% of working Americans intend to disregard the prevalent financial advice to wait until age 70 to claim Social Security benefits, despite being aware that delaying would result in significantly higher monthly payments. Only 10% plan to wait, while 44% anticipate filing for benefits before reaching their full retirement age. This disparity underscores the financial realities confronting many workers, who require immediate income due to inadequate personal retirement savings. Concerns about Social Security's projected insolvency by 2034 also contribute to early claiming, although payments would merely be reduced, not entirely halted. The study highlights a critical need for improved retirement planning and financial literacy among the populace. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is actively seeking to dissolve a lingering court order that prohibits the deployment of National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon. This move comes after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a prior temporary restraining order, indicating the administration's likely success in its legal challenge. The government cited the appeals court's decision, contending it justifies the dissolution of the broader order that prevents any state's National Guard from deploying to Portland. Oregon's Attorney General vehemently condemned the appeals court's ruling, asserting that "Portland is peaceful" and that the military should not be on its streets, while Attorney General Pam Bondi lauded the decision as affirming the president's right to deploy the Guard where local leaders have allegedly failed.</p>

A U.S. marshal was also wounded in the hand by a ricochet bullet. Both individuals were subsequently hospitalized.

While current home equity loan rates are already lower, locking in a fixed rate now might not be advantageous if rates continue to decline after the Fed's announcement. A Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is presented as a potentially superior alternative, offering variable rates that can adjust favorably to a cooling rate environment and are typically more affordable. Prospective borrowers should meticulously compare both fixed-rate home equity loans and variable-rate HELOCs, understanding their inherent volatilities and costs, to make an informed decision aligned with their individual financial objectives.
