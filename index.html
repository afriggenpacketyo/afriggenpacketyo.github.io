          <p>Two men have been jailed for the 2019 theft of a Â£4.8 million gold toilet from Blenheim Palace. James Sheen, a career criminal, received a four-year sentence for burglary and related charges after his DNA and incriminating messages were found. Michael Jones, who scouted the location, was sentenced to two years and three months for burglary; he even took selfies with the toilet before the heist. The toilet, an 18-carat solid gold functional piece, was ripped out hours after a launch party, with Sheen selling a portion of the gold shortly after the theft.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's attempt to secure a retrial in the E. Jean Carroll defamation and sexual assault case has failed after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied his request for an en banc review. This decision leaves the Supreme Court as Trump's final recourse to challenge the jury's verdict that found him liable for $5 million in damages. Carroll's legal team expressed satisfaction with the court's decision, emphasizing that Trump remains liable for sexual assault and defamation. The case stems from Carroll's claim of a mid-1990s encounter with Trump in a New York City department store, which Trump has consistently denied.</p>

Organizers of the "No Kings" protests aim to challenge what they see as the administration's circumvention of the courts and Congress.

This resurgence has emboldened other companies, such as Gemini and Caris Life Sciences, to pursue listings, leading to increased activity for investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. However, geopolitical tensions, such as Israel's attack on Iran, and unpredictable trade policies from President Trump could introduce volatility and cause companies to reconsider their IPO plans.

          <p>A federal appeals court temporarily reversed a judge's order to return control of the California National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom, granting a reprieve to Donald Trump. The decision pauses a temporary restraining order issued by a U.S. district judge who found Trump's move to federalize the guard illegal. The court scheduled an emergency hearing for June 17 to further consider the matter. The lawsuit challenges Trump's decision to call up National Guard troops and Marines over Newsom's objections, arguing that Trump failed to demonstrate a "rebellion" requiring federal intervention.</p>

          <p>Loneliness can manifest in unexpected ways, including surrounding oneself with people without forming meaningful connections, regularly declining invitations due to a lack of confidence, and experiencing changes in mood such as increased anger or emotional sensitivity. Other signs include avoiding taking time off work, neglecting self-care or home maintenance, and mindlessly scrolling on social media. Experts recommend speaking to trusted individuals, taking small steps to improve social connections, and giving back to the community through volunteering to combat loneliness.

          <p>Airlines worldwide have canceled flights to Israel and are rerouting flights to avoid Middle Eastern airspace following Israel's missile strike on Iran. Delta Air Lines and United Airlines canceled service to Tel Aviv through at least Saturday, with Tel Aviv-bound flights returning to the New York area. El Al has suspended service and warned customers against traveling to Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport. The flight disruptions come after Israel's overnight strike and Iran's subsequent launch of drones.</p>

          <p>The Harris campaign and Future Forward super PAC had conflicting strategies, potentially costing Democrats the election.

Hawley called this a "huge step forward" and a "huge victory" in the fight to secure compensation for those affected by nuclear exposure.
