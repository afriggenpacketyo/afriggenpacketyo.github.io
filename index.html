          <p>Goldman Sachs is maintaining its economic forecast that U.S. consumers will ultimately bear the majority of costs from recent tariffs, despite public criticism from President Donald Trump. The firm's research indicates that these tariffs could increase the personal consumption expenditures price index, a key inflation gauge for the Federal Reserve, to 3.2% by year's end. An economist from the bank reaffirmed the study's findings, stating they are consistent with research from other economists and that the impact on consumers is expected to manifest by the fall. This analysis suggests a direct financial impact on household spending due to ongoing trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

This marks her return to a major tournament for the first time since the 2023 US Open, following a comeback to the sport in July. Williams' inclusion has sparked some debate, with some arguing it takes a spot from a younger player, while others celebrate the opportunity for an all-time great.

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is confronting a critical shortage of approximately 3,000 air traffic controllers, a situation contributing to summer travel delays nationwide. To address this, the FAA is enhancing its training methods at its sole facility in Oklahoma City, where about 35% of trainees currently do not complete the intensive program. New initiatives include a mentorship program, a streamlined application process, and the expansion of immersive tower simulators to reduce certification time. The agency is also partnering with colleges to allow students to complete basic training locally, aiming to bolster recruitment and retention in the vital role.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned a lower court's decision, enabling the Trump administration to move forward with cutting billions of dollars in foreign aid funding appropriated by Congress. The D.C. Circuit Court ruled 2-1 that the nonprofit organizations who filed the lawsuit lacked the legal standing to challenge the administration's actions under the Impoundment Control Act. This decision sidestepped the core constitutional question of whether the executive branch can withhold funds approved by the legislature. A dissenting judge criticized the majority for facilitating what she described as the executive's unlawful behavior and disregard for the separation of powers.</p>

The judge ruled that the suspension violated a previous preliminary injunction, which had blocked the National Science Foundation from canceling grants within the UC system. The funding freeze is linked to President Trump's threats to cut federal support for universities over pro-Palestinian student protests, which the administration alleges allowed antisemitism. The university is also reviewing a settlement offer from the administration that would require a payment of $1 billion.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration's federal takeover of the Washington D.C. police force is a move characteristic of authoritarianism, manufactured to address a non-existent crisis. The author presents crime statistics showing that violent crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low, directly contradicting the administration's claims of a city overrun by violent criminals. The piece contends that this action is a pretext for expanding federal power, noting President Trump's statements about applying similar tactics to other major cities. It frames the deployment of the National Guard as an effort to consolidate authority by creating fear and disregarding factual evidence.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive report details the investigation and conviction of Bryan Patrick Miller, known as the "Zombie Hunter," for the 1990s murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas in Phoenix. The cold case was solved after more than two decades through the use of genetic genealogy, which connected Miller's DNA to both crime scenes. His defense team argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming that severe childhood abuse caused dissociative amnesia, but he was found guilty and sentenced to death. The article explores Miller's history of violence, the police sting operation that secured his DNA, and the trial that finally brought justice.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI data center provider CoreWeave fell by 18% after the company reported a quarterly adjusted loss of 27 cents per share, exceeding analysts' expectations. The poor financial results arrived just before the expiration of the post-IPO lock-up period, which could introduce further stock volatility as insiders become eligible to sell their shares. Despite the loss, CoreWeave's revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, surpassing forecasts and reflecting continued high demand for AI infrastructure.

This annual event, known as a glacial lake outburst flood, has intensified in recent years due to climate change, which caused a smaller glacier to retreat and form the basin.

Critics and intelligence agencies have expressed skepticism about the extent of the gang's structure and its connection to the Venezuelan state.</p>

          <p>The grocery chain Wegmans has issued a recall for its brand of medium camembert cheese and several prepared products containing it due to a potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. The recall affects items sold between July 1 and August 12 across numerous states in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic U.S. While no illnesses have been reported, listeria can cause serious infections, particularly in vulnerable populations. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has published the specific product details, and Wegmans is urging customers who purchased the affected items not to consume them and to return them for a full refund.</p>

          <p>Leading pornography websites have seen a significant decrease in U.K. traffic since new, stricter age verification rules under the Online Safety Act were implemented on July 25. Data from analytics firm Similarweb shows that top sites like Pornhub and XVideos experienced a 47% drop in visitors between late July and early August. The new regulations require sites to implement more robust age checks to prevent access by minors. Concurrently, there has been a surge in downloads of VPN apps, which can disguise a user's location, and an increase in traffic to smaller, less-regulated adult websites, raising new concerns.</p>

          <p>Students across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are set to receive their A-level, T-level, and BTec results, with grade distributions expected to be similar to last year. This marks a period of stability after several years of fluctuation caused by the pandemic's impact on exams. The head of the university admissions service, Ucas, predicted a record number of 18-year-olds will secure their first-choice university placement, partly because universities are compensating for this cohort having received lower GCSE grades during the post-pandemic grade deflation period. This is also the fourth year of results for the vocational T-level qualifications in England.</p>

          <p>Dale Webster, a Northern California surfer who held a world record for surfing every single day for 14,642 consecutive days, has passed away at the age of 77. His remarkable streak began on September 3, 1975, and ended on October 5, 2015, only when he required surgery for kidney stones. Known as "Daily Dale," he committed to riding at least three waves to the shore each day, regardless of weather, water temperature, or personal health challenges. Webster's extraordinary dedication, which saw him build his life around the daily ritual, made him a celebrated and inspirational figure within the global surfing community.</p>

          <p>U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy has admitted to an "administrative error" after he went fishing with U.S. Vice President JD Vance without possessing the required rod licence.

Lammy has since purchased a licence and written to the Environment Agency to notify them of the oversight. While he did not catch any fish, Vance's children reportedly did. Fishing without a licence in England and Wales can result in a fine of up to £2,500, though it is unclear if any penalty will be applied in this case.</p>

          <p>A market analysis from CNBC's Investing Club notes the significant impact of Amazon's expansion of same-day fresh grocery delivery, which caused shares of competitors like Kroger and Albertsons to fall. However, the report argues that warehouse retailer Costco should not be similarly affected, as its business model is based on in-person, bulk-price shopping rather than delivery convenience. The analysis also touches on the recent stock decline of AI company CoreWeave, which rents Nvidia chips, and positive analyst sentiment for Nvidia itself, citing strong demand from China.

          <p>The fashion accessory retailer Claire's has collapsed into administration in the U.K. and Ireland, placing 2,150 jobs and 306 stores at risk. The company, once a popular destination for teenagers, has faced declining sales and intense competition from online retailers and fast-fashion giants. Administrators will keep all stores trading while they assess options, which could include a sale of the business. This development follows the company's bankruptcy filing in the U.S. earlier in the month, where it cited the shift away from brick-and-mortar retail and the impact of tariffs on its supply chain as key factors in its financial struggles.</p>

The ruling requires ICE to provide detainees with sleeping mats, hygiene products, and access to medication, and to reduce the number of people held at the site. The order followed a lawsuit from the ACLU and other advocates, who decried the conditions as inhumane, and a court hearing where a government lawyer conceded the lack of certain basic services.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis details how the Trump administration has significantly altered the U.S. State Department's annual human rights reports, which have long served as a global standard. Political appointees have reportedly rewritten drafts to remove entire categories of concern, such as corruption, violence against women, and discrimination against sexual minorities. The new reports also feature softened depictions of some authoritarian regimes while leveling harsh, politically motivated criticisms against democratic allies like Germany. Critics argue this move undermines the reports' credibility, abandons bipartisan foreign policy norms, and aligns U.S. rhetoric with that of countries like China and Russia, who seek to weaken international human rights standards.</p>
