          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to impose significant new tariffs on more than a dozen countries, with an effective date of August 1, 2025. Japan and South Korea face a 25% tariff, while other nations including Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia are threatened with even higher rates ranging from 35% to 40%. The White House has framed this as a move toward reciprocal trade, but some economists warn it could trigger inflation and slow economic growth. The announcements, made via social media, signal a continued aggressive stance on international trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kenya is experiencing continued tension and unrest following deadly anti-government protests, with businesses remaining closed and roadblocks in place in several cities. Protesters, largely youth frustrated with economic hardship and corruption, are demanding the resignation of President William Ruto and an end to police brutality. The government's response has been criticized as authoritarian, with over 560 arrests made during the recent Saba Saba Day unrest. The decentralized, leaderless nature of the youth-led movement has contributed to the volatile situation across the country.</p>

          <p>Germany's Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius, has put forward a bill that would allow the government to reinstate military conscription in specific national defense situations. The plan is a compromise, aiming to bolster the armed forces in response to Europe's changing security landscape without a full return to compulsory service. The proposal also seeks to make voluntary service more appealing with significantly higher pay to increase the number of active soldiers and reservists. This move comes as Germany works to meet new NATO guidelines requiring a substantial increase in troop numbers.</p>

          <p>Following the US announcement of new tariffs, international trade partners are actively weighing their negotiation strategies to avoid steep import duties. Japan's Prime Minister stated he will continue negotiations to secure a mutually beneficial deal, while the European Union is aiming for a fast agreement before the August 1 deadline. The EU reportedly expects to work out a baseline 10% tariff. Meanwhile, South Africa's president has contested the proposed 30% tariff, calling it an inaccurate representation of trade data, highlighting the global effort to navigate the new trade landscape.

          <p>Boeing delivered 60 airplanes in the last month, its highest total since December 2023, indicating a ramp-up in production of its 737 Max jets. The increase follows a period of slowed production after a door plug blowout incident in January 2024, which intensified scrutiny over the company's manufacturing and safety protocols. Of the 60 planes, 42 were 737 Max models delivered to major airlines. This marks the company's best second-quarter performance since 2018, suggesting progress in overcoming its recent series of crises and production challenges.</p>
