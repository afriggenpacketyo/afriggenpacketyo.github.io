          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing Elon Musk's DOGE team from accessing Social Security Administration data, citing a "fishing expedition" and lack of justification for accessing sensitive personal information.

          <p>Following the deadly Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse, the NTSB recommended that 68 bridges across 19 states undergo vulnerability assessments to determine their risk of collapse in a vessel collision.  The recommendations target bridges built before 1991 lacking current assessments, including notable structures like the Golden Gate Bridge. The NTSB noted this doesn't imply imminent collapse but necessitates risk evaluation.</p>
