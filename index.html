          <p>Ted Christie, the CEO of Spirit Airlines, has stepped down from his position after leading the company through the COVID-19 pandemic and a recent bankruptcy. A group of executives including the CFO, COO, and General Counsel will lead the airline until a replacement is found. Spirit Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection in November after facing mounting losses, a failed merger, and increased competition. The budget carrier emerged from bankruptcy protection last month and now faces an uncertain future.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered a first-century A.D. Roman mass grave containing hundreds of bodies beneath a soccer field in Vienna. The remains, likely a mix of Roman soldiers and Germanic tribesmen, show signs of battle wounds, suggesting a hasty burial after a major conflict. The discovery is the largest of its kind in Central Europe and offers unique insights into Roman warfare practices, as soldiers were typically cremated during that era. Experts hope further examination of the bones will reveal more details about the individuals and their roles in the conflict.</p>
