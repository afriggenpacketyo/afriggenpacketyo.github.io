        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that deporting noncitizens to Libya without due process would violate his existing court order. This decision came after reports that the White House considered such plans, prompting lawyers for a group of migrants to file an emergency motion to prevent deportations to Libya or Saudi Arabia. Judge Murphy clarified that any imminent removals to these countries would defy his previous preliminary injunction, which barred the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens to any country other than their origin without due process. The judge cited Libya's dangerous conditions, including crime, terrorism, and armed conflict, making deportations there a violation of the court's order.</p>

          <p>First Minister John Swinney has announced his opposition to the assisted dying bill currently before the Scottish Parliament, which seeks to allow terminally-ill individuals the option to end their lives with medical assistance. The bill, proposed by Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, requires that patients have a terminal illness and be deemed mentally fit by two doctors. Swinney's stance is expected to influence undecided MSPs, particularly within his own party, as they prepare to vote on the legislation. This marks the third time the Scottish Parliament has considered the issue, with previous attempts failing in 2010 and 2014. McArthur has adjusted the bill to raise the minimum age from 16 to 18, aligning with legislation in other countries, and urges MSPs to support the compassionate measure.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has accused Russia of continuing attacks across the entire front line, dismissing Vladimir Putin's declared three-day truce as a "farce." The truce, intended to coincide with Russia's Victory Day celebrations, was allegedly violated by Russian forces, who Ukraine claims carried out numerous ceasefire violations and assault operations. Despite Kyiv not agreeing to the truce, Russia has accused Ukraine of violating it, while maintaining that its own forces are strictly observing the ceasefire. The Ukrainian air force reported Russian guided bomb strikes on the Sumy region, further undermining the declared truce. The situation highlights the ongoing conflict and distrust between the two nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated Dr. Casey Means, an advocate of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s health agenda, to be the next U.S. Surgeon General. Means, who replaces the withdrawn Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, is known for her "MAHA" credentials, referring to Kennedy's "Make America Healthy Again" slogan. She co-founded Levels, a health app, and has criticized the food and drug industries, aligning with Kennedy's views on lifestyle choices and health conditions. While supported by Kennedy's allies, some within his anti-vaccine base express concern over Means' stance on mRNA vaccines. Means has previously voiced support for vaccine safety and questioned the current vaccine schedule, potentially causing health declines in children.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is predicted to reenter Earth's atmosphere imminently. The spacecraft, intended for a Venus mission, failed to leave Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction and has been gradually losing altitude. Experts estimate the half-ton object could land anywhere between 52 degrees north and south latitude, encompassing a vast area including parts of the United States, South America, Africa, and Europe. While the risk of impact is low, the possibility of the spacecraft, built to withstand Venus's atmosphere, surviving reentry raises concerns about a metal object falling from the sky.</p>

Carney will remain Prime Minister, succeeding Justin Trudeau earlier this year. Key rivals, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, both lost their seats. The Liberals won 168 seats, requiring 172 for a majority, while the Conservatives secured 144 seats. Increased support for the two largest parties came at the expense of smaller parties, particularly the NDP.

He also cautioned about a "modest" risk of stagflation due to the inflationary pressures and economic slowdown caused by higher tariffs. Griffin emphasized the importance of managing inflation and questioned whether Trump's economic program, encompassing trade, tax cuts, and deregulation, would generate necessary economic growth.</p>

Kendrick attributes this revised outlook to changing market dynamics, with flows becoming the dominant factor driving Bitcoin's price. He notes significant inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs and increasing allocation to Bitcoin by large investors. Bitcoin's price is currently approaching $100,000, supported by institutional money piling in.

In April, single-family offices made 40 direct investments, with half of those deals focused on AI. SandboxAQ, a quantitative AI firm, recently finalized a $450 million Series E round, attracting investments from billionaires and their family offices. These family offices, with their experience in tech and finance, provide valuable advice and support to deep-tech startups.

          <p>A Florida federal judge has dismissed most claims against celebrities and YouTubers who promoted the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The ruling narrows the scope of a lawsuit accusing high-profile figures like Tom Brady and Stephen Curry of marketing a fraudulent platform. The judge determined that the plaintiffs failed to prove the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried's misconduct. This decision clears the "Celebrity Defendants" and "YouTuber Defendants" of most claims, following allegations that they were paid millions to endorse FTX without disclosing their financial incentives.</p>

          <p>Health care providers across the U.S. are reporting a rise in appointment no-shows and increased anxiety among immigrant patients, stemming from fears of deportation. Since the Trump administration announced plans for mass deportations and rescinded protections for hospitals and clinics, many immigrants are forgoing necessary medical care. This trend is raising concerns about the spread of infectious diseases, worsening chronic conditions, and dangerous birth complications. Research indicates that immigration crackdowns correlate with poorer health outcomes and reduced access to public programs.
