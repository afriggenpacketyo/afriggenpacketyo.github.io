          <h2>Conscious Parenting Expert Offers Alternatives to Toxic Phrases That Cause Children to Refuse Listening</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 13:03:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reem Raouda, a conscious parenting expert, suggests alternative phrases to avoid toxic language that triggers defiance in children. She argues that traditional parenting phrases can activate a child's fight-or-flight response, hindering cooperation and learning. Instead of saying things like "Because I said so" or making threats, parents should explain their reasoning, acknowledge their child's feelings, and invite problem-solving. By creating conditions where cooperation feels natural, parents can foster respect, emotional safety, and involvement, ultimately raising emotionally resilient adults. The suggested phrases aim to honor a child's autonomy while still holding boundaries, promoting a deeper connection and understanding. Optimism in parenting may lead to more positive interactions.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, world leaders and organizations have expressed a range of reactions, from condemnation to cautious support. Israeli leaders lauded the strikes, while Iranian officials vowed retaliation and deemed the U.S. action a violation of the UN Charter. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres expressed grave alarm and urged de-escalation through diplomacy. Iran's allies, including Hamas and the Houthis, condemned the strikes and pledged to join in retaliation. Other nations, including Russia, China, the U.K., and EU members, called for dialogue, restraint, and a return to negotiations to prevent further escalation. The situation has heightened fears of a wider regional conflict.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has revealed details of "Operation Midnight Hammer," the U.S. mission targeting Iranian nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. According to officials, the operation involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers launching from Missouri, supported by fighter jets, refueling planes, and surveillance aircraft. The B-2s dropped GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) on Fordo and Natanz, while Tomahawk cruise missiles targeted Isfahan. The U.S. claims the strikes inflicted severe damage, and that Iranian forces did not engage during the mission. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the attack a success, emphasizing it did not target Iranian troops or civilians and was intended to deter Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

          <p>NATO member countries have reportedly agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of their GDP, a benchmark previously advocated by US President Donald Trump. Spain initially sought to block the measure but ultimately agreed to an exemption. The agreement is expected to be formally adopted during an upcoming NATO meeting in The Hague. With the exception of Spain, member nations will have until 2035 to meet the 5% target, with at least 3.5% allocated to core military needs and an additional 1.5% for related expenditure. This move signals a potential shift in the financial commitments of NATO members to defense.</p>

          <p>Iranians are expressing fear and anger following U.S. strikes on key nuclear sites, with many feeling paralyzed and caught by surprise. Some are defiant, vowing to stand by their country, while others express sorrow and rage over the situation. The strikes have occurred amid restricted internet access, limiting the flow of information and making communication difficult. The Iranian government has warned of "everlasting consequences" and declared that it reserves all options to defend itself. The Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) has described U.S. bases in the Middle East as "vulnerabilities, not strengths."</p>

          <p>Iranian authorities report no signs of off-site radiation or contamination following U.S. attacks on three nuclear sites, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi stated that no health consequences for people or the environment outside the targeted sites are expected at this time. The sites contained uranium enriched to different levels, but experts say the isotopes are at the low end of hazard regarding radioactive materials. The uranium was primarily in the form of uranium hexafluoride, a heavy gas that does not travel far through the air when released. Neighboring countries have also reported no abnormal radiation levels.</p>

Himes cautioned against premature celebration, citing historical parallels to previous U.S. military interventions in the Middle East.

Himes acknowledged the possibility of a positive outcome, but emphasized the potential for a worst-case scenario involving dead soldiers, a relocated nuclear program, and a broader conflict.

          <p>The U.S. military deployed multi-million-dollar, 30,000-pound "bunker busters" in a stealth strike against Iranian nuclear facilities on June 21, marking the weapon's first operational use. The Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs), also known as Guided Bomb Units (GBU-57), are GPS-guided weapons designed to penetrate deep into underground targets. The bombs, each weighing 30,000 pounds and costing millions to produce, were dropped by B-2 bombers on the Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan sites. The Pentagon reported that the strikes resulted in "extremely severe damage and destruction" to the targeted facilities. The B-2 bomber is the only aircraft capable of carrying the MOPs.</p>
