          <p>A New York City police officer and three civilians were fatally shot by a gunman inside a Midtown Manhattan office building. The suspect, identified as a 27-year-old from Las Vegas with a documented mental health history, later died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities report the gunman entered the Park Avenue building with an M4 rifle and began firing, killing Officer Didarul Islam and three others before taking his own life on an upper floor. The motive for the deadly attack is currently under investigation by law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi encouraged his new South Korean counterpart, Cho Hyun, to pursue an independent foreign policy and resist economic "decoupling." In their first official call, both ministers affirmed a commitment to advancing their strategic partnership in a stable and mature manner. The discussion signals Beijing's effort to reset relations with Seoul's new administration under President Lee Jae-myung, who is viewed as more open to China than his predecessor. The two sides agreed to cooperate to ensure the success of the upcoming Apec summit in Gyeongju.</p>

          <p>Singapore Airlines experienced a significant stock price drop after reporting a 59% decline in its first-quarter net profit, which fell to S$186 million. The company attributed the sharp decrease to lower interest income and losses from its associate, Air India, in which it holds a 25.1% stake. Analysts noted that Air India's losses were deeper than expected and could remain a drag on SIA's financials. Despite the profit plunge, the airline stated that demand for air travel remains strong, though some investment analysts have downgraded the stock, citing weaker cargo demand and higher operating costs.

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed to challenge a new Trump administration policy that mandates detention without bail for immigrants in the U.S. illegally while they await deportation proceedings. This reverses a long-standing practice of allowing individuals deemed not to be flight or safety risks to be released on bond. Advocacy groups argue the policy is a misinterpretation of the law and violates due process rights, causing irreparable harm by separating families and detaining individuals with deep community ties for extended periods. The administration contends the policy is necessary to close security loopholes and keep communities safe.</p>

          <p>USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA seeking an injunction to allow him to play in the upcoming season. After transferring to USC for his final year of eligibility, Wingfield's waiver request for an additional season was denied by the NCAA, jeopardizing a significant NIL opportunity and a starting role. The lawsuit challenges the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," arguing it is anticompetitive and unfairly penalizes him for disruptions caused by the pandemic and a previous injury. The outcome of the case could have a significant impact on USC's already thin offensive line.</p>

The system aims to level the playing field for reservations, which previously would be fully booked within minutes of becoming available. Would-be campers can now enter a free drawing for a chance to book a site, with unsuccessful applicants receiving points to increase their odds in future drawings. This change is part of a broader effort to reduce no-shows and make the state's coveted outdoor destinations more accessible.</p>

          <p>A 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel has expressed skepticism toward the Trump administration's defense of aggressive U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) tactics in Southern California. The hearing concerned a lower court's injunction that blocked agents from conducting "roving patrols" and using criteria like race or location as the sole basis for detention, finding it violates the 4th Amendment. Judges fiercely questioned the Justice Department's lawyer about the constitutionality of the sweeps, suggesting they may uphold the injunction. The case highlights the legal battle over the limits of federal immigration authority and is likely headed for the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A court in Bogotá has found former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe guilty of witness tampering and fraud, marking the first time an ex-president in the country has been criminally convicted. The charges, which carry a potential sentence of up to 12 years, stem from allegations that Uribe bribed witnesses to give false testimony in a separate investigation concerning his alleged ties to right-wing paramilitary groups. The highly politicized case originated in 2012 and has been a central issue in Colombian politics, reflecting deep divisions from the country's long-running armed conflict. Uribe has maintained his innocence and is expected to appeal the verdict.</p>

          <p>A garment factory in Lesotho, which previously manufactured Trump-branded apparel, is at risk of shutting down due to high import tariffs imposed by the U.S. government. The small African nation, a major producer of denim and other clothing for American brands, was hit with steep tariffs that threaten its largest private-sector employer. Workers at Precious Garments have already had their hours cut in half, and thousands of jobs in the country's textile industry are at risk. The situation has contributed to Lesotho declaring a national "state of disaster" as it grapples with the economic fallout and rising unemployment.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic argues that President Donald Trump's policy positions, particularly regarding the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, are heavily shaped by what he sees on television rather than intelligence briefings. Trump recently contradicted Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's claims of "no starvation" in Gaza, citing TV images of hungry children as evidence of "real starvation." This reliance on media makes him susceptible to public opinion and manipulation but also attunes him to the visceral impact of events. The author suggests this approach is dangerous in an age of misinformation and highlights the potential for a closed-loop information system as the administration seeks more control over broadcasters.</p>
