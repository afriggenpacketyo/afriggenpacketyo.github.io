          <p>Shigeo Nagashima, a celebrated figure in Japanese baseball, passed away at 89 due to pneumonia; he was known for his charismatic presence and pivotal role with the Yomiuri Giants during Japan's economic boom in the 1960s and 70s. Nagashima, nicknamed "Mr. Giants," captivated fans with his exceptional fielding and game-changing batting, and he was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988. Beyond his playing career, he managed the Giants and was set to manage Japan's Olympic team in 2004 before a stroke sidelined him. His legacy extends beyond sports, as his phrases became part of Japan's cultural lexicon, and he received the People's Honor Award in 2013. The impact of his baseball career is reflected in his numerous awards and accolades. </p>

          <p>South Korea is holding a snap presidential election following the removal of Yoon Suk Yeol, who faced rebellion charges for imposing martial law. Pre-election polls suggest Lee Jae-myung, a liberal candidate, is likely to win due to public dissatisfaction with conservatives; Kim Moon-soo, the main conservative candidate, has struggled to gain traction with moderate voters. The new president will immediately assume office for a five-year term, facing challenges such as a slowing economy and strained relations with North Korea. Lee advocates for patience with Trump's tariff policy, while Kim seeks a quick meeting with the U.S. president. </p>

          <p>San Diego officials are criticizing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) work raids at two Italian restaurants, during which agents used flash-bang grenades against protestors. The raids, which targeted alleged violations of hiring undocumented workers, led to the arrest of four individuals and sparked outrage from city officials. Mayor Todd Gloria and Councilmember Stephen Whitburn denounced the operation as an unnecessary and alarming show of force that undermines community trust. Councilmember Sean Elo-Rivera labeled the raids as "state-sponsored terrorism," while Stephen Miller, a former Trump advisor, accused the left of encouraging violence against law enforcement. </p>

          <p>A Trump administration memo issued in March instructed border and customs officials to curtail participation in diversity-related events. This directive further reduced efforts to promote a more diverse workforce within these agencies. The memo signals a shift away from initiatives aimed at fostering inclusivity and representation. The move reflects the administration's broader stance on diversity and inclusion policies.</p>

          <p>Grupo Firme canceled their appearance at Napa’s La Onda festival due to visa issues, joining a growing list of international musical acts facing similar challenges since President Trump took office. The Tijuana band announced that their visas were in an administrative process with the U.S. Embassy, making it impossible to perform. This cancellation follows similar incidents, including Mexican singer Julión Álvarez postponing a show due to visa revocation and the cancellation of Chicago’s Michelada Fest over visa concerns. In April, the U.S. State Department canceled the visas of Los Alegres del Barranco after they displayed images of a drug lord at a concert. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump has pardoned Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., two Florida shark divers convicted of theft for freeing sharks and a grouper from a fisherman’s longline. The men were convicted in 2022 for theft of property within special maritime jurisdiction after they released 19 sharks and a giant grouper, believing it was an illegal fishing line. Despite avoiding prison time, the felony convictions restricted their voting rights, firearm ownership, and international travel. The pardons erase those convictions, with attorneys for the divers celebrating the decision as justice finally prevailing. </p>

With international sales surging, Pop Mart has become a favorite among investors, with JPMorgan Chase initiating coverage with an overweight rating.

The playwright, Kimberly Belflower, was inspired by the MeToo movement and wanted to examine her own adolescence through a new lens.
