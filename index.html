        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously rejected a lawsuit filed by the Mexican government against American gun manufacturers, arguing they are responsible for the flow of illegal weapons into Mexico and the resulting violence by drug cartels. The court upheld a 2005 law that shields gun manufacturers from liability when their products are misused, overturning a lower court's ruling that had allowed the suit to proceed. Mexico had sought $10 billion in damages and the implementation of safety measures and sales restrictions on U.S.-made guns, but the court found that Mexico did not plausibly allege the manufacturers knowingly participated in the wrongdoing. Justice Kagan stated that merely knowing that bad actors misuse products does not constitute aiding and abetting, thus dismissing Mexico's claims. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US imports experienced a record 20% monthly drop in April due to tariffs imposed by President Trump, reflecting an abrupt impact on trade after companies rushed to import goods earlier in the year to avoid new taxes. Purchases from major trade partners like Canada and China fell to their lowest levels in years, according to the Commerce Department. This collapse in imports contributed to a record decline in the US trade deficit, which was cut by almost half. While analysts caution interpreting the figures due to earlier surges, the report indicates that tariffs have significantly affected trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. trade deficit experienced a record decrease in April, primarily due to a significant drop in import demand as companies and consumers reduced purchases ahead of President Trump's tariffs. The deficit decreased to $61.6 billion, a $76.7 billion reduction from the previous month, surpassing economists' expectations. This shift follows a surge in imports preceding Trump's announcement of widespread tariffs. While a reduced deficit might seem positive, some economists caution that it reflects decreased international trade, which has generally benefited the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump and his aides are using the incident to advocate for stricter immigration enforcement. However, the circumstances of Solimanâ€™s arrival and immigration status are more nuanced than the administration portrays. Soliman entered the U.S. legally on a visitor visa in 2022 and applied for asylum, a process that can leave applicants in legal limbo for years.</p>

          <p>NBA teams have seen an 8% increase in sponsorship revenue, reaching $1.62 billion this season, largely driven by the introduction and proliferation of sponsor patches on team jerseys. The number of jersey patch deals has more than doubled year-over-year, contributing over $80 million in new spending. The opening of the Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome has also boosted overall sponsorship revenue. Rakuten and JPMorgan Chase are the top-spending brands in the league, demonstrating the growing value and interest in NBA sponsorships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports on the significant decline in imports in April, attributing it to the impact of tariffs on international trade. Americans are purchasing fewer pharmaceuticals, cellphones, and cars from other countries, and have also reduced their procurement of foreign machinery and supplies. The decrease in imports highlights the economic consequences of the ongoing trade disputes and the imposition of tariffs by the Trump administration. The changes in trade patterns reflect broader shifts in global commerce and supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously sided with an Ohio woman, Marlean Ames, who claimed she was discriminated against by her employer, the Ohio Department of Youth Services, due to her heterosexual orientation. Ames alleged she was passed over for promotions and later demoted in favor of less qualified gay candidates, with her supervisor also being gay. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, writing for the court, stated that Ames was unfairly held to a higher legal standard as a member of a majority group. The ruling allows Ames' lawsuit to proceed, but does not guarantee a victory in her case.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a new travel ban for people from 12 countries, aiming to avoid the legal challenges faced by his original ban. Key differences include a broader scope and clearly defined exemptions, making it more legally robust. While there are similarities to the 2017 ban, the new order does not expressly target Muslim-majority states, potentially increasing its chances of being upheld by the Supreme Court. Legal experts note that Trump appears to have learned from the past, crafting a ban that is more likely to withstand legal scrutiny.</p>
