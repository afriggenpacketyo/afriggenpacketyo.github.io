          <p>The Edmonton Oilers are striving to end Canada's Stanley Cup drought, which dates back to 1993, as they face a critical Game 6 against the Florida Panthers in Miami. Despite a strong start to the series, the Oilers' recent loss has raised concerns that history may repeat itself, uniting Canadian fans in support of the team. The article delves into the reasons behind the losing streak, including the NHL's expansion into the U.S. and the draw of warmer climates and tax breaks for players. Amidst trade tensions between Canada and the U.S., a Canadian win would be a symbolic victory.</p>

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee's version of President Trump's tax and spending bill differs significantly from the House-passed version, potentially leading to a conflict between the two chambers. Key sticking points include the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, Medicaid work requirements, and the child tax credit amount. The Senate proposal includes a $5 trillion increase to the federal debt limit, which faces opposition from some Republicans. The bill also phases out Inflation Reduction Act tax credits more slowly than the House version, setting the stage for contentious negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Colorado found MyPillow founder Mike Lindell defamed a former employee of Dominion Voting Systems, awarding the employee $2.3 million in damages. Lindell, a prominent election conspiracy theorist, called the employee a traitor and accused him of stealing the 2020 election on his online platform. The employee, Eric Coomer, said his career and life were destroyed by the false statements, with Lindell's lawyers arguing his statements were protected by the First Amendment. Lindell continues to falsely claim the election was stolen, despite recounts and audits affirming the results.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have released details on their version of President Trump's tax bill, revealing key differences from the House-passed version, which may create a legislative standoff. The Senate proposal includes steeper cuts to Medicaid, permanently extends the $10,000 state and local tax deduction, and increases the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. These changes have already drawn criticism from House Republicans, who have threatened to withhold their support. Republican leaders aim to get the legislation to the president's desk by early July, but significant hurdles remain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's comments on the Israel-Iran conflict have been ambiguous, ranging from supporting Israeli strikes to distancing himself from them, adding uncertainty to the escalating situation. Netanyahu has pressured Trump to take a military approach, while others argue for a diplomatic solution through a deal between the U.S. and Iran. Trump's options include escalating the conflict, holding the course, or pulling back, with domestic political factors and the views of his supporters influencing his decision-making process. The abandonment of planned talks with Iran reflects the complexity of the situation.</p>
