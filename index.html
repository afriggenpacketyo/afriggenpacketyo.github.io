          <h2>Psychologist Highlights the Most Damaging Phrase in Relationships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 12:50:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [someone else]?" as highly detrimental to relationships. This comparison, whether to an ex-partner, friend, or even a past version of the current partner, communicates that the person is not enough. The article suggests that such comparisons stem from a fear of openly expressing needs and frustrations. Instead of making comparisons, the article suggests that couples should communicate their needs directly and clearly to foster a healthier and more secure relationship environment, which is crucial for long-term happiness and fulfillment.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated a willingness to lower tariffs on China due to the current high levies impeding business between the two nations. He acknowledged that the existing tariffs, some as high as 145%, have significantly disrupted trade and negatively impacted both economies. Trump noted economic challenges in China, including a contraction in factory activity, suggesting that China is eager to resume trade. He emphasized that any future trade agreement must be fair, signaling a potential shift in his administration's trade strategy to alleviate economic pressures and foster renewed business engagement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly canceled over $800 million in NIH grants related to LGBTQ+ health, impacting research on cancers and sexually transmitted infections disproportionately affecting this community. The cuts align with the administration's opposition to diversity programs and gender-affirming care, sparking concerns about ideological bias in scientific funding. Critics argue that the move creates a hierarchy of patients and undermines efforts to address significant health disparities. The NIH defended the cuts, stating that the terminated research no longer aligns with agency priorities, while scientists warn of potential harm to vulnerable populations and the resurgence of preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>Aid organizations warn of an escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza as Israel's blockade on aid deliveries continues, leading to severe shortages of food, medicine, and essential supplies. Residents report living in constant fear of bombing, struggling to find food, and facing exorbitant prices for basic necessities. The UN and aid groups accuse Israel of using humanitarian aid as a political tool, with the health care system on the brink of collapse. The blockade, part of Israel's strategy to pressure Hamas, has left Gaza's population of 2.2 million almost entirely dependent on external aid.</p>
