          <p>The U.S. housing market is showing signs of cooling, with a new report indicating modest home price declines in some metro areas compared to the 2022 peak. The South and West, including cities like Austin and Miami, are experiencing the most significant price drops due to higher housing inventory and new construction. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to face limited inventory and rising prices, creating a distinctly divided national real estate landscape. The article attributes these regional disparities primarily to fundamental supply and demand dynamics across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

While revenue of $7.69 billion surpassed estimates, adjusted earnings per share were one cent below the forecast. The company is a key competitor to Nvidia in the AI chip market but has faced challenges from U.S. export controls on its China-focused products. Strong performance in its Client and Gaming segment, driven by new CPUs, helped boost overall sales figures for the period. (not investment advice)</p>

The freeze affects hundreds of grants for critical research in areas like cancer and neuroscience.

While faculty and UC system leaders are considering all options, including a potential lawsuit, the immediate focus is on dialogue to resolve the issue and restore the vital funding.</p>

          <p>As Texas Democrats remain out of state to block a Republican-led redistricting vote, questions loom over Governor Greg Abbott's legal authority to remove them from office. Abbott has threatened to use a nonbinding attorney general opinion to declare their seats vacant, while the House Speaker has issued civil arrest warrants. However, political science experts note that Texas law provides limited avenues for removing lawmakers, primarily through expulsion by a two-thirds vote. The Democrats maintain their quorum break is a constitutionally permitted tactic to protest the proposed maps.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is intensifying his campaign to lower prescription drug prices, sending letters to major pharmaceutical companies urging compliance with a previous executive order. The order aims to establish price targets and potentially use enforcement actions against non-compliance. However, experts note the administration has limited direct authority to force price changes, suggesting the effort relies heavily on public pressure. The move comes as drug prices have significantly outpaced inflation, but critics argue it amounts to government price controls without congressional approval, a historically problematic policy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department is preparing to seek hate crime charges and the death penalty against the man accused of murdering two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, D.C. Prosecutors are expected to present the case against Elias Rodriguez to a grand jury this week for the May shooting outside the Capitol Jewish Museum. Rodriguez was initially charged with murder, but securing a hate crime indictment will require proving the act was motivated by antisemitism. The suspect allegedly shouted pro-Palestinian slogans during the incident and told police he "did it for Palestine."</p>

          <p>Snap's shares fell by 15% after the company's second-quarter earnings report revealed a key metric, average revenue per user (ARPU), missed analyst expectations. Although total revenue and daily active users met or slightly exceeded forecasts, the lower-than-expected ARPU signaled weakness in its advertising monetization. The company provided a third-quarter revenue forecast that was ahead of estimates but also reported a net loss of $262.6 million for the quarter. In response to the results, Snap announced a restructuring of its engineering teams to better support business functions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential interest earnings of depositing $10,000 into either a 3-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. While a high-yield savings account might currently offer a slightly higher rate and thus marginally more interest over three months, its rate is variable and could decrease. In contrast, a CD locks in a guaranteed rate, providing certainty in a climate of potential interest rate cuts. The article concludes that the choice depends on an individual's need for liquidity versus the security of a fixed return. (not investment advice)</p>

The article also suggests comparing a HELOC with a fixed-rate home equity loan, which offers rate stability and a lump-sum payment.

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has tentatively agreed to a $500,000 settlement with two journalists from Knock LA who were arrested while covering a 2021 protest over the removal of a homeless encampment in Echo Park. The reporters alleged their First Amendment rights were violated when LAPD officers arrested them despite their identification as press. While the city does not admit wrongdoing, the settlement averts a federal trial. The journalists' attorney noted that despite the lawsuit, the LAPD's treatment of reporters at recent protests suggests its culture has not fundamentally changed.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell are formally opposing the Justice Department's effort to unseal grand jury testimony related to her case, arguing it would violate her due process rights. In a court filing, her legal team stated that Maxwell is alive and her legal options are still viable, unlike the late Jeffrey Epstein. They contend that releasing the "untested, hearsay-laden" transcripts while her case is pending before the Supreme Court would be prejudicial. The filing also notes that Maxwell has not been permitted to review the materials herself to assess their content.</p>

          <p>The political fight over redistricting in Texas carries significant national weight, as it could directly impact the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives. Republicans, backed by Donald Trump, are pushing for a new map that could grant them up to five additional seats, a crucial margin given their current narrow majority. This has prompted Texas Democrats to flee the state to block the vote. In response, Democratic leaders in states like California and New York have threatened to counter with their own partisan gerrymandering, setting the stage for a nationwide battle.</p>

The committee is seeking depositions and documents to scrutinize the federal government's handling of the investigation and prosecution of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. This move intensifies congressional focus on the case following a recent Justice Department memo that concluded Epstein did not have a "client list," a finding that angered some lawmakers and prompted calls for greater transparency.</p>

This policy is part of the Trump administration's broader agenda to tighten immigration controls and may be expanded to other countries.

          <p>A new spending bill signed by President Trump will introduce changes to the tax deduction for charitable giving, primarily affecting high-income filers starting in 2026. The legislation establishes a "floor," allowing deductions only on donations exceeding 0.5% of adjusted gross income, and it also caps the benefit for those in the top 37% tax bracket. Financial planners suggest these changes may encourage taxpayers to "bunch" several years of donations into 2025 to take advantage of the current, more generous rules, possibly through donor-advised funds.

          <p>A new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science reveals that parts of the Great Barrier Reef have suffered their largest-ever annual decline in coral cover. The survey found that widespread coral bleaching, driven primarily by climate change-induced heat stress, was the main cause. While cyclones and starfish outbreaks contributed, the unprecedented heat caused the most extensive and severe bleaching recorded to date. Scientists warn the reef may be approaching a tipping point where it can no longer recover between these catastrophic events, facing a volatile future.</p>
