          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail in May, has been apprehended in Atlanta following a brief stand-off. His capture was the result of a coordinated effort involving multiple law enforcement agencies, with tips leading authorities to his location. Groves, convicted of second-degree murder, faces life in prison and additional charges for his escape, which officials called a serious breach of public safety. Authorities are now investigating who may have assisted him during his time on the run.</p>

          <p>A nor'easter is forecast to potentially impact the East Coast this weekend and into next week, bringing a range of severe weather conditions including heavy rain, gusty winds, rough surf, and coastal flooding. The precise track of the storm is still uncertain, with possibilities ranging from a quick movement up the Northeast to a slower path affecting the Carolinas, Maryland, and Delaware. Regardless of its exact trajectory, coastal areas from the Carolinas northward should prepare for localized flash flooding, significant beach erosion, and strong wind gusts. Authorities urge vigilance as the storm's development continues to be monitored.</p>

His top negotiators, including Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, are currently in Egypt for indirect talks based on a 20-point peace proposal. Trump expressed optimism about the progress, despite the trip potentially coinciding with a federal government shutdown. The negotiations aim to secure a peace agreement, with Hamas having accepted some elements of the U.S.-led plan.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, has been arrested and charged in Florida for allegedly starting the Pacific Palisades fire in Los Angeles, which killed 12 people and destroyed thousands of homes. Investigators found an image he generated on ChatGPT depicting a burning city, along with other digital evidence. The fire, initially a smaller blaze on New Year's Day, rekindled a week later due to strong winds.

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney and US President Donald Trump reportedly discussed the potential revival of the Keystone XL pipeline project during their recent meeting in Washington. Carney raised the issue in the context of US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, finding Trump receptive to the idea. The pipeline, designed to transport oil from Alberta to Nebraska, was previously approved but later blocked by both the Obama and Biden administrations. Despite the company behind it having "moved on," the preliminary discussions signal renewed political interest in the controversial project. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>California Challenges Trump's Deployment of National Guard to Illinois</h2>

          <p>California is challenging President Trump's deployment of its National Guard, arguing that the White House used claims of Los Angeles unrest as a pretext for a nationwide expansion, now including Illinois. Trump sent 14 California Guard soldiers to Illinois to train other state troops, escalating a dispute over federal versus state control of military forces. Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the actions as an "illegal charade" against American values. Federal officials intend to extend the federalization of 300 California Guard members, prompting legal challenges from both California and Oregon regarding the scope of presidential power.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has entered its second week after the Senate once again rejected both Republican and Democratic funding proposals. Dueling stopgap bills, one from the GOP to fund the government through November and another from Democrats with additional healthcare funding, failed to pass for the sixth time. Leaders from both parties blame each other for the impasse, with Republicans demanding a short-term measure and Democrats pushing for healthcare extensions. The White House has warned of potential federal worker firings and initially floated denying back pay, highlighting the severe consequences of the ongoing political gridlock.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In October, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is significantly cheaper than a credit card for borrowing, with average credit card interest rates at 22.25% compared to a median HELOC rate of 7.89%. This disparity makes HELOCs a preferred option for homeowners needing substantial funding, especially since both products have variable rates that could respond to future Federal Reserve cuts. Additionally, HELOCs offer potential tax benefits for qualifying home repair projects, further enhancing their cost-effectiveness over credit cards.

This inquiry expands congressional oversight of the disaster response and politically targets Governor Gavin Newsom's office, which is supported by the charity.

          <p>Gold prices have surged to a record $4,000 an ounce, indicating growing investor unease over U.S. economic and political stability, despite strong stock market performance. This rally is attributed to factors like the ongoing government shutdown, which fuels economic uncertainty and limits data visibility. Expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts also make gold more attractive as a safe-haven asset and inflation hedge. Additionally, strong global central bank demand, driven by geopolitical tensions and a desire to reduce dollar exposure, significantly contributes to the metal's climb. (not investment advice)</p>
