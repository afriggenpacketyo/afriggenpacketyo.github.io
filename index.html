          <h2>Nike's Air Jordan 1s Face Potential Price Hikes Due to Trump Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-04 23:55:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's tariffs on goods from Asia, where Nike manufactures most of its shoes, have caused concerns about potential price increases for the iconic Air Jordan 1s. Nike's shares initially fell after the tariff announcement, and analysts predict a 10-15% price increase is likely, although Nike may try to mitigate this by downgrading shoe technology or refreshing designs less frequently. While some believe Nike's brand strength allows for price hikes, others worry about decreased consumer confidence and demand, especially as US consumers account for a significant portion of Nike's sales. Ultimately, the extent of price increases will depend on the persistence of the tariff war and how trading partners react. (not investment advice)

          <p>The L.A. Dodgers' planned visit to the White House to celebrate their World Series championship has ignited controversy, with some players and fans expressing concerns about the Trump administration. Shortstop Mookie Betts, who boycotted a White House visit during Trump's first term, initially found it difficult to decide whether to attend. While some fans object to the visit due to Trump's policies, others argue that the team should honor tradition and celebrate their victory. The Dodgers' manager, Dave Roberts, is trying to avoid the political fray, focusing on recognizing the team's achievement.</p>

          <p>President Trump has granted TikTok a second 75-day extension to comply with a law requiring the app to sell its US operations or face a ban. The administration hopes to broker a deal for American ownership, but ByteDance states that key matters need resolution and Chinese law approval is necessary. The extension comes after a previous deal reportedly fell apart due to Trump's global tariffs, raising questions about the future of the popular social media platform in the US. The administration cites national security concerns related to potential Chinese government access to user data as the main reason for the pressure.</p>

          <p>Gen. Timothy Haugh, head of the National Security Agency (NSA) and U.S. Cyber Command, has been fired by the Trump administration, raising concerns about U.S. cybersecurity. Right-wing personality Laura Loomer reportedly played a role in Haugh's dismissal, which was also influenced by his perceived ties to retired Gen. Mark Milley. The administration is considering splitting the NSA and Cyber Command, and Haugh's firing has drawn criticism from intelligence committee leaders who fear it undermines national security at a time of increasing cyber threats.</p>

          <p>Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman believes there's an advantage to developing AI models that are "three or six months behind" the cutting edge, citing lower costs and the ability to focus on specific use cases. Microsoft relies on partnerships with companies like OpenAI and CoreWeave, incorporating their latest systems into products like Copilot. Suleyman emphasizes the importance of long-term self-sufficiency in AI for Microsoft, while maintaining a strong partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft's strategy involves carefully selecting the most valuable AI advancements and integrating them effectively, rather than striving to be first to market with every new model.
