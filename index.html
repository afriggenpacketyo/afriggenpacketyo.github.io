          <p>Arkansas State Police have arrested a 28-year-old man in connection with the double homicide at Devil's Den State Park. The suspect is charged with two counts of capital murder for the deaths of a couple who were attacked while hiking with their two young daughters. The children, ages 7 and 9, were physically unharmed and are now with family members. Authorities have not released a motive for the attack, but hailed the arrest as taking a "monster off the streets" and providing some relief to the community.</p>

As part of the deal, South Korea will invest $350 billion in the U.S., though interpretations differ on how the funds will be utilized, with Seoul aiming to support its own industries' entry into the American market. The agreement also includes a commitment from South Korea to purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy products, while U.S. goods will not face any new tariffs.

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a significant downturn in its second-quarter earnings, with operating profit falling by more than half compared to the previous year. The decline was primarily driven by a staggering 94% plunge in profits from its crucial chip division, which faced challenges from inventory adjustments and export restrictions. Despite the steep drop, the company expressed optimism for a gradual recovery in the second half of the year, fueled by growing demand in AI and robotics. The mobile division, however, showed positive growth with strong sales of its Galaxy S25 and A series smartphones. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A failure in the United Kingdom's air traffic control system caused widespread travel chaos, leading to the cancellation of over 150 flights and grounding thousands more. The national provider, NATS, apologized for the "radar-related" issue, which it claims was resolved within 20 minutes by switching to a backup system. However, airlines including Ryanair and EasyJet expressed significant frustration, with Ryanair's leadership calling for the resignation of the NATS CEO. This incident has revived concerns about the resilience of critical travel infrastructure, echoing a similar major outage that occurred less than two years ago.</p>

CEO Rene Haas also confirmed that Arm is exploring designing its own chip components or even full chips, a strategic shift that could turn current customers into competitors. The company noted that potential future tariffs could indirectly impact demand for products containing its technology, though it expects limited direct effects. (not investment advice)</p>

The PMI registered at 49.3, below the 50-point threshold that separates growth from contraction, signaling persistent weakness in the world's second-largest economy. The National Bureau of Statistics attributed the downturn to seasonal factors, extreme weather, and ongoing trade tensions with the United States. The data, showing contracting sub-indexes for new orders and employment, was released after a high-level Politburo meeting that did not indicate plans for major new economic stimulus.

          <p>A significant diplomatic shift is underway as key U.S. allies, including Canada, France, and the United Kingdom, announce intentions to formally recognize a Palestinian state. This move creates a clear divergence from the United States' long-standing position and reflects growing international frustration with the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The announcements were made during a French-Saudi-led conference at the United Nations, which the Trump administration boycotted, calling it an anti-Israel "publicity stunt." This growing chasm highlights the lack of a coherent, internationally-backed U.S. plan for the future governance of Gaza and long-term peace.</p>

          <p>Since Donald Trump's return to the White House, his administration's aggressive tariff policies have significantly impacted the U.S. economy, according to a BBC Verify analysis. The average U.S. tariff rate has reached its highest level in nearly a century, tripling monthly government revenue from import taxes. However, instead of shrinking the trade deficit as intended, the policies have so far widened it, as U.S. firms stockpiled goods in anticipation of the tariffs. While China's exports to the U.S. have decreased, many economists warn that the tariffs will ultimately lead to higher consumer prices for Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas has been arrested and charged with operating an illegal, high-stakes poker ring from his Los Angeles-area home. Prosecutors allege that Arenas, nicknamed "Agent Zero," rented out his mansion for the games and directed co-defendants to collect a "rake" from the pots. The indictment also claims co-defendants hired women to provide companionship to players and armed security for the events. Arenas has pleaded not guilty to three federal charges and was released on a $50,000 bond pending trial, where he could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>Following the major earthquake off Russia's coast, this article explains the science behind tsunamis. These powerful waves are typically generated by large, shallow underwater earthquakes, particularly those with strong vertical motion that displaces the seafloor. The recent 8.8-magnitude quake possessed all these characteristics, warranting immediate Pacific-wide warnings. Tsunamis travel at jet-plane speeds in the deep ocean but slow down and build in height as they approach shallower coastal waters, where they become most dangerous. While forecasting remains challenging, scientists use a network of tide gauges and deep-ocean sensors to better predict their arrival and potential impact.</p>

          <p>A scientific expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered and filmed what they describe as "thriving communities" of life at depths of over 9 kilometers in the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese-led research team observed dense beds of clams, mats of bacteria, and fields of tube worms, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are not fueled by sunlight but by chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from the Earth's crust. The findings suggest that such chemosynthetic communities may be widespread in the planet's deepest regions.</p>

          <p>A group of UK scientists is challenging the widely held belief that screen time is inherently harmful to children's brains, arguing that concrete scientific evidence for negative outcomes is lacking. Psychology professor Pete Etchells and others point out that much of the research relies on flawed self-reporting and often confuses correlation with causation. While some studies suggest links to mental health issues, others have found little to no connection, indicating factors like loneliness may be more significant. The debate highlights the complexity of the issue, as the term "screen time" encompasses a wide range of activities, from passive viewing to interactive learning and socializing.</p>

The high-resolution scans revealed crisp, uniform decorations of leopards, a stag, and mythical creatures on the woman from the nomadic Pazyryk culture. Researchers, collaborating with a tattooist specializing in ancient methods, concluded that the designs were sophisticated and would be challenging even for modern artists. The findings suggest the tattoos were likely stenciled before being applied with multi-pointed tools, shedding new light on the artistry and cultural practices of this ancient warrior society.</p>

French ministers condemned the "brutal" handcuffing of the group's female leader by Spanish police and the "antisemitic" remarks of a Spanish minister who called the teens "Israeli brats." The airline, Vueling, maintains the group was removed for disruptive behavior, including mishandling safety equipment, an account disputed by other passengers. The incident has sparked allegations of antisemitism, which both the airline and Spanish police deny, as France's foreign minister expressed "deep concern" to Vueling's CEO.</p>

          <p>Texas Republicans are moving forward with a plan to redraw the state's congressional districts five years ahead of the typical schedule, a move prompted by a request from Donald Trump.

The plan has faced strong resistance from Texas voters and Democrats, who are threatening a retaliatory "gerrymandering war."
