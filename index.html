            <p>US envoy Steve Witkoff met with Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg to discuss a potential settlement in Ukraine, coinciding with Donald Trump's urging for a ceasefire. The meeting, which lasted over four hours, focused on normalizing relations and finding a resolution to the conflict. This comes as Trump's Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg denied suggesting a partition of the country. Meanwhile, European nations agreed to provide â‚¬21 billion in military aid to Kyiv, and Ukrainian President Zelensky accused the Kremlin of prolonging the war, alleging the involvement of Chinese nationals in the Russian army.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronics from global tariffs, a move intended to protect American consumers from price increases. This decision comes after China and the United States exchanged tariff increases, with China planning to raise tariffs on U.S. goods. However, these electronics remain subject to a 20% tariff related to fentanyl. The White House emphasizes that America cannot rely on China for critical technologies and is encouraging companies to onshore manufacturing.</p>

            <p>While certain technology sectors received tariff exemptions, the 145% tariffs on Chinese imports are expected to cause irreversible damage to many American businesses. Canceled freight orders and abandoned shipments are becoming common as businesses halt container exports. Lower-margin goods cannot be sustainably produced in China, leading to potential product shortages and lost sales. Experts warn that small businesses are particularly vulnerable to these disruptions.</p>

            <p>The announcement of the "de-extinction" of the dire wolf by Colossal Biosciences has sparked debate about the ethics and priorities of resurrecting extinct species. Critics argue that resources would be better spent on conserving existing endangered animals. Reviving long-dead creatures raises ethical concerns about animal welfare and the impact on ecosystems. A study suggests that de-extinction efforts could lead to the extinction of other species due to resource allocation.</p>

            <p>Former President Barack Obama's preference for medium-well steak continues to be a point of contention among steak purists. While many believe that cooking a steak beyond medium results in a tougher, less flavorful cut, Obama maintains that it's simply how he enjoys it. His steak order, while controversial, aligns with food safety guidelines, as it requires an internal temperature that minimizes the risk of bacteria. In contrast, current President Donald Trump prefers his steak well-done with ketchup.</p>
