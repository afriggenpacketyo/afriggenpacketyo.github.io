          <p>A tour bus carrying 63 passengers collided with a disabled SUV on State Route 60 in Hacienda Heights, resulting in one fatality and injuries to 32 others. The driver of the SUV died at the scene after being trapped in the burning vehicle, while two bus passengers were critically injured. The tour bus was en route to Koreatown from Morongo Valley when the collision occurred, and the initial investigation suggests that the bus driver, Sui Sheng Du, rear-ended the stalled SUV, causing it to burst into flames. Authorities have ruled out alcohol and drugs as factors in the crash, and the incident is still under investigation.</p>

The article highlights the story of Adaline, an 8-year-old with Down syndrome, whose educational experience in Oklahoma contrasts sharply with that of Louisa, a child with Down syndrome in Ohio, illustrating the potential disparities that could arise without federal oversight, emphasizing the importance of inclusive education and robust federal monitoring to ensure equal opportunities for students with disabilities.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States and China have made 'substantial progress' in trade talks held in Geneva, with further details expected to be released on Monday. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer indicated that a 'deal' addressing national security concerns regarding China's trade practices had been reached, though it remains unclear whether tariffs would be reduced. The talks, aimed at easing tensions from the ongoing trade war, have significant implications for the global economy, which has been disrupted by tariffs imposed by both countries. Economists have warned that the trade dispute could slow global growth and fuel inflation, potentially leading to a recession.</p>
