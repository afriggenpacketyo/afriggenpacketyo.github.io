          <p>Former NFL player and current FOX Sports analyst Mark Sanchez is in stable condition after being injured in a reported stabbing incident in Indianapolis. The event occurred early Saturday morning before a game between the Colts and Raiders. FOX Sports confirmed his hospitalization and stable condition in a statement but did not detail the nature of the incident, asking for privacy for Sanchez and his family. The initial report of a stabbing came from TMZ Sports, and medical teams are being credited for their exceptional care.</p>

          <p>After decades of operation, the pharmacy chain Rite Aid has announced the closure of all its locations nationwide. The company posted a notice on its website thanking customers for their support over the years. This decision follows two bankruptcy filings in less than two years, the most recent being in May, as the company struggled with significant debt and litigation. Since October 2023, Rite Aid had already closed over 520 stores and faced a Justice Department complaint over its handling of controlled substance prescriptions.</p>

          <p>Populist billionaire Andrej Babiš and his ANO movement have won the Czech parliamentary election with 35% of the vote, marking a significant political comeback. This victory signals a potential shift in the country's foreign policy, aligning it more closely with the pro-Russian stances of Hungary and Slovakia and away from its current support for Ukraine. The incumbent pro-Western coalition led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala came in second, while several smaller parties, including an anti-migrant group, also secured seats, offering potential coalition partners for Babiš.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is considering a draft design for a $1 coin to commemorate the 250th anniversary of American independence, featuring former President Donald Trump. The proposed coin displays Trump with a clenched fist and the words "fight, fight, fight," referencing his response to an assassination attempt during his 2024 campaign. U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach confirmed the draft's authenticity, though a Treasury spokesperson noted it is not the final design. The proposal has emerged amid Trump's low approval ratings and criticism of his economic policies.</p>

The Met Office has issued an amber wind warning for northern Scotland, with gusts reaching up to 96mph in some areas. The storm has also been linked to a weather-related death in the Republic of Ireland. Authorities have closed London's royal parks as a precaution, and rail and ferry services have seen widespread cancellations due to the severe conditions.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) has officially installed Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, a historic moment for the predominantly white denomination. Curry, who was elected in July, succeeds Rev. Elizabeth Eaton, the church's first female leader. His installation comes as the ELCA, like other mainline Protestant denominations, faces challenges of declining membership. Leaders within the church view his election as a significant step, hoping his presence will inspire greater diversity and help the denomination connect more deeply across its congregations.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 355 people during a protest in support of Palestine Action, a group proscribed by the government as a terrorist organization. The demonstration, organized by Defend Our Juries, proceeded in Trafalgar Square despite calls from police and politicians to postpone it following a recent deadly synagogue attack in Manchester. Organizers stated that canceling the event would be "letting terror win." The majority of arrests were for supporting a proscribed organization, a process that required a significant police presence of around 1,500 officers.</p>

          <p>During the ongoing government shutdown, Democrats are actively refuting Republican claims that their funding proposals aim to provide "free healthcare for illegals." Democratic leaders like Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries have emphasized that federal law already prohibits using funds from programs like Medicaid and the ACA for undocumented immigrants. The Democratic bill seeks to reverse cuts affecting lawfully present noncitizens, such as refugees and asylum seekers, who are at risk of losing coverage under recent Republican legislation. This debate highlights the parties' differing strategies, with Republicans focusing on immigration and Democrats on protecting healthcare access.</p>

Panelists on a Washington Week discussion noted that Trump is also using the shutdown as an opportunity to advance his goal of deconstructing the administrative state. However, some within his circle reportedly fear potential public blowback if these efforts go too far, as the threat of layoffs looms for many federal workers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the prosecution of Salvadoran national Kilmar Ábrego García on human-smuggling charges may constitute illegal retaliation by the Department of Justice. The judge granted a discovery request, citing "some evidence that the prosecution... may be vindictive," following Ábrego's successful lawsuit against the Trump administration for his wrongful deportation. The ruling highlighted public statements by administration officials that seemed to link the charges directly to his legal victory. The case has become a focal point in the political conflict over the administration's aggressive immigration and deportation policies.</p>

          <p>The luxury department store Harrods has set aside more than £60 million for a compensation scheme for alleged victims of historical abuse by its former owner, the late Mohamed Al Fayed. The redress program, open until March 2026, is expected to provide payments to over 100 former employees who claim they suffered sexual assault by Fayed, who owned the store from 1985 to 2010. The allocation of £57 million for compensation and £5.3 million for costs contributed to Harrods reporting a £34.3 million loss in its latest fiscal year.</p>

          <p>A civil rights alliance in Pakistan-administered Kashmir has called off days of violent protests after reaching an agreement with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which left at least 10 people dead, were organized to demand cheaper wheat, reduced electricity tariffs, and an end to lavish benefits for the political elite. Under the new deal, the regional government has agreed to meet these demands and improve public services. The alliance leader urged protesters to disperse, expressing gratitude for the government's willingness to resolve the issues that had fueled the unrest.</p>

          <p>A Chinese military journal has detailed the development of new unmanned underwater systems described as intelligent and 'disruptive.' According to the article, these systems are designed for stealth, operating below 90 decibels to evade enemy sonar detection.

The report indicates a significant advancement in the People's Liberation Army Navy's capabilities, showcasing new unmanned submersibles, surface vessels, and minelaying systems that enhance its underwater combat potential.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has thrown the national park system into a state of confusion, with thousands of employees furloughed and many parks either fully closed or operating with minimal staff. While a Department of the Interior plan allows for some areas like roads and trails to remain accessible, essential services are halted, leading to visitor frustration and safety concerns. Parks like Mesa Verde are completely closed, while others like Yosemite and Grand Canyon remain partially open but without fee collection or regular maintenance. This situation risks damage to natural resources and economic losses for nearby communities.</p>

          <p>Small U.S. college towns are facing economic strain due to a sharp decline in international student enrollment, a trend exacerbated by the Trump administration's immigration policies. Universities like Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, have seen their international student populations plummet, resulting in potential revenue losses of over $140 million. Stricter visa vetting processes and fears of deportation have deterred many students, who are now choosing to study in other countries. This downturn threatens the economies of towns that depend on the financial contributions and cultural diversity these students bring.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is causing severe financial hardship for low-wage hourly contractors who work in federal buildings but are not guaranteed back pay like direct federal employees. Many of these workers, including cafeteria staff and cleaners, live paycheck to paycheck and are now facing the inability to pay for basic necessities like housing and food. Labor unions are highlighting the disproportionate impact on these workers, who risk falling into debt or losing their homes as the shutdown continues. For many, this situation revives the financial trauma experienced during the record-long shutdown in 2018.</p>

          <p>North Dakota's Republican insurance commissioner, Jon Godfread, is urging Congress to act quickly to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which are at the center of the government shutdown debate. He warns that the window is "rapidly closing" before the open enrollment period begins, and failure to act could cause insurance premiums to more than double for millions of Americans. Godfread, representing a consensus among state insurance regulators, emphasizes that delaying a fix will make it difficult to bring consumers back to the marketplace after they have been priced out, potentially destabilizing the entire system.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has abruptly fired Navy Chief of Staff Jon Harrison, a key aide in the Trump administration's efforts to reshape the Pentagon. Harrison, appointed in January, was reportedly instrumental in changes aimed at limiting the budgetary influence of the Navy undersecretary. His dismissal occurred just days after a new undersecretary was confirmed, following reports that Harrison and the Navy Secretary had reassigned aides to reduce the undersecretary's power. This firing is the latest in a series of leadership shake-ups at the Pentagon under Hegseth's tenure.</p>
