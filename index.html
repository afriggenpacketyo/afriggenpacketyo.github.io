          <p>A recent war game in Taipei revealed significant weaknesses in Taiwan's defenses, particularly in its outer perimeter and eastern regions.  The simulation, involving experts from Taiwan, the US, and China, highlighted the speed of a potential PLA assault.  The results of the exercise, including whether Taiwan was successfully defended, haven't been publicly released, but a full report is expected. This underscores growing concerns about Taiwan's vulnerability to a Chinese attack.</p>

          <p>Around 200 Marines have been deployed to Los Angeles to protect federal property and personnel following protests against immigration enforcement operations.  This deployment, challenged in court by California's governor, marks a rare instance of active-duty military on US soil.  While the Marines' mission is to protect federal assets, an incident involving the temporary detention of a US Army veteran highlights the complex situation. The situation is highly contentious, with the mayor of Los Angeles denouncing both the military presence and the ICE raids.</p>

          <p>A study published in Nature Machine Intelligence suggests that large language models (LLMs) can spontaneously develop human-like cognitive abilities.  Specifically, the research indicates LLMs can create systems for understanding and categorizing natural objects, a key aspect of human cognition.  This finding provides new evidence in the ongoing debate about the cognitive capabilities of AI, suggesting that artificial systems mirroring human thought processes may be achievable.  The study focuses on the potential of LLMs to reflect key aspects of human thinking.</p>
