          <p>Devastating flash floods in central Texas have resulted in at least 43 deaths, including 15 children, with dozens more, primarily from a children's summer camp, still missing. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, swelling over 26 feet in under an hour, catching communities and campers by surprise in what officials are calling a "mass casualty event." Massive search and rescue operations are underway, involving over 160 air rescues and hundreds of first responders. The disaster has prompted a federal disaster declaration to provide state and local officials with extensive resources for the ongoing crisis.</p>

          <p>England's Lionesses began their Euro 2025 title defense with a 2-1 loss to France, raising concerns about their performance and strategy. Pundits and players noted that the team was outmatched in midfield and appeared to play with uncharacteristic fear, leading to crucial errors. Despite a late goal from Keira Walsh, England struggled to create chances for most of the match, failing to register a shot on target until the 87th minute. The defeat puts immediate pressure on the defending champions, who now face must-win games against the Netherlands and Wales to advance from the group stage.</p>

          <p>Following Real Madrid's 3-2 Club World Cup quarter-final win, Trent Alexander-Arnold dedicated his performance to his former Liverpool teammate Diogo Jota, who recently died in a car crash. Alexander-Arnold, who assisted a key goal, described the news as "extremely difficult" and said he was sure Jota "was there with me" during the match. The tribute was part of a wider outpouring of support from the football community for the 28-year-old Portuguese forward and his family. The emotional context highlights the deep personal bonds within the sport, transcending club rivalries during a time of tragedy.</p>

          <p>Two American aid workers from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation were injured in a grenade attack at a food distribution site in Khan Younis, an act the organization attributed to Hamas. Concurrently, separate Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip reportedly killed 14 people, including a doctor and his children, at a tent camp in the Muwasi area. These violent incidents occurred as U.S.-led efforts for a 60-day ceasefire appear to be progressing, though significant hurdles remain. The ongoing violence underscores the perilous conditions for both civilians and humanitarian personnel operating within the war-torn enclave.</p>

          <p>An eight-year-old girl was killed in Buena Park, California, on July 4th after being struck by illegal fireworks. According to police, a homeowner's fireworks display malfunctioned, firing projectiles toward a residence where other illegal fireworks were stored, causing a secondary ignition that proved fatal for the child. The homeowner has been arrested, and the incident is part of a string of deadly fireworks-related accidents across the state during the holiday. This tragedy serves as a stark reminder of the dangers posed by non-sanctioned pyrotechnics, which continue to be a problem despite law enforcement warnings.</p>

          <p>The deadly flash floods in Texas have drawn attention to the nation's weather warning infrastructure, with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem acknowledging the system is "ancient" and has been "neglected." Speaking after the tragedy, Noem stated that the Trump administration is actively working to upgrade the technology at the National Weather Service and NOAA to provide faster and clearer notifications. Critics and officials have questioned the timeliness of the alerts, as many were issued in the early morning when residents were asleep. The incident has intensified calls for modernizing the systems responsible for warning citizens of unpredictable weather events.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the deadly Texas floods, officials are facing intense scrutiny over their preparedness and why residents and summer camps were not evacuated sooner. While the National Weather Service issued escalating warnings, including a rare flash flood emergency alert, many came in the pre-dawn hours. Local officials have insisted that the flood's intensity was unpredictable, though some acknowledge that a more robust, siren-like warning system had been considered years ago but was deemed too expensive. The disaster has sparked a debate about the effectiveness of current alert systems and the responsibility of local authorities in such fast-moving crises.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis suggests President Trump is employing the "Madman Theory" in his foreign policy, using deliberate unpredictability to coerce both allies and adversaries. This approach, characterized by contradictory statements and a highly centralized decision-making process, has unsettled traditional alliances like NATO, pushing members to increase defense spending significantly. While this strategy appears to yield results with allies, its effectiveness against adversaries like Russia and Iran remains questionable. The article explores whether this doctrine is a sustainable way to project American power or if it risks long-term trust and stability for short-term gains.</p>

The primary criticisms involve a significant penalty for early withdrawal and a property price cap of £450,000 that has not been adjusted for rising house prices. Critics argue these flaws make the product risky and are calling for reforms to prevent savers from losing their own money. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's executive order aimed at grounding Chinese-made drones is facing significant challenges due to China's dominant position in the global market. Industry insiders and analysts note that Chinese firms are world leaders in drone technology, making it difficult and costly for American companies to remove them from their supply chains. With very few non-Chinese drone manufacturers available, a ban could raise costs and disrupt operations for U.S. businesses that rely on the technology. This situation highlights the complexities of decoupling from Chinese manufacturing in critical tech sectors where they hold a substantial lead.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has made his first public appearance since the recent 12-day war with Israel, according to Iranian state media. Footage showed him at a mosque ceremony in Tehran, ending speculation about his whereabouts during the conflict, which saw Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear and military sites. His last appearance had been in a pre-recorded video message. The public return, broadcast extensively on state television, comes as Iran observes the religious mourning period of Muharram and appears designed to project stability and control following the intense military exchange.</p>

          <p>A new study conducted on women in Los Angeles has found a correlation between exposure to extreme heat and wildfire smoke and negative birth outcomes. This research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that environmental factors exacerbated by climate change can have direct and harmful effects on maternal and fetal health. The findings, highlighted in a brief report, underscore the public health risks associated with rising temperatures and increased wildfire frequency. This information is critical for developing public health strategies to protect vulnerable populations, particularly pregnant women, from environmental hazards.</p>

          <p>An Alvarado, Texas police officer was shot in the neck and several armed suspects were taken into custody following a confrontation outside an ICE detention facility late on July 4th. Officials report that a group of masked individuals vandalized the facility and launched fireworks, apparently to lure law enforcement to the scene before opening fire. The injured officer was treated at a hospital and has since been released. A federal source indicated that some of the eight people arrested were wearing body armor, and the Justice Department is closely monitoring the incident as a targeted attack.</p>

Lammy stated the UK is looking "to the future" and will use engagement and humanitarian aid to encourage inclusivity and stability. However, concerns remain over recent violent attacks against minorities and restrictions on social freedoms under the new Islamic-led government.</p>

          <p>Hamas has issued a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated proposal for a temporary ceasefire and hostage exchange, stating it is ready to enter negotiations on implementation.

In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office called the changes requested by Hamas "unacceptable" but confirmed it would send a negotiating team to Qatar to continue talks.

          <p>A Nottingham-based Islamic charity has received an official warning and one of its trustees has been disqualified after an "inflammatory" sermon was delivered days after the October 7 Hamas attacks. The Charity Commission found that the sermon contained divisive language, including a hadith about Muslims fighting Jews, without providing appropriate context, especially given the timing. The regulator determined this constituted misconduct, as it did not further the charity's purposes and was not in its best interests. This case is one of over 300 related to the Middle East conflict that the commission has investigated since late 2023.</p>

With seven wickets remaining, batting for a draw is the most realistic way to preserve their 1-0 series lead. For the first time, assistant coach Marcus Trescothick acknowledged that drawing the game is a possibility, a significant shift from the team's previously defiant mantra. This situation presents the first major test of whether England's high-risk, high-reward approach has room for pragmatic flexibility.</p>
