          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison after convicting him of leading a military coup plot to stay in power following his 2022 election loss. A five-justice panel found him guilty of multiple charges, including conspiracy, and also barred him from public office until 2033. The verdict, which cannot be appealed, also convicted seven of his co-conspirators, including senior military officials. Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest, has denied the charges, calling the trial a politically motivated "witch hunt" designed to prevent his return to politics.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Teaching unions in the UK are raising alarms as a growing number of children are starting primary school without fundamental skills like being toilet-trained or speaking in full sentences. A survey of over 1,000 teachers revealed that nine in ten have observed a decline in speech and language abilities among new students in the last two years. Experts suggest social isolation and increased screen time may be contributing factors, leaving schools to manage developmental gaps traditionally handled at home. The government has acknowledged these challenges and is investing in early years services to improve school readiness.</p>

          <p>The National Football League held a moment of silent reflection to honor conservative activist Charlie Kirk before the Green Bay Packers and Washington Commanders game. The gesture followed Kirk's assassination at a university event in Utah, an act the league condemned as part of a call to end hate and violence. The football community, including figures like Tim Tebow and Pat McAfee, expressed shock and devastation over the killing. President Donald Trump announced that Kirk, who was 31 and is survived by his wife and two children, will be posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p>

          <p>In response to the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, members of the U.S. Congress are curtailing outdoor events and heightening security measures due to rising concerns about political violence. Several lawmakers, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ruben Gallego, have postponed public rallies and town halls out of an abundance of caution. The shooting, which involved a gunman firing from a rooftop, has drawn parallels to the 2024 assassination attempt on President Trump. The incident has prompted a bipartisan re-evaluation of security for public appearances, with some officials vowing to carry firearms for personal protection.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, President Donald Trump stated he wants his supporters to respond with nonviolence, reflecting Kirk's own advocacy. While expressing concern for the country and blaming "radical left lunatics," Trump emphasized a peaceful reaction to the tragedy. He confirmed that he spoke with Kirk's devastated wife, Erika, and announced he will posthumously award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

          <p>A new immigration holding facility in El Paso, Texas, designed to be the largest in U.S. history with a capacity for 5,000 people, has been described as a "giant tent city" by Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar. After visiting the site, she reported hearing complaints from detainees about inedible food causing illness and a complete lack of information regarding their legal status or future. The $1.24 billion contract to operate the center was awarded to Acquisition Logistics, a company with no public record of running detention facilities. Government officials have denied requests for access and declined to comment on the conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth studio album, "Play," is being met with mixed critical reception, as the pop star attempts to reclaim his commercial dominance after two introspective, less successful records. The album incorporates Asian and Middle Eastern musical influences, with collaborations like the single "Sapphire" featuring Indian superstar Arjit Singh. However, critics note that these cultural elements are often layered over conventional Western pop structures rather than being fully integrated. While some songs are praised for their intimacy and raw emotion, much of the album is seen as a safe, algorithm-friendly effort that pulls back from more adventurous musical possibilities.</p>

          <p>The assassination of 31-year-old conservative activist Charlie Kirk has ignited a debate over his complex legacy, particularly among young Americans. His supporters remember him as a bold defender of Christian conservative values who gave them a voice, while opponents recall his provocative and polarizing views on issues like gun rights and abortion. Despite these deep divisions, there is a broad consensus condemning the political violence that led to his death. Many commentators and activists from across the political spectrum have stressed that disagreement over ideas should never justify violence, viewing his killing as a dangerous moment for free speech.</p>

          <p>Denmark has dramatically improved its cancer survival rates over the past 25 years, transforming its healthcare system from one of the worst-performing in Europe to a model of success. The country's strategy involved significant investment in diagnostic equipment like CT scanners, setting strict national standards for rapid diagnosis and treatment, and enhancing the overall patient experience. UK policymakers are now studying the Danish approach, which also includes the right for patients to seek treatment elsewhere if targets aren't met. Experts believe the UK's National Health Service could adopt similar long-term strategies to improve its own cancer care outcomes.</p>

The Constitutional Court declared the previous legislation, which only permitted women to change their names, unconstitutional and discriminatory on the basis of gender. The ruling noted that the practice of women taking a husband's surname was a "colonial import," as many African cultures traditionally saw women retain their birth names.

          <p>Recent significant gains in China's US$12 trillion stock market are creating a challenge for regulators in Beijing, who aim to foster a stable, sustainable bull market rather than a volatile boom-and-bust cycle. The government's goal is to position the equity market as a reliable source of household income to boost consumer spending and shift wealth away from the property sector. After a recent pullback tempered the market's rapid ascent, regulators may be relieved by the transition to a more measured pace.

          <p>An alleged drug-trafficking boat destroyed by the U.S. military last week, resulting in 11 deaths, appeared to be turning back toward Venezuela when it was struck, according to sources familiar with the incident. The occupants reportedly saw the military aircraft and attempted to retreat before the vessel was hit. The Trump administration has justified the strike as an action against the Tren de Aragua gang, a designated terrorist organization. However, Venezuela's interior minister claims none of the deceased were gang members or drug traffickers, while the White House maintains the president acted within his authority to protect the country.</p>

          <p>This opinion article, written by a personal friend of Charlie Kirk, mourns his assassination as a profound loss for the nation and a tragic blow to civil discourse. The author frames Kirk as a martyr for free speech, highlighting the disturbing trend of viewing violence as an acceptable response to political speech. The piece calls for honoring Kirk's legacy by recommitting to the civil exchange of ideas and the Judeo-Christian values he championed. It expresses deep skepticism that this event will be a turning point to pull America back from the brink of political violence, citing other recent attacks that failed to do so.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has predicted that struggling competitor Spirit Airlines is destined to go out of business, declaring that the ultra-low-cost carrier model is no longer viable. Speaking at an industry conference, Kirby argued that a business model predicated on low base fares and numerous fees, which he claims customers dislike, cannot be sustained. Spirit Airlines, which recently filed for bankruptcy for the second time in a year, has been facing weak demand and high costs. Kirby's comments reflect the intense competition in the airline industry, where larger carriers are successfully competing with discount airlines on price. (not investment advice)</p>

They believe that rapid AI adoption and continued investment spending by major tech firms will allow Nvidia to sustain strong growth over the next two years.

          <p>Wildlife officials in Maine are issuing warnings about the northward spread of the invasive hammerhead worm, a destructive pest originally from Asia. The worm poses a significant threat to local ecosystems because it preys on earthworms, which are vital for soil health, and has few natural predators. The species also secretes a toxin that can irritate the skin of humans and pets. Authorities are advising the public not to cut or squish the worms, as this can cause them to multiply through regeneration. Instead, they recommend capturing them and either freezing them or drowning them in soapy water.</p>

Prosecutors then laid out their case, telling jurors that Routh meticulously plotted the attack with military-grade rifles, intending to prevent Trump from being reelected.

The attack targeted a Hamas negotiation team during ceasefire talks, sparking outrage from Qatar and other Gulf nations who now question the value of hosting U.S. military bases. The strike occurred despite Qatar hosting the Hamas office at Washington's request, similar to its previous role with the Taliban.

          <p>The assassination of Charlie Kirk at an open-air event at Utah Valley University has prompted a close examination of the security measures in place. The event was staffed by six local police officers and Kirk's private security team, but the outdoor setting in a quad surrounded by buildings presented significant challenges. Police say the fatal shot was fired from a rooftop, a vulnerability that experts say is difficult to secure without protocols like drone surveillance, which are uncommon for such events. The incident highlights the complex security assessments required for high-profile, and often polarizing, public figures in uncontrolled environments.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that President Donald Trump and his allies are irresponsibly and inaccurately blaming the left for the rise in political violence following Charlie Kirk's assassination. The author argues that while the shooter's motive is unknown, the right's immediate rush to judgment ignores the well-documented history of far-right extremism being the most frequent source of domestic terrorism in the U.S. The article points to Trump's own rhetoric, which has often encouraged or excused violence, from the January 6th Capitol attack to his comments about political opponents. It concludes that Trump's narrative dangerously omits this context to his own political advantage.</p>
