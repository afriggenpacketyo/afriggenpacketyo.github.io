          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose widespread tariffs on foreign goods. The court found that declaring longstanding trade deficits a "national emergency" was an improper justification for the levies. While the ruling is a significant legal challenge to a cornerstone of Trump's economic policy, it does not immediately strike down the tariffs, allowing the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. The decision does not affect other tariffs imposed under different legal authorities, such as those on steel and aluminum.</p>

          <p>David Warburton, who served as the Member of Parliament for Somerton and Frome until 2023, has died suddenly in London at the age of 59. The Metropolitan Police are treating his death as unexpected but not suspicious. Warburton had been suspended by the Conservative Party in 2022 following allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denied and which were later withdrawn. He ultimately resigned from his position as an MP in June 2023 after admitting to cocaine use, concluding a turbulent period at the end of his political career.</p>

          <p>A shallow 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck eastern Afghanistan, causing widespread devastation and killing over 800 people, with the death toll expected to rise. The quake's epicenter was in a remote, mountainous region, severely hampering rescue efforts due to landslides and difficult terrain. Afghanistan's ability to cope is severely strained, as the nation is already facing economic collapse and a humanitarian crisis following the Taliban's takeover and the subsequent suspension of most foreign aid. The article notes that recovery will be challenging, with women and girls potentially at greater risk due to Taliban-imposed restrictions on their access to services.</p>

The Hungarian-born British fighter was a dominant force in the 1970s, holding British, Commonwealth, and European heavyweight titles. Known for his technical skill and remarkable durability, Bugner's career spanned several decades and included notable bouts against other legends like Henry Cooper and Frank Bruno. After his boxing career, he appeared in films and on television, leaving a lasting legacy as one of the toughest fighters of his era.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has reportedly implemented a near-blanket ban on non-immigrant visas for individuals using Palestinian Authority passports, according to media reports citing a diplomatic cable. This move significantly expands previous restrictions, which were limited to visitors from Gaza and specific officials. The policy affects Palestinians seeking to travel to the U.S. for business, study, or medical treatment, requiring a further review that effectively halts visa issuance.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly urged pharmaceutical companies to provide more transparent data to "justify the success" of their COVID-19 drugs. His comments come amid significant leadership turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including the firing of its director, and follow an FDA decision to limit the new vaccine approvals to high-risk individuals. Trump referenced his administration's Operation Warp Speed but also acknowledged the public debate fueled by figures like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a notable vaccine skeptic. The call for transparency adds to the ongoing political conflict over U.S. public health and immunization policies.</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old boy was shot and killed in Houston, Texas, after participating in a "ding-dong ditch" prank where children ring a homeowner's doorbell and run away. According to police, a witness saw the boy fleeing a property after ringing the bell just before he was struck by gunfire. The boy was hit several times and later died from his injuries. Authorities have arrested a middle-aged man from the residence and recovered several weapons. This tragic incident highlights the potential for extreme and violent reactions to what is often considered a harmless childhood prank.</p>

          <p>A new study from the University of Exeter indicates that daily consumption of nitrate-rich beetroot juice can help lower blood pressure in older adults. The research found that the juice alters the oral microbiome, increasing helpful bacteria and reducing microbes linked to inflammation. Nitrates in foods like beets are converted by the body into nitric oxide, a molecule that helps dilate blood vessels and improve vascular health. While the study showed a notable benefit for participants in their 60s and 70s, researchers emphasize that more investigation is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of this dietary intervention.</p>

This approach, combined with the artistic direction of conductor Paavo Jarvi, has fostered a deep sense of commitment and motivation, leading to both critical acclaim and financial independence.

The persistent and widespread heat, which included four separate heatwave events, aligns with scientific evidence of a warming climate, making such extreme summers far more likely.

Rayner maintains she has paid all relevant taxes properly, and her allies suggest she is the target of a sexist and classist briefing war.

          <p>A controversial post-war redevelopment plan for Gaza, reportedly being considered by the Trump administration, envisions transforming the territory into a 'Gaza Riviera' under a decade of U.S. trusteeship. The 38-page document outlines the "voluntary" relocation of Gaza's entire population in exchange for digital tokens, the construction of AI-powered smart cities, and private-sector financing. The plan, developed by Israeli figures linked to a controversial foundation, has drawn sharp criticism for proposing mass displacement without addressing international law or Palestinian self-determination. It assumes 25% of Gazans would choose to leave the country permanently, framing the proposal as a path to economic prosperity.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Taipei, U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, head of the Senate Armed Services Committee, declared that Taiwan is a "free country" with the "right to remain free." His strong statement of support comes amid rising tensions with China, which claims sovereignty over the democratic island and opposes any official U.S.-Taiwan exchanges. Wicker emphasized the need for enhanced military and defense cooperation to help Taiwan preserve its self-determination against the looming threat from Beijing. China's Foreign Ministry strongly condemned the visit and the senator's remarks, reiterating that Taiwan's future must be decided by the Chinese people.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is defending his administration's decision to issue 600,000 student visas to Chinese nationals over the next two years, a move that has drawn sharp criticism from some of his staunchest supporters. Figures in the MAGA movement have expressed concern that the visas will take spots from American students and pose a national security risk. However, Trump argued that banning Chinese students would be "insulting" to a country with which he is trying to maintain a good relationship, particularly during trade negotiations. He also stated that the students bring significant revenue to U.S. universities.</p>

          <p>Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has announced an ambitious goal for the country to become a fully digital, cashless society by 2030. However, the plan is met with significant skepticism from financial and cybersecurity experts who point to major obstacles. These include a large informal economy, a high percentage of the population living in rural areas with limited digital literacy, and severe vulnerabilities in the nation's cybersecurity infrastructure, as evidenced by recent major cyberattacks. Critics argue that a forced transition could harm small businesses and that the country lacks the foundational elements needed for such a rapid and complete shift.</p>

          <p>Businesses in Cape Town, South Africa, are being systematically targeted by protection rackets, creating what experts call an "intolerable" situation and a growing shadow economy. Extortion gangs demand monthly payments from establishments in sectors like nightlife, construction, and transportation, using intimidation and violence against those who refuse to pay. The problem, which escalated during the pandemic, has halted infrastructure projects and particularly affects vulnerable immigrant entrepreneurs. Despite some high-profile arrests, law enforcement struggles to combat the pervasive issue, as victims often fear retaliation and refuse to cooperate with police investigations.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen revealed that European nations are developing "precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as part of post-war security guarantees. She stated in an interview that these plans have the backing of President Trump, who has reportedly assured European allies of an "American presence as part of the backstop," though this would likely involve coordination rather than ground troops. The discussions reflect a high-level effort to create a stable peace framework, but they face opposition from Russia, which has rejected the idea of any Western military presence in Ukraine.</p>

A committee aide stated that the decision was made after learning of health issues that prevent the 81-year-old from being able to testify. Mueller, who served as FBI Director from 2001 to 2013, was subpoenaed for his knowledge of the FBI's investigation into Epstein during his tenure. Recent reports have disclosed that Mueller was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2021, providing context for the committee's reversal on his required deposition.</p>

States as far south as Illinois and Oregon may catch a glimpse of the colorful display.

          <p>Financial coach Bernadette Joy advises that prospective homebuyers should aim for a 15-year mortgage to build equity faster, arguing that if one cannot afford its higher payments, they cannot truly afford the home. She cautions against 30-year mortgages where early payments primarily cover interest, resulting in slow equity growth. Joy also highlights often-overlooked costs of homeownership, such as maintenance, furnishing, and increased utilities, which can strain finances unexpectedly. She recommends a budget where living expenses, including the mortgage, do not exceed 50% of income to ensure financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

To counter a potential crisis, the article suggests the government must take bold, eye-catching measures in its autumn budget to restore market confidence. Proposed actions include significant tax reforms like a land tax to reduce taxes on labor, pursuing growth-positive policies such as rejoining the EU customs union, and reinforcing the Bank of England's independence. These steps are deemed necessary to change the prevailing negative narrative surrounding the UK's economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>
