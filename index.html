          <p>Following President Trump's declaration of a public safety emergency in Washington D.C., approximately 850 National Guard troops and federal agents have been deployed to the capital. The White House reported 23 arrests for various offenses on the first night, vowing a month-long crackdown on violent crime. This marks the first National Guard deployment in the city since 2021. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who noted that violent crime is at a 30-year low, called the federal takeover of the city's police "unsettling and unprecedented" and is scheduled to meet with the Attorney General.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees who must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts but do not need the income, several financial strategies are available. Experts suggest options such as reinvesting the funds into a brokerage account, preferably using tax-efficient exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for continued growth. Another popular method is making a qualified charitable distribution (QCD) directly from an IRA to a nonprofit, which satisfies the RMD requirement without increasing taxable income. For those focused on legacy planning, using the withdrawn money to contribute to a 529 college savings plan for family members is also a viable option. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index for July showed a 2.7% annual increase, slightly below economists' expectations, with a 0.2% monthly rise. While overall inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, falling gasoline prices helped temper the figures. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose to its highest level in five months, and food prices continue to climb, adding financial stress for many American households. Analysts believe these figures are unlikely to prevent a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A severe heatwave across southern Europe, with temperatures exceeding 40°C (104°F), is fueling dozens of devastating wildfires, leading to mass evacuations and at least one death in Spain. Countries including Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, and Greece have issued red heat alerts and are struggling to contain the blazes, which threaten homes, businesses, and even a UNESCO World Heritage site. The crisis has prompted the deployment of military units and international aid, highlighting the growing impact of climate change on the region's fire seasons as scientists warn of hotter, drier Mediterranean summers.</p>

          <p>The Newsom administration's lawsuit against the federal government over President Trump's deployment of the National Guard during immigration riots in Los Angeles has reached a California court. The case, heard by Judge Charles Breyer, tests the limits of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts using the military for domestic law enforcement. California argues Trump overstepped his authority, while the federal government claims the action was a necessary response to attacks on federal officers. The trial's outcome could have significant implications for presidential power, especially in light of the recent federal takeover of police in Washington, D.C.</p>

Early results from pilot stores show significant improvements in service speed, prompting an accelerated rollout to all U.S. locations. This positive sentiment reflects a belief that Niccol's focus on operational efficiency and restoring the classic coffeehouse atmosphere will drive stronger sales and profits in the coming year.

          <p>E.J. Antoni, President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), has suggested suspending the agency's influential monthly jobs report. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, criticized the report's reliability and proposed that the BLS should instead only publish its more accurate, but less timely, quarterly data. This proposal has sparked alarm among economists, who view it as a move to undermine the agency's independence and the availability of crucial economic data. The nomination follows Trump's firing of the previous BLS commissioner after a report showed a slowdown in job growth.</p>

Once a dominant force in photography, Kodak struggled to adapt to the digital revolution and filed for bankruptcy in 2012.

This article explains that before the Home Rule Act of 1973, D.C. was governed by presidentially appointed commissioners for a century, with Congress holding ultimate authority. Even after gaining limited self-governance, the city was placed under a federal financial control board in the 1990s due to a fiscal crisis. This historical context illustrates the constitutional limits on D.C.'s autonomy and the precedent for federal intervention in its affairs.</p>

          <h2>Legal Analysis Confirms 30-Day Limit on Trump's Control of D.C. Police</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While President Trump has the authority to temporarily take control of Washington D.C.'s police force, the law imposes a strict time limit on this power. The 1974 Home Rule Act allows the president to federalize the city's police upon determining an emergency exists, but explicitly states this control cannot exceed 30 days without congressional approval. Although the president has broad discretion to declare an emergency, any attempt to extend control beyond this 30-day window by declaring a new emergency would likely face a strong legal challenge. This statutory limit serves as a significant check on presidential power over the nation's capital.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Embracing Absurdity and Humor Can Counter Political Despair</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 12:29:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this opinion piece, author Anne Lamott reflects on the overwhelming nature of current political turmoil and proposes an unconventional coping mechanism: embracing absurdity and humor. Drawing inspiration from the comedy of Monty Python, she argues that laughter is a form of fearless hope that can disrupt the power of bullies and narcissists who rule by fear. Lamott suggests that while activism and civic duty are essential, rediscovering joy and silliness can provide the emotional resilience needed to confront societal darkness. She concludes that doing hopeful things, like getting a manicure or singing a silly song, can help maintain one's spirit.</p>

The meeting took place at the house where Vance is staying in the Cotswolds, following an invitation from the vice president's team. This meeting is notable as both politicians share similar stances on key policy issues like immigration and free speech. While in the UK, Vance also met with Foreign Secretary David Lammy to discuss international affairs, but a meeting with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch could not be scheduled due to logistical conflicts.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has escalated his public feud with both Apple and OpenAI, threatening legal action against Apple for allegedly making it "impossible" for other apps to compete with ChatGPT in its App Store. He also called OpenAI CEO Sam Altman a "liar" after Altman suggested Musk manipulates his X platform for personal benefit. This conflict stems from Musk's belief that OpenAI, which he co-founded, has abandoned its original non-profit, open-source mission in favor of maximizing profits for investor Microsoft. The rivalry has now grown to include legal battles and public accusations between the two influential tech billionaires.</p>

          <p>Everton has completed the signing of England international Jack Grealish from Manchester City on a season-long loan. The 29-year-old winger, who joined City for a record £100m in 2021, seeks to rejuvenate his career after falling out of favor and making only seven league starts last season. Grealish stated that conversations with Everton manager David Moyes were decisive in his move, and he aims to regain his place in the England national squad. He will wear the number 18 shirt, a choice inspired by his football idols Wayne Rooney and Paul Gascoigne, who both wore the number for Everton.</p>

It calculates that such a deposit could earn over a thousand dollars on a three-month term and potentially tens of thousands over a five-year term. While CDs offer guaranteed returns and security, the article notes the trade-off is lower potential profit compared to stocks and the restriction of locking funds away for a set period.

The court's decision, which mandates the capture and relocation of 5,000 dogs to shelters, followed reports of nearly 2,000 daily dog bites in the capital. Protesters argue that the government should focus on more pressing issues and properly enforce existing animal birth control rules, which involve sterilizing and vaccinating strays.

          <p>An analysis of Israeli public opinion reveals a complex mindset regarding the war in Gaza, with a majority supporting a ceasefire while showing little concern for Palestinian suffering. According to pollster Dahlia Scheindlin, Israeli opposition to the war is primarily rooted in self-interest, namely the desire to bring home hostages and soldiers, rather than empathy for Gazans. This indifference is fueled by a combination of media that barely covers civilian suffering, a widespread belief that reports of starvation are Hamas propaganda, and deep-seated dehumanization on both sides of the conflict, which predates the current hostilities.</p>
