          <p>Authorities have released more information about the shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, where a gunman killed two children and injured eighteen others during a school Mass. The shooter, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, reportedly fired a rifle through church windows before taking his own life. Law enforcement sources indicate Westman, a former student at the school, had a fascination with past mass shootings and expressed wide-ranging hatred toward various groups. The investigation is exploring motives of domestic terrorism and hate crimes targeting Catholics, as officials analyze a manifesto-style video Westman had scheduled to post online during the attack.</p>

Conversely, South Korea's Kospi and Kosdaq indices saw gains, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged slightly higher.

          <p>The Trump administration has dismissed CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez just one month after her Senate confirmation, escalating a period of significant turmoil within the public health agency. Her lawyers state she was fired for refusing to endorse "unscientific, reckless directives" and accused Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of weaponizing public health. The firing follows the recent resignations of at least three other senior CDC officials, some of whom cited concerns over the administration's vaccine policies and misinformation. The White House confirmed Monarez was not aligned with the president's agenda and has named RFK Jr. deputy Jim O'Neill as the acting director.</p>

          <p>Conservation scientists are analyzing the DNA of the Druids Oak, an 800-year-old tree in Buckinghamshire, to uncover the genetic secrets behind its remarkable longevity and resilience. The project, involving The Woodland Trust and the Arboricultural Association, aims to understand how ancient oaks survive threats like climate change and disease. Researchers hope this genetic information will help in selecting the most robust oak trees for future planting, aiding in the restoration of Britain's woodlands. These iconic trees are vital ecological keystones, supporting over 2,300 species and playing a crucial role in biodiversity.</p>

          <p>In Memphis, Tennessee, radio host Bev Johnson is being celebrated for her 42-year career at WDIA, the first all-Black radio station in the United States. Since its inception in 1947, WDIA has served as a vital cultural and informational hub for the Black community, providing news ignored by mainstream outlets and promoting civil rights activism. Johnson, affectionately known as "your girlfriend" to her listeners, continues this legacy by hosting experts who offer free advice on legal and medical issues.

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed an international network of spammers creating and posting AI-generated images of fake Holocaust victims on Facebook to generate profit. These emotionally manipulative posts, featuring fabricated stories and images, attract high engagement, which is then monetized through Meta's content payment programs. Holocaust memorial organizations have condemned the practice, stating it distresses survivors, disrespects the memory of victims, and dangerously distorts history. The investigation traced many of the accounts to content creators in Pakistan who are exploiting the system by generating high volumes of low-quality, emotionally charged content, known as "AI slop."</p>

          <p>Beginning in January 2026, the National Health Service (NHS) will offer a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children in England and Wales. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months of age, combined with the existing MMR jab for measles, mumps, and rubella. This public health initiative aims to protect children from the rare but severe complications of chickenpox, such as encephalitis and stroke. Officials also hope the program will reduce the economic impact of the illness, which currently costs the UK an estimated £24 million annually in lost productivity from parents taking time off work.</p>

          <p>The UK government did not perform its own cost-benefit analysis before initiating the largest reorganization of English councils in decades, a BBC investigation has learned. The Ministry of Local Government based its projection of £2.9 billion in savings on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN). However, the CCN has since updated its analysis, now suggesting that some reorganization scenarios could result in no savings or even incur additional costs, potentially reaching £850 million over five years. Critics, including the District Councils' Network, have expressed astonishment that such a significant reform was undertaken without independent, up-to-date evidence to justify it.</p>

While this specific fish was sterile and could not reproduce, the presence of even a single grass carp is a significant concern for the local ecosystem. These fish have voracious appetites, capable of consuming 40% of their body weight in aquatic vegetation daily, which destroys fish habitats, clouds water, and promotes algal blooms. Authorities are increasing surveillance and urging the public to report any sightings of the invasive species immediately.</p>

          <p>George Clooney's latest film, "Jay Kelly," has premiered at the Venice Film Festival to largely positive reviews, with some critics hailing it as a masterpiece. In the Netflix movie, Clooney plays a famous, aging movie star grappling with his life choices and legacy, a role that draws parallels to his own public persona. The film, directed by Noah Baumbach and co-starring Adam Sandler and Laura Dern, explores themes of identity and the gap between public presentation and private reality. Clooney's subtle and revealing performance is already generating awards season buzz in what is expected to be a competitive year for best actor.</p>

          <h2>Survey Reveals Tesla's Full Self-Driving Technology Is a Deterrent for Many Potential Buyers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new survey of 8,000 Americans indicates that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology may be turning more consumers away from the brand than attracting them. The report found that 35% of respondents said FSD would make them less likely to buy a Tesla, compared to only 14% who said it would make them more likely. The remaining 51% were indifferent, and nearly half of all surveyed believe the technology should be illegal. These findings present a challenge for Tesla and CEO Elon Musk, who has positioned the company's future on the success of its autonomous driving services amid a current sales slump.</p>

          <p>An MSP, Colin Smyth, has had his pass to the Scottish Parliament deactivated following reports that he placed a secret camera in a Holyrood toilet. Smyth was previously suspended by the Labour Party after being charged with possessing indecent images of children and is now reportedly facing a further police charge related to the camera allegations. The parliament's chief executive informed members of the decision to deactivate Smyth's pass ahead of Holyrood's return from recess, citing the ongoing criminal investigation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot legally fire the director of Voice of America (VOA) on her own authority. U.S. Senior District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth stated that by law, such a removal requires the backing of a congressionally established advisory panel, which currently lacks the members to form a quorum. The ruling is a significant check on the administration's efforts to reshape the federally funded international broadcaster, which has seen its operations dramatically curtailed under Lake. The judge found the attempt to remove Director Michael Abramowitz did not comply with statutory requirements designed to insulate the network from political pressure.</p>

          <p>A complex love-hate dynamic currently defines China-Japan relations, highlighted by two concurrent summer phenomena. A Chinese film depicting Japanese wartime atrocities, "Dead to Rights," has become a massive box office success, reigniting memories of historical trauma for millions of viewers. Simultaneously, Chinese tourism to Japan has surged, with nearly a million visitors in July alone, making China the top source of inbound tourists for Japan. This paradox illustrates the deep-seated nature of the relationship, which is shaped by a mixture of historical wounds, geopolitical tensions, economic interdependence, and a strong cultural affinity between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace has successfully qualified for the league phase of the Conference League after a 1-0 aggregate victory over Fredrikstad, marking a significant achievement in their first-ever European campaign. The club, which recently won the FA Cup and Community Shield, is seen as a potential contender to win the third-tier European trophy. However, the team faces challenges, including a weakened squad following the departure of star Eberechi Eze and the potential sale of captain Marc Guehi. The club's participation in this competition itself resulted from a demotion from the Europa League due to multi-club ownership rules.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article draws a parallel between President Donald Trump and Homelander, the narcissistic and dangerously powerful antagonist from the television series "The Boys." The author notes similarities in their demands for sycophantic praise, their assertions of unlimited power, and their quickness to anger when challenged. The piece argues that while both figures appear unstoppable to their subordinates and enemies, Trump, unlike the fictional superhero, is constrained by the Constitution, the courts, and ultimately, the voters. The commentary suggests that speaking truth, legal challenges, and electoral participation are the necessary checks on the president's authoritarian posturing.</p>

          <p>An asylum seeker living at the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, reports that residents are being kept "in the dark" about their future as the hotel faces closure. A High Court injunction, currently under appeal, has ordered the 138 male asylum seekers to be moved out by September 12 following breaches of planning laws. The hotel has become a focal point for large anti-immigration protests, leaving residents feeling intimidated and afraid to go outside. The man, who fled Somalia, described the hostility he faces and expressed a complex understanding of the local community's anger about mass migration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long-standing "de minimis" rule, which has allowed low-value packages to enter the U.S. duty-free for decades, is being suspended by an executive order from President Trump. This change means that all incoming shipments will now be subject to an import tax, significantly impacting online shoppers accustomed to buying cheap goods from foreign retailers like Temu and Shein. The rule, which most recently applied to goods valued under $800, has been criticized by the administration as a loophole that undermines American businesses. Consumers can expect price increases on many imported items as sellers will likely pass the new tax costs onto them.</p>
