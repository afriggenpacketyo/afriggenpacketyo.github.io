          <p>President Trump lauded Elon Musk for his contributions to the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as Musk's tenure as a "special government employee" concluded. Trump highlighted Musk's role in overhauling the federal government, claiming significant cost-cutting achievements, although some analyses suggest potential financial drawbacks from DOGE's actions. Despite Musk's departure, Trump indicated that Musk would remain involved as a "friend and adviser," while Musk expressed disappointment over a recent spending bill that increased the budget deficit. Musk's time in Washington was marked by workforce cuts, agency dismantling, and public disagreements with Trump over domestic policy.</p>

The match served as a strong statement ahead of Euro 2025, where the Lionesses will defend their European title, showcasing their attacking prowess and ability to overcome off-pitch distractions.

          <p>A clinical trial suggests that an immunotherapy drug, pembrolizumab, could significantly extend the lives of individuals with advanced head and neck cancer, potentially preventing cancer recurrence. The trial demonstrated that the drug doubled the time patients remained cancer-free, increasing it from an average of 2.5 years to five years, and also reduced the risk of cancer returning elsewhere in the body. Patients received pembrolizumab before and after surgery, which researchers believe helped the body develop immunity to attack the cancer if it were to return. This new approach marks a significant advancement in treating these difficult cancers, offering hope for improved survival rates and quality of life.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will double tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a speech at U.S. Steel's Irvin Works in Pennsylvania. Trump stated that this increase would further protect the steel industry, making it more difficult for foreign steel to compete in the American market. He also addressed the proposed merger with Japan's Nippon, stating that Nippon has committed to maintaining U.S. Steel's blast furnaces at full capacity for at least a decade, with no layoffs or outsourcing, and U.S. Steel workers will receive a $5,000 bonus. The president framed the deal as a "partnership" controlled by the USA, despite U.S. Steel describing it as a merger.</p>

          <p>Following a federal court ruling against President Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, the administration is exploring alternative trade policy options. While the tariffs remain in place temporarily due to a federal appeals court stay, the administration could turn to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, or Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930. These options have limitations compared to the broader authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), potentially slowing down the process and requiring more targeted application. The White House maintains its commitment to addressing trade deficits and national emergencies using all available legal tools.</p>

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, challenging his executive order to cut off federal funding. PBS argues that the order is retaliatory, stemming from "perceived political slights in news coverage," and violates constitutional protections of speech and press freedom. The lawsuit asserts that Trump's actions interfere with PBS's editorial independence and the autonomy of its member stations, as well as being a violation of federal telecommunications law. The White House responded by stating that the CPB was "creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime."</p>

          <p>A wildfire ignited in the Covington Flats area of Joshua Tree National Park, burning 165 acres and raising concerns about damage to Joshua trees in a critical "climate refugia." The Covington Flats region is a higher-elevation area with cooler temperatures and more rainfall, making it essential for the long-term survival of Joshua trees in a warming climate. The trees are not adapted to wildfire, making any fire damage potentially devastating to the population. Fire crews from multiple agencies are working to contain the blaze, which had no containment as of Friday afternoon.</p>

The man managed to escape after 17 days and alerted police, leading to the arrest of John Woeltz and William Duplessie, who have been charged with kidnapping, assault, and unlawful imprisonment. The suspects are accused of using electric wires, a saw, and other means to torture the man, forcing him to smoke crack cocaine, and threatening to kill him and his family.

          <p>China is scaling up the use of AI in urban management through its "smart cities" initiative, utilizing technologies like drones for nightly patrols in cities like Nanjing. These AI-driven systems aim to improve urban management and governance by focusing on areas often overlooked by human patrols. However, China's AI governance faces challenges similar to those in other parts of the world, including privacy protection and limited community involvement. Despite the rapid progress, analysts caution that addressing these challenges is crucial for the responsible and effective implementation of AI in urban environments.</p>

          <p>A guest essay in the New York Times explores a potential link between therapy culture and the rising rate of childlessness among millennials and Gen Z. The author suggests that the redefinition of "harm," "abuse," "neglect," and "trauma" has led to an increasingly impossible standard for parenting. This cultural shift has contributed to adult children cutting off contact with parents, citing emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, as well as parental toxicity or feeling misunderstood. As a result, the younger generation may dread parenthood, knowing they would struggle to meet the unreachable standards they have set for their own parents.</p>

          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed in April, with consumer prices rising just 2.1% compared to a year earlier, indicating that President Trump's tariffs have yet to significantly push up prices. Despite rising incomes, spending by Americans slowed, potentially reflecting an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods. The report showed that overall prices and core prices both increased just 0.1% from March to April. Economists and business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, although the timing and impact of those duties are now uncertain due to recent court rulings.</p>

Newsom's office contends that federal court rulings have rejected the argument that California law limits law enforcement coordination with immigration authorities. The state's sanctuary policies aim to prevent local law enforcement from being used to round up law-abiding immigrants, while still permitting cooperation with federal authorities in certain cases.</p>
