          <p>The House Rules Committee moved President Trump's tax bill to the floor after a lengthy debate, setting up a vote despite expected Democratic opposition. The bill, which includes last-minute changes aimed at appeasing both moderate and conservative Republicans, faces scrutiny due to concerns about its potential impact on federal deficits. Markets reacted negatively to the prospect of the bill's passage, with Treasury bond yields rising, reflecting investor worries about the nation's fiscal health. Speaker Mike Johnson aims to pass the bill before Memorial Day, navigating a narrow Republican majority and potential holdouts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent concurred that the current dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals, amidst ongoing bilateral tariff discussions. This acknowledgment suggests the yen's weakness against the dollar is no longer a point of contention in trade negotiations, contrasting with President Trump's previous concerns about Japan devaluing the yen to gain a trade advantage. Kato expressed concerns about the global economic impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, while Japan continues to oppose additional tariffs. Japan is also reportedly considering concessions on tariff rates to expedite a mutually beneficial trade agreement with the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House conservatives to rally support for a budget package containing his second-term agenda, as GOP leaders worked to address concerns from fiscal hawks and blue-state Republicans. Speaker Mike Johnson expressed optimism about passing the bill, which includes extensions of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, adjustments to Medicaid work requirements, and changes to the state and local tax deduction (SALT). The bill faces opposition from Democrats and requires near-unanimous Republican support to pass, given the party's slim majority in the House. A manager's amendment was released late Wednesday containing highly anticipated changes to the legislation that had been negotiated in recent days.</p>

Figures released by the Office for National Statistics are expected to reveal a fall in net migration to the UK.

While attitudes towards immigration have softened recently, hostility remains concentrated in certain groups, influencing electoral outcomes. The Labour government is implementing stricter visa rules to reduce legal immigration, but faces the challenge of balancing economic needs with public concerns.</p>

Anderson, who had no history of disciplinary problems and was known for community engagement, had the authority to make such decisions under previous administrations, according to the union representing him.

          <p>The Senate is set to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats call "the nuclear option," arguing Republicans may not have the right to do so. These waivers set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including California's "EV mandate" requiring all new vehicle sales to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, while Democrats contend this sets a dangerous precedent. California officials have vowed to sue if Congress revokes the waivers, which impact 16 other states and D.C. that have adopted California's vehicle standards.</p>
