          <p>Six soldiers were killed and two wounded in Michoacan, Mexico, after a bomb exploded near their armored vehicle, highlighting the ongoing violence between drug cartels and security forces in the region. Warring criminals have a history of using improvised landmines and explosive-laden drones to attack security forces. President Claudia Sheinbaum called the deaths "deplorable," while the U.S. has designated six Mexican drug trafficking groups as terrorist organizations, raising concerns about potential military intervention. The area has been plagued by turf wars between the Jalisco New Generation cartel and local criminal groups.</p>

          <p>A deceptively simple reform is gaining traction in the US that could unlock more housing. This reform would allow single-staircase apartment buildings up to six stories, potentially cutting construction costs and increasing housing density. Advocates argue that modern safety features like sprinklers make single-stair buildings as safe as those with two staircases, and note that many countries already permit this design. While fire safety officials raise concerns, several states are considering or have already passed legislation to allow single-stair construction, aiming to ease the housing crunch and provide more varied unit layouts.</p>

          <p>Complaints about substandard living conditions in social housing in England have increased more than fivefold in the past five years, according to a report by the Housing Ombudsman. The report cites issues such as asbestos, electrical and fire safety concerns, pest control problems, and leaks, damp, and mold, leading to a breakdown in trust between tenants and landlords. The Housing Ombudsman calls for a transformative overhaul of the system, including an independent review of funding practices and a national tenant body to strengthen tenant voice and landlord accountability. The ombudsman warns that without change, England risks the managed decline of social housing and growing social unrest.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares experienced a significant jump in premarket trading following a strong earnings report, which triggered a rally in global semiconductor stocks. Despite facing headwinds from U.S. semiconductor export restrictions to China, Nvidia's financial results exceeded market expectations. The company wrote off $4.5 billion of H20 chip inventory due to these restrictions, but investors view Nvidia as a bellwether for the semiconductor industry and AI-related stocks. The positive earnings also lifted shares of other U.S. companies like Marvell and Qualcomm, indicating continued demand for graphics processing units used in training AI models.</p>

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem endorsed a right-wing presidential candidate in Poland, while Hungary's Viktor Orban is positioning himself as a recipient of MAGA soft power. These events occur as Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs threaten to spark a trade war with the European Union, potentially straining the relationship between the MAGA movement and its European allies.

          <p>Scientists warn that President Trump's proposed 24% budget cut to NASA could jeopardize future discoveries about the universe, including the search for life on Mars and the study of Venus. The cuts would disproportionately affect space and Earth science missions, potentially leading to the closure of labs and the abandonment of ongoing projects. Experts highlight the loss of future initiatives like the Nancy Grace Roman space telescope, which could discover thousands of new planets and galaxies. The cuts are part of a broader trend of devaluing science, potentially allowing other nations to surpass U.S. leadership in space.</p>

Trump has hinted at new sanctions but has yet to take action, facing growing pressure to adopt a harder line.

The changes could benefit business owners who receive profits on their individual tax returns, although critics argue it disproportionately favors the wealthy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pilots face unique challenges in seeking mental health care due to FAA regulations that can jeopardize their careers. A detailed system of medical reviews, intended to keep pilots with severe mental distress out of the cockpit, may unintentionally lead pilots to avoid seeking necessary care. Research shows over half of pilots avoid health care due to fear of losing their flying status, with tragic examples of pilots who took their lives rather than risk losing their medical certificates. The FAA has begun to implement recommendations from a panel of experts to lower barriers to mental health access, but challenges remain.</p>

          <p>Financial Times columnist Robert Armstrong coined the acronym TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) to describe a trading strategy where investors profit from Trump's tariff announcements by buying the dip and selling when he inevitably reverses course. This pattern was evident in the market's response to Trump's threat to levy a 50% tariff on imports from the European Union, followed by his delay of the increase. The author argues that Trump's actions reveal a pattern of bluster with little follow-through, undermining the stability of international trade and creating opportunities for insider trading.</p>

          <p>A new report from the World Meteorological Organization warns that the planet is poised to get even hotter, with a high chance of surpassing the 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit warming threshold within the next five years. This means more extreme weather events, including droughts, heat waves, and intense wildfires, particularly in the western U.S. The report highlights the likelihood of continued record-breaking temperatures and the increasing frequency of climate "whiplash" episodes.

          <p>A contributor argues that a Trump appointee's plan to end the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac without addressing core structural flaws could set the stage for a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. The author contends that implicit government guarantees backing mortgages incentivize dangerous lending practices, and releasing Fannie and Freddie prematurely could further rig the market in favor of hedge funds. The author advocates for strengthening capital reserves, enhancing transparency and oversight, and explicitly removing government guarantees to prevent future bailouts. Ignoring these lessons would inevitably lead to a similar disaster, according to the contributor. (not investment advice)</p>
