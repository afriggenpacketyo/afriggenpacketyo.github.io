          <p>The U.S. Senate is preparing for a crucial procedural vote on a comprehensive tax and spending package strongly supported by President Trump. Majority Leader John Thune has expressed uncertainty about securing enough Republican votes, as internal party disputes over Medicaid cuts and other provisions persist. The White House has framed the bill's passage as a critical test of loyalty, calling failure the "ultimate betrayal." Meanwhile, some key Republican holdouts like Susan Collins and Josh Hawley have signaled they will allow the bill to advance to debate, though final support remains uncertain.

          <p>According to renowned computer scientist Harry Shum, China is rapidly advancing in artificial intelligence algorithms, narrowing the gap with the United States despite lagging significantly in chip technology. Shum, the former head of AI at Microsoft, noted that the U.S. maintains a clear and substantial lead in AI chip production, a challenge that will take years for China to overcome. However, he highlighted Chinese firm DeepSeek as an example of algorithmic progress, achieving top-tier results with far fewer resources than its American counterparts. This suggests China's strategic focus on algorithm engineering could be a key factor in the ongoing tech competition.</p>

To offset these costs, the bill proposes significant cuts to Medicaid and eliminates the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles.

Scientists have raised alarms, stating the loss of SSMIS data will severely degrade forecast accuracy and could negatively impact the safety of millions in hurricane-prone areas.

          <p>On the tenth anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's legalization of same-sex marriage, a pioneering Maryland couple, Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak, are reflecting on their journey. They were lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit that, while unsuccessful in court, helped build momentum for marriage equality in the state, which was achieved in 2012. The couple shared their experiences of facing obstacles in healthcare and daily life, emphasizing their fight was for their children and for basic rights. They also expressed concern over recent legal challenges and rhetoric that threaten to roll back these hard-won protections for LGBTQ+ people.</p>

          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students from Johns Hopkins University has designed and built a specialized printer that adds braille to beer can labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was initiated at the request of Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), the state's largest employer of blind and low-vision workers. The student-invented machine can handle materials that commercial braille printers cannot and is designed with open hardware, making it accessible for operators with low vision. The printer has already produced 400 labels for a special "Blind Spot" beer, created for a fundraiser supporting individuals with vision loss.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached new record highs, navigating a week that began with significant geopolitical risk following U.S. strikes in Iran. The market quickly stabilized as fears of a wider conflict subsided, leading to a sharp drop in oil prices, which eased inflation concerns. Investor sentiment was also buoyed by growing expectations of multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts by the end of the year, despite a slightly hotter-than-expected core inflation report. This optimism allowed major indices to post strong weekly gains, with the Nasdaq having its best quarter since 2020. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The latest Supreme Court term ended with a series of victories for conservative priorities, particularly empowering Republican-led states and bolstering President Trump's claims of executive power. The court's 6-3 conservative majority issued rulings that give states more authority to restrict transgender medical treatments and limit funding to Planned Parenthood clinics. While not nationwide landmark decisions, these rulings reflect a states-rights approach that allows for differing policies on divisive cultural issues. The court also sided with the Trump administration by reining in the power of district judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a procedural win for the executive branch. (not investment advice)</p>

Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 skeletons buried under the city's houses and found that genetic connections were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wife's household, and female offspring remained connected to their maternal homes. The findings challenge traditional assumptions about ancient social structures and suggest that maternal lineage played a key role in the community's identity and organization.</p>

The modification, likely done at a Russian depot, replaces the vehicle's original 25mm Bushmaster cannon. While Russia has used a few captured Bradleys in combat, this change could be an experiment to test re-armament feasibility or for propaganda purposes. The original American ammunition is unavailable to Russian forces, so swapping the main gun would be necessary for sustained use, though a large-scale conversion program is unlikely.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured a stunning pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, outpacing the field by more than half a second on a short lap. Norris described his performance as "as close to perfection" as he could ask for, stating it was nice to feel like "the old me back" after a season hampered by qualifying mistakes. The strong result comes after McLaren introduced car upgrades aimed at improving front-end feel, which Norris credited for his renewed confidence.
