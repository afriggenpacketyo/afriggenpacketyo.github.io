          <h2>Japan's Economy Contracts More Than Expected Amidst Global Trade Tensions</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a larger-than-anticipated contraction of 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, primarily driven by a decline in exports. This marks the first quarterly drop since early 2024, raising concerns about the nation's economic stability. The decrease in exports occurred amidst heightened trade tensions, particularly with the United States, where tariffs on Japanese goods are looming. Analysts suggest that these trade uncertainties, coupled with an aging population and rising welfare costs, could potentially push Japan into a recession, and the article indicates that the Bank of Japan may maintain its current monetary policy until the economic outlook becomes clearer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest Sunday Times Rich List reveals a decrease in the number of billionaires residing in the UK, dropping from 165 to 156, which is the largest decline in the list's history. This decline is attributed to criticism surrounding tax changes implemented by the new Labour government, specifically the abolition of non-dom status. In contrast, King Charles' personal wealth has increased, now equaling that of former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his wife. The Hinduja family remains at the top of the list, despite a decrease in their fortune, with a total worth exceeding Â£35 billion.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey shared an Instagram post featuring seashells arranged to form "86 47," a phrase interpreted by some as a call for President Trump's removal from office. The post ignited controversy, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asserting it was a call for assassination, prompting an investigation by DHS and the Secret Service. Comey later removed the post, stating he didn't realize the numbers' association with violence. The incident highlights the ongoing tension between Comey and the Trump administration, dating back to Comey's firing in 2017 and the subsequent investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>

          <p>Romania is on the brink of a political shift as far-right candidate George Simion is likely to win the presidential runoff. Simion's rise is attributed to decades of economic struggles, widespread insecurity, and mass emigration, fueling anti-establishment sentiment. The author argues that mainstream parties have failed to address the broken economic model that has led to this point, resulting in high poverty rates and low wages. The article suggests that Simion's policies, similar to Viktor Orban's Hungary, may not offer a genuine alternative for ordinary Romanians.</p>

          <p>Japan witnessed record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, as investors sought safer havens amidst trade tensions and uncertainties surrounding the U.S. economy. The shift was largely driven by institutional investors diversifying away from U.S. assets, with pension funds and reserve managers playing a significant role. While the U.S. has since softened its trade stance, the inflows reflect a broader trend of investors seeking stability in Japanese markets, which are generally considered a safe haven.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation after posting an image on Instagram that was interpreted as a threat against President Trump. The image, featuring seashells arranged to form the numbers "86 47," prompted an outcry from the Trump administration, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem alleging it was a call for assassination. Comey later deleted the image, stating he opposed violence, but the incident highlights the ongoing tension between Comey and the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A strike by NJ Transit rail engineers has commenced, halting train service and impacting thousands of commuters. The dispute centers on pay raises, with the union arguing that their members are underpaid compared to similar positions. NJ Transit has implemented a contingency plan, including additional bus service and park-and-ride options, but warns that it can only accommodate a fraction of the usual train riders. The strike has prompted calls for commuters to work from home and raised concerns about transportation to events at MetLife Stadium.</p>

The strike stems from a disagreement over contract terms and conditions, with the union and NJ Transit officials unable to reach an agreement despite ongoing negotiations. New Jersey Gov.

          <p>Europe has been warned that it must reform quickly or become a "shock absorber" of tectonic upheavals in global trade imbalances caused by the US-China trade war. While recent talks have led to a reduction in tariffs, economists say that the outlook for Europe remains bleak if it fails to adapt to Washington's efforts to reorder trade. Without deeper political integration and better coordination of fiscal and industrial policies, Europe risks being forced to adjust to the choices of others without shaping the outcomes.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that lawyers are increasingly seeking out federal jurisdictions with judges sympathetic to their political views when challenging divisive issues. Conservatives suing the Biden administration often file cases in small Texas courts with Republican-appointed judges, while liberals challenging the Trump administration have favored courts in the 9th Circuit. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should be able to issue nationwide injunctions, a practice that has become more common in recent years.</p>
