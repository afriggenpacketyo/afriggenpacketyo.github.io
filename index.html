          <p>Over 365 people were arrested in London's Parliament Square for participating in a demonstration supporting Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under UK terrorism laws. The protest, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw hundreds of individuals display signs with messages opposing genocide and supporting the banned organization, leading to mass arrests for expressing support for a proscribed group. The event highlights the growing tension between free speech, protest rights, and national security measures, as the government's ban on the group is currently being challenged in court.</p>

This follows his recent threats to assume federal control over the city's police force and the deployment of federal law enforcement officers to patrol the streets. Despite official data showing a significant drop in violent crime in the district, the administration is framing the move as a necessary step to restore order.</p>

          <p>An early morning shooting in New York City's Times Square left three people injured, including two teenagers and a 65-year-old man. The incident reportedly began as a fight inside a restaurant that spilled onto the street, culminating in gunfire in an area designated as a gun-free zone. Police have taken a 17-year-old suspect into custody and recovered a firearm from the scene. All victims were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries and are in stable condition.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Friedrich Merz's decision to halt German arms exports to Israel has created a significant political rift within his own conservative coalition. Critics from his CDU/CSU alliance argue the move breaks with Germany's long-standing foreign policy and special responsibility toward Israel, viewing it as a strategic mistake. However, the decision has also found support from other conservatives and coalition partners like the Social Democrats, who believe it is a necessary response to the Israeli government's recent actions in Gaza.</p>

White opened fire on the campus, striking multiple buildings before being found deceased with a gunshot wound inside a nearby pharmacy. Officer Rose, a 33-year-old former Marine and father of two with another child on the way, was fatally wounded while responding to the scene. Investigators are exploring the possibility that the attack was motivated by the suspect's beliefs regarding COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through a homeowner's roof in McDonough, Georgia, has been analyzed by scientists and found to be approximately 4.56 billion years old. This makes the space rock about 20 million years older than Earth itself. The meteorite, which left a dent in the floor, is believed to be a fragment from a larger asteroid breakup that occurred 470 million years ago in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Scientists plan to officially name it the "McDonough Meteorite," marking the 27th such recovery in Georgia's history.</p>

          <p>The four-person crew of NASA's Crew-10 mission has successfully returned to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule. The crew, consisting of two NASA astronauts, a Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut, completed a 148-day mission aboard the International Space Station. During their time in orbit, they conducted over 200 scientific experiments. This landing marked the first time a NASA-sponsored crew has returned to the Pacific, a change made to ensure any discarded spacecraft debris lands far from populated areas.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical overview of how partisan gerrymandering, particularly the Republican "Redmap" project of 2010, has reshaped American politics. By targeting state legislative races, Republicans gained control of the redistricting process in key states, creating electoral maps that have locked in their power in Congress and statehouses for over a decade. This strategy, enhanced by modern technology, has insulated politicians from accountability and allowed for the passage of policies not supported by a majority of voters, fundamentally altering the democratic process.</p>

Gloss, who reportedly suffered from mental health issues, had expressed pro-Russian sentiments online before enlisting with Russian forces. The posthumous presentation of the Soviet-era Order of Lenin adds a strange and personal dimension to U.S.-Russia relations.</p>

The final monetary value of each point will depend on the total settlement fund and the number of points awarded across all claims.

          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has reported an additional 11 deaths from malnutrition, bringing the total to 212, including 98 children. This comes amid reports of an Israeli plan to take full security control of Gaza City, which could involve the forced displacement of its one million residents. Aid agencies continue to warn of famine conditions, stating that the amount of aid entering the territory is far below what is needed to meet the immense needs of the population. The situation highlights the catastrophic human cost of the ongoing conflict and blockade.</p>

          <p>World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture co-founded by Donald Trump and his sons, is reportedly seeking to raise $1.5 billion from investors. The funds are intended to establish a public company that will hold the venture's proprietary WLFI tokens, according to a Bloomberg News report. This move has amplified concerns among economists and some lawmakers about potential conflicts of interest, as the president's family deepens its financial ties to the largely unregulated crypto sector while his administration oversees its potential regulation.

          <p>A coalition of approximately 20 Arab and Muslim countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, has issued a joint statement condemning Israel's new plan to take military control of Gaza City. The nations described the plan as a "dangerous escalation" and a "flagrant violation of international law" aimed at entrenching the occupation. This unified denunciation follows the Israeli security cabinet's approval of a plan that would see its military seize the territory's largest city and displace its population, further escalating regional tensions over the conflict.</p>

          <h2>Scientist Affirms Bermuda Triangle Mystery Can Be Explained by Probability and Environment</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki asserts that the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle is not a mystery at all, attributing the disappearances to a combination of high traffic volume, human error, and challenging weather. He argues that, on a percentage basis, no more vessels or aircraft go missing in the area than in any other well-traveled part of the ocean. This scientific explanation, supported by organizations like NOAA and Lloyd's of London, points to natural phenomena like the Gulf Stream and navigational complexities rather than supernatural causes.</p>
