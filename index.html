This honor will take place at halftime of the team's home opener on September 14 against the Chicago Bears. Porcher, a three-time Pro Bowl selection who spent his entire 13-year NFL career with the Lions, holds records for career sacks, single-season sacks, and multiple double-digit sack seasons.

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to roll back electric vehicle incentives and promote fossil fuels, Ford is making a significant $5 billion investment in a new EV platform for an affordable four-door pickup truck, aiming for a 2027 release at around $30,000. This strategic move signals automakers' belief in the long-term growth of EVs, even as U.S. sales have slowed due to cost and infrastructure concerns. Globally, the EV transition is accelerating, with countries like China and the European Union maintaining strong support and regulations. Ford's focus on a lower price point and export markets reflects a broader industry recognition that affordability, rather than just environmental benefits, will drive mass adoption.</p>

This win puts the two-time defending champions four points clear at the top of the table, with a superior net run-rate making it highly improbable for them to be overtaken by rivals. Batter Jordan Cox continued his exceptional form with 47 runs from 27 balls, further extending his lead as the tournament's top scorer.

          <p>Twenty-two people, including five journalists, were killed in two consecutive Israeli strikes on Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, Gaza, leading to widespread international condemnation. The incident, confirmed by the hospital morgue and witnessed by survivors, involved an initial strike followed minutes later by a second missile hitting the same spot as rescue workers and other journalists responded. This marks one of the deadliest days for the press in the Palestinian territory, with organizations like the Committee to Protect Journalists calling for firm action. While Israel's prime minister expressed regret for the "tragic mishap," media groups accuse the military of a pattern of targeting journalists.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the Department of Justice will sue California over Governor Gavin Newsom's push for a new, Democratic-leaning congressional map. This move comes just days after Trump lauded Texas Republican legislators for codifying a new map designed to give the GOP an advantage in five more U.S. House races. Newsom quickly responded with defiance, tweeting "BRING IT." The controversy highlights the intense political battle over redistricting, typically conducted every ten years after the U.S. Census, with Texas's mid-decade effort drawing significant criticism from Democrats.</p>

He praised Rubio’s decision, prompted by a deadly crash allegedly involving an illegal immigrant trucker, and urged other states to prioritize U.S. citizens for such employment opportunities.

While KDP shares fell 11% on the news, JDE Peet's stock surged 15%, reflecting the market's mixed reaction to the complex deal.

Legal experts, however, maintain that the First Amendment protects this form of political protest, making the order a direct challenge to established constitutional precedents.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay has confirmed that quarterback Matthew Stafford is on schedule to start the season opener against the Houston Texans, showing no setbacks after returning from a back injury. In further positive news for the team, left tackle Alaric Jackson, who has been sidelined with blood-clot issues, is expected to participate in full-team drills next week. Jackson's return to protect Stafford's blindside would be a significant boost for the Rams, who are carefully managing his condition. The team is optimistic about both players' trajectories as they prepare for the upcoming season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by labor researchers indicates that the share of working Californians represented by unions has remained relatively stable over the past two decades, defying a national trend of declining union membership. In 2024, 16.3% of California's labor force, totaling 2.67 million workers, were covered by a union. This stability is attributed to consistent and successful new organizing efforts, particularly within the medical industry and at companies like Starbucks. While some sectors experienced declines, California's sustained union activity contrasts sharply with the gradual national decrease, highlighting the state's unique labor landscape.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article highlights the critical consequences for seniors who fail to meet their reverse mortgage obligations, such as property taxes, insurance premiums, or home maintenance costs. Unlike traditional mortgages, defaulting on a reverse mortgage can cause the entire loan balance to become immediately due and payable, often leading to swift foreclosure proceedings. Such defaults can also negatively impact a borrower's credit score, even though the reverse mortgage debt itself doesn't appear on credit reports. While reverse mortgages offer financial flexibility, understanding these risks and proactively addressing difficulties is essential to avoid severe financial ramifications.

          <p>Starbucks' stock experienced a 2% drop, largely attributed to competitive concerns following Keurig Dr Pepper's acquisition of JDE Peet's, and more significantly, a Bloomberg report detailing Starbucks' decision to scale back production at its U.S. plants. The company's shift from a seven-day to a five-day production schedule, starting in January, suggests current demand is lower than previous capacity. This move, potentially aimed at cost-cutting and efficiency, comes after Starbucks recorded six consecutive quarters of negative same-store sales.

          <p>Cracker Barrel's recent logo redesign sparked public furor and an almost $100 million drop in market value, highlighting the risks of altering a company's core brand identity. Marketing experts attribute the backlash to the company abandoning its established "brand story," which previously featured an old-timey man and barrel evoking a southern, nostalgic atmosphere. The new, more generic logo, perceived by some as "woke," alienated loyal customers who valued the brand's consistent, folksy image. This incident underscores the challenge for legacy brands to modernize without alienating their core stakeholders and the emotional investment customers have in familiar imagery.</p>
