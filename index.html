          <p>Russell Brand formally denied five counts of sexual assault, including one count of sexual assault, one of indecent assault, one of oral sexual assault and two further counts of sexual assault, at Southwark Crown Court in London. The charges stem from allegations by four women for incidents between 1999 and 2005. Brand, who maintains his innocence, will remain on conditional bail until his trial, which is scheduled to begin on June 3, 2026, with a pre-trial review set for May 20, 2026. Brand rose to prominence as a stand-up comedian and television host before establishing a Hollywood career. </p>

          <p>Neuroscientist Mark Blumberg discusses the complexities of animal behavior and the limitations of the term "instinct." He argues that behaviors are species-typical, arising from a combination of genetic predispositions, environmental experiences, and learning. Blumberg uses the example of a tailorbird sewing leaves to create a nest to illustrate the interplay of innate abilities and environmental factors. He emphasizes that behaviors grow up in bodies under environmental experiences and explicit learning, and all of those things are going to shape them.</p>

          <p>The Honolulu Police Department is under scrutiny following an ACLU of Hawaii lawsuit alleging officers are arresting sober drivers to inflate DUI arrest statistics. The lawsuit claims officers are incentivized to make DUI arrests, leading to investigative shortcuts and arrests without probable cause, even when drivers show no signs of impairment and have 0.000 breath test results. The ACLU asserts this practice aims to secure federal funding and meet quotas, causing lasting damage to innocent individuals' records and reputations. The department has initiated a review of impaired driving arrests dating back to 2021 in response to these allegations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its stance on academic exchanges with China by aggressively revoking visas for Chinese students with alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party or those studying in critical fields. This policy shift contrasts with the era of soft power diplomacy initiated by President Jimmy Carter in the 1970s, which fostered academic exchange between the two nations. The administration claims that China exploits U.S. universities to enhance its military and technological capabilities, citing risks of espionage and technology theft. These new measures are expected to reduce the number of Chinese students on American campuses, who numbered approximately 277,000 in 2024.</p>

          <p>An expert argues that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the head of Health and Human Services, is misguided in his approach to autism research by focusing on environmental toxins rather than genetics. The expert contends that the increase in autism rates is primarily due to expanding diagnostic criteria and increased awareness, not a novel environmental factor. The article highlights the significant progress in genetics research, which has identified hundreds of genes associated with autism and facilitated the development of potential therapies. It warns that Kennedy's emphasis on environmental factors could divert resources from promising genetic research and muddy the understanding of autism.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Parks-Ramage's novel, "It's Not the End of the World," is reviewed as a campy and ambitious work that blends elements of bourgeoisie routine with dystopian chaos. The book follows Mason Daunt, a wealthy gay artist in 2044 Los Angeles, as his world is disrupted by a mysterious pink fog that causes violence and a zombie-like state. The novel explores themes of wealth, inequality, climate change, and the question of children's role in a bleak future.

          <p>A dry spring has significantly reduced the amount of runoff into the Colorado River, exacerbating the region's ongoing water crisis and straining flows to Southern California. The river's flows into Lake Powell are projected to be only 46% of average, leading to further declines in reservoir levels. This situation underscores the need for new water management guidelines after 2026, as current measures are insufficient to prevent reservoirs from reaching critically low levels.

          <p>A lawsuit has been filed against several oil companies, alleging they are responsible for the death of a woman in Seattle during a record-breaking heat wave in 2021. The lawsuit claims the companies knew for decades that burning fossil fuels alters the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in extreme weather and foreseeable loss of life, but deceived the public about the risks. This marks the first time oil companies have been sued over the death of a person in a "climate disaster." The plaintiff is seeking damages and a public education campaign to correct misinformation.</p>

          <p>One year after his conviction for falsifying business records, Donald Trump continues his legal fight to overturn the verdict in the hush money case. A federal appeals court is set to hear oral arguments on moving the case from state to federal court, with Trump's lawyers arguing that the prosecution relied on evidence related to his official acts as president. The appeal proceeds on uncharted legal grounds as Trump wields the power of the presidency in his defense, characterizing the prosecutors as politically motivated. His former defense attorneys now work for the government, adding another layer of complexity to the case.</p>
