          <p>Following the Pahalgam attack, the US and China have both urged India and Pakistan to de-escalate tensions. The Indian Army reported exchanging gunfire with Pakistani soldiers for the fourth consecutive night along the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir, a disputed territory administered by India, Pakistan, and China. India has accused Pakistan of supporting militancy in the region after the attack, while Pakistan denies involvement and calls for an independent probe. The Line of Control divides the Indian and Pakistan-administered parts of Kashmir, and tensions remain high between the two nations.</p>

          <p>A new study has linked the Han dynasty's conquest of the Nanyue kingdom in southern China in 112 BC to the decline of the Chinese swamp cypress. Researchers analyzed geological evidence, pollen analysis, and historical records to determine how the Han's riverine warfare tactics impacted the Pearl River Delta's ecosystem. Sediment samples showed a decline in swamp cypress pollen and a spike in charcoal deposits around 100 BC, coinciding with the Han's assault on Nanyue's capital, Panyu, when the city was set ablaze. The findings highlight the long-term environmental consequences of ancient warfare.</p>

          <p>Japan and Vietnam have agreed to establish a vice-ministerial-level foreign affairs and defense dialogue framework to address China's increasing military presence in the region. The leaders of both countries also pledged to enhance multilateral free trade in response to US President Trump's tariff policies. Japan is considering adding Vietnam to its list of eligible defense equipment recipients, potentially making Vietnam the fourth ASEAN member to receive aid under Japan's Official Security Assistance scheme. This move underscores Japan's efforts to strengthen security ties with ASEAN states.</p>

The article emphasizes the importance of maintaining supply chains and industrial capabilities to compete globally and safeguard national security. It draws parallels to the challenges faced by the U.S. auto industry in the 1980s and the need for strategic adaptation.</p>
