          <p>President Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer have announced the initial framework of a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. from the Oval Office, which aims to increase trade while maintaining certain tariffs. The agreement includes increased access to the U.K. market for U.S. agricultural products and reduced non-tariff barriers, with Britain set to reduce or eliminate discriminatory practices against U.S. products. The deal also involves keeping a 10% tariff on U.K. imports, with exemptions for the first 100,000 vehicles, and Rolls Royce engines not being subject to tariffs. The framework is expected to generate $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. and includes a British airline purchasing $10 billion in Boeing planes.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a missile test intended to bolster the military's nuclear counterattack capabilities, as reported by state media following detections by South Korea and Japan of ballistic missiles launched toward the Sea of Japan. The drill involved training units to operate a 600-millimeter multilayer rocket system and the Hwasongpho-11-Ka tactical ballistic missile. Kim emphasized the importance of strengthening the role of nuclear forces in deterring war and called for improved combat readiness. KCNA also accused the U.S. and its allies of conducting nuclear operation drills, necessitating North Korea's preparedness for rapid reaction and a thorough war posture.</p>

          <p>Despite the imposition of tariffs by the United States, China's exports experienced an 8.1% year-on-year increase in April, demonstrating resilience in the face of trade pressures. This growth exceeded market expectations, though exports to the U.S. specifically saw a decline of 21%. Meanwhile, China's imports contracted slightly by 0.2% year-on-year. The country's trade surplus for April was recorded at US$96.18 billion, a decrease from the previous month. The U.S. had announced reciprocal tariffs on Chinese imports, leading China to retaliate with duties on American goods.</p>

          <p>Developed nations are beginning to diversify their tungsten supply sources after China imposed export restrictions on critical industrial metals, including tungsten. The restrictions, part of China's retaliation against U.S. tariffs, have caused panic in the industry, which has relied on Chinese raw materials for 30 years. The element is crucial for cutting tools, ammunition, and clean energy applications. The US defense contractors must stop using Chinese tungsten by January 1, 2027.

          <p>Despite Russia's announcement of a three-day ceasefire to coincide with Victory Day, Ukrainian soldiers and civilians in the Donetsk region express deep skepticism and report ongoing attacks. Soldiers near Pokrovsk describe continuous explosions and drone attacks, emphasizing that Russia cannot be trusted. Civilians in Dobropillya echo these sentiments, noting that the sounds of explosions persist despite the ceasefire announcement. President Zelensky has rejected Russia's offer, calling for a longer 30-day truce.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Assess the Impact of US-UK Trade Deal</h2>

          <p>Analysts are offering mixed reactions to the new trade deal between the US and the UK, with some describing it as a symbolic political victory for President Trump while others point to its limited substantive benefits. The deal maintains existing tariffs on most UK goods but rolls back some import taxes on strategic sectors like cars and steel. In return, the US secured expanded access for American agricultural products in the UK market. Experts suggest the deal primarily serves Trump's goal of having an agreement, regardless of its actual impact.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., after withdrawing his previous nominee. The move raises legal questions about Trump's appointment powers and could face legal challenges. Pirro's selection provides Trump with a trusted ally in a key Justice Department office. This tactic could eliminate the need for Senate confirmation by frequently changing U.S. attorneys.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics are advocating for a revised understanding of World War II history, suggesting that the conflict's start date should be pushed back to 1931 with Japan's invasion of Manchuria. This perspective aims to highlight China's role in the war against fascism, challenging the Western-centric view that marks Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland as the beginning. President Xi Jinping will attend a Victory Day parade in Moscow this week, commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII in Europe.</p>

          <p>UCLA's medical school is facing a federal class-action lawsuit alleging that it uses race as a factor in admissions, violating state law and Supreme Court precedent. The lawsuit, brought by activist groups, claims that the school intentionally discriminates based on race and ethnicity in its admissions process. The lawsuit cites whistleblowers who allege that the associate dean for admissions requires applicants to submit responses that reveal their race, which is then used in admission decisions. The Trump administration is also scrutinizing UCLA and other UC campuses for potential illegal DEI practices.</p>

The agreement allows Britain to export 100,000 cars per year into the U.S. with a 10 percent tariff, while the U.S. will remove its additional tariffs of 25 percent on steel and aluminum. The deal expands market access for American farm products, such as beef and bioethanol, and reduces nontariff barriers.

          <p>India appears ready to strike a trade deal with the U.S., potentially at the cost of some of its domestic manufacturing ambitions. Recent reports suggest India has proposed zero tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis up to a certain quantity. Analysts suggest that even if the deal involves India abolishing tariffs on certain sectors, it won't be particularly detrimental to all of those industries. A trade deal could also benefit logistics companies, while consultancy giants Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys are set to outperform, irrespective of a deal.</p>

They reflect on the challenges facing new artists today, including the shrinking live music scene and the decline of music TV shows.</p>
