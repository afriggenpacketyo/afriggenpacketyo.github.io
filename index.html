          <p>Hurricane Erin has rapidly intensified into a powerful Category 5 storm, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, with maximum sustained winds reaching 160 mph. Its outer bands are currently impacting the northern Leeward Islands, prompting tropical storm watches and warnings of potential flash flooding. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the storm's center will pass north of Puerto Rico and remain at sea, avoiding a direct impact on the United States. Forecasters are still urging those in the Caribbean to monitor its progress closely.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Guatemala successfully freed nine prison guards who were held hostage for three days by inmates from the Mara Salvatrucha gang. The riots began earlier in the week in two separate prisons, involving members of both Mara Salvatrucha and Barrio 18. The inmates were demanding the return of 10 gang leaders who had been transferred to another facility and placed in solitary confinement. The incident highlights the ongoing violent rivalry between the two major gangs for control within the nation's prison system.</p>

          <p>A White House official has confirmed that National Guard members deployed in Washington, D.C., may be armed to protect federal assets and support civil authorities, though they will not be making arrests. This represents a shift from previous guidance, which stated that weapons would remain in armories. The deployment is part of President Trump's executive order declaring a public safety emergency to address crime, which placed the city's police under federal control. The move has prompted protests from some D.C. residents who oppose the increased law enforcement presence.</p>

          <p>A new box set titled "Sunset Boulevard" compiles the music Elvis Presley recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975, capturing his last significant burst of creativity. The collection includes hits like "Burning Love" and showcases his evolution into an expressive ballad singer, influenced by his personal struggles. The article reflects on this period, including a missed opportunity to star in "A Star Is Born" with Barbra Streisand, which some believe marked a turning point before his death in 1977. The release offers a fresh look at Presley's artistry as he navigated a changing cultural landscape.</p>

This development comes as families of hostages held in Gaza call for protests demanding an end to the war.</p>

          <p>Following a summit in Alaska, Russian President Vladimir Putin described his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump as "timely and very useful" for discussing a resolution to the war in Ukraine. Putin stated that a settlement should be based on eliminating the "root causes" of the crisis. The article also details several related developments, including First Lady Melania Trump sending a letter to Putin about abducted children and reports that Putin demanded Ukraine withdraw from the entire Donetsk region in exchange for halting its offensive in other areas.

The increased presence of federal agents and outside troops has been justified by the administration as a necessary crackdown on crime and homelessness.

          <p>An opinion piece argues against proposed legislation that would weaken the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act, calling the bill a "death sentence" for whales, dolphins, and seals. While the act has successfully helped some species recover, many marine mammal populations are now facing new threats from climate change, ship strikes, and pollution. The article highlights the recent crash in the West Coast gray whale population and the struggles of North Atlantic right whales as evidence that protections are more critical than ever. It concludes that safeguarding these animals is essential for the overall health of the ocean.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has praised U.S. President Donald Trump, stating his efforts have brought the end of Russia's war in Ukraine "closer than ever before." The commendation came after the Alaska summit between Trump and Vladimir Putin, which did not result in a ceasefire but opened the door for further talks. Starmer emphasized that any path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and reaffirmed the UK's unwavering support for Ukraine. He also welcomed the U.S. commitment to providing robust security guarantees as part of a potential peace deal.</p>

          <h2>Man Scammed Out of $17,000 After Being Transferred During Call to Official United Airlines Number</h2>

          <p>A Denver man was scammed out of $17,000 after his call to United Airlines' official customer service number was mysteriously transferred to a fraudster. While trying to rebook a canceled flight, Dan Smoker spoke with an agent who processed a new ticket and then a separate $17,000 charge under the alias "AIRLINEFARE." Call logs confirmed he dialed the correct number, but United's internal records showed the call lasted only 12 minutes, not the three hours Smoker was on the phone. The case highlights a sophisticated new type of scam where customers are intercepted through official corporate channels.</p>

          <p>Cardiologists are encouraging adults over the age of 60 to incorporate more salmon into their diets to support cardiovascular health. The article highlights that salmon is a high-quality protein rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help lower "bad" LDL cholesterol and reduce inflammation. Maintaining overall muscle mass through adequate protein intake is also beneficial for the heart, which is itself a muscle. Experts recommend eating at least two servings of omega-3-rich fish per week, prepared in healthy ways such as baking or grilling rather than frying.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explains Rapid Intensification of Hurricane Erin to Category 5 Strength</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 13:46:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Erin underwent a process of rapid intensification, strengthening from a tropical storm to a powerful Category 5 hurricane in just over 24 hours. This explosive growth was fueled by a combination of low wind shear and its path over unusually warm ocean waters with surface temperatures exceeding 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Experts note that climate change is making such rapid intensification events more common, as hotter oceans provide more energy for storms. This phenomenon complicates forecasting and emergency preparedness, as storms can become dangerously powerful with very little warning.</p>

          <p>Topshop is planning a major comeback with the confirmed return of standalone stores to the UK High Street, years after its previous owner, Arcadia, collapsed. The brand, now owned by ASOS, recently hosted its first catwalk show in seven years, signaling its intent to reclaim its former status as a fashion trendsetter. While nostalgia for the brand is high among millennials and Gen Z, industry experts caution that its success will depend on attracting a new generation of shoppers. The company aims to re-establish its unique "London girl" aesthetic while navigating a competitive market with different price points.</p>

          <p>John Cruickshank, the last living recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War Two, has died at the age of 105. The Aberdeen native was awarded Britain's highest military honor for his valor during an attack on a German U-boat in 1944 while piloting a Catalina flying boat. Despite suffering 72 separate injuries from heavy gunfire, he successfully destroyed the submarine, an act his citation praised as an example of supreme courage and devotion to duty. After the war, he left the RAF for a career in banking and rarely spoke of his wartime experiences.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of people in the southern Syrian city of Sweida demonstrated for self-determination for the Druze minority, following deadly sectarian clashes in July. The violence, which involved Druze militias and armed Bedouin Sunni tribes, resulted in approximately 1,600 deaths. Druze groups have accused the Syrian government, which intervened in the conflict, of siding with the Bedouin tribes and committing atrocities. Some protesters waved Israeli flags, thanking Israel for its military intervention in July, which it stated was to protect the Druze community in southern Syria.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is directing U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to apply greater scrutiny when evaluating the "good moral character" of legal immigrants applying for citizenship. A new policy memo instructs officers to conduct a "holistic assessment" that considers positive contributions like community involvement and stable employment. However, it also mandates greater scrutiny of negative factors beyond criminal offenses, including actions that are lawful but "inconsistent with civic responsibility," such as habitual traffic infractions. Critics argue the policy is designed to create more grounds for denial and discourage eligible immigrants from applying.</p>
