          <p>Malawi and Israel have entered into an agreement that will allow Malawian nurses and midwives to work in Israeli health institutions. The Malawian government hopes this deal will provide jobs, new skills, and financial support for the healthcare workers and their families. However, critics are concerned about the potential strain on Malawi's already fragile healthcare system and the possibility of exploitation, drawing parallels to a previous agreement involving Malawian agricultural workers in Israel. Some Malawian nurses are eager to go, while others are hesitant due to concerns about working conditions and security risks in Israel.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine, calling them "absolutely crazy" after Russia launched a large-scale drone attack on Ukraine. Trump expressed his unhappiness with the situation, questioning Putin's motives and the extent of the violence. In response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov attributed Trump's remarks to emotional overload while maintaining that Putin's decisions are necessary for Russia's security. The recent attacks involved hundreds of drones and missiles, resulting in injuries and prompting calls for stronger international pressure on Moscow.</p>

          <p>On Memorial Day, Americans are taking time to remember and honor military service members who have died.

These stories highlight the valor and dedication of those who served, such as Hans George Faltin, who defused booby traps during World War II, and Carl Sutton, who served in Vietnam. The Up First newsletter team asked listeners and readers to tell us stories of the loved ones they've lost. One word stood out to me as I read through them: valor.</p>

Despite facing frigid waters and challenging weather conditions, Pugh is determined to complete the 62-mile swim and convey his message about the critical role sharks play in the ocean ecosystem.</p>

          <p>The article explores the often-overlooked connection between personal finance and the climate crisis, highlighting how pensions, investments, and banking decisions can inadvertently support fossil fuel projects. It reveals that shifting to a sustainable pension provider can significantly reduce an individual's carbon footprint. While quantifying the precise impact is challenging, experts emphasize that banks use customer money to expand their business and attract investors, potentially benefiting fossil fuel companies. The article also discusses green finance alternatives and the importance of transparency and regulation in the sustainable finance sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Suzanne O’Sullivan, a neurologist, argues that modern medicine's eagerness to diagnose and preemptively screen patients is creating problems. She advocates for “slow medicine,” where doctors and patients take time to develop a relationship, monitor symptoms, and take great care before naming a condition. She claims that an over-reliance on tests and scans is leading to overdiagnosis, which can cause real harm. O'Sullivan emphasizes that diagnosis is a clinical skill that requires understanding the patient's story in the context of the tests.</p>

Access to charging and fuel was also a concern a century earlier. The author wonders if the history of electric vehicles could repeat itself.
