        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data suggests that people receiving the new state pension in the UK are likely to see an increase of over £500 per year starting in April. The "triple lock" policy ensures the state pension rises annually by the highest of 2.5%, inflation, or average earnings growth. With the Office for National Statistics reporting total pay including bonuses rose by 4.7% in the three months to July, this figure is expected to determine the annual increase. The increase will depend on individual contribution history. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The forthcoming "Hillsborough Law" will require public officials to be truthful during investigations into major disasters, with potential criminal sanctions for non-compliance. This legislation aims to prevent cover-ups and ensure accountability, inspired by the Hillsborough disaster and other tragedies like the Grenfell Tower fire. The bill, set to be introduced to Parliament, includes a "duty of candour," obligating public officials to act honestly and with integrity at all times during investigations. Campaigners and families of victims welcome the law as a crucial step towards justice and preventing future suffering caused by institutional dishonesty. The law is expected to change the balance of power in Britain.</p>

Trump claimed the newspaper has made false statements about him, his family, and his business, without providing specific details in his initial statement. This lawsuit follows Trump's previous threats to sue the Times over reporting related to a note and drawing involving Jeffrey Epstein. Trump has also brought a $10 billion defamation suit against The Wall Street Journal for its article linking him to the Epstein note published. </p>

          <p>The names of Chinese missiles, including the Dongfeng (East Wind), were inspired by Mao Zedong's ideology. The Dongfeng missile's name originates from Mao's 1957 speech in Moscow, where he stated, "Either the east wind prevails over the west wind, or the west wind prevails over the east wind," referring to communist China and the capitalist West. This naming convention reflects the historical and political context of China's missile development program. The program has since expanded greatly.</p>

          <p>A report indicates that Russia has been forcing kidnapped Ukrainian children to work in factories producing drones and other military hardware for its armed forces. The study, conducted by Yale University's humanitarian research lab, details 210 facilities used by Russia for the abduction, deportation, re-education, and forced adoption of Ukrainian children. Children at the "All-Russian Children's Center 'Change'" have been made to construct drones, mine detectors, robots, and rapid loaders for assault rifles. The findings highlight potential war crimes committed by Russia. </p>

          <p>The Dodgers are considering using Shohei Ohtani, primarily a starting pitcher, in a bullpen role during the playoffs. While the team expects Ohtani to contribute as a starter, they acknowledge the possibility of him pitching in relief in specific late-game situations. Manager Dave Roberts and President Andrew Friedman have both indicated that the conversation regarding Ohtani's postseason pitching role remains open. Ohtani's unique two-way status adds complications, as MLB rules would prevent him from remaining in the game as a designated hitter if he enters as a reliever. </p>

He noted that all 10 UC campuses are facing federal investigations and actions, ranging from allegations of illegal use of race in admissions to civil rights complaints related to discrimination. Milliken cautioned that these challenges could lead to budget cuts, federal grant suspensions, and layoffs.

          <p>Two teenagers in China have been ordered to pay 2.2 million yuan ($309,000) to two catering companies after they urinated into a pot of broth at a hotpot restaurant. The incident, which occurred at a Haidilao branch in Shanghai, sparked widespread condemnation after the teens posted a video of their act online. The court found that the teenagers had infringed upon the companies' property rights and reputation, and ordered their parents to bear the compensation. The court ruled that any additional compensation Haidilao offered to its customers was a voluntary business decision. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has designated Colombia as failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in nearly 30 years, a rebuke to the traditional U.S. ally. Despite this designation, the administration issued a waiver of sanctions, citing vital U.S. national interests. Colombian President Gustavo Petro expressed regret over the decision, highlighting the sacrifices made by Colombian security forces in the drug war. The designation reflects concerns over increased cocaine production and shifting policies under Petro's leadership. </p>
