          <p>President Trump pardoned Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed, BitMEX co-founders, who had pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act.  The pardons came despite accusations of operating BitMEX as a money-laundering platform and disregarding anti-money laundering regulations. This action may be seen as politically motivated, given Delo's statement suggesting wrongful targeting and inconsistent regulatory signals.</p>
