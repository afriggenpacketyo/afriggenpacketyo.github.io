          <p>A tractor-trailer carrying approximately 250 million bees overturned in Whatcom County, Washington, leading to the escape of the pollinators. Authorities advised the public to avoid the area, particularly those allergic to bee stings, while beekeepers worked to re-hive the bees and locate the queen. The road was closed for an estimated 24 to 48 hours to facilitate the bee recovery efforts. By the next morning, most of the bees had returned to their hives, and those responsible for the delivery took charge of the situation. </p>

This change follows a directive from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who rescinded the department's 2022 acceptance of the CDC's recommendations for routine COVID-19 vaccination in children and pregnant women. Professional medical groups, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, continue to recommend COVID-19 vaccines for these groups based on scientific evidence.

          <p>President Trump touted a "blockbuster agreement" between U.S. Steel and Japanese company Nippon Steel that he said would keep the iconic U.S. steelmaker in Pittsburgh and invest billions in facilities in several other states. Trump emphasized that the U.S. Steel headquarters would stay in Pittsburgh, bringing in more jobs for Americans -- and even promised a $5,000 bonus for every U.S. steelworker. He also claimed that under the deal, U.S Steel would still be "controlled by the USA," although he did not explicitly say how the ownership of the company would be structured.</p>
