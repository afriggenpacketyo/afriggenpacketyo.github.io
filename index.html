        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has accused Volodymyr Zelensky of hindering peace negotiations by refusing to concede Crimea to Russia, claiming a deal to end the war was close but Zelensky's stance is prolonging the conflict. This follows US Vice-President JD Vance outlining a potential deal to freeze territorial lines near their current positions, which Ukraine rejects. Russia intensified attacks after a brief Easter lull, despite Putin's claim of a ceasefire. The conflict, rooted in Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and support for militants in eastern Ukraine, has resulted in hundreds of thousands of casualties and millions of refugees.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aiming to reform college accreditation by focusing on "results" rather than "woke ideology," and to enforce laws requiring universities to disclose large foreign gifts. The order directs the Department of Education to hold accreditors accountable for failing to meet recognition criteria or engaging in unlawful discrimination under the guise of diversity initiatives. The administration believes accreditation entities have become too focused on ideology and not enough on merit, while also alleging that some universities, like Harvard, have violated foreign gift disclosure laws. Tensions have escalated between the administration and Harvard, which has sued over funding freezes.</p>

          <p>A coalition of states has filed a lawsuit against President Trump's administration, challenging the legality of his newly imposed tariffs on foreign imports. The states argue that the president lacks the authority to arbitrarily impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, asserting that this power is constitutionally reserved for Congress. The lawsuit seeks a court order declaring the tariffs unlawful and preventing their enforcement, citing the potential for economic chaos and harm to consumers. The states contend that the tariffs represent an unconstitutional tax increase imposed without congressional approval.</p>

          <p>Chris Brookes-Smith, who once feared even trace amounts of peanuts due to a severe allergy, now eats them daily for breakfast after participating in a clinical trial. The trial, conducted at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London, used oral immunotherapy to desensitize adults with serious peanut allergies. Over nine months, patients gradually increased their peanut intake under medical supervision, starting with tiny amounts of peanut powder. The treatment, led by Professor Stephen Till, has shown potential to significantly improve patients' lives by providing protection against accidental exposure and empowering them to manage their allergy.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's foreign policy is being pulled in different directions by competing factions within his administration, leading to unexpected shifts in approach. While Trump campaigned on a hard line against Iran, he has recently engaged in talks for a new nuclear deal similar to the original one, drawing praise from some and criticism from others. This shift is attributed to the absence of key figures from his first term and the rise of new players with differing agendas, including neo-isolationists led by Vice President J.D.

          <p>A Dartmouth College study estimates that emissions from 111 fossil fuel companies caused $28 trillion in climate damage between 1991 and 2020, attributing about a third of the total cost to five companies. The research presents a method for tying emissions to specific climate harms, aiming to hold companies liable for the costs of extreme weather events. The study found that every 1% of greenhouse gas emissions since 1990 has caused $502 billion in damage from heat alone. Researchers used computer simulations to translate emissions into changes in Earth's temperature, connecting pollution from individual companies to specific climate impacts.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the installation of a makeup studio next to the Pentagon press briefing room, sparking controversy over the cost and timing. The project, suggested by a former Fox News producer, involved renovating an adjacent green room with a large mirror and makeup lighting. Hegseth, a former Fox News host, is reportedly doing his own makeup for TV appearances. The renovation comes as the administration seeks cost-cutting measures. Hegseth is also under review for sharing sensitive military strike details in a Signal group chat.</p>

          <p>Experts are casting doubt on President Trump's claim that Kilmar Abrego Garcia's finger tattoos prove his membership in MS-13. Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident mistakenly deported to El Salvador, has been repeatedly linked to the gang by Trump, who shared an image of his tattoos with digitally added labels. While some tattoos can be associated with gang symbolism, experts say the markings alone are not reliable indicators of membership and that Abrego Garcia has no criminal record. The case has raised concerns about the potential for mislabeling individuals based on perceived race, immigration status, or tattoos.</p>

Flores is the first alleged TdA member to be charged with terrorism offenses since President Trump designated the gang as a terrorist organization. Prosecutors allege that Flores helped deliver cocaine for international distribution to further the gang's criminal goals. The charges include conspiring to provide material support to TdA and international drug distribution conspiracy. Extraditing Flores to the U.S. would contradict previous arguments by DOJ officials defending the rushed deportations of alleged TdA members to El Salvador.</p>
