          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has been monitoring carbon dioxide levels since the 1960s, continuing the work of Professor Charles David Keeling, who first documented the buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere. Professor Ralph Keeling, his son, now analyzes air samples at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. However, proposed funding cuts by the Trump administration threaten to end this decades-long critical scientific research, which would degrade the nation's ability to project how climate change could impact us in the future. Keeling equates ending the program to turning off headlights on a dark street at night, making it impossible to see where we are going.</p>

          <p>Cambodia has allowed warships from multiple nations, including Vietnam, Japan, and Russia, to access its Ream naval base, signaling an inclusive approach to regional security and dispelling notions of it being solely a Chinese outpost. This move aligns with China's vision of an inclusive regional security framework, as expressed during President Xi Jinping's Southeast Asian tour. China has outlined a new security doctrine emphasizing peaceful dialogue and resolving disputes through sovereign states directly concerned, particularly in the South China Sea. For this vision to foster lasting trust, China needs to prioritize openness, consistency, and multilateral engagement.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, arrested for trespassing at a federal immigration facility, defended his actions during a gubernatorial debate, asserting he did not interfere with law enforcement. Baraka stated he attended a press conference, not a protest, and that Homeland Security escalated the situation by making arrests. Other gubernatorial candidates expressed varying levels of support for Baraka's actions, with some suggesting he was invited in and did nothing wrong. The arrest occurred amidst calls for access to the privately-run detention facility, with Baraka emphasizing the need for the facility to obey local laws and respect constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court for permission to deport a group of nearly 200 Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas, claiming they are gang members. The administration argues that a group of migrants barricaded themselves inside a detention center, threatened to take hostages, and harm immigration officers. The solicitor general asserts the government's strong interest in promptly removing gang members who pose a danger to ICE officers and facility staff. This filing marks the latest development in the administration's efforts to deport Venezuelan immigrants accused of being members of the gang Tren de Aragua.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's GDP grew by 3.4% in 2024, marking its highest growth rate in a decade, driven by recovery in the oil and gas sector and strong performance in tech and finance, according to a World Bank report. Despite this growth, poverty remains high, with nearly half of Nigerians living in poverty in 2024, making it the country with the world's second-largest poor population after India. While inflation is expected to fall, it is still forecast to remain high at an average of 22.1%, eroding the purchasing power of Nigerians. The report praises government reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira, but acknowledges the reforms have caused a cost-of-living crisis for many ordinary Nigerians.</p>

Appointed as the first postwar U.S. ambassador to Vietnam in 1997, Peterson sought accountability for missing Americans and fostered a new diplomatic relationship, emphasizing openness and transparency.

          <p>Gold prices have surged by over 40% in the past year, reaching an all-time record due to factors like unpredictable US trade policies and geopolitical uncertainty, prompting investors to seek a stable asset. Central banks have also been net buyers of gold, adding to their official reserves, especially since 2022. While gold is considered a safe haven, it is not immune to price fluctuations, with past surges followed by significant falls. Experts suggest the upward trend may continue, but caution that a market bubble could be forming, advising investors to diversify their portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced significant flight delays due to a shortage of air traffic controllers, with as few as three controllers scheduled to work during peak hours. This staffing crisis exacerbated existing issues, including a recent radar outage and months of glitches, leading to delays of up to seven hours. The FAA's move to relocate Newark's air traffic management to Philadelphia, intended to improve staffing, has faced challenges, as training new controllers takes years. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed the Biden administration for "bungling" the move and plans to reduce the number of flights at the airport to mitigate delays.</p>

          <p>Doctors and researchers are debating who should take GLP-1 drugs, effective for weight loss but expensive and with side effects. The article argues that the primary goal should be health changes, not just weight changes, as these drugs reduce visceral fat, linked to metabolic diseases. Identifying individuals with excess visceral fat is crucial, using waist size and blood-lipid patterns as indicators, rather than solely relying on BMI. The FDA's guidelines and clinical trials still use BMI, despite its limitations, highlighting the need for a better diagnostic test for insulin resistance to determine appropriate treatment with anti-obesity medications.</p>

          <p>The Federal Railroad Administration has consulted Elon Musk's The Boring Company to assess the costs and progress of the Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, a new tunnel along a busy Amtrak stretch connecting Baltimore to Washington. The project's estimated cost has increased to $8.5 billion, and officials hope The Boring Company can identify ways to build the tunnel more cheaply and efficiently. The talks have raised concerns about Musk's conflicts of interest, given his leadership roles in multiple companies and his advisory role to President Trump.</p>

He is eligible for parole after 25 years.

          <p>President Trump called on drugmakers to lower their prices within the next month to match those charged in other high-income countries, threatening steep caps on Medicare earnings if they fail to comply.

Presiding bishop Sean Rowe announced the step on Monday, shortly before 59 South Africans arrived at Dulles international airport outside Washington DC on a private charter plane and were greeted by a government delegation. Donald Trump opened a fast-tracked refugee status to white South Africans, accusing their government of discrimination, even as his administration abruptly shut down the overall US refugee program.</p>

The report found that in 2023, gross greenhouse gas emissions dropped about 17% since 2005. Carbon dioxide made up most of the greenhouse gas emissions in 2023, at nearly 80%.</p>

All of those tax cuts will be expensive, so Republicans are also planning to raise taxes as part of the package to help make their budget math work.</p>
