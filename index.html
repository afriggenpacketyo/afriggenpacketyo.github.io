          <p>Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested on charges of obstructing immigration enforcement, accused of intentionally misdirecting federal agents away from an undocumented immigrant in her courtroom. Judge Dugan, known for her work with low-income people, has hired a former federal prosecutor and vows to defend herself vigorously, asserting her commitment to the rule of law and due process. Elected in 2016 and unopposed in 2022, her current term extends to 2028, but this arrest puts her future as a judge into question.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) claims to have saved billions in US government spending, but BBC Verify's analysis reveals a lack of evidence to support these figures. Doge's website reports substantial savings from cancelled contracts and grants, but less than 40% of this figure is broken down into individual savings with supporting documentation. Accounting errors have been highlighted, including an $8 billion claim that was actually $8 million, and some receipts are listed as 'unavailable for legal reasons.' The analysis suggests Doge's savings may be overstated, particularly concerning a contract for housing migrant children.</p>

While the plan omits demands for the full recovery of all territories and NATO membership, crucial points of contention remain.

          <p>Following a deadly attack in Kashmir, this article examines the major militant groups operating in the region, their local impact, and connections to global jihadist networks. Groups like The Resistance Front (TRF), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) aim to challenge control over Indian-administered Kashmir. Many of these groups have links to the Taliban and al-Qaeda, framing their cause as part of a broader global jihad. The militant landscape is fluid, with factions frequently changing allegiances and sharing fighters.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has revoked a Biden administration-era policy that restricted subpoenas of reporters' phone records in criminal investigations. The internal memo states that federal employees who leak sensitive information are engaging in potentially treasonous conduct. Bondi argues that it is necessary to rescind the protections to identify and punish the source of improper leaks. The move comes after the Director of National Intelligence made criminal referrals related to alleged leaks in the intelligence community.</p>

          <h2>Potential 'Baby Bonus' to Boost US Birth Rate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 17:08:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is considering a $5,000 'baby bonus' to address the declining US birth rate. The annual birth rate is near a record low, raising concerns about the long-term economic outlook. While President Trump expressed interest in the idea, no final decision has been made. Other countries with similar demographic trends have tried various strategies to revive their birth rates, with mixed results. Tackling long-standing economic issues like affordable day care and paid parental leave may be more effective.</p>
