          <p>At least two people were killed after a shooter opened fire on firefighters who were responding to a wildfire on Canfield Mountain in Idaho. The Kootenai County Sheriff's Office reported that first responders were taking active sniper fire from what appeared to be high-powered rifles, forcing a halt to firefighting efforts. Authorities stated the situation was ongoing with the suspect still at large, prompting shelter-in-place orders for nearby residents. Idaho's governor condemned the incident as a heinous assault on emergency personnel, highlighting the extreme danger faced by the crews.</p>

The accused official, who initially admitted to the charge but later recanted, is now facing trial.

FBI data indicates that assaults against people at houses of worship nearly doubled between 2021 and 2023, a trend officials are treating as a form of domestic terrorism. The article highlights recent convictions and ongoing investigations into planned attacks, which are often driven by white nationalism or animus toward minority groups.

          <p>A top Shiite cleric in Iran, Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi, has issued a fatwa, or religious decree, against President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The ruling labels them as "warlords" who threaten the global Islamic community, a term that under Iranian law can justify severe punishment, including execution. This action follows a period of intense conflict where U.S. and Israeli forces reportedly damaged Iran's nuclear facilities. Commentators have condemned the fatwa as a state-sanctioned incitement to global terrorism, escalating already high geopolitical tensions.</p>

While the full extent of damage to Iran's enriched uranium stockpile is still being assessed, the loss of this facility and the degradation of Iran's air defenses are seen as major strategic setbacks for Tehran's ability to develop a weapon.</p>

          <p>The search for the thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger, which was declared extinct in 1986, has become a national obsession in Australia, fueled by thousands of reported sightings. Passionate seekers use trail cameras and forensic techniques, convinced the marsupial predator still roams the Tasmanian bush. This enduring hope is mirrored in the scientific community, where a de-extinction project aims to bring the creature back by editing the DNA of its closest living relative, the dunnart. While some scientists are skeptical, the quest highlights a deep-seated human desire to reverse a loss caused by human action.</p>

          <p>Stopping the mysterious drone swarms over sensitive U.S. sites is complicated by significant technical and legal hurdles. Standard radar systems often fail to detect the small, low-flying aircraft, and simply shooting them down over populated areas poses a major safety risk from debris. Jamming their communication frequencies is also problematic, as it can interfere with civilian services like Wi-Fi and GPS. Furthermore, jurisdictional confusion among agencies like the FAA, FBI, and Department of Defense creates policy gaps, hindering a coordinated and effective response to the growing threat.</p>

          <p>Visual artist and photographer Lena Herzog shares insights into her life with her husband, renowned filmmaker Werner Herzog. She recalls that when they first met, he jokingly told her he was a stuntman, a ruse he maintained for months. Lena discusses his occasional acting career, noting he often plays villains that are almost caricatures of his public persona as a "wild man." However, she emphasizes that this perception is misleading, describing him as a sweet and good man, unafraid to make fun of himself while remaining a deeply committed and unique artist.</p>

          <p>Filmmaker Werner Herzog employs a distinctive and intuitive process for creating his documentaries, shunning traditional methods like storyboarding or transcript reviews. Instead, he and his editor watch all raw footage only once, with Herzog taking notes and marking compelling shots with exclamation points. He then builds the film shot by shot, adding his signature poetic narration to transport the audience beyond mere information and into a dreamlike reality. Herzog believes this focus on powerful, unforgettable imagery and philosophical musings is what gives his films their lasting impact.</p>

          <p>Kenya is positioning itself as a major tech hub in Africa, often called the "Silicon Savannah," to address a looming jobs crisis on the continent. The boom was anchored by the pioneering mobile money service M-Pesa and is now attracting investment from giants like Microsoft. However, this rapid growth has a downside, with reports of low-wage, high-stress AI-related jobs creating exploitative conditions for local workers. Experts stress that for Kenya to succeed, it must update its labor laws to protect its workforce while continuing to foster innovation and investment.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has issued a warning that the Lifetime Individual Savings Account (LISA) may be unsuitable for some savers and could leave them with less money than they invested. The product, designed for first-home buyers or retirement savings, applies a significant penalty for early withdrawals, effectively taking 6.25% of the person's own contributions. The Treasury Committee report also highlighted that the LISA's complex dual purpose can lead to poor investment strategies and that its rules can nonsensically penalize those receiving certain government benefits, calling for urgent reforms.</p>

          <p>The Boeing 787 Dreamliner, once considered one of the safest aircraft, is facing renewed scrutiny following a recent fatal crash and a history of whistleblower allegations about its production. Since its debut, the plane has suffered from quality control issues, including battery fires that grounded the fleet in 2013 and numerous manufacturing defects. Former employees have claimed that safety was compromised by pressure to speed up production, alleging that substandard parts were used and assembly shortcuts were taken. Boeing maintains the aircraft is safe, but the persistent concerns have cast a shadow over the program.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have launched a widespread crackdown on authors of "danmei," a popular genre of gay erotic fiction written predominantly by and for young women. At least 30 writers have been arrested since February for allegedly violating pornography laws, which are applied more stringently to homosexual than heterosexual content. The writers, who published on a Taiwan-based platform, face social shame and potential prison sentences of over 10 years. This government action is seen as part of a broader campaign to enforce traditional family values and has sparked online debate about censorship and creative freedom.</p>

While President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed the facilities were "obliterated," initial Pentagon intelligence reports suggested a more limited setback of only months for Iran's program. Officials' statements have also shifted, at times emphasizing the achievement of a ceasefire with Israel as the primary goal rather than the complete destruction of Iran's nuclear capabilities.

          <p>A controversial provision to mandate the sale of up to 1.2 million acres of public land in 11 Western states has been removed from a major Republican bill following strong bipartisan backlash. The proposal, spearheaded by Senator Mike Lee, was intended to increase land availability for housing. However, it faced opposition from at least four fellow Republican senators and several House members, as well as conservation and recreation groups. Lee withdrew the measure, stating he could not secure safeguards to prevent the land from being sold to foreign interests or large corporations.</p>
