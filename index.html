          <h2>White House Moderates Expectations for Upcoming Trump-Putin Summit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 03:49:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has tempered expectations for the upcoming summit between President Donald Trump and Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin in Alaska, describing it as primarily a "listening exercise" for Trump. Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt indicated the meeting aims to gain a better understanding of how to end the war in Ukraine, with only one party to the conflict present. This downplaying follows Trump's earlier suggestion of "land swapping" between the warring parties, a notion strongly rejected by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allies who insist no decisions should be made without Ukraine's involvement. Experts believe the White House is managing expectations due to the unlikelihood of a quick resolution given Russia's maximalist conditions and Ukraine's firm stance on territorial integrity.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office announced an expansion of live facial recognition (LFR) vans across seven police forces in England to help locate suspects for serious crimes, including sexual offenses. Ten new vans, equipped with cameras that scan faces against watchlists, will be deployed, approximately doubling the existing fleet. While the government highlights the technology's success in making 580 arrests in London over 12 months, civil liberties groups like Big Brother Watch condemn the move as an alarming expansion of surveillance. Critics argue the technology is intrusive and has been rolled out without robust legislative safeguards, despite pending judicial reviews and concerns over false matches and privacy.</p>

          <p>Rolls-Royce CEO Tufan Erginbilgic believes the engineering firm could become the UK's most valuable company by leveraging its nuclear reactor technology to power AI-driven data centers. The company has signed deals to provide small modular reactors (SMRs) to the UK and Czech governments, anticipating a global need for 400 SMRs by 2050, representing a trillion-dollar market. Despite SMRs being an unproven technology, Erginbilgic is confident in their potential and the company's unique nuclear capability. He also aims to expand Rolls-Royce's dominant aircraft engine business into the lucrative narrow-bodied aircraft market, asserting that these initiatives represent the single biggest opportunity for UK economic growth.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is initiating a review of content at specific Smithsonian Institution museums and exhibits to ensure alignment with President Donald Trump's "Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History" executive order. The review aims to emphasize "American exceptionalism" and remove narratives deemed divisive or partisan, focusing on historically accurate and uplifting portrayals of America’s heritage. Phase I includes museums like American History, Natural History, and African American History and Culture, with a 120-day implementation guideline for corrections. The administration views this as a collaborative effort to renew the Smithsonian's role as a trusted and inspiring institution.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders are scheduled to hold an online call with U.S. President Donald Trump, aiming to increase pressure on him to side with Ukraine ahead of his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The leaders are expected to reiterate that no decisions regarding Ukraine's borders should be made without Kyiv's input. Concerns have mounted among Ukraine's allies over Trump's previous comments about "swapping of territories" as part of a peace deal, which Zelenskyy has firmly rejected. This meeting underscores the international effort to ensure Ukraine's sovereignty is respected in any potential peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>New figures reveal that over one in seven UK councils have lowered swimming pool temperatures since 2020, primarily due to soaring energy costs. The Local Government Association reports that council finances remain fragile, leading nearly a quarter of councils to reduce or close leisure services. This decision has drawn criticism, with some individuals, like a muscular dystrophy patient, stating that colder pools prevent them from continuing their vital exercise. While councils adhere to safety guidelines, critics urge them to explore other cost-saving measures to avoid deterring swimmers, particularly those with health conditions who rely on warm water for therapeutic benefits.</p>

          <p>New guidance from the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) encourages police forces in England and Wales to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects charged in high-profile and sensitive investigations. This aims to combat misinformation and address significant public interest, particularly following cases where false information led to unrest. While the Home Office welcomes the move for transparency, critics, including a former Met Police Chief Superintendent, warn of unintended consequences, such as increased speculation when details are withheld. The guidance, which comes into immediate effect, reaffirms that verifying immigration status remains the Home Office's responsibility, not the police's.</p>

          <p>Major developers in Dubai are increasingly establishing in-house contracting firms, moving away from relying solely on third-party contractors, as the city's real estate market experiences a significant boom. This strategic shift aims to enhance control over construction timelines, costs, and quality, ultimately maximizing profits in a surging market where property prices have risen 70% in four years. Companies like Emaar Properties and Samana Developers have adopted this approach, with some now handling a majority of their projects internally due to difficulties attracting external bids. While offering greater certainty, this model also carries risks, such as potential idle capacity during market downturns.</p>

          <p>California state lawyers faced off against the federal government in court over President Trump's deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, arguing it was illegal and caused "anxiety and fear." The state contends the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts military involvement in domestic law enforcement, alleging troops were used for armed security, roadblocks, and civilian detentions. Federal lawyers countered that the deployment was legal, aimed at protecting federal property and personnel, and did not violate the Act.

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's potential susceptibility to Vladimir Putin's narrative poses a greater threat to Ukraine than military actions. The author suggests that both leaders have incentives to present a decisive resolution to the conflict without Ukrainian involvement, but warns against Trump emerging from the summit parroting Kremlin talking points. The piece highlights Putin's consistent demands for territorial concessions and Ukraine's demilitarization, framing them as reasonable. The article concludes that Putin's primary goal is to manipulate Trump into pressuring Kyiv towards capitulation, thereby achieving a strategic victory for Russia through diplomatic means rather than solely military force.</p>

          <p>The upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will take place at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska. This remote military installation, Alaska's largest, holds historical significance as the U.S. purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire 158 years ago, and is geographically close to Russia. The choice of location has drawn criticism, with some suggesting Putin might leverage the historical context to argue for territorial changes. Despite its remoteness, the base is described as picturesque and is a key site for Arctic military readiness, previously visited by US presidents for various purposes.</p>

          <p>The New York Liberty defeated the Los Angeles Sparks 105-97 in a high-scoring WNBA contest, but the game was overshadowed by a left ankle injury to Sparks' sophomore star Cameron Brink just before halftime. Despite strong performances from Kelsey Plum, Dearica Hamby, and Azurá Stevens, who combined for 38 points, the Sparks struggled defensively against the Liberty's efficient offense. Liberty's Emma Meesseman, returning from a three-year WNBA hiatus, played a crucial role in maintaining her team's rhythm. The loss, compounded by Brink's injury and visible frustration from Sparks coach Lynne Roberts over officiating, marked a tough night for the Los Angeles team.</p>

          <p>A recent study, published in Nature Communications and conducted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and international universities, reveals that foreign-owned enterprises were responsible for 25% of all company emissions in China over a two-decade period. The research highlights that while eastern coastal regions reaped economic benefits, central and western inland areas bore heavier environmental burdens. This finding raises new questions regarding the scientific assessment of carbon emission responsibilities for multinational enterprises, underscoring their often-overlooked role in shaping global carbon inequality. The study emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive understanding of emission sources to address climate change effectively.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's imposition of 39% tariffs on Swiss exports has shattered Switzerland's long-standing tradition of splendid isolation and neutrality, triggering a major identity crisis. Historically, Switzerland has thrived on exports while remaining politically detached from global conflicts, enjoying economic stability and low social unrest. The unexpected tariffs, which could significantly impact the Swiss economy, have left the government struggling for leverage, especially given its unilateral elimination of industrial tariffs. The situation forces Switzerland to re-evaluate its 'have your cake and eat it' foreign policy, potentially leading to a closer relationship with the EU, a prospect previously resisted.</p>

          <p>China's "durian diplomacy" is expanding with the first direct air shipments of Cambodian durians arriving in Henan province, marking a new milestone in agricultural trade between the two nations.

Durian is now the fifth fresh fruit from Cambodia approved for direct supply to the Chinese market, highlighting improved customs efficiency and growing trade relations. While the move signifies significant progress, some industry insiders remain cautious about the commercial competitiveness of Cambodian durians in the broader market.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity has made a surprising $34.5 billion takeover bid for Google's Chrome internet browser, citing a commitment to user safety under independent operation.

However, technology industry investors have dismissed the offer as a "stunt," significantly undervaluing Chrome and questioning whether the browser is even for sale. The bid comes amidst Google's ongoing antitrust scrutiny and Perplexity's recent launch of an AI-powered browser, Comet, as competition in the generative AI space intensifies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore hundreds of suspended UCLA science research grants, totaling $584 million, ruling that the government's actions violated a previous injunction. The grants, covering critical areas like cancer and clean energy, were abruptly frozen by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and Department of Energy, citing alleged discrimination and failure to promote a research environment free of antisemitism at UCLA. The court found that the indefinite suspensions were effectively terminations, challenging the administration's attempt to coerce UCLA into a settlement.
