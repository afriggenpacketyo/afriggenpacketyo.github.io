          <p>Liu, a former commander of the Chinese navy, is celebrated as a visionary technocrat who spearheaded the comprehensive modernization of China’s naval forces to world-class standards. His strategic genius has drawn comparisons to 19th-century US naval officer Alfred Thayer Mahan. Joining the Red Army at 13 and participating in the Long March, Liu rose through the People's Liberation Army ranks before his transfer to the newly established PLA Navy in 1952. Despite first seeing the sea at that time, his long and distinguished career profoundly shaped China's "blue sea strategy," transforming its capabilities and leaving an enduring legacy in national defense.</p>

          <p>Following a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Trump suggested both Ukraine and Russia should declare victory and "let history decide" to end the ongoing conflict. Zelenskyy and Trump reportedly decided not to publicly discuss the provision of long-range weapons, such as Tomahawks, to avoid further escalation with Russia. Trump, who recently spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and plans a future meeting in Budapest, reiterated his call for a deal to stop the killing. This article highlights Trump's unconventional approach to peace negotiations and the complex considerations regarding military aid.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the immediate commutation of former Congressman George Santos' seven-year federal prison sentence, citing "horrible mistreatment" during his incarceration. Santos, convicted of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, had appealed to Trump, emphasizing his consistent Republican vote and seeking an opportunity to return to his family. The clemency follows Santos' expulsion from Congress in 2023 and a plea deal that included significant restitution. This article details the controversial decision, which has sparked debate regarding political influence and the justice system's application.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has seen a significant 25% reduction in fatal drug overdoses in 2024, translating to nearly 30,000 lives saved, with North Carolina at the forefront of this positive trend. This turnaround is largely attributed to comprehensive harm reduction strategies, including law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) programs and expanded access to opioid use disorder medications like methadone and buprenorphine. The widespread availability and administration of naloxone, an overdose reversal drug, also played a crucial role. Despite this progress, challenges persist in certain demographics and states, and potential federal funding cuts could impact future efforts.</p>

          <p>Leaked "behind the scenes" footage from Bill Belichick's former TV show, "Coach," captured the North Carolina head football coach and his girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, criticizing the show's graphics team. Obtained by "Pablo Torre Finds Out," the hot mic moment showed Hudson suggesting improvements with "Adobe Photoshop" and both expressing dissatisfaction, with Belichick stating they "can't do s---." This incident adds to ongoing speculation about Hudson's influence on Belichick's media appearances and comes amidst a challenging 2-3 start for UNC's season. NFL Films, whose studios were used, denied any involvement in the leak.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces confirmed that Hamas has handed over the remains of another deceased Israeli hostage, which were subsequently transferred to Israel's National Institute for Forensic Medicine for official identification. This development is part of a broader Gaza peace plan that stipulated the return of all remaining hostages, both living and deceased. While 20 living hostages have been released, the recovery of all deceased remains has been challenging due to the extensive destruction across Gaza. US officials have urged patience, acknowledging the difficulties but emphasizing commitment to the agreement.</p>

          <p>The North Pacific Ocean experienced its warmest summer on record, with sea surface temperatures between July and September exceeding previous highs by over 0.25C across an area roughly ten times the size of the Mediterranean. Climate scientists are struggling to fully explain the prolonged heat in this "warm blob," though global warming is known to make marine heatwaves more likely. Possible contributing factors include weaker-than-usual winds and a reduction in sun-reflecting aerosols from cleaner shipping fuels. This article also suggests the unusual heat could potentially lead to a colder early winter in the UK due to atmospheric teleconnections.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of National Guard troops to the Chicago area, escalating a showdown with Democratic-led cities. This emergency application by the Justice Department followed a federal appeals court ruling that blocked the deployment in Illinois. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the lower court order "improperly impinges on the president's authority" and endangers federal personnel. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, however, condemned the move as "un-American" and a politically motivated attempt to intimidate rivals.

          <p>President Trump confirmed a report that Venezuelan officials offered the US a significant stake in their oil and natural resources in an attempt to ease escalating US actions against the country. Trump stated President Nicolás Maduro "has offered everything" because "he doesn't want to f*** around with the United States." These comments followed Trump's authorization of covert CIA operations in Venezuela and his acknowledgment of deadly US strikes on suspected drug trafficking vessels. This article highlights the aggressive US stance and Venezuela's desperate diplomatic overtures amidst accusations of drug cartel leadership.</p>

          <p>The US military is holding two individuals aboard a Navy ship in the Caribbean after a targeted US strike on their vessel, which allegedly carried drugs from Venezuela, killed two others. This marks the first time survivors have been reported from such US attacks, which President Trump confirmed targeted a "drug-carrying submarine." Trump defended the ongoing operations, which have reportedly killed 28 individuals, as efforts against "narco-terrorists." Venezuela has urged the UN Security Council to intervene, calling the US strikes "extrajudicial executions" and accusing the US of seeking "regime change."</p>

          <p>A new study reveals promising results for the Galleri blood test, capable of detecting over 50 types of cancer, with three-quarters lacking existing screening programs. Trial data from North America showed the test identified more than half of cancers at an early, more treatable stage, and correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of negative cases. The test works by detecting cancerous DNA fragments in the blood and accurately identified the cancer's origin in 9 out of 10 cases. Further research, including a large NHS trial, is underway to confirm if this innovation translates into reduced cancer mortality.</p>

The move, made in consultation with the King, allows Andrew to voluntarily step back, avoiding messy parliamentary intervention, but questions about his conduct and further Epstein-related documents remain.</p>
