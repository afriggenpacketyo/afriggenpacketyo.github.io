          <p>Home Depot's first-quarter results were a mixed bag, with revenue exceeding expectations but earnings per share falling short. However, investors focused on the company's reaffirmation of its full-year guidance and positive sales trends throughout the quarter. CEO Ted Decker expressed optimism about the macro environment, noting improvements in comparable store sales from February to April. The company is also navigating tariff uncertainties by diversifying its supply chain, with a goal to source more than 50% of its purchases in the U.S. and ensure no single country outside the U.S. accounts for more than 10% of merchandise purchases in the coming year.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Fed reports a significant spike in student loan delinquencies following the resumption of collection efforts on defaulted federal student loans. The report expresses concern about potential spillovers to delinquencies on other types of debt, such as credit cards and auto loans. With the end of the pandemic-era pause on student loan payments and the restart of collection activity, borrowers may face increased pressure on their ability to manage multiple debt obligations. Experts suggest that the resumption of student loan repayments could reduce disposable personal income, potentially leading to increased credit card debt.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has charged Rep. LaMonica McIver with assaulting two federal agents at the Delaney Hall Detention Facility in New Jersey. The charges stem from an incident where McIver and other lawmakers allegedly interfered with the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. Prosecutors cite bodycam footage as evidence, alleging McIver slammed her forearm into an agent and forcibly struck another. McIver denies the charges, claiming they are politically motivated and mischaracterize her actions during a lawful oversight visit to the facility. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated that no one is above the law, regardless of political status.</p>

Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

          <p>The FDA has outlined new regulatory guidance for future Covid-19 vaccine boosters, requiring more rigorous clinical trials for healthy Americans. The agency will now demand clinical trials showing safety and effectiveness before approving boosters for healthy adults and children, moving away from relying solely on antibody response data. This shift aims to balance regulatory flexibility with scientific rigor, approving vaccines for high-risk individuals based on immunogenicity data while requiring stronger evidence for low-risk populations. The new guidance comes as HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. overhauls U.S. immunization policy, emphasizing a risk-based approach to vaccination.</p>

          <p>While President Donald Trump's poll numbers have declined, Democrats are not seeing a corresponding increase in support. Voters disillusioned with Trump are not necessarily flocking to the Democratic Party, with many disliking both parties and some disengaging from politics altogether. Polls indicate that Americans still trust Trump more than Democrats to handle the country's main problems and view the Democratic Party as out of touch. This trend is particularly evident among young voters and Latino voters, who are increasingly distrustful of both parties.</p>

After a call with President Trump, it became clear that economic rapprochement with Russia would only occur after peace in Ukraine. While the Kremlin maintains that the leaders are committed to a broader reset, the only concrete deal mentioned was a prisoner exchange. Experts suggest Putin believes time is on his side, with stable oil prices and a growing military, leading him to prioritize Ukraine's capitulation over immediate economic benefits.</p>

The decision-making process involved secret coordination between Washington and Doha, with President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steven Witkoff, playing a key role.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that dark streaks on Mars, previously believed to be evidence of flowing water, may instead be caused by dry processes. Researchers used machine learning to analyze over 86,000 satellite images of slope streaks and recurring slope lineae (RSLs). The analysis found that the streaks were not generally associated with factors suggesting a liquid or frost origin, but were more likely found in areas with above-average wind speeds and dust deposition. The study casts doubt on the possibility of habitable environments in those regions.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has charged Rep. LaMonica McIver with assaulting federal agents during a clash outside a Newark immigration detention center. The charges stem from an incident where McIver and other lawmakers allegedly interfered with the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. The U.S. attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, announced the charges, stating that "no one is above the law." McIver denies the allegations, claiming they are politically motivated. The Justice Department also dropped a trespass charge against Mayor Baraka, citing the "spirit of public interest."</p>

This has led to controversy, including the cancellation of an HBO series and ruffling feathers in his new role at the University of North Carolina. While some question her motives, Belichick defends her involvement, stating she handles business matters allowing him to focus on football.</p>

This incentivizes ranchers to protect jaguars and their prey, expanding protected areas and fostering a culture of coexistence. The success of the program bodes well for efforts to restore jaguars to the US, but the border wall remains a significant obstacle.</p>
