          <p>Veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott stated in a BBC interview that she stands by her controversial 2023 comments on racism which led to a year-long party suspension. She reaffirmed her position that racism directed at Black people is distinct from prejudice experienced by Jewish people or Travellers, due to the immediate visibility of skin color. Abbott's original letter to The Observer, which she later apologized for, suggested these groups experience prejudice but not racism in the same way. Her remarks have reignited debate around her views and her relationship with the Labour party leadership.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas Sands has commenced construction on an $8 billion resort in Singapore, a major new development separate from its existing Marina Bay Sands property. The project will feature a 55-story all-suite hotel tower, luxury retail, a 15,000-seat arena, and a public rooftop space with an observation deck and gardens. This new resort is designed to be a distinct entity with its own identity, aligning with Singapore's long-term strategy to significantly boost tourism revenue. The development underscores the nation's focus on attracting high-value leisure and business travelers with world-class entertainment and facilities.</p>

          <p>The Indiana Fever were defeated by the New York Liberty 98-77 in their final game before the All-Star break, playing without star rookie Caitlin Clark. Clark was ruled out shortly before the game due to a groin injury, her third injury-related absence this season, raising questions about her availability for the upcoming All-Star weekend events. Coach Stephanie White expressed frustration with the team's inconsistency and emphasized the need to develop a more resilient mindset. The Fever have struggled in Clark's absence, holding a 4-6 record in games played without her.</p>

          <p>Israel has launched significant airstrikes against Syrian military targets in Damascus and southern Syria for a third consecutive day. The strikes are a response to escalating sectarian violence in the Suweida province, where clashes between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes have reportedly killed over 350 people. Israel's Prime Minister stated the intervention aims to protect the Druze minority, while Syria's interim government accused Israel of a major escalation. The United States announced that "specific steps" have been agreed upon to de-escalate the violence as the humanitarian situation in the region deteriorates.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced his ambition to sell more technologically advanced chips to China, going beyond the recently reinstated H20 AI chip. Speaking in Beijing, Huang argued that as technology evolves, the products available to the Chinese market should also improve over time, despite current U.S. export controls. This statement follows Nvidia's resumption of H20 sales, a less powerful chip designed to comply with American restrictions. The comments highlight the ongoing tension as U.S. tech companies navigate geopolitical restrictions while trying to capitalize on China's massive and growing AI market.</p>

          <p>The White House has stated that a crucial national fentanyl overdose prevention program, currently facing a $140 million shortfall, will be funded in "increments" rather than a single annual payment. This change to the Overdose Data To Action (OD2A) program has raised concerns among CDC staff and state health officials about operational stability. Critics inside the CDC worry that the uncertainty could trigger layoffs and program shutdowns, as verbal commitments are not sufficient for planning complex public health services.

While billions have been approved for technological overhauls, controllers argue these investments overlook the human element, which is currently strained to its limit.

          <p>The Trump administration has officially canceled $4 billion in federal funding for California's high-speed rail project, citing mismanagement, delays, and budget overruns. The Federal Railroad Administration made the decision after a compliance review found "no viable path forward" for the train. California Governor Gavin Newsom and other state leaders have condemned the move as illegal and politically motivated, vowing to fight the decision and explore all options to keep the project alive. This action marks a major escalation in the long-standing conflict between the state and the federal government over the ambitious infrastructure plan.</p>

          <p>Police have arrested a 22-year-old suspect in connection with the shooting deaths of "American Idol" music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca. The couple was found dead in their Encino, California, home during a wellness check. Investigators believe the incident was a random home invasion that turned fatal when the couple returned home and confronted an intruder who had gained entry through an unlocked door. The suspect was identified using surveillance footage and facial recognition software, leading to his arrest by a joint LAPD and FBI task force.</p>

          <p>A massive afforestation project in China, known as the "green great wall," is being linked to a rise in hay fever and other allergic conditions in the country's northern regions. Scientists have confirmed that pollen from the artemisia plant, which is widely used in the project to combat desertification, is a primary cause of these allergies. While the program has been successful in reducing desertification, this unintended health consequence is now a significant problem for residents. Researchers have identified specific allergenic components in the pollen, which could lead to better prevention and treatment strategies in the future.</p>

          <p>A coalition of immigrant advocacy groups has filed a class-action lawsuit against the Trump administration over a policy of arresting individuals at their own immigration court hearings. The lawsuit alleges that the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department have colluded to unlawfully detain and deport people who are complying with their legal obligations. The plaintiffs, many of whom were seeking asylum, argue that this practice violates due process and turns the courts into a trap. They are asking a federal judge to declare the policy illegal and halt its enforcement.</p>

          <p>Companies are developing an innovative solution to the massive energy demands of the artificial intelligence boom by repurposing used electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Firms like Crusoe and Redwood Materials are creating large-scale energy storage systems from these retired batteries to provide reliable, clean power to AI data centers. This approach not only addresses the power consumption challenge of AI but also provides a sustainable second life for EV batteries that no longer meet the demands of a vehicle but still retain significant storage capacity. The modular system is seen as a scalable and environmentally friendly alternative to building new gas-fired power plants.</p>

          <p>Recent Israeli airstrikes in Syria have drawn attention to the Druze, an Arabic-speaking ethno-religious minority central to the conflict. This article explains that the Druze, who primarily reside in Syria, Lebanon, and Israel, occupy a precarious position in post-war Syria and have resisted the new government's authority. Israel has intervened militarily, positioning itself as a protector of the Druze to deter Islamist fighters near its border and to forge alliances with minority groups. The violence underscores Syria's fragile security landscape and the complex geopolitical dynamics shaping the region's future.</p>

          <p>The federal E-Verify system, intended to ensure employment eligibility, is proving to be deeply flawed and easily circumvented, according to experts and recent events. A raid on a Nebraska meatpacking plant illustrates the problem: the employer used E-Verify as required but still unknowingly hired dozens of unauthorized workers who were using stolen identities. Experts describe the system as vetting paperwork, not people, which makes it vulnerable to identity theft and leaves compliant businesses exposed to raids and operational disruption. This highlights a systemic failure that victimizes both employers and the individuals whose identities are stolen.</p>

The states argue the administration acted unlawfully, as the power to eliminate a program funded by Congress lies with the legislative branch.
