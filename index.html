            <p>Cody Balmer, a 38-year-old Pennsylvania man, faces charges of attempted murder and terrorism after allegedly setting fire to Governor Josh Shapiro's residence in Harrisburg. The incident occurred while Shapiro and his family were home, forcing them to evacuate. Balmer reportedly hopped a fence and intentionally started the fire, with officials investigating his motive. Balmer's mother stated that her son has a history of mental illness and had recently stopped taking his medication, and that she tried to get her son 'picked up' last week, reaching out to four different police departments but "couldn't get anybody to help. So he was mentally ill, went off his meds, and this is what happened." The fire caused significant damage, and an investigation is underway to determine how Balmer accessed the property.</p>

            <p>A family plane crash in upstate New York resulted in the deaths of six individuals, including Karenna Groff, a former NCAA woman of the year, and her parents. The twin-engine aircraft went down in a field in Copake, N.Y., en route to a Passover celebration. According to a video obtained by the NTSB, the aircraft was intact before it crashed at a high rate of descent. Air traffic control attempted to contact the pilot several times, but there was no response and no distress call. The victims were identified as Karenna Groff, her parents Dr. Michael Groff and Dr. Joy Saini, her brother Jared Groff and his partner Alexia Couyutas Duarte, and Karenna's partner James Santoro.</p>

            <p>President Trump's volatile trade policies are creating new challenges for California's state budget. The state's reliance on income tax from top earners, whose fortunes are tied to the stock market, makes it vulnerable to economic uncertainty. Tariffs and potential retaliation from other countries could hurt California's economy, from almond exports to Silicon Valley tech stocks. The Newsom administration is trying to develop economic forecasts for the upcoming budget year amidst this uncertainty.</p>

            <p>All five members of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), appointed by Governor Gavin Newsom, live in or near Sacramento or San Francisco, despite the fact that Southern California accounts for nearly half of the state's population. This has drawn criticism from Southern Californians who feel their interests are not adequately represented. The CPUC makes decisions that significantly impact Southern Californians, including setting utility rates. A bill has been introduced to require the governor to appoint a commissioner from each of the four regions used by the Board of Equalization.</p>
