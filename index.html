          <p>Andrew Flintoff has shared a harrowing account of his 2022 Top Gear crash, revealing he believed he was dying and feared severe facial disfigurement. The incident occurred during filming at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome when the open-topped Morgan Super 3 he was driving flipped.

          <p>A Dartmouth College study has linked 111 fossil fuel companies to an estimated $28 trillion in climate damage from extreme heat between 1991 and 2020. The study presents a peer-reviewed method for tying emissions to specific climate harms, aiming to hold companies liable for the costs of extreme weather events. Researchers attributed about a third of the total cost to five companies: Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and BP. The study's findings could bolster climate liability lawsuits against major carbon emitters.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the U.S. government owes North Dakota nearly $28 million for policing the Dakota Access Pipeline protests in 2016 and 2017. The state had sued to recoup costs associated with managing the demonstrations, which drew international attention due to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's concerns about the pipeline's Missouri River crossing. The judge found the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers liable for failing to follow mandatory procedures, leading to harm for the state. The protests involved thousands of people and resulted in numerous arrests.</p>

Experts and researchers, however, cast doubt on this claim, stating that the tattoos alone are not reliable indicators of gang membership. They also dispute Trump's interpretation of the symbols, suggesting they may not represent MS-13 at all. While some tattoos can carry gang-related symbolism, the experts emphasize that identifying gang members requires a multi-pronged approach and that many symbols are used by the general population.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that nearly half of Americans still live in areas with unhealthy air pollution, despite decades of improvements. The report highlights the health impacts of smog and soot, including increased asthma rates and reduced life expectancy. It comes as the Trump administration considers rolling back air quality regulations. The report also notes that people of color are disproportionately affected by air pollution. Experts express concern about the potential public health consequences of weakening environmental protections.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Chuck Grassley faced a contentious town hall meeting in Northwood, Iowa, where constituents expressed strong disagreements with the Trump administration's policies. The meeting echoed similar tense exchanges from a previous town hall, with questions about the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident deported to El Salvador. Grassley defended the administration's actions, citing Supreme Court rulings. Attendees argued among themselves, and Grassley noted that the language used was stronger than he typically encounters.</p>
