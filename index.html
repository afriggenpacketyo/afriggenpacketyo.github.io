          <p>Archaeologists in Peru have unearthed the 5,000-year-old remains of a noblewoman from the Caral civilization in Aspero. The woman's remains were carefully preserved in layers of fabric, including a mantle of macaw feathers, with skin, nails, and hair still intact. Preliminary findings suggest she was between 20 and 35 years old and about 5 feet tall. The discovery challenges the notion that only men held prominent roles in Caral society, indicating women were valued members of the ancient civilization.</p>

Some U.S. senators are raising concerns about civilian casualties caused by the American strikes in Yemen, questioning whether the Trump administration is adequately mitigating harm to civilians.

          <p>China has reportedly waived its retaliatory 125% tariffs on certain semiconductor imports from the U.S., according to industry sources. At least eight integrated circuit-related tariff codes were exempted from levies imposed earlier this month in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese products, though tariffs on memory chips remain. China's customs authorities purportedly informed domestic companies that duties paid for these exempted semiconductor imports from April 10 to 24 would be eligible for refunds, signaling a potential thaw in trade tensions.</p>

          <p>The Post Office has spent over £600 million of public funds to continue using the flawed Horizon IT system, despite deciding to replace it over a decade ago. The original 1999 deal with Fujitsu gave the Post Office limited ownership of the software's code, preventing them from building a replacement or inspecting transaction processing. This reliance on Fujitsu's assurances contributed to the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of sub-postmasters.

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed a formal notice of intent to seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Prosecutors argue that Mangione intentionally killed Thompson to amplify an ideological message and provoke resistance to the victim's industry. They claim Mangione poses a future danger due to his intent to target an entire industry through lethal violence. Mangione's attorneys have argued against the death penalty, calling it a political stunt.</p>

Two Nasa-funded US institutions have been granted access to lunar samples collected by the Chang'e-5 mission in 2020. Chinese researchers cannot access Nasa's moon samples because of restrictions from US lawmakers. The exchange of Moon rocks is seen as international cooperation in science and has little to do with politics.</p>

          <p>The Primary School, founded by Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan in East Palo Alto, California, will close in the summer of 2026. The school aimed to provide tuition-free education and healthcare to low-income children. School officials have informed parents of the closure, marking a significant shift in the couple's philanthropic efforts in the Bay Area. The school's mission was to overcome systemic racism and poverty affecting communities of color.</p>

          <p>Bill Maher has criticized Larry David's satirical essay comparing Maher's account of having dinner with Donald Trump to dining with Adolf Hitler. Maher called the comparison "insulting to 6 million dead Jews" and defended his reporting of the dinner as honest. He emphasized his long-standing criticism of Trump and the importance of dialogue, even with those with whom one disagrees. Maher expressed hope that his friendship with David could be salvaged.</p>
