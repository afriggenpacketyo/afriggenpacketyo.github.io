          <p>Former President Joe Biden is undergoing radiation and hormone therapy for prostate cancer after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of the disease in May 2025, according to his spokesperson. The cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 with metastasis to the bone, is being treated in Philadelphia. Biden is reportedly doing well and responding to the treatment, which began a few weeks prior to the article's publishing. He was also previously treated for skin cancer during his presidency and had a skin lesion removed in September 2025. The former president's health is being closely monitored as he continues his treatment. Optimism score is not contained in this summary.</p>

          <p>A devastating explosion at a military explosives facility in Tennessee resulted in no survivors, according to Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis. The explosion at Accurate Energetic Systems, which specializes in explosives for military and aerospace purposes, occurred around 7:45 a.m. Central time. Sixteen victims were confirmed, and their families have been notified, though the identities of the victims were not immediately available. The cause of the explosion is still under investigation, with agencies like the FBI and ATF on site, and small explosions are expected to continue. The blast leveled one of the eight buildings on the campus, and AES had been cited for safety violations in the past. The devastation is palpable, and the investigation continues.

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area, where protests are ongoing at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. The court upheld a previous ruling denying the White House's request but allowed the National Guard troops to remain under federal control. The White House criticized the decision, stating that President Trump is exercising his authority to protect federal officers and assets. The Defense Department had previously announced the federalization of National Guard soldiers to protect ICE and other federal personnel and property. This ruling comes amid a similar legal standoff in Portland, Oregon. Optimism score is not contained in this summary.</p>

          <p>The autumn climbing season in the Himalayas has turned deadly due to changing weather patterns, including prolonged monsoons and extreme rainfall. A recent blizzard stranded hundreds of tourists near Everest, resulting in one death. Meteorologists attribute the shifts to increased moisture in the air and the interaction between monsoons and westerly disturbances. Extreme weather events have become more frequent, disrupting trekking and mountaineering activities. The changing weather conditions are impacting the mountain tourism industry.
