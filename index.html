          <p>Zhigang Peng's election as president-elect of the Seismological Society of America marks a growing trend of China-born scientists gaining leadership in US academic societies. Despite significant research contributions, Chinese-American scientists have been historically underrepresented in these roles. Peng, a Georgia Institute of Technology professor, will assume the presidency in 2026, while virologist Shan-Lu Liu will lead the American Society for Virology this July. These milestones reflect a desire for greater representation and broader community service among Chinese-American researchers in the US.</p>

          <p>A significant explosion at Shahid Rajaee, a key Iranian port near Bandar Abbas, resulted in at least 18 deaths and 800 injuries, causing widespread damage. The blast, felt up to 50km away, ignited a large fire that spread through containers, leading to school and office closures. Initial reports suggested improper handling of solid fuel for ballistic missiles as the cause, with a maritime risk consultancy noting a shipment of sodium perchlorate rocket fuel arriving in March. Iranian officials later cited a fire in a hazmat and chemical materials storage depot as the likely origin.</p>

          <p>A Canadian tech entrepreneur, Josh Adler, and his company ConvrtX are facing accusations of defrauding clients by failing to deliver promised websites and apps for their start-ups. Clients claim to have paid significant sums, up to $245,000, without receiving viable products, and some allege legal or financial threats after complaining. ConvrtX, launched in 2019, claimed to have helped over 700 entrepreneurs, but leaked documents suggest few success stories, with customers reporting non-functional products and unmet contractual obligations. Adler's lawyers deny the allegations, claiming that the company had only received about 12-15 complaints out of about 340 customers.</p>

          <p>Brian Fanion, a Massachusetts detective, was convicted of first-degree murder in the shooting death of his wife, Amy Fanion, after investigators uncovered incriminating internet searches on his work computer. These searches, which included "household poisons," "how to make a murder look like a suicide," and "gsr testing," began around the time Fanion's affair with another woman intensified. The prosecution argued that these searches, combined with a lack of gunshot residue on Amy's head, suggested Fanion staged the scene to look like a suicide, while the defense claimed Amy suffered from anxiety and anger issues.</p>

The key issue is under what circumstances people can sue the federal government for law enforcement accountability.
