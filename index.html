          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng reported its eighth consecutive month of over 30,000 car deliveries in June, demonstrating resilience in a fiercely competitive market. While market leader BYD continues to dominate, Xpeng's performance stands out as rivals like Nio and Li Auto show mixed or declining results. The intense price war has drawn criticism from the Chinese government for creating "disorderly competition," even as new players like Xiaomi enter the market, putting further pressure on established brands, including Tesla, whose China sales are projected to have declined.

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of "30% or 35%" on Japanese imports if a new trade agreement is not reached by the July 9 deadline. This marks a potential escalation from the current 10% levy that was temporarily instated to allow for negotiations. Trump expressed doubt that a deal with Tokyo would be finalized, while Japan's chief cabinet secretary stated the country would not make concessions that could harm its agricultural sector. The threat continues the administration's aggressive trade posture, which has impacted numerous global partners.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters, including nurses and healthcare advocates, gathered outside the office of Republican Rep. Young Kim to oppose President Trump's proposed spending bill. The legislation, which narrowly passed the Senate, includes significant cuts to federal programs like Medicaid while extending tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. Protesters argued the bill is cruel and will harm vulnerable Californians, including children and the elderly, who rely on Medi-Cal for healthcare. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would cause 11.8 million Americans to lose health insurance and add trillions to the national deficit.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants living in the U.S. The ruling prevents the Department of Homeland Security from ending the program in September, months ahead of a previously established 2026 deadline. The judge stated that the administration lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation and that migrants have built lives in reliance on the program's continuation. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision, asserting the executive branch's authority to enforce immigration laws.</p>

The event has been compared to the parliamentary turmoil of the Brexit era, weakening the Prime Minister's authority despite his large majority.

These cuts could negatively impact Tesla's sales and its energy division.

          <p>President Trump's signature spending legislation, dubbed the "big, beautiful bill," has generated significant controversy due to its vast scope and political implications. The 940-page bill aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, expand the child tax credit, and allocate billions for defense and border security. However, it also proposes deep cuts to social welfare programs like Medicaid and has been criticized, even by former allies like Elon Musk, for potentially adding trillions to the national debt. The bill's narrow passage through Congress highlights deep divisions and the contentious nature of its sweeping fiscal changes.</p>

The probe examines whether the universities colluded to limit financial aid and fix tuition prices, effectively engaging in price discrimination. The committee, which previously subpoenaed Harvard, deemed the universities' initial responses to document requests "inadequate." The schools maintain they have been cooperating with the investigation, which could lead to legislative reforms regarding anticompetitive practices in higher education.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states, led by California, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for sharing sensitive Medicaid recipient data with the Department of Homeland Security. The lawsuit alleges that the transfer of personal health informationâ€”including names, addresses, and immigration statusâ€”violates federal privacy laws and was intended to aid in immigration enforcement. State attorneys general argue this action creates a climate of fear that could deter people from seeking essential medical care. The administration defends the data sharing as a legal and necessary measure to combat fraud and misuse of federal funds.</p>

The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032.

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022, is reportedly set to accept a plea agreement, a move opposed by some victims' families. The deal would conclude a case that shocked the nation, built on DNA evidence from a knife sheath, cellphone records, and surveillance footage. Kohberger, a criminology Ph.D. student at the time, had previously pleaded not guilty. The family of one victim expressed frustration over the "secretive deal," as they had hoped prosecutors would continue to pursue the death penalty in the high-profile case.</p>
