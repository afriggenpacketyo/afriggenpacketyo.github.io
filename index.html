          <p>Jimmy Kimmel resumed his late-night show following a suspension by Disney's ABC network, which stemmed from comments he made about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Audience members described Kimmel's return monologue as emotional and well-received, but noted the host did not issue an apology for his prior remarks. Disney had deemed Kimmel's initial comments, which criticized the MAGA movement's reaction to Kirk's death, as "ill-timed and thus insensitive." Protesters and supporters were present outside the studio, reflecting the controversy surrounding his return.</p>

          <p>The USC football team faces uncertainty regarding the availability of star wide receiver Ja’Kobi Lane and starting left tackle Elijah Paige for upcoming conference games. Lane recently returned to practice after an upper body injury, while Paige's status remains unclear. Head coach Lincoln Riley refrained from providing detailed updates, directing reporters to the official Big Ten availability report. The potential absence of these key players could impact USC's offensive strategy, although the team demonstrated depth and resilience in their most recent victory.</p>

          <p>A new, unauthorized bronze statue has appeared on the National Mall, controversially depicting Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein in a seemingly celebratory pose. A plaque at the base explicitly references a "long-lasting bond" between the former president and the convicted sex trafficker. This installation, which shares artistic themes with other anti-Trump pieces, reignites scrutiny over Trump's past association with Epstein, an issue that has previously caused internal divisions among his supporters. The president reportedly issued a strong condemnation of the statue.</p>

          <p>An article rigorously fact-checks President Donald Trump's recent assertions regarding a link between Tylenol use during pregnancy and autism, and claims about Amish children's vaccination status. The report clarifies that no scientific studies have established a direct causal link between Tylenol and autism, and that autism exists within Amish communities, with lower reported rates likely due to underreporting, not vaccine absence. It also corrects his inaccurate statements on the number of childhood vaccines and the necessity of the Hepatitis B vaccine for newborns, emphasizing medical consensus.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced declines, mirroring Wall Street's performance, after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that "equity prices are fairly highly valued" and suggested an uncertain path for rate cuts. Major indexes in Japan, South Korea, and Australia all fell, while Hong Kong and mainland China remained flat amid the threat of Super Typhoon Ragasa. Notably, South Korean defense stocks defied the broader downturn, posting gains after President Trump expressed continued support for Ukraine and NATO's weapons supply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Canadian investigation has concluded that TikTok's efforts to prevent underage users and protect their personal data are inadequate, despite the app's stated age restrictions. The probe revealed that TikTok collected sensitive personal information from a "large number" of Canadian children, utilizing it for online marketing and content targeting. In response to the findings, TikTok has pledged to implement enhanced measures to strengthen its platform for Canadians, though the company disputes some of the investigation's specific conclusions. This scrutiny aligns with global concerns over the Chinese-owned app's data practices.</p>

          <p>A distressing incident unfolded during a Cleveland Guardians-Detroit Tigers game when Guardians player David Fry was struck in the face by a 99 mph fastball during a bunt attempt.

Fry was removed from the game, though the play was ruled a foul ball due to bat contact. The Guardians later capitalized on subsequent errors by Skubal to take the lead, but the serious injury casts a shadow over the team's crucial playoff run.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young people in the UK are finding it financially impossible to move out of their parents' homes due to escalating living costs, according to recent industry analyses. Research indicates that approximately nine out of ten young adults living with parents would see nearly half their income consumed by housing and utility expenses if they were to move out. This trend, exemplified by individuals like Leoni Clancey who returned home after depleting her savings, highlights the significant financial strain on young Britons and its broader societal implications.</p>

Following his UN address and meetings with Ukrainian and French leaders, Trump declared Russia a "paper tiger" and suggested Ukraine could reclaim its territory with European and NATO financial backing. The analysis posits that this shift might stem from a desire to avoid humiliation by Putin or to signal disengagement from the conflict, rather than a concrete commitment to bolstering Ukraine's war efforts.</p>
