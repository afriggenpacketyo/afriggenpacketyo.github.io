          <p>Ree Drummond, the "Pioneer Woman," has recommitted to her health journey after experiencing weight fluctuations following a year-long break from her regular regimen. Drummond shared that she had stopped exercising and paying close attention to her diet, leading to weight gain. She has now returned to the plan that previously helped her shed over 50 pounds, focusing on building muscle through lunges, squats, deadlifts, and floor exercises with ankle weights. Additionally, she's prioritizing a higher percentage of protein in her diet while no longer strictly counting calories or weighing her food.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China convened in Geneva for a second day of negotiations aimed at easing trade tensions. The talks, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Vice Premier He Lifeng, have significant implications for the global economy, which has been disrupted by tariffs imposed by both nations. While Mr. Trump hailed the initial conversations as a success, economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a quick resolution, noting that even a reduction in tariff rates would still leave them significantly higher than before the trade war began. The article notes that China has been steadfast in saying it does not intend to make trade concessions in response to Mr. Trumpâ€™s tariffs.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that the pursuit of perfect motherhood is harmful. She contends that being flawed is an essential part of a mother's job, teaching children to accept their own imperfections. The article challenges the societal pressure on mothers to constantly do more and highlights the historical tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems. Ross encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack and recognize that they are already good enough, flaws and all.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin has called for direct talks between Russia and Ukraine to be held in Turkey on May 15, following a visit by European leaders to Kyiv who threatened "new and massive" sanctions on Russia's banking and energy sectors if a 30-day cease-fire is not agreed upon. While Putin indicated Russia was prepared for serious negotiations without preconditions, he did not directly address the European call for a cease-fire, and authorities reported a Russian drone attack shortly after his announcement. The last publicly known peace talks between Ukraine and Russia took place in Istanbul in March 2022.</p>

The oral medication zongertinib outperformed the standard treatment option for HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that zongertinib targets the HER2 protein and blocks its activity, responsible for cell growth. The multi-cohort study was conducted at 82 sites globally, including institutions in the US, China, and Japan.</p>
