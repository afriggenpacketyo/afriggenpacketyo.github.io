          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass stated that over 100 people were arrested during late-night protests in downtown Los Angeles, following peaceful demonstrations earlier in the day against federal immigration sweeps. Bass characterized the late-night protests as "horrible" and attributed the violence and vandalism to "fringe groups" rather than those supporting immigrants' rights. Those arrested will be evaluated for active warrants. The mayor emphasized that the earlier protests were focused on fighting for immigrants' rights and calling for an end to the raids, distinguishing them from the later, more violent activities. </p>

          <p>Paramount Global is set to reduce its workforce by 3.5%, citing challenges in the economy and the linear television business, as the company prepares to merge with Skydance Media. The layoffs, primarily affecting U.S. workers, are part of a broader effort to streamline the organization and prioritize investments in the streaming service, Paramount+. This move follows a previous 15% workforce reduction last year aimed at cutting costs by $500 million and restoring profitability. The merger with Skydance awaits regulatory approval amidst a lawsuit filed by President Trump against CBS, which Paramount denies, and mediation is underway. </p>

          <p>Mortgage rates remain high, creating challenges for prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing, but opportunities still exist for those with strong credit profiles. As of June 10, 2025, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage is 6.89%, while a 15-year mortgage averages 6.09%; refinance rates are similar. Experts suggest that the Federal Reserve's potential pause on rate hikes could bring some relief to borrowers, and strengthening one's credit profile is crucial for securing favorable rates.

          <p>Chinese film distributors are planning to diversify the country's cinematic offerings by importing more high-quality films from overseas, aiming to increase the number, quality, and market share of foreign films. Distributors pledged to leverage imported films to diversify and expand the market, acknowledging that foreign films have faced challenges this year. Mao Yu, an associate director of the Communist Party's publicity department, encouraged the entry of more international films into the Chinese market. This initiative comes as domestic titles have dominated box office revenue, driving growth after a brief decline in 2024. </p>

          <p>Birthright citizenship, or jus solis, is a prevalent practice in the Americas, reflecting the ideal of the Western Hemisphere as an asylum for humanity, in contrast to jus sanguinis, which assigns citizenship based on parentage. Mexico first enshrined jus solis in its constitution in 1814, aiming for universal citizenship regardless of race, a concept tied to the abolition of slavery. The United States eventually adopted birthright citizenship with the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, but its interpretation has been debated, particularly concerning undocumented migrants. While most Latin American countries uphold birthright citizenship, challenges remain, exemplified by the Dominican Republic's stripping of citizenship from individuals of Haitian descent. </p>

          <p>With homes increasingly at risk from floods due to climate change, elevating homes is presented as a solution to protect communities, particularly in coastal areas like New Jersey. Following Superstorm Sandy, many homeowners invested in raising their homes, but the process is expensive, costing over $140,000 in some cases. While elevating homes can help, it requires community-wide efforts, including protecting infrastructure like roads and utilities. The article highlights the need for funding and support to help families afford elevation and ensure that communities can remain resilient in the face of rising flood risks. </p>

          <p>The US military is urging African countries to take greater ownership of their security challenges as the Trump administration prioritizes domestic policies. This shift involves "burden sharing" to build local military capacity and reduce reliance on US forces, which may create a power vacuum that emboldens militant networks. Some experts worry that reduced US involvement could undermine counter-terrorism efforts and place significant economic pressure on affected countries. As a result, African nations may need to seek alternative alliances with countries like China and Russia, which are increasing their presence on the continent. </p>

The Labour government initially planned to withdraw the payments from most pensioners, but partially reversed this decision following pressure from charities, unions, and MPs. Starmer stated that better-than-expected growth figures, falling interest rates, and new trade deals enabled the government to increase eligibility for the payment. (not investment advice) </p>
