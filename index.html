          <p>The Trump administration has initiated investigations into Harvard University and its Law Review following allegations that the journal was selecting articles based on the authors' race rather than merit. This action follows a prior freeze of $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard over concerns about antisemitism and DEI programs on campus. The investigations by the Department of Education and Department of Health & Human Services will examine Harvard's relationship with the Law Review, including financial ties and selection policies, to ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A Harvard Law School spokesman stated the school is committed to compliance and will investigate any alleged violations, while noting the Law Review is legally independent. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>Legal scholars are evaluating the constitutionality of Donald Trump's actions during his second presidency, focusing on his executive orders and potential overreach of power. Times Opinion reached out to dozens of legal scholars and asked them to identify the most significant unconstitutional or unlawful actions by Mr. Trump and his administration in the first 100 days of his second presidency and to assess the damage. Thirty-five scholars from diverse viewpoints assessed the damage and identified actions that might draw legal challenges but remain within presidential powers. The assessment aims to connect the dots on the direction Trump is heading and examine actions exceeding legal limits. Optimism score: 55</p>

          <p>President Trump has decided to provide relief to automakers by easing some tariffs, marking a shift from his previously strict trade policies aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing. The formal announcement is expected soon, preceding a rally in Michigan celebrating Trump's 100th day in office. This move aims to prevent the accumulation of various tariffs on imported foreign cars and auto parts, offering reimbursement to importers for tariffs over the next two years. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that this break will reward domestic manufacturers and provide them time to invest in domestic plants, building an important partnership with both the domestic automakers and American workers.

          <p>Two California federal judges are suing the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), alleging the utility failed to properly prepare for and respond to a wildfire that destroyed their homes. The lawsuit claims the Palisades fire was caused by LADWP's empty reservoirs and energized power lines. The suit cites reports that the Sana Ynez Reservoir was empty during the fire, and that power lines remained energized, causing additional ignitions. The LADWP denies responsibility, stating its system was prepared for strain, but no urban water system can combat a wind-driven wildfire of that speed and scale. Optimism score: 35</p>

          <p>The government is considering extending the sugar tax to milkshakes and other milk-based drinks as part of its efforts to tackle obesity. The consultation proposes to end the exemption for dairy-based and non-dairy substitute drinks and reduce the maximum sugar amount allowed before the levy applies. The Treasury argues that the health benefits of these drinks do not justify the harms from excess sugar. The sugar tax has raised Â£1.9 billion since its introduction in 2018, and the government hopes this extension will further incentivize manufacturers to reduce sugar in their recipes.
