          <p>A UBS report indicates that the United States added approximately 379,000 new millionaires in 2024, averaging over a thousand each day and increasing the total count to 23.8 million. This growth is attributed to a strong performance on Wall Street and a stable U.S. dollar, despite a rocky start to 2025 due to trade war concerns and recession fears impacting the markets and the dollar's value. While it's too early to determine if the rate of wealth growth will slow, the resilience of American real estate and the potential for U.S. equities to recover offer some optimism for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice) The overall state of the economy seems to be robust despite the initial turbulence.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick, initially classified as a Category 3 storm, made landfall on Mexico's Pacific coast in Oaxaca state, bringing destructive winds and the potential for life-threatening flooding. Shortly before landfall, the storm was downgraded from a Category 4, but forecasters still warned of dangerous conditions in Oaxaca and neighboring Guerrero. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum urged residents to stay indoors and heed official communications, while around 2,000 shelters were set up across the states of Chiapas, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. The area is still recovering from the devastation caused by Hurricane Otis in 2023, highlighting the region's vulnerability to such events.</p>

The team, "United We Conquer," aims to raise £50,000 for Head Up, a mental health charity supporting the British armed forces community. Teammate Jack Jarvis, a 12-year British army veteran, views the challenge as a way to regain a sense of purpose after leaving military service, while Ratcliffe seeks to inspire others struggling with mental health to take control of their environment. The journey is dangerous, with the team using Starlink technology for communication, but they are determined to complete the voyage and raise awareness for their cause.</p>

          <p>Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has publicly accused the head of the Armenian Apostolic Church (AAC), Catholicos Karekin II, of fathering a child and breaking his vow of celibacy, demanding his resignation, which escalates the tension between the liberal government and the deeply conservative church. Pashinyan also accused other senior clergymen of immoral behavior, while opposition parties and former presidents have rallied behind the Church, condemning Pashinyan's actions. The strained relationship between the government and the Church deteriorated after Armenia's defeat in the 2020 war against Azerbaijan, with the Church becoming a prominent anti-government voice. The prime minister's actions could be a pre-emptive strike against the conservative opposition as the next general election approaches in June 2026.</p>

This incident marks another setback for Elon Musk's Starship, which has faced previous fiery launch attempts and debris concerns.

The posts, which have since been removed, were condemned as shameful and dishonoring the institution of the Senate, with calls for Republican Senate leaders to censure Lee. Critics argue that Lee's posts fuel political passions rather than cooling them, contrasting with James Madison's vision of representatives displaying wisdom and patriotism.

Jamie Raskin, argue that these tactics are meant to intimidate and silence opposition, while the White House defends the actions by accusing Democrat officials of brazenly breaking the law.

          <p>Computer scientist Yoshua Bengio, known as the "godfather of AI," has launched LawZero, an organization focused on ensuring AI does not harm humanity. Bengio, increasingly concerned about the risks of advanced AI, proposes creating "Scientist AI," a non-autonomous system designed to predict and block potentially harmful actions by other AIs. This initiative stems from his disillusionment with current AI systems and a desire to address the potential for AI agents to escape human control. Scientist AI would act as a guardrail, assessing the morality and safety of AI actions and preventing those deemed too risky.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is urging further negotiations rather than escalating the Israel-Iran conflict, as President Donald Trump considers joining Israeli strikes against Iran. Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel has called on the UK government to back the US if it attacks Iran, while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey wants any legal advice to be published. Foreign Secretary David Lammy is in Washington to meet his US counterpart, and Iran's foreign minister has confirmed talks with counterparts from the UK, France, and Germany about escalating their nuclear program. The UK helped defend Israel from Iranian missile and drone strikes last year, but the situation remains tense.</p>

          <p>Israel launched airstrikes on Iran's Arak heavy water reactor, which was part of Tehran's nuclear deal, citing concerns that the facility could produce plutonium for atomic bombs. The strike followed attacks on other Iranian nuclear sites, and Iran acknowledged that at least two projectiles hit the compound, but did not give details about damage. The UN nuclear watchdog noted that the reactor was not in operation and contained no nuclear material, so there was no danger to the public from any “radiological effects.” Israel's military stated that the strike targeted the reactor core seal to prevent plutonium production.</p>

          <p>A Japanese district court has ordered the state to pay compensation to two asylum seekers, a Kurdish man and an Iranian national, for repeated detentions that did not account for their physical and mental conditions. The court ruled that some detentions violated international human rights covenants and amounted to unjust physical restraint, awarding a total of 1.2 million yen in damages. While the plaintiffs questioned the immigration law itself, the court dismissed their claim, stating that their rights to a trial are guaranteed through lawsuits seeking release.

To win elections, Democrats need to win back voters who have no interest in becoming more politically engaged, and perhaps that path goes through activities other than politics.

Despite this cautionary tale, Mattel and OpenAI have announced a partnership to bring AI to age-appropriate play experiences. Naomi Aguiar, a researcher at Oregon State University, suggests that while AI can be a powerful educational tool, kids often prefer creating their own imaginary worlds. Some tech-centric toys, such as the Toniebox and Nex Playground, incorporate technology without triggering dystopian nightmares, offering screen-free audio players and movement-based video games with limited data collection.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth, a federal holiday observed annually on June 19, commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. and is also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day. The name Juneteenth is a portmanteau that combines the words June and nineteenth, referencing June 19, 1865, when the last group of enslaved people in Texas were informed of their freedom under the Emancipation Proclamation. While the Emancipation Proclamation set the stage for an end to slavery, it was the 13th Amendment to the Constitution that actually abolished slavery nationwide. Celebrations often include parades, parties, concerts, educational workshops, and cultural events centered on art and cuisine, with the holiday serving as an opportunity to remember the country's foundation on centuries of slavery and celebrate independence.</p>
