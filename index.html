          <p>Influential conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a prominent ally of former President Trump and founder of Turning Point USA, was fatally shot on Wednesday while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University. The 31-year-old was addressing a crowd of approximately 3,000 people in an outdoor courtyard, reportedly responding to a question about gun violence when a single shot rang out, striking him in the neck. Eyewitnesses described immediate chaos and terror as the crowd dispersed. Authorities have launched an intensive manhunt for the shooter, treating the incident as a targeted assassination, with no current suspects in custody despite initial arrests. This tragic event has prompted a significant outpouring of grief and anger from across the political spectrum, with numerous leaders condemning the act and the broader climate of political violence in America.</p>

          <p>Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index achieved a new record high of 44,396.95 on Thursday, driven by global optimism for Federal Reserve rate cuts and positive inflation data from the US. Tech investment giant SoftBank Group saw a nearly 10% surge, contributing significantly to the gains, following reports of a substantial $300 billion cloud-computing deal between OpenAI and Oracle. This robust market performance mirrors broader gains on Wall Street and reflects an overall positive investor sentiment across Asian markets. The article highlights the interconnectedness of global tech developments and financial news, bolstering confidence in the market's upward trajectory.</p>

          <p>Equities worldwide, including the S&P 500, Japan's Nikkei 225, and South Korea's Kospi, have reached fresh record highs, reflecting a significant shift in investor sentiment. This global rally is fueled by easing inflation pressures, resilient corporate earnings, and strong expectations for U.S. interest rate cuts, particularly after a surprisingly soft producer price index reading indicated deflation. Analysts note that "animal spirits are soaring" as markets increasingly price in a quarter-point reduction at the September 17th Federal Reserve meeting. Oracle's blockbuster outlook for AI-related revenue has also bolstered confidence, suggesting the tech-led rally has sustained momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A shooting at Evergreen High School near Denver, Colorado, left two students wounded on Wednesday, one in critical condition, before the suspected student gunman died by suicide. Authorities responded swiftly to numerous 911 calls, making contact with the shooter within five minutes, though no law enforcement officers fired weapons. The preliminary investigation revealed the shooting occurred both inside and outside the school building, involved a handgun, and was witnessed by many students during lunchtime. School was subsequently canceled for Evergreen High and several surrounding districts as the community grapples with the tragedy and calls for discussions on enhancing school safety protocols.</p>

          <p>Nathalie Tocci argues that the transatlantic relationship is undergoing a structural rupture, not merely a temporary rift caused by Donald Trump. She contends that even without Trump, deep-seated security, demographic, societal, and economic forces make a return to past kinship unlikely, dubbing the hope for restoration "delusional." The article suggests Europe must abandon the belief in shared values and instead pursue a more transactional relationship with the US, or risk being caught in a dangerous world of clashing empires. This analysis emphasizes Europe's urgent need to develop strategic autonomy and strengthen ties with other global partners to avoid being pushed down the geopolitical food chain.</p>

          <p>A recent Redfin report suggests San Francisco's housing costs have returned to "normal" July 2018 levels when considering the mortgage payment-to-income ratio. This indicates a slowing home-price growth and falling mortgage rates, particularly in tech-driven metros where wages have grown considerably faster than the national rate. However, "normal" for San Francisco still means households spend a staggering 74% of their income on mortgages, significantly higher than the national average of 30% in 2018. The article clarifies that this stabilization doesn't equate to affordability, and the ongoing artificial intelligence boom continues to spike rents and crowd out lower-wage tenants.

The article stresses that in-depth analysis of the samples, ideally on Earth, is needed before drawing definitive conclusions. Roaming Mars since 2021, Perseverance cannot directly detect life but collects samples from areas deemed suitable for hosting life billions of years ago. Lead researcher Joel Hurowitz called it the most compelling candidate yet in the search for long-ago life, noting the discovery of organic carbon and minuscule specks enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide, which on Earth are byproducts of microorganisms consuming organic matter.

          <p>China has opened the world’s longest cable-stayed bridge, the Changtai Yangtze River Bridge, in Jiangsu province, eastern China, significantly reducing travel time from over an hour to just 20 minutes. Stretching 10.3km (6.4 miles) with a main span of 1,208 meters (3,960 feet), this mega bridge is the river’s first crossing to carry an expressway, regular road, and intercity railway, all on the same structure. Its distinctive asymmetrical lower deck design, accommodating a 200km/h railway on one side and a regular road on the other, marks a pioneering achievement in large-span bridge construction. This project showcases China's advanced engineering capabilities and improves regional connectivity.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has appealed a federal judge's order that blocked him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook while a lawsuit challenging her removal continues. The judge had ruled that Cook made a strong showing that her purported removal violated the Federal Reserve Act's requirement for removal only for legal "cause," and that public interest favors the Federal Reserve's independence. Trump had claimed Cook committed mortgage fraud, which she denies, with her attorneys arguing it is a pretext to pressure the Fed on interest rates. This article highlights a significant legal and political battle over the Fed's autonomy and the President's executive power.</p>

          <p>Senior cancer doctors in England are warning that excessive bureaucracy is creating an unacceptable "postcode lottery" for patients seeking the latest cancer treatments. The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) states that cumbersome funding applications stifle innovation, making cutting-edge therapies like Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) more readily available only in larger, better-funded units. This inequity means some patients are missing out on potentially life-saving treatments, prompting the RCR and the Society of Radiographers to call for a reduction in red tape. The government is preparing a new cancer strategy, due later this year, which aims to put the NHS back at the forefront of global cancer care and address these disparities.</p>

She characterizes the choice as "recklessness" given the high stakes and also expresses criticism of Biden's inner circle, claiming they often failed to defend her and even fueled negative narratives. While defending Biden's capacity as president, she acknowledges he "got tired" at 81, asserting her loyalty to the country above any personal allegiance to the president.

          <p>China is pursuing a "lean and mean" artificial intelligence strategy, focusing on practical applications and less on massive investments in human-level AGI, contrasting with the US approach. Beijing discreetly launched an $8.42 billion national AI fund and plans to integrate AI across its economy and society through a wide-ranging "AI+" initiative, emphasizing "usable" chips despite US restrictions. This resourcefulness has enabled local companies like DeepSeek to produce competitive generative AI models. While analysts warn of potential overcapacity risks in AI infrastructure, China's government-backed investments in hardware and its 2017 goal to be an AI innovation center by 2030 underscore its ambitious, long-term commitment in the intensifying tech rivalry.
