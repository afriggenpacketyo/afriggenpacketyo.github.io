          <p>President Trump has been briefed on the potential risks and benefits of military action against Iran's Fordo nuclear site, with sources indicating he believes disabling the site is necessary due to the risk of rapid weapons production. While Trump approved attack plans, he has not made a final decision, holding off in case Tehran agrees to abandon its nuclear program. The UK is actively involved in diplomacy, and Trump is aware of efforts by European ministers to engage with Iran. Trump has indicated that he may delay his final decision until the last moment, as circumstances can change quickly, especially during conflict.</p>

Walter's ownership group, TWGC Global, purchased the Dodgers in 2012 and has since overseen a period of sustained success.

Trump, who previously vowed to save TikTok, signed an executive order delaying the enforcement of the law for a third time.

The report cited poor financial judgment from university leaders and weak governance from the university court. It found that nearly Â£40m of ringfenced money had been spent elsewhere and there had been a lack of real action to address an Â£8m shortfall due to a drop in international student recruitment.

The new projection is partly due to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which boosted benefits for millions of retirees. The program faces long-term financial challenges due to baby boomer retirements and an aging population. Experts suggest raising revenue by lifting the income cap or adjusting the retirement age to address the shortfall (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is now requiring lawmakers to provide 72 hours' notice before visiting detention centers, prompting criticism from Democratic representatives. The new guidance follows a series of tense visits from lawmakers to detention centers amid Donald Trump's immigration crackdowns. Critics argue the policy is an attempt to block congressional oversight of ICE facilities. Several lawmakers have faced arrest or physical altercations during recent visits to detention centers, leading to accusations of obstruction and abuse of power.</p>

          <p>Roberto Minervini's "The Damned" strips away traditional war film elements to create an existential drama set during the Civil War. The film focuses on a group of volunteer soldiers in the U.S. Army, emphasizing their state of being and uncertainties rather than combat. Minervini's naturalistic style and collaboration with his cast result in a pensive atmosphere, exploring themes of economic inequality, brutality, and masculinity. The film subtly pinpoints the divisions that continue to plague America, presenting a perceptive exploration of a nation still in conflict.</p>

          <p>Tariffs are pushing up the cost of materials used in home renovation projects, leading some homeowners to reconsider their plans. Suppliers have already hiked prices for lumber, steel, and aluminum, attributing the increases to the Trump administration's levies. The extra costs can add up quickly, leading to a typical price increase of around $10,000 per home renovation project. Experts advise pre-ordering materials, opting for fresh paint jobs instead of new appliances, and budgeting for additional costs related to tariffs (not investment advice).</p>
