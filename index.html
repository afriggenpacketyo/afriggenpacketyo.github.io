          <p>A former assistant to the rapper Ye (formerly Kanye West), Lauren Pisciotta, is reportedly in hiding due to fear after filing a lawsuit containing serious allegations. The lawsuit, initially filed for sexual harassment, has been amended to include claims of sexual assault, stalking, and sex trafficking. Pisciotta's lawyer states she has been suffering since her employment began and is now letting the legal process unfold while concealed. West's legal team has denied the allegations, calling them "fantasy fiction" and stating they are prepared to challenge them in court.</p>

Meanwhile, Mengniu is set to issue yuan-denominated bonds to refinance existing debt and fund green and social-responsibility projects.

The students, who were on an educational visit from Northeastern University, fell into a processing tank after a grating panel gave way. Despite rescue efforts, they could not be revived, and a teacher was also injured in the accident. The victims were reportedly third-year students majoring in mineral processing engineering, visiting a mine operated by China National Gold Group.</p>

          <p>Two former traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were convicted and jailed for manipulating the Libor inter-bank interest rate, have had their convictions quashed by the UK Supreme Court. This ruling raises significant questions about potential compensation for wrongful conviction and opens the door for at least seven other convicted traders to appeal their sentences. The decision also fuels calls for a public inquiry into the broader rate-rigging scandal, including the role of senior bank managers and the Serious Fraud Office's investigation methods.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has affirmed a lower court's decision to block a Trump administration order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the executive order's interpretation of the 14th Amendment is unconstitutional, keeping a nationwide injunction in place. The case was brought by several states arguing that inconsistent citizenship laws would create significant problems. The 2-1 decision marks a significant legal setback for the policy, with a dissenting judge arguing the states lacked legal standing to sue.</p>

Students share experiences of feeling let down by "one-size-fits-all" university support systems, which they say are not equipped for complex cases. While universities have increased spending on wellbeing services, they stress they are not a replacement for clinical NHS services, which face long waiting lists. The debate involves whether universities have a formal duty of care and the strain on academic staff acting as first responders.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump will visit the Federal Reserve, a move seen as a significant escalation in his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. This marks the first official presidential visit to the central bank in nearly two decades, breaking with the long-held tradition of respecting the Fed's political independence. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates and has even publicly contemplated firing him. The visit is a symbolic gesture that brings the president's criticism directly to the institution he has been targeting. (not investment advice)</p>

This finding challenges the widely promoted but less evidence-based goal of 10,000 steps, which originated from a 1960s marketing campaign. Researchers analyzed data from over 160,000 adults and found substantial health benefits at the 7,000-step mark compared to lower activity levels. Experts believe this more attainable target could encourage more people to use step tracking as a practical tool for improving their health.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has declassified additional documents related to the U.S. intelligence assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Gabbard claims the materials show that Obama administration officials "manufactured" false intelligence to undermine Donald Trump's campaign. Democrats and former intelligence officials dispute this, accusing her of misrepresenting the findings and warning that the release could compromise sensitive sources and methods. Gabbard has referred the matter to the Justice Department for investigation of what she described as a "treasonous conspiracy."</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the origins of the band Black Sabbath and how they created the genre of heavy metal. Formed in working-class Birmingham, the band, fronted by Ozzy Osbourne, reacted against the "hippy-dippy" music of the late 1960s. Inspired by horror films, they adopted a darker theme and developed a heavier sound, characterized by Geezer Butler's bass, Bill Ward's slowed tempo, and Osbourne's wailing vocals. Guitarist Tony Iommi's unique, detuned style, developed after an industrial accident, became the cornerstone of the genre, influencing countless bands.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Giants' Rafael Devers, who recently made his debut at first base, made a surprising admission following the team's game against the Atlanta Braves. Devers stated that he prefers playing a defensive position on the field over serving exclusively as a designated hitter. He explained that being on the field keeps him active and prevents him from overthinking his next at-bat. This contrasts with his time at the Boston Red Sox, where there was public tension over his role, and he was ultimately assigned to full-time designated hitter duties before being traded.</p>

While acknowledging the diversity of the league's fan base and sympathizing with those impacted by immigration policies, he maintained that the league itself will not take a political stance.

          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. House representatives has introduced a resolution to stop a federal plan to shoot approximately 450,000 barred owls in the Pacific Northwest. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service approved the plan to protect the native northern spotted owl, which is being outcompeted by the more aggressive barred owl and is facing extinction. Opponents of the culling argue it is inhumane, unworkable, and a waste of taxpayer money, while some scientists and conservation groups insist it is the only way to save the spotted owl. The resolution uses the Congressional Review Act to attempt to reverse the agency's rule.</p>

          <p>Two new studies published in the British Medical Journal have raised serious concerns about the accuracy and reliability of over-the-counter health self-test kits. Researchers analyzed 30 kits and found that many lack crucial information on accuracy, how to interpret results, or what steps to take next. Experts warn that inaccurate results could lead to false reassurance or cause unnecessary anxiety, placing additional pressure on the NHS. In response, the UK's medical device regulator has stated it is overhauling safety standards for these widely available products.</p>

Arenas, a highly-touted five-star recruit who graduated high school a year early to join USC, was expected to play a major role.

          <p>A coalition of Los Angeles business leaders has initiated a ballot measure to repeal the city's gross receipts tax, a move they argue will improve the "anti-job climate" at City Hall. Proponents claim eliminating the tax, which is levied on revenue rather than profit, would provide relief to employers and boost the local economy. However, city officials warn that repealing the tax would create an $800-million hole in the city's general fund. This would directly threaten core public services like police and fire departments, which were already strained by a recent budget shortfall. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, allowing the country to avoid a technical recession. The growth, which beat economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong performance in exports, particularly for semiconductors and petroleum products. This rebound followed a 0.2% contraction in the first quarter. However, analysts remain cautious, noting that the export surge may have been fueled by firms shipping ahead of potential U.S. tariffs and that domestic demand, while improved, still faces headwinds.

Another order seeks to expedite the permitting process for data center construction by removing environmental regulations and other "red tape."
