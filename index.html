          <h2>UK Government and Labour Party Propose Stricter Immigration Rules</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 00:16:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several UK newspapers report on the government's and Labour party's new, stricter immigration policies. The government plans to require spouses, siblings, parents, and adult children of foreign workers to pass an English language test and will prevent care homes from recruiting staff from abroad. Labour also plans to tighten legislation that allows courts to grant asylum to foreign criminals under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The papers analyze these policies as an attempt to seize the narrative from the Reform UK party, with Conservatives accusing the government of merely pretending to be tough on the issue.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reported making significant progress in trade talks held in Switzerland. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as "productive and constructive," while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng called them "in-depth" and "candid." The White House referred to it as a "trade deal," with a joint statement expected to follow; the talks were the first face-to-face meetings since the US imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports, leading to retaliatory levies from Beijing. Both sides have agreed to establish an economic and trade consultation mechanism.</p>

          <p>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, facing International Criminal Court charges for crimes against humanity, remains popular as the Philippines holds midterm elections. Despite his arrest and extradition to The Hague, Duterte is expected to win another term as mayor of Davao City. His case has divided the country, with some believing he is a victim of political persecution by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., whose approval rating has dropped since Duterte's arrest. The article discusses the potential impact of Duterte's situation on his daughter, Sara Duterte, the current vice president, and the political landscape in Davao.</p>

          <p>Britain is increasing its military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, aiming to stimulate domestic job creation and local prosperity. The town of Barrow-in-Furness, home to BAE Systems, which builds nuclear submarines, is set to receive £200 million in government funding over the next decade. This investment aims to address infrastructure problems, attract workers, and revitalize the town center, with BAE Systems expanding its operations.

          <p>President Trump plans to sign an executive order directing the U.S. to pay the same price as other nations for some drugs, an attempt to revive a previously blocked initiative. The order aims to lower medication costs by tying Medicare payments to the lowest price paid by other countries. The pharmaceutical industry is expected to strongly oppose the move, arguing it will hurt profits and innovation. This plan would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare Part B and given in an office.</p>

The proposal, known as a "most favored nation" pricing model, aims to ensure the U.S. pays the lowest price among its peer countries. The plan will likely face legal challenges and strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry has long opposed the idea, which would almost certainly cut into its profits, and has been lobbying against it as discussions of the policy have regained steam in Washington in recent weeks.</p>
