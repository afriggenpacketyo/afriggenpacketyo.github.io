        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Peter R. Orszag, former budget director, expresses growing concern over the U.S.'s fiscal situation, citing annual federal budget deficits running at 6% of GDP and rising interest rates on 10-year Treasuries. He notes that the government is projected to spend more on interest payments than on defense, Medicaid, or Medicare, and federal debt has increased significantly since 2015. Orszag suggests eliminating the debt limit, extending the maturity of Treasury debt, and embracing the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency to manage fiscal risks. He concludes that recognizing the elevated fiscal risks is the first step toward fiscal health, as current budget legislation would exacerbate the challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress revoked California's authority to set electric vehicle mandates, viewing it as curbing the state's outsize influence. The move follows California's mandate to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035, a policy drawing strong opposition from Republicans with ties to the oil industry. Republicans argue that electric vehicles are impractical for rural constituents and that California's policies shouldn't dictate national standards. The article highlights the historical context of California's stringent pollution limits and the ongoing ideological battle over environmental regulations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent call for a wind down of the war in Gaza, coupled with criticism from Germany and Italy, signals growing impatience among Israel's allies. Britain, Canada, and France have also criticized Israel's actions, with Britain suspending trade negotiations and France organizing a conference to discuss a Palestinian state. Despite continued military and economic support, these shifts indicate diminishing patience with Prime Minister Netanyahu's approach, while Israel remains defiant and continues military operations in Gaza.</p>

          <p>While the unemployment rate remains low, a report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) suggests a different reality, with a "true rate" of unemployment at 24.3%.

The measure seeks to capture nuances missed by other indicators, such as people lacking steady work and living wages, and shows that Hispanic, Black, and women workers are disproportionately affected.
