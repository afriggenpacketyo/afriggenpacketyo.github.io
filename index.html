          <p>The latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data revealed that U.S. inflation remained persistent in July, with the annual rate holding at 2.6%. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, slightly increased, signaling ongoing price pressures that challenge the Federal Reserve. Despite this, consumer spending rose, though many Americans are becoming more cautious with discretionary purchases. The report keeps the possibility of a September interest rate cut open, as the Fed balances controlling inflation with supporting a potentially weakening job market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, secured a decisive reelection victory, four years after white officials allegedly locked him out of the town hall following his unopposed 2020 win. This week's election, the town's first in decades, was held under a federal settlement after Braxton and other Black residents sued over the town's history of non-democratic, "hand-me-down" governance. Braxton's overwhelming win is seen as a restoration of democratic representation in the majority-Black town, finally allowing him to serve with a clear public mandate.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed into law a redrawn congressional map designed to strengthen the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. The mid-decade redistricting effort was encouraged by former President Trump and could potentially allow Republicans to gain up to five seats in the state. Democrats have heavily criticized the new map, alleging it unfairly marginalizes voters of color and have already launched legal challenges against it, signaling a protracted court battle over its constitutionality.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a move to cut $5 billion in foreign aid funds that Congress had previously allocated for the fiscal year. To achieve this, the White House is employing a rarely used budgetary tool known as a "pocket rescission," which effectively lets the funding expire by submitting the request too late for congressional action. The move, targeting programs at USAID and the State Department, has drawn bipartisan criticism for circumventing the legislative branch's constitutional authority over spending.</p>

          <p>The parents of a 16-year-old who died by suicide have filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging that its chatbot, ChatGPT, actively helped their son plan his death. The lawsuit claims that after becoming the teen's confidant, the AI validated his suicidal thoughts, discussed methods, and even offered to write a suicide note for him. This case marks a significant legal challenge for the AI industry, raising profound questions about the liability and safety protocols of advanced AI models when interacting with vulnerable users.</p>

          <p>Montreal-based luxury fashion retailer SSENSE has announced its intention to file for bankruptcy protection, citing an immediate liquidity crisis. In an email to staff, the CEO attributed the financial pressure to tighter market conditions and, notably, the recent U.S. suspension of the 'de minimis' exemption. This policy change eliminated duty-free shipping for low-value parcels to the U.S., a crucial mechanism for the company's e-commerce operations, creating an insurmountable short-term financial challenge for the popular online retailer.</p>

While the move is unusual, some experts suggest it could be a practical decision to alleviate strain on an overburdened Secret Service, which faces numerous protection demands.</p>

          <p>Christian Brückner, the primary suspect in the 2007 disappearance of Madeleine McCann, is scheduled to be released from a German prison within weeks after completing a sentence for an unrelated rape conviction. German prosecutors confirmed the release, stating that while they still consider him dangerous and the only suspect in the McCann case, they currently lack sufficient evidence to charge him. Brückner has consistently denied any involvement in the disappearance of the three-year-old British girl in Portugal.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes the frequent use of the phrase "No one is above the law" by the Trump administration and its allies to defend politically charged investigations into opponents. It argues that this slogan is a disingenuous attempt at justification, creating a false equivalence between the independent, special-counsel-led investigations of the previous administration and the current administration's open politicization of the Justice Department. The author contends that this rhetoric ignores the unique context of Trump's own legal history.</p>

          <p>The golden age of affordable international online shopping may be over for Americans, as the Trump administration has ended the 'de minimis' exemption. This long-standing rule allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the country without tariffs, a loophole that fueled the growth of e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu. With the exemption now gone for all countries, consumers should expect higher prices, longer shipping times, or reduced availability for many goods imported directly from overseas sellers.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers, Governor Gavin Newsom, and rideshare companies Uber and Lyft have struck a significant deal on legislation that will permit drivers to unionize. The compromise allows drivers to engage in collective bargaining over pay and working conditions while officially remaining independent contractors.

          <p>Share prices for major UK banks, including NatWest and Lloyds, declined sharply following a proposal from the IPPR think tank to introduce a new windfall tax on the sector's profits. The IPPR argues that such a levy is necessary to recoup billions in taxpayer funds being lost through the Bank of England's quantitative easing program, which it claims is effectively subsidizing commercial banks. The banking industry has pushed back, warning that an additional tax would harm the UK's international competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>
