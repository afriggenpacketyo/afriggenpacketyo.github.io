          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant decline following Iran's missile strike on the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which resulted in no reported casualties. This attack was a response to U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, but the lack of casualties eased investor concerns about escalating conflict in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil futures fell by over 7%, while global benchmark Brent also saw a substantial decrease, reflecting optimism that tensions might de-escalate. Energy Secretary Chris Wright credited President Trump's foreign policy for fostering a more stable global environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk has ended its partnership with Hims & Hers Health, alleging the telehealth company engaged in "deceptive marketing" practices and sold illegitimate versions of Wegovy, its weight-loss drug. This decision came shortly after the companies announced a long-term collaboration to improve obesity treatment access. Hims & Hers' shares plummeted following the announcement, as the company anticipated significant revenue from weight-loss services. Novo Nordisk stated it aims to ensure patient safety and will continue selling Wegovy through other telehealth platforms committed to these standards, following FDA scrutiny of compounded weight-loss drugs.</p>

          <p>Iran launched a missile attack on the United Statesâ€™ Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Monday, according to a U.S. official, two days after the U.S. struck three nuclear sites in Iran. There are no reports of casualties at the base, according to a U.S. official. Iran's attack was in response to the U.S. on Saturday sending B-2 bombers to drop 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs -- known as "bunker busters" -- over Iran. President Donald Trump on Sunday said that "Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran," though Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said a full battle damage assessment is still pending.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company is recalling over 197,000 Mustang Mach-E vehicles due to a potential issue with the door latches that could trap passengers inside. The recall affects model years 2021-2025, as the door latches may remain locked if the car's battery level drops too low, posing a risk to children and others unable to unlock the doors. Ford plans to issue a software update to address the problem and will notify owners of the safety risk. This recall follows a previous recall in May for over 1 million Ford and Lincoln vehicles due to a rearview camera software glitch.</p>

          <p>The recent U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about potential disruptions to the oil and gas industry and their impact on energy prices. Although oil prices initially surged, they later retreated as experts believe Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil transit route. However, ongoing tensions could still disrupt the energy market, with potential Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities posing a significant risk. Analysts suggest that a closure of the Strait of Hormuz could send prices soaring, potentially reaching $130 per barrel, while U.S. gas prices are expected to rise in the short term.

          <p>With summer 2025 bringing potential for increased expenses, homeowners are considering using home equity loans. Understanding the difference between a home equity loan and a HELOC (home equity line of credit) is crucial, as loans offer a lump sum with fixed interest rates, while HELOCs provide a revolving line of credit with variable rates. Shopping around for the best rates and terms is also important, as is using the equity for financially sound purposes such as paying off high-interest debt rather than discretionary spending. Strategically using home equity can improve financial standing.</p>

          <p>Tyrese Haliburton, star player for the Indiana Pacers, suffered a torn Achilles tendon during Game 7 of the NBA Finals, potentially jeopardizing his next season. The injury occurred early in the game, significantly impacting the Pacers' performance and contributing to their loss. Recovery from an Achilles tear typically takes 8-10 months, casting doubt on Haliburton's availability for the upcoming season. Several other NBA players are currently recovering from similar injuries, highlighting the severity and prevalence of this type of injury in basketball.</p>

The flight departed from Tel Aviv, transporting vulnerable Britons to Cyprus before their final destination in the UK. A British national was also injured in Israel during an Iranian missile attack. The Foreign Secretary reiterated calls for Iran to return to negotiations following U.S. strikes, as many remain stranded due to closed airspace.</p>

High vacancy rates and low home value-to-income ratios indicate favorable conditions for homebuyers.
