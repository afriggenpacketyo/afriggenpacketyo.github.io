        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has detailed a plan to restructure TikTok's U.S. operations into a new American-based joint venture, aiming to address national security concerns. Under this framework, software company Oracle will manage the platform's security from top to bottom, including oversight of its content recommendation algorithm. While administration officials express confidence that China has approved the deal, Beijing has not publicly confirmed an agreement has been finalized. The move is intended to prevent a full ban of the popular social media app for its 170 million American users.</p>

          <p>Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, has been removed as a patron by four different charities after a 2011 email surfaced in which she referred to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend." The charities, including Julia's House children's hospice and the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, deemed her continued association inappropriate. A spokesperson for the duchess stated the email was sent to appease Epstein amid legal threats and that she regrets any association with him. This development follows years of scrutiny over the royal family's connections to Epstein, which previously led her ex-husband, Prince Andrew, to step down from public duties.</p>

          <p>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has issued a pardon for Alaa Abdel-Fattah, a high-profile British-Egyptian activist who has been imprisoned for most of the last decade. Abdel-Fattah became a symbol of political prisoners in the country following his involvement in the 2011 uprising. The pardon, which also included five other individuals, came after repeated calls for his release from the United Nations and the British government. This decision follows a recent court ruling that removed Abdel-Fattah from Egypt's terrorism list, citing a lack of evidence linking him to the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>

          <p>A senior White House official clarified that the preliminary deal to preserve TikTok in the U.S. will not involve the federal government taking an equity stake or a "golden share" in the new entity. The arrangement will establish TikTok's U.S. operations as a new joint venture with a majority-American board of directors and security oversight provided by tech giant Oracle. The official expressed confidence that China has approved the framework, which is designed to address national security concerns about the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. President Trump is expected to sign an executive order backing the deal and extending the deadline for a potential ban.</p>

          <p>Meta's new AI-powered smart glasses are being adopted by the blind and visually impaired community as a tool to enhance daily independence. The technology can connect to apps like "Be My Eyes," which links users with volunteers for real-time assistance, and uses optical character recognition to read text from menus, signs, and mail aloud. While users like para-athlete Emeline Lakrout find the glasses make daily tasks quicker and easier, the technology is still a work in progress, with some limitations in functionality and battery life.

          <p>Texas state Representative James Talarico, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, is campaigning on a message of unity and civility, a stance that contrasts with his past online statements. A 2021 social media post from Talarico has resurfaced in which he described "radicalized White men" as the nation's greatest domestic terrorist threat. His campaign now states he was calling out for-profit algorithms that can radicalize young men online. The National Republican Senatorial Committee has criticized Talarico for what it calls extremist rhetoric, highlighting the challenge candidates face when past online activity is scrutinized during a campaign.</p>

          <p>A raid on a suspected militant compound in Pakistan's northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province has resulted in the deaths of more than 20 people, including at least 10 civilians. Security officials stated the operation targeted a location where the Pakistani Taliban allegedly stored bomb-making materials. An explosion during the raid reportedly destroyed several nearby homes, leading to the civilian casualties, which included women and children. The incident has triggered protests and condemnation from local politicians, who have described the assault as an attack on unarmed civilians, while the government has yet to claim responsibility.</p>

          <p>While the national median household income saw a slight increase of just over 1% between 2023 and 2024, seven of the 50 largest U.S. cities experienced a decline. According to a SmartAsset analysis of Census Bureau data, Minneapolis saw the most significant drop at just over 4%, with its median household income falling to $77,732. Other cities where incomes fell include Denver, Seattle, and Austin, though their median incomes remain above the national average. Analysts suggest these fluctuations in large cities can be influenced by various economic and demographic shifts, including changes in family structures or local business dynamics.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point rate cut, average 30-year fixed mortgage rates have fallen to a nearly three-year low of 6.13%. This reduction offers significant savings for borrowers, particularly those with large loans; for example, a $1 million mortgage now has a principal and interest payment about $600 lower per month compared to rates earlier in the year. The article details how these lower rates can translate into over $200,000 in total interest savings over the life of the loan.

An engine would add weight, take up valuable space intended for features like a lockable cargo tunnel, and complicate the vehicle's engineering and safety structures.

          <p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has proposed that encouraging Americans to work past the traditional retirement age of 65 could help avert a looming retirement crisis, a suggestion that has drawn criticism. Fink argued in his annual letter that longer lifespans are straining Social Security, and that the concept of retiring at 65 is outdated. However, labor economist Teresa Ghilarducci countered that this view overlooks the reality that many older Americans are forced into retirement due to health issues or caregiving responsibilities. She also noted that longevity gains are not evenly distributed across the population, making a one-size-fits-all solution inequitable.</p>

          <p>A British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, who were recently released after being held by the Taliban for over seven months, have described their ordeal, which included being moved between 10 different prisons. The couple, who ran a charity in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, said they were never told why they were detained and at one point feared they would be executed. Their release was secured through what a UK minister called "good, old-fashioned diplomacy," with assistance from Qatar. The couple, who suffered health problems during their detention, have returned to the UK, leaving behind their home and possessions.</p>

          <p>Shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) fell by approximately 1.4% following the company's announcement that it had purchased an additional 850 Bitcoin for $100 million.

The company funded its latest acquisition using proceeds from both preferred and common stock offerings. Despite the recent stock dip, analysts at TD Cowen maintain a buy rating and a $620 price target, citing the stock's potential undervaluation relative to Bitcoin's price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial personality Dave Ramsey advised a caller to liquidate a $150,000 stock portfolio to pay down a mortgage, even though the loan has a low 2.875% interest rate. The caller and his wife, who are expecting their second child, have significant savings but are running a small monthly deficit. Ramsey argued that holding investments while carrying mortgage debt is equivalent to borrowing against a house to buy stocks, framing it as an unnecessary risk. This advice contrasts with conventional financial planning, which often suggests investing when market returns are expected to exceed low-interest debt costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A murder trial has begun in France for Cédric Jubillar, who is accused of killing his wife Delphine nearly five years ago, in a case that has gripped the nation due to the absence of a body. Prosecutors are building their case on circumstantial evidence, including a motive of jealous rage over an impending divorce, signs of a struggle, and testimony from a neighbor who heard screaming. Jubillar has consistently maintained his innocence, and his defense argues there is no direct evidence linking him to the crime. The mystery has become a sensation on social media, with amateur sleuths debating theories about the disappearance.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, known for a possession-based attacking style, has shifted to a surprisingly defensive approach, culminating in a recent draw against Arsenal where his team held only 34% possession. This tactical change, which involves deploying multiple central defenders and sitting deep, marks a radical departure from the philosophy that has defined his career. Analysts are debating whether this is a temporary strategy forced by strong opponents or an admission that his current squad is less suited to his traditional possession game. The shift comes as the Premier League sees a broader trend toward more cautious, physical styles of play.</p>

          <p>China's soybean imports remained near record highs in August, with the country making exceptionally large purchases from Brazil to hedge against potential supply disruptions from the United States. Detailed customs data revealed that over 85% of the 12.2 million tonnes imported came from the South American nation. This strategy allows China to build its reserves ahead of the U.S. harvest season, when the impact of tariffs related to the ongoing trade dispute would be more acutely felt. The move indicates that Beijing is preparing for a prolonged trade stand-off with Washington by diversifying its agricultural supply chain.</p>

He characterized the current stance as appropriate, balancing risks to employment and inflation, and urged his colleagues to "tread cautiously" on any future rate reductions. His comments reflect a more hesitant view within the Federal Open Market Committee regarding the pace of potential future cuts.</p>

The attack on the MUSE check-in and boarding system has forced airport staff to perform many tasks manually, leading to widespread disruption.

Experts attribute this trend to lowered barriers to entry, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence and the marketing power of social media platforms like TikTok.
