          <h2>Businesses Pass Tariff Costs to Consumers, Fed Report Reveals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 15:22:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Federal Reserve report indicates that businesses are already attempting to pass the costs of President Trump's tariffs onto consumers. Companies are reporting increased input costs from suppliers and are seeking to avoid absorbing these increases themselves. The report also notes pervasive uncertainty regarding international trade policy across the Fed's districts. Businesses are adding tariff surcharges or shortening pricing horizons to account for the uncertain trade policy, with most expecting to pass additional costs to customers. The outlook for service sector firms has worsened, with contacts anticipating a sharp decline in activity and a major pullback in planned investment.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has issued a stern warning to both Russia and Ukraine, stating that the U.S. will cease its efforts to broker a ceasefire if they do not reach an agreement. This ultimatum, the second from the Trump administration in a week, comes despite President Trump's earlier pledges to swiftly end the war. Vance proposed freezing territorial lines near their current positions, requiring both sides to concede some land. President Zelenskyy reaffirmed Ukraine's commitment to negotiations while also sending condolences for civilian deaths in a Russian drone attack. Emotions have run high, but five countries met to bring peace closer: Ukraine, the USA, the UK, France and Germany.</p>

          <p>The German government is proposing to allow Syrian refugees to visit their home country for up to four weeks without losing their refugee status. The aim is to enable Syrians to assess the possibility of voluntary return, checking on their homes and relatives. Such visits would be permitted under strict conditions and registered with immigration authorities. However, the CSU party rejects the proposal, calling them vacation trips in disguise, while favoring a coordinated solution within Europe.</p>

          <p>Rep. Ayanna Pressley, a Democrat from the progressive "Squad," has warned that the Trump administration might imprison individuals for non-criminal reasons, including "practicing diversity, equity and inclusion."

Pressley alleges the students are being mistreated and denied basic essentials, while claiming one student had her hijab forcibly removed. The Department of Homeland Security refuted the allegations about the student's detention as unequivocally false.</p>

The surge in viewership is attributed to both the Pope's death and Amazon Prime Video making "Conclave" available to subscribers.

          <p>Bitcoin's price is surging towards $95,000, rising for a third consecutive day, driven by a broad relief rally following President Trump's softened stance on China tariffs and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Exchange-traded funds tracking Bitcoin have seen a spike in inflows. This is due to increasing interest in the cryptocurrency as a hedge against stock market turbulence and a diving dollar. The rally has forced short sellers to cover their positions, further pushing up the price. Demand for spot bitcoin has been contracting on a monthly basis, though that contraction has slowed recently. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The stock market's recent rally is largely attributed to a short squeeze, where short sellers are forced to buy back stocks to cover their losses. Increased short positions in the market created an environment prone to dramatic upswings. A short seller borrows an asset and quickly sells it, then buys it back more cheaply to profit from the difference. Goldman Sachs' prime brokerage data shows hedge fund short sellers recently increased bearish wagers. The market's rally, driven by this artificial buying force, occurred despite a lack of tangible news.</p>

          <p>The retrial of Harvey Weinstein has commenced in New York, with prosecutors accusing him of using his power in Hollywood to commit sexual assault and harassment against three women. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty, and his attorney is attempting to discredit the women's claims. The retrial focuses on allegations from actress Jessica Mann, former TV production assistant Miriam Haley, and former model Kaja Sokola. Weinstein's previous conviction was overturned due to the inclusion of testimony from women whose allegations were not part of the charges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is signaling a potential shift away from its trade war with China, acknowledging that tariffs on Chinese goods are unsustainable. Markets have responded positively to comments from President Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicating a willingness to lower tariffs. However, subsequent remarks from Bessent stating that tariff reductions require reciprocal action from Beijing have tempered enthusiasm. The policy shift follows warnings from major retailers about potential supply shortages and higher prices for U.S. consumers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring a $5,000 "baby bonus" to incentivize Americans to have more children. The proposal is part of a broader effort to increase the nation's birth rate. The administration has been fielding proposals from outside groups focused on increasing the nation's birth rate after years of decline. While advisers are considering the idea, Trump hasn't made a final decision on any of the proposals.</p>
