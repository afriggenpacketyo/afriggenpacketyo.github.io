          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles amidst protests over immigration enforcement has sparked a lawsuit from California Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta, who argue that the move violates the U.S. Constitution and exceeds presidential authority. The lawsuit contends that Trump's action, which federalizes the California National Guard without Newsom's consent, is unwarranted and an abuse of power. Trump defended the deployment, stating it was necessary due to purported obstruction of federal immigration enforcement, while Newsom criticized the move as an attempt to manufacture chaos for political gain. The situation has escalated tensions between the state and federal government, raising concerns about the appropriate use of federal forces in domestic affairs.</p>

          <p>An aid boat named Madleen, bound for Gaza carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists, was intercepted by Israeli forces and directed to the port of Ashdod. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated the action was to prevent the ship from breaking the naval blockade of Gaza, aimed at preventing Hamas from importing arms. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organized the effort, condemned the interception as an unlawful act, stating that the ship was boarded and its crew abducted, while the aid cargo was confiscated. The Israeli Foreign Ministry posted images of Thunberg and other activists, stating they would be deported to their home countries, while Turkey criticized the intervention as a violation of international law, further highlighting the contentious nature of aid efforts to Gaza.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles under Title 10 of the federal code has raised legal questions and sparked controversy. The move, intended to protect federal immigration officials and law enforcement amid protests, has been criticized by California Governor Gavin Newsom, who argues it violates state sovereignty and has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration. Legal experts note that Title 10 allows the president to call up the National Guard in a supportive role, but concerns remain about the potential for escalating violence and the impact on civil society. The situation highlights the tension between federal authority and state autonomy in managing domestic unrest.</p>

          <p>A New York judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, stemming from Lively's allegations of sexual harassment on set and subsequent retaliation. Baldoni's lawsuit claimed Lively and others aimed to ruin his career by promoting a false narrative of sexual assault and a smear campaign. The judge ruled that Baldoni had not adequately proven extortion or defamation, as Lively's statements were privileged as part of her lawsuit. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete vindication, while Baldoni has been given the opportunity to amend and refile allegations related to interference with contracts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing stricter visa scrutiny for international students, particularly those from India and China, causing some to rethink their plans to study in the U.S. These restrictions, including threats to revoke some visas, are raising concerns about the U.S.'s reputation as a leading destination for education and innovation. The moves are impacting the flow of talent and research, potentially affecting the U.S.'s competitive edge in science and technology. The increased scrutiny is leading some students to consider alternative destinations for their education.</p>

          <p>A yacht carrying 12 activists, including Greta Thunberg, attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, was intercepted by Israeli forces and towed to Ashdod. Israeli authorities stated the interception was to enforce the naval blockade and prevent weapons from reaching Hamas. The organizers, Freedom Flotilla Coalition, condemned the action as an unlawful boarding and abduction, while Israel dismissed the vessel as a "selfie yacht" and plans to deport the activists. The aid on board included rice and baby formula, highlighting the ongoing tensions surrounding aid efforts to Gaza.</p>

          <p>A recent Gallup poll reveals a growing divergence between men and women on their support for abortion rights, three years after the overturning of Roe v Wade. The poll found that 61% of women identify as "pro-choice," compared to only 41% of men, marking the widest gender gap in decades. The changes are attributed more to increased support among women post-Roe than to shifts in men's attitudes. The findings suggest that the political upheaval surrounding abortion rights has energized women's support for access to the procedure.</p>
