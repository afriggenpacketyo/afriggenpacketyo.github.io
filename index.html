          <h2>Trump Administration Proposes Eliminating Arts and Humanities Endowments in New Budget</h2>

          <p>President Trump's budget proposal seeks to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), along with the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences, for the fiscal year 2026. This move aligns with Trump's efforts to reduce the size of the federal government and cut unnecessary entities. The proposal has drawn criticism from Democrats, with some vowing to fight the plan. The NEA, which supports arts organizations and projects across the country, has already faced cuts and challenges to its grant distribution policies under the Trump administration, including the elimination of grants supporting underserved communities and requirements regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion. The article suggests the agency's budget in 2024 was $207 million, and that it had provided more than $163 million in grants that year.</p>

          <p>A single-engine plane made an emergency landing at Riviera Country Club due to engine issues, but no injuries were reported. The plane had three passengers on board, and the pilot skillfully avoided hazards while landing on the golf course. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating the accident. The golf course, which will host the Olympic Games in 2028, experienced temporary disruptions due to the landing. The 2025 edition of the Genesis Invitational was played at Torrey Pines due to Riviera Country Club being damaged by wildfires earlier in the year.</p>

Read is being retried on charges including second-degree murder and vehicular manslaughter in connection with O'Keefe's death in 2022. McCabe testified that she heard Read say, "I hit him, I hit him, I hit him," and was cross-examined by the defense regarding inconsistencies in her testimonies and a Google search for how long it takes to die in the cold. The defense alleged collusion among witnesses to coordinate their statements, which McCabe denied. The article mentions that Read has claimed McCabe was lying on the stand.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's dismissal of nearly 400 scientists working on the National Climate Assessment, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society announced a plan to publish a special collection of climate change research.

The groups are inviting climate scientists to submit their work, with a focus on climate change in the United States. The collection is not meant to replace the National Climate Assessment, but to expand on it, given concerns about the scope of the next official assessment.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a policy requiring new vaccines to undergo placebo-controlled trials, a move described as a "radical departure from past practices." The policy would necessitate studies where half the participants receive a placebo to compare results against the vaccine, raising ethical questions about withholding proven treatments. It remains unclear what HHS considers a "new" vaccine and whether this includes updated flu and COVID vaccines. Kennedy has long questioned vaccine safety, arguing for placebo-based trials to ensure vaccines do more good than harm.</p>

          <p>President Trump renewed his threat to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, claiming the school deserves it, which Harvard is resisting and stating there is "no legal basis" for such a move. The university argues that such action would endanger its educational mission, diminish financial aid, and halt critical medical research. While Trump asserted his intentions, it remains unclear whether the IRS is proceeding with the revocation, as federal law prohibits presidential direction of tax investigations. The conflict is part of a broader campaign against elite universities, which the administration accuses of antisemitism and discrimination.</p>

Kirby stated that 20% of air traffic controllers for Newark have been absent after technology failures. He urged the FAA to establish flight restrictions similar to those in place at other congested airports.

          <p>Fifteen-year-old Benjamin Qin Muji won top place in the China trials for the International Philosophy Olympiad by arguing that while AI can think and is conscious, it cannot feel pain due to lacking a biological body. Benjamin's essay explored the question of whether machines have the ability to think and feel pain. His success highlights the growing importance of understanding the implications of AI on consciousness and the definition of humanity in the age of advanced technology.</p>

          <p>DÃ©a Kulumbegashvili's film "April" portrays Nina, an obstetrician in Georgia, as she faces scrutiny after a tragedy in the delivery room. Nina also performs private abortions, which could be exposed during the investigation. The film explores the oppressive gloom descending on Nina, using tracking shots and audio cues to emphasize her inner turmoil. The realist style emphasizes the cold procedural quality of Nina's work and her stark demeanor, as she dedicates herself to serving women in need while withdrawing from her own life.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued an executive order to end government funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), claiming that outlets like PBS and NPR are "left wing propaganda." The CPB responded that the president does not have the power to cut off its funding, as Congress controls that authority. The White House is expected to request Congress to claw back $1.1 billion allocated for the CPB. NPR and PBS vowed to fight the executive order, arguing it violates First Amendment rights and threatens their ability to serve the American public with educational programming.</p>

          <p>President Trump sent a letter to Congress outlining his proposals for government spending in the next fiscal year, including $163 billion in cuts to climate, education, health, and housing programs. The plan would significantly reduce domestic spending and formalize Trump's campaign to remake the federal government, depicting many functions as woke or wasteful. Democrats rebuked the proposal, while some Republicans endorsed it. The plan includes significant cuts to public health and education, dismantling climate programs, and increasing military spending. Trump also said Harvard would be stripped of its tax-exempt status.</p>

          <p>Germany's Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party has been designated as right-wing extremist by the country's federal office for the protection of the constitution.

The AfD, which came second in federal elections, denounced the decision as politically motivated. The classification has drawn criticism from some US officials, while the German Foreign Office defended the decision as a measure to stop right-wing extremism.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has made significant gains in English local elections, winning 677 seats and control of eight authorities from the Conservatives. The party also won its first mayoral contests. Nigel Farage hailed the results as evidence that Reform has overtaken the Tories as the main opposition to the Labour government. The Conservatives suffered heavy losses, while Labour saw its share of the vote dented by Reform. The BBC estimates that Reform would have won 15% of the national vote, its worst-ever share of such a projection.</p>

          <p>American consumers are set to face higher prices on small shipments from China as a key shipping loophole, the "de minimis" provision, has been closed. The Trump administration eliminated the exemption for goods imported from China and Hong Kong, citing concerns about illegal drugs and unfair trade practices. The move is expected to impact consumers who rely on low-cost goods from e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu, and the companies are already adjusting prices and fulfillment models. The article mentions that Shein has already raised its prices by an average of 51% on its top 100 products.</p>
