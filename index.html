          <p>Doordash has announced its acquisition of SevenRooms, a restaurant booking platform, for $1.2 billion in cash, aiming to enhance its services and support financial goals. However, the company's first-quarter revenue fell short of expectations, causing shares to decline by approximately 4%. Despite the revenue miss, Doordash reported an 18% increase in total orders compared to the previous year, reaching 732 million. The company anticipates second-quarter adjusted EBITDA between $600 million and $650 million, reflecting continued strong consumer demand in its marketplaces, consistent with typical seasonal patterns.

          <p>Russia has accused Ukraine of launching a drone attack on Moscow, leading to the temporary closure of the city's major airports. The alleged attack occurred just days before Russia's planned World War II parade on May 9, commemorating the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany. While there were no reported casualties, the incident has heightened tensions between the two countries. Ukraine has not commented on the accusations, and President Zelensky has dismissed Russia's proposed ceasefire as a "theatrical play," pushing instead for a longer truce that includes a halt to missile and drone strikes on civilian targets.</p>

          <p>King Charles III has unveiled his official coronation portrait, painted by Peter Kuhfeld, depicting the monarch in his regalia from the crowning ceremony two years prior. Sunlight illuminates the crown, adding a regal touch to the painting, which has received a more positive reaction than his previous portrait. Alongside the King's portrait, Queen Camilla's portrait, painted by Paul Benney, was also revealed, showcasing her in her silk coronation dress. Both artists have long-standing relationships with the royal family, with Kuhfeld having painted Charles's sons in 1986 and Benney having painted Queen Elizabeth stroking a horse in 2015.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has acknowledged that restricting winter fuel payments negatively impacted Labour's support in recent local elections, as many voters expressed dissatisfaction with the decision. Despite this, he maintained that the move is necessary to invest in public services amid ongoing economic challenges. Streeting stated that the policy is not under formal review, though Labour is considering the voters' message from the elections. The winter fuel payment provides a lump sum to pensioners, but the government restricted payments to those qualifying for pension credit to save £1.4 billion.</p>

CEO Benedetto Vigna noted that key metrics recorded double-digit growth, highlighting strong profitability from product mix and personalization demand.

          <p>The Taiwan dollar has eased after a historic surge, weakening over 3% against the U.S. dollar, following a 9% rally over the previous two trading days. This surge was driven by exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging U.S. dollar debt, although officials deny currency talks with the U.S.. Despite the pullback, the Taiwanese dollar remains up over 8% this year against the greenback. Analysts are closely watching the Taiwanese central bank, as its apparent lack of intervention has fueled speculation that authorities are allowing a stronger currency to potentially win trade concessions from the U.S..</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. imports and exports are experiencing disruptions akin to those seen during the Covid-19 pandemic due to Trump's trade tariffs, with the agricultural sector particularly hard-hit. U.S. exports have declined significantly, impacting ports across the country, including major agricultural export hubs like the Port of Oregon and Port of Tacoma. The decline in exports is linked to a decrease in containerships coming to the U.S., as businesses cancel manufacturing orders in response to rising costs. Retailers are urging consumers to buy sooner rather than later, as supply disruptions may lead to leaner inventories in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Three years into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, some Russian parents and teachers are finding creative ways to shield children from state-mandated patriotic education classes. Some schools are preparing fake schedules, while parents are opting for homeschooling or helping children navigate a school system they see as increasingly propagandistic. The Kremlin's "patriotic education" initiatives, including weekly lessons and flag-raising ceremonies, are seen by critics as an effort to indoctrinate children.

          <p>Former Governor Andrew Cuomo, in his bid to become mayor, is proposing a plan to remove more mentally ill people from the streets of New York City to address public safety concerns. The 36-page plan includes expanding involuntary hospitalizations and requiring screenings for mandatory outpatient treatment for those discharged from public hospitals and jails. Cuomo aims to add supportive housing units and psychiatric beds, focusing on those who pose a danger to themselves or the public. Many of Cuomo's ideas align with those of Mayor Eric Adams and Governor Kathy Hochul, who have also pushed for changes to force more people into treatment.</p>

They argue that the committee is weaponizing their pain and anguish and is not concerned with antisemitism, but rather with silencing pro-Palestinian voices on campus.

          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan has stated that she will challenge Labour in Westminster when it makes decisions that negatively impact Wales, emphasizing that her priority is the nation and its people over party loyalty. Morgan called for the UK government to reconsider cuts to disability benefits and the winter fuel allowance, and demanded that Wales benefit more from wind power revenue. She also criticized Reform UK and Plaid Cymru, emphasizing that the rise of Reform and a split on the left meant that the "whole shape of the future of Wales" was at stake at the next election.</p>

          <p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is seeking to drop its appeal of a federal judge's ruling that allowed commodities exchange KalshiEx to take bets on the outcome of U.S. political elections. The agreement calls for both sides to bear their own costs and attorney fees, and for Kalshi to waive all legal claims arising from litigation in the case. Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour hailed this as a historic moment that secures the future of prediction markets in America. However, the financial reform advocacy group Better Markets criticized the decision, calling it "a stark betrayal of the public interest."</p>

Chinese diplomats are campaigning to unite Global South nations against Washington, framing Trump's tariffs as a threat to developing economies.
