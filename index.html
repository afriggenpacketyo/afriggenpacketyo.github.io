          <p>An Indiana woman, Britney Gard, 46, was reported missing last week following a "suspicious" fire at her home in Bainbridge, located about 40 miles west of Indianapolis. Authorities found no one inside the fire-damaged residence, and all attempts to contact Gard have been unsuccessful since her disappearance. Her car and purse were found at her house, intensifying concerns about her unknown whereabouts. The Putnam County Sheriff's Office is actively investigating this case, classifying her as a missing endangered person. Her family, deeply worried, is urging the public to be vigilant and provide any information that might help locate her safely and bring her home.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani faced strong criticism from Israel and pro-Israel voices for his statement on the two-year anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attacks. Mamdani's statement commemorated both Israeli victims from that day and Palestinian victims from Israel's subsequent war in Gaza, while also denouncing Israel's actions as "genocidal." The Israeli foreign ministry accused him of spreading Hamas propaganda, highlighting the deep divisions his stance has created in the mayoral race. This article underscores the political sensitivity of the conflict and its impact on domestic politics.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have reached an unprecedented $4,000 per ounce, marking a significant 50% increase this year, as investors increasingly seek a safe haven asset. This surge is primarily driven by a weaker U.S. dollar, escalating geopolitical volatility, pervasive economic uncertainty, and stubborn inflation. Central banks and retail investors are rapidly acquiring gold, with prominent financial experts recommending a substantial portfolio allocation to the precious metal. This article suggests that gold is demonstrating robust performance when typical parts of an investment portfolio decline, although some analysts advise a cautious approach due to potential market corrections.

          <p>Los Angeles County has launched an investigation into its record $4-billion sexual assault settlement, following reports that some plaintiffs were paid by recruiters to sue the county. The supervisors unanimously approved a motion to examine possible misconduct by legal representatives involved in the litigation, and a public hotline will be established for tips. Concerns also extend to the significant portion of taxpayer money potentially going to law firms and the impact of a 2020 law that altered the statute of limitations. Supervisors expressed anger over the alleged exploitation of a system meant for victims and the financial strain on county services.</p>

          <p>UFC star Conor McGregor has been handed an 18-month suspension for violating the organization's anti-doping policy, Combat Sports Anti-Doping announced.

The sanction was backdated to September 2024, running through March 2026. McGregor fully cooperated with the inquiry and provided explanations for the circumstances, which led to a reduction of the standard 24-month penalty by six months.

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, marking the tenth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season, and is expected to steadily strengthen into a hurricane in the coming days. Although currently far from land, Jerry has prompted a tropical storm watch for several northern Leeward Islands in the Caribbean. Forecasters predict the storm will bring heavy rains, potentially up to four inches, and generate life-threatening surf and rip currents to these islands by Thursday or Friday. This article details the storm's current trajectory and potential impact, following a relatively quiet hurricane season thus far.</p>

          <p>A new study by the National Council on Aging and the University of Massachusetts Boston reveals that low-income Americans over 60 die an average of nine years earlier than their high-income peers. This significant longevity gap is attributed to factors like lack of preventative care, inability to afford medical treatment, and the pervasive stress of financial instability. The findings highlight widening economic inequality and its profound impact on the health and well-being of an aging population, with many seniors lacking the financial assets to cope with unforeseen shocks. This article underscores a critical social issue in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has strengthened into a Category 2 storm off Mexico's west coast and is projected to become a major Category 3 hurricane by day's end. Its outer bands are already spreading over Baja California Sur, with heavy rains and gusty winds expected to impact sections of the peninsula later Tuesday into Wednesday. A tropical storm watch is in effect from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro. While the storm is expected to remain offshore, it will generate dangerous swells, posing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and moisture from Priscilla may affect the southwestern U.S. later this week.</p>

          <p>US airports, including Hollywood Burbank, are experiencing significant flight delays and cancellations due to an exacerbating shortage of air traffic controllers amid the ongoing government shutdown. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy reported a "slight tick" in sick calls from essential controllers working without pay, leading to staffing levels as low as 50% in some areas. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association warned members against job action, despite the financial strain. This situation mirrors a 2019 shutdown that also disrupted air travel, highlighting the system's fragility.</p>

          <p>New research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association reveals that inhalers for asthma and COPD contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, generating an estimated 24.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually in the US. This is comparable to the emissions of 530,000 gas-powered cars each year, exacerbating climate change and potentially worsening respiratory conditions. Metered-dose inhalers, which use hydrofluoroalkane propellants, are identified as the primary culprits. The study highlights a crucial opportunity to mitigate this environmental impact by shifting towards lower-emission alternatives like dry powder inhalers.</p>
