          <p>The European Union and Southeast Asian nations are seeking to enhance the security of undersea cables, which are vital for telecommunications and international trade. Recent incidents in the Baltic and Red Seas have highlighted the vulnerability of these cables to both accidental damage and deliberate sabotage. Concerns also include China's increasing pressure on cable consortia in the South China Sea and the potential for natural disasters to disrupt cable infrastructure. The EU has published an Action Plan on Cable Security and is redirecting funds to boost surveillance and establish emergency repair vessels, with France's Alcatel Submarine Networks playing a key role.</p>

          <p>Tottenham is reportedly close to appointing Brentford's Thomas Frank as their new head coach following the dismissal of Ange Postecoglou. Brentford anticipates a formal approach from Tottenham in the coming days, although there has been no confirmed dialogue between the two clubs yet. Frank's success in guiding Brentford into the Premier League and establishing them as a top-flight club on a small budget makes him a strong candidate. Brentford would be entitled to compensation exceeding Â£10 million to release Frank from his contract, which runs until 2027.</p>

          <p>Following a series of high-profile kidnappings targeting cryptocurrency executives, the "Bitcoin Family" has overhauled its security measures to protect their crypto assets. Didi Taihuttu, the family's patriarch, explained that they have moved away from hardware wallets in favor of a hybrid system that combines analog and digital methods. This involves encrypting and splitting seed phrases, storing them through blockchain-based encryption services, and hiding them across four continents. The family's lifestyle, which involves living entirely on bitcoin and traveling full-time, makes them particularly vulnerable to such threats, prompting them to prioritize safety and decentralization in their financial security.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deployed the California National Guard in response to ongoing protests in Los Angeles over immigration enforcement operations. Demonstrations have intensified, with protesters halting traffic on the 101 Freeway, leading to clashes with authorities. President Trump signed a memorandum to deploy 2,000 National Guardsmen to address the perceived lawlessness in California. California Governor Gavin Newsom has requested the Trump administration to rescind the deployment, citing concerns over federal overreach and escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>Glastonbury Festival has reduced its ticket sales by a few thousand this year to alleviate overcrowding, according to organizer Emily Eavis. The event, which will take place in Somerset later this month, will not use its full 210,000 capacity. Organizers have also created more space at the Other Stage and the Shangri-La nightlife area. Festival-goers are encouraged to use multiple routes to ease congestion, with the festival app tracking popular artists to predict busy areas. This year's headliners include Olivia Rodrigo, The 1975, and Neil Young.</p>

Marine scientists are concerned about the potential harm to marine biodiversity and ecosystems, with over 30 countries supporting a moratorium on deep sea exploration pending further research.</p>

The Southern Nevada Heat Resilience Lab is studying the impact of heat on communities and recommending data-based solutions. The city aims to plant 2,000 trees annually, focusing on drought-tolerant species, to mitigate the effects of climate change and address shade disparity in lower-income areas.</p>

          <p>A proposed bill in the U.S. could significantly alter student loan programs, potentially making college less accessible for many Americans. The legislation includes changes to Pell Grant eligibility, requiring students to take more credit hours to qualify for the maximum grant amount, which could disproportionately affect low-income and part-time students. Additionally, the bill proposes eliminating subsidized loans, which do not accrue interest while students are in school, and imposing lifetime borrowing caps. These changes may force students to rely on private lenders with higher interest rates, exacerbating financial challenges for those pursuing higher education. (not investment advice)</p>
