          <p>Tadej Pogacar is set to secure his fourth career Tour de France title after successfully navigating the penultimate stage and maintaining his substantial overall lead. While Australian sprinter Kaden Groves celebrated his first-ever Tour stage win with a bold solo attack near the finish, Pogacar completed the hilly course safely within the main peloton. As the final day is traditionally a processional stage into Paris where the leader is not challenged, the 26-year-old Slovenian's victory is all but officially confirmed, barring any highly improbable accidents. This win further solidifies his status as one of the sport's dominant figures.</p>

          <p>Media trailblazer Tom Rogers, once a self-proclaimed "raging bull" on Netflix, has significantly dialed back his optimism, citing new concerns about the streaming giant's long-term growth trajectory. Despite a positive recent quarterly report, Rogers highlights declining viewership engagement per subscriber and intensifying competition from free content on platforms like YouTube as major headwinds. He suggests that while AI aids Netflix's ad targeting, it also empowers YouTube creators, blurring content quality lines. These engagement trends could challenge Netflix's future pricing power and programming budget, signaling potential trouble ahead. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a new interview, James P. Hoffa alleges his father, legendary labor leader Jimmy Hoffa, was murdered in a 1975 conspiracy involving then-Teamsters president Frank Fitzsimmons and Detroit Mafia figures. He claims Fitzsimmons and the mob collaborated to prevent his father from reclaiming the union presidency, as his return threatened their control and financial interests. The article details the devastating emotional toll on his family, the lack of closure without a body, and new claims from informants about the specific individuals who carried out the killing. The disappearance officially remains an active FBI investigation.</p>

          <p>A significant security operation is underway as U.S. President Donald Trump visits his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland for a private trip. While the visit has proceeded without incident at the resort itself, protests against his politics have occurred in the cities of Edinburgh and Aberdeen. During his stay, Trump is scheduled to meet with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney. The visit has prompted public debate about the high security costs and the use of public funds for a separate golf tournament at his other Scottish course.</p>

          <p>House Democrats are formally requesting that Jeffrey Epstein's estate provide a copy of a "birthday book" allegedly compiled for the disgraced financier in 2003. Public reports indicate the book contains a "bawdy" letter signed by President Trump, a claim the president has vehemently denied and is now suing over. Lawmakers argue the document is relevant to their ongoing oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation and the Trump Administration's selective release of related files. The request precedes a scheduled deposition of Epstein's imprisoned accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>

          <p>Despite CEO Elon Musk's optimistic projections about driverless cars and a revolutionary robotaxi service, Tesla investors are increasingly focused on the company's immediate and pressing financial challenges. The electric vehicle maker recently reported a 16% year-over-year decline in automotive sales, thinning profits, and now faces headwinds from expiring EV credits and tariffs. Analysts note that while futuristic projects are interesting, the market is currently more concerned with the company's core profit-and-loss performance and the rapid rise of lower-cost competitors. This skepticism is reflected in the stock's recent underperformance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A panel of political correspondents on "Washington Week" analyzed why President Donald Trump is unable to shake the controversy surrounding his connection to Jeffrey Epstein. Panelists argued the issue resonates deeply with Trump's own base, who are often mobilized by distrust of powerful people acting behind closed doors. By appearing to defend powerful interests in this case, Trump is undermining a core part of his established political narrative. This dynamic helps explain why his usual deflection tactics have been largely ineffective and why the story continues to gain traction and create political problems for the White House.</p>

          <p>A U.S. research team has discovered the presence of PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," in nearly a third of tested reusable period products like menstrual underwear and cups. These persistent chemicals, which do not break down in the environment, are linked to serious health issues including cancer and fertility problems. The study notes that while some products had high levels indicating intentional use in manufacturing, many others were PFAS-free, proving the chemicals are not necessary for function.

They argue that more salacious and revealing information likely exists in yet-unreleased FBI interview notes and internal Justice Department memoranda.

The lead single, "Daisies," has quickly climbed the charts, offering a soothing and emotionally reserved alternative to typical high-energy summer anthems. The album's production is described as aqueous and gentle, reflecting a broader musical trend toward more downtempo and melancholic pop. This shift in style, coming after Bieber's professional split with manager Scooter Braun, seems to resonate with the current cultural mood, filling a void in the music landscape.</p>

          <p>After a recent tournament win, tennis star Venus Williams quipped that she returned to competition for the health insurance, inadvertently highlighting a common struggle for many Americans. Because most U.S. health insurance is directly tied to employment, athletes and other workers with non-traditional or intermittent careers face unique and difficult challenges. When not actively competing, Williams lost her WTA-provided plan and had to switch to expensive COBRA coverage. Her situation illustrates the complexities of a system where access to affordable healthcare is deeply linked to one's job status, a problem affecting millions beyond elite athletes.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has strongly condemned the Hong Kong government for offering cash rewards for information leading to the arrest of pro-democracy activists currently living in Britain. In a joint statement, the UK's Foreign and Home Secretaries labeled the move a clear act of "transnational repression" and reiterated their commitment to protecting the rights and safety of all individuals in the UK. The bounties target 19 activists who are accused of violating Beijing's controversial national security law. This is the latest in a series of such actions by Hong Kong authorities targeting dissidents who have fled abroad.</p>

          <p>A shooting at a University of New Mexico dormitory complex has resulted in the death of a 14-year-old and the injury of a 19-year-old. The incident occurred early Friday morning when a suspect opened fire on a group of four people who were playing video games inside a dorm room. New Mexico State Police later arrested an 18-year-old suspect, John Fuentes, who has been charged with murder and other serious offenses. The shooting prompted a campus-wide shelter-in-place order and closure for the day, deeply unsettling the university community during its new student orientation period.</p>

          <p>In a significant recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected a bid to remove 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a major setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to shift the balance of power in the legislature. The KMT and its allies currently form a majority bloc, enabling them to resist the agenda of President Lai Ching-te. The recall effort was driven by public anger over the opposition's blocking of key legislation and passing controversial changes seen as favoring Beijing, which claims sovereignty over the self-ruled island.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is experiencing a surge in canceled sales contracts and delistings as buyers and sellers reach an impasse in negotiations. Financially stretched buyers are proving more willing to walk away from deals over issues like home repairs, while many sellers with low mortgage rates are opting to pull their homes off the market rather than lower their asking price. In June, 15% of all homes that went under contract fell through, the highest rate for that month since 2017. This market friction is contributing to muted home sales during what is typically the busiest season.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's extensive use of tariffs is facing a critical legal test in a federal appeals court, with significant implications for his trade policies. A lawsuit challenges his authority to impose duties on any country by declaring a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). A lower court previously ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, but that decision was paused pending this appeal. The outcome of this case could potentially invalidate many of Trump's major trade actions, including his tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted Niger's democratically elected president, the country's situation has significantly deteriorated, according to regional analysts. The junta, which cited insecurity and economic woes as justification for the takeover, has instead overseen a period of increased job losses, a severe crackdown on civil society, and worsening human rights abuses. Niger has also withdrawn from the regional ECOWAS bloc and forced many international NGOs to cease operations. The military leader was recently sworn in for a five-year term, signaling that a return to civilian rule is unlikely.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a significant and concerning rise in loneliness, with recent studies showing that young people are increasingly affected by social isolation. Experts point to the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the nature of social media as contributing factors, as digital interactions often replace meaningful real-life connections. Sociologists also warn of a potential link between chronic loneliness and a higher susceptibility to authoritarian thinking and political extremism. The problem is not confined to urban areas, as those in rural communities with fewer opportunities for social interaction are also at a higher risk.</p>
