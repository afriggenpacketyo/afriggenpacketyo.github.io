          <p>Renowned venture capitalist Michael Moritz has publicly supported Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan following calls for his resignation from former President Donald Trump. In a Financial Times piece, Moritz described the political attacks as "artless bullying" and expressed confidence in Tan's ability to lead Intel, citing his successful history. The controversy stems from concerns raised by Trump and Senator Tom Cotton regarding Tan's connections to Chinese companies. Despite the political pressure, Intel's board appears to be standing by Tan, who met with White House officials to address the concerns.</p>

          <p>Following former President Trump's decision to place the Washington, D.C. police under federal control, focus has turned to the 1973 D.C. Home Rule Act. The act grants the president authority under Section 740 to assume control of the Metropolitan Police Department for federal purposes in an emergency, though this control is limited to 30 days without congressional extension. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other Democrats have criticized the move as an "egregious assault on D.C. home rule" and are using it to renew calls for D.C. statehood. Republicans, however, have praised the action as a necessary step to combat crime.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has extended the deadline to reimpose high tariffs on Chinese goods, delaying the increase for an additional 90 days. This move provides a temporary reprieve in the ongoing trade dispute, preventing U.S. duties on Chinese imports from escalating to previous peak levels. The decision followed recent trade negotiations in Stockholm and reflects the administration's pattern of using tariff deadlines as a negotiation tactic. The extension offers continued, albeit uncertain, stability for businesses navigating the unpredictable trade policy landscape between the two economic powers. (not investment advice)</p>

The move has drawn sharp criticism from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and congressional Democrats, who label it an unprecedented and politically motivated power grab.</p>

          <p>This article critiques the growing trend of mandating facial recognition and ID checks for online services, arguing these measures are often ineffective and compromise user privacy. The author demonstrates this by easily fooling the verification system of a dating app, Tea, that recently suffered a major data breach. The piece warns that laws like the U.K.'s Online Safety Act and similar proposals in the U.S. force platforms to adopt invasive surveillance that can be circumvented, ultimately making users less safe. It suggests that such laws risk creating a centralized tracking system while failing to achieve their stated goal of protecting users.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have extended their partnership with Netflix through a new multiyear, first-look deal for their company, Archewell Productions. This new arrangement gives Netflix the first right of refusal on their projects, offering more flexibility than their previous exclusive contract. The couple announced several upcoming projects, including a second season of Meghan's lifestyle show and a film adaptation of a novel. This deal solidifies their media presence in the U.S. as they continue to build their careers outside the British royal family.</p>

          <p>AMC Entertainment's stock rose after the company announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The movie theater chain reported revenue of nearly $1.4 billion and significantly narrowed its net loss to $4.7 million, or one cent per share. CEO Adam Aron attributed the positive performance to a recovering box office and the company's success in managing its debt maturities. The company also saw a 26% increase in attendance and record-high revenue per patron, signaling a potential turnaround after post-pandemic struggles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent research note from Melius Research, which downgraded Adobe, suggests that artificial intelligence is beginning to disrupt the software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry. The analysis posits that AI tools could reduce the need for "costly SaaS seats" by increasing worker productivity, posing a potential threat to companies like Salesforce. While Salesforce is actively developing its own AI offerings, such as Agentforce, to adapt, the changing landscape has prompted a reevaluation of its stock. Consequently, CNBC's Investing Club has downgraded Salesforce to a "hold" rating, acknowledging the deteriorating outlook for the broader SaaS neighborhood. (not investment advice)</p>

A recent study suggests the world could face shortfalls of key minerals like lithium and cobalt, but the article argues these "peak mineral" fears may be premature. Technological advancements are rapidly creating substitutes, such as sodium-ion batteries replacing lithium and new chemistries that eliminate the need for cobalt. Just as innovation overcame "peak oil" predictions, new technologies, improved mining techniques, and material science breakthroughs could resolve mineral supply challenges for the renewable energy sector.</p>

          <p>A Romanian citizen, Catalin-Marius Graur, has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for orchestrating a massive fraud scheme targeting food and cash aid recipients.

At the time of his arrest, he possessed nearly 1,500 stolen account numbers and over $37,000 in cash.

          <p>Cannabis industry stocks experienced a significant rally after former President Trump stated he is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less-dangerous drug category under federal law. Currently a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, a potential move to Schedule III could provide major benefits, including tax relief and increased investment. While Trump noted a decision could come in the next few weeks, the reclassification authority ultimately rests with the Attorney General and the DEA. The announcement has nonetheless sparked optimism in the sector for a long-awaited policy shift with bipartisan support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of Microsoft's GitHub unit since 2021, has announced he is leaving the company to "become a founder again." His departure comes as GitHub faces increasing competition from a new wave of AI-powered coding tools from startups like Anysphere, Replit, and Windsurf. Although GitHub's AI tool, Copilot, has seen significant growth with 20 million users, the market is rapidly evolving. Dohmke will stay on through the end of the year to manage the transition, with GitHub's leadership team continuing its mission within Microsoft's CoreAI division.</p>

          <p>In a press conference, former President Donald Trump provided his account of the deal allowing Nvidia to sell certain AI chips to China. He claimed he initially demanded a 20% share of the revenue for the U.S. government but agreed to 15% after negotiating with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Trump also characterized the H20 chip in question as "obsolete," suggesting China already possesses similar technology. He asserted that he would not permit the sale of more advanced chips like the Blackwell without significant performance downgrades, framing the deal as a strategic move for national security.</p>
