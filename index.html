            <p>A helicopter crashed into the Hudson River near Lower Manhattan, resulting in the deaths of all six individuals on board, including three children. The victims, reportedly tourists from Spain, were on a 15-minute flight around Manhattan when the helicopter plunged into the water. Witnesses reported seeing pieces falling off the helicopter and hearing loud noises before the crash, with the aircraft found upside-down near the New Jersey side of the river. Emergency services responded to the scene, and the FAA identified the helicopter as a Bell 206. </p>

            <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant downturn, erasing gains from the previous day, after President Trump's tariff policies created market volatility. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq Composite all fell sharply due to escalating trade tensions with China, compounded by confusion over tariff rates. Despite a positive CPI report indicating progress on inflation, uncertainty surrounding Trump's trade war and potential recession risks continue to weigh on investor sentiment. Analysts emphasize that the full impact of tariffs is yet to be felt, making the market situation highly volatile. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>U.S. stocks closed sharply lower on Thursday, reversing the previous day's gains, as investors reacted to President Trump's trade policies, particularly the escalating trade war with China. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all experienced significant declines after the White House clarified that tariffs on Chinese goods would be higher than initially reported. China responded by restricting imports of Hollywood films, further escalating tensions. Despite positive rallies in Asian and European markets earlier in the day, U.S. investors remained cautious amid uncertainty surrounding the trade landscape.</p>

            <p>A federal judge in Boston has extended a temporary order blocking the Trump administration's policy of deporting migrants to third countries. The judge expressed concerns about the policy's lack of safeguards for migrants facing potential danger in those countries. The DOJ argued that delaying removals could overburden the courts, while advocates for the migrants asserted that the policy denies due process. The judge plans to issue a decision on a preliminary injunction next week, further scrutinizing the controversial deportation approach.</p>

            <p>The House adopted a budget blueprint for President Trump's agenda after Republican leaders convinced conservative holdouts to support it. The resolution passed with a narrow margin, with some Republicans joining Democrats in opposition. House conservatives initially resisted the plan due to concerns about spending cuts, but ultimately flipped their votes after receiving assurances from the Senate. The budget plan is a crucial step in implementing Trump's priorities, including border security, defense, and extending tax cuts.</p>
