          <h2>Hollywood Film and TV Industry Faces Uncertainty in California</h2>

          <p>The Hollywood film and television industry is facing significant challenges in California, with a considerable decline in production and job opportunities. Following the 2023 strikes, the industry has not rebounded as expected, leading to concerns about its long-term viability in the state. Television production in the Los Angeles area has decreased by 58% since 2021, and on-location production has also seen a decline. Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to more than double the state's film and TV tax credits to $750 million in an effort to retain productions, but some industry experts believe this may be insufficient to offset the high costs of working in California, as many productions are moving to other states and countries offering more attractive tax incentives. The situation has left many industry professionals struggling to find work and facing difficult financial decisions. Optimism remains uncertain, but the proposed tax credits offer a potential lifeline for the industry.</p>

          <p>UCLA's softball team is facing Women's College World Series elimination after a 3-1 loss to Texas Tech. The Bruins struggled against Texas Tech pitcher NiJaree Canady, who pitched a complete game, leaving five runners on base. UCLA's sole run came from a home run by Kaniya Bragg in the fifth inning, while Taylor Tinsley pitched a complete game for the Bruins. UCLA must now defeat Tennessee to continue their quest for a national title, while Texas Tech advances to the semifinals.</p>

          <p>Wayfarers Chapel, a historic landmark in Rancho Palos Verdes, is seeking a new location due to ongoing landslides that forced its disassembly. Chapel leaders have identified a prospective site next to Rancho Palos Verdes City Hall, on the old Battery Barnes military site, as an ideal location. The relocation plan includes rebuilding the chapel with a visitor's center, museum, cafe, and gardens, while maintaining the sweeping ocean views. The original chapel, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright Jr., was built in 1951, but was damaged by recent landslides with shattered windows and warped metal framing. Securing the new site and raising the estimated $20 million for rebuilding are the next steps for the chapel's leadership.</p>

          <p>A by-election in Hamilton, Larkhall, and Stonehouse is seeing intense competition among political parties following the death of Christina McKelvie. The SNP, Labour, and Reform UK are all vying for the seat, with the outcome expected to influence the political landscape ahead of the Holyrood election next May. Labour aims to regain power after nearly two decades, while the SNP seeks to maintain its position, and Reform UK hopes to capitalize on recent successes in England. Voters have expressed frustration with established parties, focusing on issues such as rising household bills and healthcare access, which Reform UK is attempting to leverage.</p>

Interfaith couples face challenges, such as backlash from their communities, while LGBTQ+ individuals may experience rejection from their families and religious groups. Former members of strict religious communities, like Jehovah's Witnesses, can be ostracized for leaving their faith. Despite these challenges, many individuals find ways to reconcile their faith with their personal lives and relationships.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump cautioned Senator Rand Paul against voting against his "Big, Beautiful Bill," claiming it would favor Democrats. Trump stated that Paul's opposition would lead to a significant tax increase and a potential default on U.S. debt, and that the people of Kentucky would not forgive him. Paul expressed concerns about the bill's potential to increase the debt, despite supporting its tax and spending cuts. The bill, which includes tax cuts and Medicaid reforms, has faced criticism from both Republicans and Democrats, and its passage in the Senate remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the UK government faces unavoidable tough choices as it finalizes public spending plans. The level of spending on health will determine whether cuts are made to unprotected areas outside of the NHS, defense, and schools. The IFS suggests a significant amount depends on the generosity of cash allocated to the NHS, which accounts for 39% of day-to-day departmental spending. The government aims to scrutinize every pound spent in the Spending Review on June 11, outlining departmental budgets over the next few years.</p>

          <p>A BBC article investigates the viral TikTok trend of using a "McMigraine Meal" (Coke and fries) to alleviate migraine symptoms. While some individuals find that the caffeine and sugar in Coke, or the salt in fries, can provide temporary relief, experts caution against relying on this as a regular treatment. Migraines are complex neurological conditions that cannot be cured by a fast-food meal, and excessive caffeine or processed foods can even trigger migraines in some people. Neurologists recommend focusing on lifestyle changes and medical treatments for managing migraines effectively.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times suggests that Donald Trump's political resilience is partly due to his willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself. This adaptability reassures swing voters that anything extreme is provisional, as Trump tests limits but is also generally willing to retreat. By checking himself and being checked by others, Trump meets the expectations of an important group of voters who approve of his presidency. This dynamic interaction, where he accepts counterpressure and retreats, is crucial to his continued viability.</p>

Kim Jong Un has called the incident a "criminal act" and ordered swift repairs to the ship, which was meant to be a triumph of North Korea's naval modernization efforts.
