          <p>A bomb exploded near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, resulting in one death and injuries to at least five people. According to Mayor Ron DeHarte, the explosion originated in or near a vehicle, and authorities suspect it was an intentional act of violence. The clinic, American Reproductive Centers, confirmed that their staff and reproductive materials were unharmed, though their office space sustained damage. The FBI and ATF are investigating the incident, and Governor Gavin Newsom stated that the state is coordinating with local and federal authorities in the response. The explosion occurred less than a mile from downtown Palm Springs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal courts are increasingly pushing back against the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, insisting on due process for immigrants facing removal. The Supreme Court recently criticized the administration for providing inadequate warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation under an 18th-century wartime law. This article discusses several cases where courts have intervened to ensure immigrants have the opportunity to challenge their deportations, particularly when Trump officials invoke novel powers to remove them. The courts' stance underscores the constitutional principle that all 'persons' are entitled to due process before being deprived of life, liberty, or property.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma's new social studies curriculum, influenced by State School Superintendent Ryan Walters, will require high school students to "identify discrepancies" in the 2020 election results, pushing conspiracy theories. The curriculum revision has sparked controversy, with critics arguing that it promotes a biased perspective and undermines factual history. The revised standards also include references to the Bible and national pride, and have led to a lawsuit from parents and educators concerned about the lack of proper review and the inclusion of misinformation. This article examines the implications of these changes and the ongoing debate over educational content in Oklahoma.</p>

          <p>Hamas has proposed releasing more hostages in exchange for a 60-day truce and the release of Palestinian prisoners, following a new round of ceasefire talks mediated by Qatar and the US. The proposal includes the entry of 400 aid trucks a day and the evacuation of medical patients from Gaza. This development comes as Israel launched a new offensive in Gaza, resulting in numerous casualties. The UN and European leaders have condemned the intensified offensive, calling for a permanent ceasefire to address the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where aid agencies warn of famine due to the ongoing blockade.</p>
