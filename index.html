          <p>The "Tea" app, designed as a "whisper network" for women to share information about men, suffered a significant data breach. The hack exposed sensitive user data, including driver's licenses and private messages, leading to two class-action lawsuits. The incident highlights the inherent risks of digital gossip platforms, where anonymity can foster both safety and potential harm. Experts note that while such networks can protect women, moving them online can lead to a loss of nuance and increase the potential for mob behavior and severe real-world consequences for all involved.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young adults are turning to TikTok for news, relying on content creators and algorithm-driven feeds rather than traditional media outlets. This shift is exemplified by "newsfluencers" like Aaron Parnas, who deliver rapid-fire updates on major events to millions of followers. While proponents find the format convenient and less biased, critics raise concerns about misinformation, the lack of in-depth reporting, and the influence of TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The trend highlights a fundamental change in media consumption, where news is often packaged as entertainment to capture attention on the platform.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has placed limits on the Trump administration's sweeping asylum ban at the U.S.-Mexico border. The D.C. Circuit Court panel ruled that the administration cannot use the president's proclamation to ignore U.S. laws that prevent the deportation of migrants to countries where they could face torture or persecution. While the court allowed the government to continue denying discretionary asylum, it affirmed that mandatory protections, such as "withholding of removal," must still be processed. This decision partially restrains the administration's efforts to summarily expel migrants without humanitarian screenings.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts federal immigration agents from conducting "roving" raids in the Los Angeles area based on factors like race or language. The court agreed that using criteria such as a person's ethnicity, speaking Spanish, or their location does not constitute reasonable suspicion for a stop, which is a violation of the 4th Amendment. This decision keeps in place protections against what critics have called discriminatory and unconstitutional enforcement tactics by ICE and CBP. The Trump administration criticized the ruling, stating it undermines their efforts to remove criminals.</p>

          <p>Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton described his own performance as "useless" after a disappointing qualifying session for the Hungarian Grand Prix left him in 12th place. While his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc secured a surprise pole position, Hamilton struggled for pace and failed to advance to the final qualifying round. Despite his personal frustration, Hamilton congratulated Leclerc and the team, acknowledging the car's capability. Leclerc's pole was unexpected, as he capitalized on changing weather conditions that disrupted the dominant McLaren team's performance.</p>

          <p>Residents of Gaza are facing a catastrophic hunger crisis, describing their daily search for food as a "death journey" fraught with danger. Despite some aid deliveries, Palestinians report that the assistance is insufficient and that accessing it is often deadly, with hundreds killed near distribution sites. They express that international diplomatic gestures, such as discussions of Palestinian statehood, feel meaningless without tangible changes to their desperate situation on the ground. Many have lost faith in aid efforts, viewing them as symbolic performances that fail to alleviate the widespread starvation and suffering.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that matching your workout routine to your personality type could lead to more enjoyable and sustainable fitness habits. Published in Frontiers in Psychology, the research linked the "Big Five" personality traits to preferences for certain exercises. For instance, extroverts tend to enjoy high-intensity group classes, while conscientious individuals prefer goal-oriented activities like marathon training. The findings suggest that people who struggle to stick with a routine might find more success by exploring different activities that better align with their innate character traits.</p>

          <p>A tribute to the late actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who died at 54, reflects on his iconic role as Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show." The article praises Warner's skillful performance, which brought depth and vulnerability to a character who could have been a simple "slacker" punch line. Warner balanced Theo's teenage hubris with a complex inner life, charting his evolution from an unmotivated student to a young adult who finds purpose after a dyslexia diagnosis. His portrayal was central to the show's groundbreaking depiction of a Black family, challenging stereotypes and exploring the nuances of growth and identity.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), following the release of a jobs report showing a sharp slowdown in hiring. The July report indicated only 73,000 new jobs were added, and figures for the previous two months were revised downward by 258,000. Trump, without evidence, claimed the numbers were manipulated for political purposes and that the economy is "booming." The move to fire the head of the independent statistical agency drew immediate and sharp criticism from economists and lawmakers, who warned it threatens the integrity of U.S. economic data.</p>

          <p>Several senior Republican senators have joined Democrats in condemning President Trump's decision to fire the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer. Lawmakers including Cynthia Lummis and Thom Tillis criticized the move as "impetuous" and problematic if based solely on disliking the weak jobs numbers. Senator Rand Paul questioned the action's effectiveness, stating that firing the people who provide statistics makes it harder to trust that the data will not be politicized. The bipartisan backlash highlights deep concerns that the president's action undermines the credibility and independence of vital government economic data.</p>

The book review in The Atlantic notes that mail carriers provide a sense of order and predictability, acting as a reliable connection to the federal bureaucracy during times of crisis. The piece reflects on the quiet heroism of mail delivery, a service that ensures communities remain connected, from Appalachian towns to the most remote village in the country. This consistency is a testament to the dedication of those who show up every day, regardless of the circumstances.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump acknowledged that he is considering a pardon for music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs but noted that Combs's past hostile comments make the decision "more difficult." In a Newsmax interview, Trump referred to Combs as "sort of half-innocent" following his conviction for transportation to engage in prostitution, for which he awaits sentencing. However, the president recalled that Combs made "terrible statements" about him during his political campaigns. This suggests that while Trump has a history of pardoning allies, personal loyalty may be a significant factor in his decision-making process regarding Combs.</p>

          <p>A RentCafe analysis reveals a vast disparity in how much apartment space $1,500 in monthly rent can secure across major U.S. cities. In Manhattan, that budget gets a renter an average of just 216 square feet, while in Wichita, Kansas, it affords an average of 1,329 square feet. The report highlights that the least amount of space is found in expensive coastal markets like New York, Boston, and San Francisco, where housing demand far outstrips supply. Conversely, renters find the most space for their money in Midwestern and Southern cities where housing is more affordable. (not investment advice)</p>
