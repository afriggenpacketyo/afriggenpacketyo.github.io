          <p>Gaby Hinsliff's article in The Guardian examines the rise of the "DEI hire" taunt, which undermines individuals from non-traditional backgrounds by suggesting their positions are due to diversity initiatives rather than merit. The piece references instances where successful women and minorities in prominent roles have faced relentless scrutiny and accusations of incompetence. It argues that this trend feeds into existing prejudices and creates a climate of doubt, eroding the confidence of those who have overcome barriers to achieve success.

          <p>In this New York Times opinion piece, Lydia Polgreen discusses the meeting between President Trump and South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, highlighting how Trump hijacked the discussion to focus on a racist narrative of white South Africans facing genocide.
