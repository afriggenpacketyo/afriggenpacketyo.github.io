          <p>A highway bridge in the Bryansk region of Russia, near the Ukrainian border, collapsed onto railway tracks, resulting in at least seven fatalities and numerous injuries. The incident involved several heavy trucks falling onto a moving passenger train, causing derailment of the locomotive and several cars. Moscow Railway alleged the collapse was due to "illegal interference in transport operations," prompting an investigation by authorities.

          <p>In an essay, a palliative care physician reflects on the importance of considering how one truly wishes to live, especially when faced with a terminal illness. The author shares anecdotes of patients whose perspectives shifted upon receiving a diagnosis, often leading them to reconcile their current lives with the ones they had longed for. Rather than pursuing outlandish bucket list activities, people often seek meaningful connections and experiences with loved ones. The author suggests that contemplating mortality can provide clarity and freedom to live more authentically.</p>

          <p>Hamas is seeking changes to the latest U.S. ceasefire proposal for Gaza, with a senior official stating the amendments focus on U.S. guarantees, timing of hostage release, aid delivery, and Israeli forces' withdrawal. A separate Hamas statement outlined the proposal's aim for a permanent ceasefire and comprehensive Israeli withdrawal, including the release of living hostages and bodies in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. However, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff called the Hamas response "totally unacceptable", urging acceptance of the framework proposal for talks. The friction comes as desperation grows among Palestinians and relatives of hostages amidst ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Despite the potential impact on its medal prospects, skateboarding powerhouse Japan has welcomed the new Olympic age limit restricting competition to athletes 14 and older from the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Governing body World Skate decided in April to institute the limit, which would have ruled some of Japan's previous Olympic medal-winning skateboarders ineligible. Japan's street skateboarding head coach Daisuke Hayakawa has nevertheless endorsed the new restriction against the backdrop of increasingly severe injuries, including ligament ruptures, being reported among growing children in many countries as the technical difficulty of tricks continues to rise. The International Olympic Committee started tightening age restrictions to protect child athletes after Russian figure skating prodigy Kamila Valieva tested positive for a banned substance at the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing.</p>

          <p>An amendment to Japan's Penal Code, emphasizing rehabilitation in prisons, has taken effect, marking the first change to punishment forms in over a century. Imprisonment is no longer divided into labor categories, and work is not mandatory, allowing more time for rehabilitation and education to reduce recidivism. The revised law stipulates "confinement" and "necessary work" or "necessary guidance" for improvement. The new system includes 24 programs tailored to inmates' age, characteristics, and other factors, including programs for seniors and drug abusers. Inmates will be sent to prisons offering appropriate programs, reviewed every six months for adjustments.</p>

Despite their efforts to address sexism and discrimination, they feel their voices are being erased. The two main candidates have been mostly silent on gender equality, while a third candidate gains popularity among young men with anti-feminist views.

          <p>A legal action over a huge lithium project in the Democratic Republic of Congo is on hold as the US battles Chinaâ€™s dominance. Perth-based AVZ Minerals has suspended its arbitration case against the Democratic Republic of Congo until later this month, following US encouragement to resolve the dispute over the massive Manono lithium project. The suspension comes as the US backs start-up KoBold Metals â€“ funded by tech billionaires including Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos â€“ to acquire AVZâ€™s stake in Manono. If successful, KoBold will pledge US$1 billion to develop the project, countering Chinaâ€™s Zijin Mining, which controls the northern section after Congo revoked AVZâ€™s rights in 2023.</p>
