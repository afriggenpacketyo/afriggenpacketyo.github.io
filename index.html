          <p>President Trump refuted claims that his tariff strategies are a form of backing down, dismissing the term "Trump Always Chickens Out" (TACO trade). He asserted that his tariff threats have been instrumental in jumpstarting trade negotiations with the European Union, pointing to their willingness to meet after he announced potential tariffs. Trump defended his approach as a negotiation tactic, highlighting the delay of tariffs on the EU as a strategic move rather than a retreat. He criticized the initial question about his trade policies as "nasty," maintaining that his actions have helped the U.S. gain ground in trade discussions.</p>

          <p>Irish rap group Kneecap was removed from the TRNSMT music festival in Glasgow due to safety concerns raised by the police. The concerns stem from a band member being charged with a terror offense and criticism over past gig footage featuring controversial statements. The band, still scheduled to perform at Glastonbury, expressed disappointment and announced a new show at Glasgow's O2 Academy as compensation. TRNSMT promoters cited the police's safety concerns as the reason for the cancellation and thanked fans for their understanding, while the band asserts they were removed rather than pulling out.</p>

          <p>Porsche is facing significant challenges due to a combination of factors, including declining sales in China, slumping demand for electric vehicles, and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. These headwinds have led the company to scale back its forecast for the year by approximately 2 billion euros. CEO Oliver Blume described the situation as a "violent storm," with U.S. import tariffs further weighing on the business. The company is now revisiting its EV strategy, reintroducing combustion engine models, and cutting costs through job eliminations and production consolidation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has expressed increasing frustration with Vladimir Putin's intensified strikes on Kyiv, marking a shift from his previously amicable stance. Despite repeated claims that his relationship with Putin would foster peace in Ukraine, Trump now asserts that Putin has gone "absolutely CRAZY!" However, when questioned about potential repercussions for Russia, Trump remained vague, raising doubts about whether any concrete actions will follow his strong words. Analysts suggest Trump's evolving perspective reflects a growing recognition that Putin is not interested in ending the war and that his actions show disrespect for the U.S.</p>

Canada's defence minister emphasized the need to boost defence capacity due to global threats, particularly in the Arctic.

          <p>The European Commission is proposing a new strategy to increase EU influence in the Black Sea region, aiming to counter Russian influence through closer collaboration with neighboring countries. A key component of this strategy is the establishment of a "maritime security hub" to enhance situational awareness, information sharing, and early warning of potential threats. This hub would monitor critical undersea infrastructure and shipping, including those potentially helping Russia circumvent EU sanctions. The plan seeks to build on existing trade, energy, and transport cooperation, but details regarding the hub's location, participating countries, and financial resources remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Cassie Ventura, ex-girlfriend of Sean "Diddy" Combs, has given birth to her third child with husband Alex Fine. The news comes after Cassie provided testimony in Diddy's federal trial for sex crimes, where she made claims of abuse, including sexual assault. Cassie's testimony as "Victim 1" is considered crucial to the government's case. Diddy's defense lawyer introduced messages showing the rapper checking in on Cassie in 2019, a few months before Cassie confirmed she was pregnant at the time.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor is aiming for substantial growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), planning to increase their share of U.S. sales from 2.4% to roughly 20% by 2030. This strategy comes amid regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles, despite the company's ongoing investments in EV technology. Toyota believes PHEVs offer a practical steppingstone for consumers hesitant to fully commit to electric vehicles, while also helping automakers meet fuel economy and emissions standards. The company plans to expand its PHEV lineup, focusing on where it can build them and how they compare to competitors.</p>

This indicates that cats can discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar humans based on their odour, but it remains unclear whether they can identify specific individuals. The study also found that cat personality influences how they interact with odors.</p>
