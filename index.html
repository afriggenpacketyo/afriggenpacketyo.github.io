          <p>In Bristol, street sex workers are collaborating with the police and a charity initiative called Night Light to protect vulnerable children. These women, often present during the night, provide crucial information about child exploitation, aiding in the apprehension of child sexual abusers and identifying children at risk. They offer insights into the dangers underage girls face on the streets and report concerning behavior, such as men showing child abuse photos. This collaboration has proven vital, leading to arrests and safeguarding at-risk youth, fostering trust between sex workers and authorities, and empowering the women to prevent similar experiences for young people. The sex workers involved emphasize they are not bad people, but are helping to safeguard other girls. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom after Newsom proposed a federal film tax credit aimed at revitalizing the American film industry. Newsom's proposal followed Trump's announcement of potential tariffs on films produced outside the U.S. Trump blamed Newsom's "gross incompetence" for the industry's struggles and vowed to bring film production back to America. He also criticized California's High-Speed Rail project and briefly mentioned the January wildfires, claiming he provided water to California, while expressing a fondness for Newsom and challenging him to run for president.

          <p>In his first interview since leaving office, former President Joe Biden criticized Donald Trump's treatment of America's allies, particularly Ukraine's president, calling it "beneath America." Biden expressed "grave concerns" about the future of the Atlantic Alliance and the potential consequences of its weakening. He emphasized the importance of defending every inch of NATO territory and warned against actions that could lead European leaders to doubt America's commitment. Biden also addressed Trump's comments about acquiring Greenland and making Canada the 51st state, stating that it's not who America is and that America is about freedom, democracy, and opportunity.

          <p>Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economics professor, argues that President Trump's plan to weaken the dollar, as proposed by Stephen Miran, is based on a flawed diagnosis of the American economy. While the dollar's reserve-currency status plays a role in trade deficits, it is only one of many factors. Rogoff suggests that reducing the fiscal deficit would be a more straightforward fix than launching a trade war. He also points to the strength of the American economy as a key factor, making US businesses attractive to investors, and notes that even manufacturing has grown as a share of GDP.

The anniversary is used to reinforce the national idea of Russia as both victor and victim, with the official narrative portraying the war in Ukraine as a continuation of World War II, fighting against Nazism and fascism. This narrative is disseminated through television and iconography, linking historical and current conflicts, with the Russian word for "Victory" prominently displayed throughout the country.

          <p>Despite the war, Ukraine's economy has shown impressive resilience, underpinned by effective military resistance and strengthened state capacity. However, this resilience is built on a fundamental dependence on foreign financial assistance, as Ukraine lacks the domestic resources to meet the enormous costs of the war. While Russia's economy is often seen as successful, it is fundamentally dependent on fossil fuels. The recent minerals agreement with the United States, while seen as a victory for Ukraine, complicates the assessment, as it is on terms that are advantageous to the US and raises questions about the countryâ€™s basic dependency on its allies.

          <p>India launched strikes against Pakistan after a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir, intensifying hostilities between the two nations. The confrontation is the latest escalation of a decades-long conflict over Kashmir, a scenic valley in the Himalayas. The conflict began in 1947 when Britain divided India and left Kashmir's fate undecided, leading to wars in 1949, 1965, and 1999. In 2019, India stripped Kashmir of its partial autonomy, further escalating tensions.
