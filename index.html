        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing prisoner exchanges, Russia launched a significant barrage of drones and missiles across Ukraine, resulting in at least 12 deaths, including three children, and over 60 injuries. Ukrainian forces report neutralizing a substantial number of incoming projectiles, but strikes still impacted numerous regions, damaging residential buildings and enterprises. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as deliberate acts of terror against ordinary cities and called for stronger international pressure on Russia through sanctions. The attacks occurred as peace talks brokered by the U.S. remain stalled, with both sides accusing each other of undermining negotiations. The scale of the recent bombardments marks a notable escalation, even as prisoner exchanges continue. Optimism surrounding the situation is low given the circumstances.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir Alan Bates, a former subpostmaster and advocate for victims of the Post Office scandal, has criticized the government's compensation offer as inadequate, claiming it amounts to less than half of his claim. He accuses ministers of presiding over "quasi-kangaroo courts" and shifting the goalposts on judgements, despite promises of a non-legalistic approach. The Post Office scandal involved the wrongful prosecution of over 900 subpostmasters due to the faulty Horizon IT system, and while the government has set up a compensation fund, progress has been slow. The Department for Business and Trade maintains that it aims to give postmasters the benefit of the doubt and offers a review process for those unhappy with their offers. The situation continues to cause distress and frustration for those affected.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Kyodo News poll indicates that a significant portion of the Japanese population, specifically 44.7%, seeks rice prices lower than those pledged by the Prime Minister. This suggests public dissatisfaction with current rice pricing and expectations for more affordable options. The survey highlights the importance of rice in the Japanese diet and economy, making its pricing a sensitive issue for both consumers and producers. This sentiment underscores the challenges faced by the government in balancing agricultural policies and consumer needs. The situation reflects a need for potential adjustments in agricultural strategies to meet public demand.</p>

          <p>Following the first detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes, a Nottingham virologist, Prof Jonathan Ball, has urged the public to remain calm, while acknowledging the likelihood of mosquito-borne diseases increasing in range due to climate change. Fragments of the virus were found in a wetland in Retford, Nottinghamshire, prompting increased mosquito surveillance in the area. Prof Ball emphasized that while most infected individuals show mild symptoms, severe disease is possible in rare cases. He advises taking precautions against mosquito bites as a general trend of tropical viral diseases expanding northward is observed.</p>

Unions have raised concerns about potential outsourcing of staffing to private companies, while the opposition Conservatives are demanding that Labour deliver on its promises.

          <p>Despite a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, attacks continue, with Kyiv being hit again and three people dead in the Kyiv region. The exchange involved hundreds of prisoners from both sides and is expected to be the largest in over three years of war. However, the exchange has not led to a halt in fighting, with Russian forces continuing to launch missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities. The situation remains tense, with both sides far apart on key conditions for ending the conflict.</p>
