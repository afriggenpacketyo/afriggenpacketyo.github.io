            <p>A Russian ballistic missile strike on the northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy killed at least 24 people, including a child, and injured 84 others on Palm Sunday. Ukrainian officials reported that the missiles used cluster munitions, designed to maximize civilian casualties, and targeted residential buildings and educational institutions. President Zelenskyy condemned the attack as a deliberate act of terror and called for a strong international response, emphasizing that pressure on Russia is essential for achieving peace. The attack highlights the ongoing violence and disregard for civilian life amidst the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>

            <p>More than 100 civilians, including children and aid workers, have been killed in attacks on famine-hit camps in Sudan's Darfur region, specifically targeting the Zamzam and Abu Shouk camps near el-Fasher. Residents report dire conditions with widespread killings, closed routes, and a lack of medical assistance. Aid organization Relief International reported that nine of its workers were killed in the Zamzam camp, and they alleged the attacks were a targeted attempt to destroy health infrastructure. The attacks occurred on the eve of the second anniversary of the civil war between the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the army, exacerbating the already severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The US government quietly exempted smartphones from tariffs on goods entering the country from China, a move seen as a significant retreat in the trade war. This decision avoids a potential 125% tariff on iPhones manufactured in China, which would have drastically increased prices for American consumers. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who maintains strong relationships with both US and Chinese leaders, may play a key role in brokering future trade agreements. This policy shift signals a possible de-escalation in trade tensions, although existing tariffs related to fentanyl remain in place. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Vietnam, which previously benefited from the US-China trade war, now faces uncertainty due to President Trump's new tariffs, including a 46% tax on imports from Vietnam. The tariffs threaten to stifle the country's manufacturing boom and economic growth, potentially making Vietnamese-made products noncompetitive in the US market. Despite a temporary stay on the duties, companies are reconsidering investments, and the Vietnamese government is exploring ways to mitigate the impact, including cutting tariffs on American imports and offering incentives for local factories. The situation highlights the vulnerability of Vietnam's export-driven economy to shifts in global trade policies.</p>

            <p>The author draws parallels between Donald Trump and characters from Homer's 'Iliad,' ultimately concluding that Trump most closely resembles King Agamemnon. Agamemnon is portrayed as a brute who relies on intimidation, gloats when he wins, and blames others when things go wrong. The author argues that Trump, like Agamemnon, leads his followers on a grievance-fueled crusade and causes unnecessary suffering, even to those on whose behalf he fights. The essay explores other potential comparisons, including Achilles and Paris, but finds Agamemnon the most fitting analogue.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariff policies, including ending a duty-free exemption for low-priced goods from China and Hong Kong, could significantly increase the cost of fast fashion items from retailers like Shein. The de-minimis rule, which allowed packages under $800 to enter the US without taxes, is being targeted, potentially subjecting these goods to tariffs. Some companies are diversifying production outside of China or stocking more inventory in the US. The changes could lead consumers to consider alternatives like secondhand clothing, but the impact on the popularity of cheap goods remains uncertain.</p>

            <h2>Sarah Palin's Defamation Case Against 'New York Times' Heads to Retrial</h2>

            <p>Sarah Palin's defamation case against The New York Times is set for a retrial after a judge's misstep in the initial suit. The case stems from a 2017 Times editorial that Palin argued falsely linked her to the 2011 Tucson shooting. Despite losing the case twice in 2022, Palin has the opportunity to retry it due to jurors learning of the judge's ruling before completing deliberations. The retrial will examine the bounds of the First Amendment and whether Palin can prove the Times acted with actual malice.</p>

            <h2>Stewart Lee Reflects on Trump's Influence Through the Lens of 'Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid'</h2>

            <p>Stewart Lee uses Sam Peckinpah's 'Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid' to reflect on the current political climate under Donald Trump. He suggests that Billy the Kid represents American freedoms under attack from big business, while Pat Garrett embodies those who compromise their ideals for survival and wealth. Lee argues that American politics have become nakedly transactional, with Trump representing a new sheriff working for modern-day 'cattle barons'. He connects these themes to his own stand-up show, which he finds increasingly prescient as world events unfold.</p>

            <h2>Experts Weigh in on Potential Impact of SAVE Act on Married Women's Voting Rights</h2>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Legal experts are debating the potential impact of the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act on married women's voting rights, particularly those who have changed their last names. The act requires proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration, which could pose challenges for women whose birth certificates do not match their current names. Experts suggest states could ease this hurdle by accepting secondary documents like marriage certificates, but concerns remain about varying policies across states and the potential for disenfranchisement. The bill's ambiguity and the timing amidst competitive elections raise concerns about its overall impact on voter access.</p>

            <p>The situation in Gaza is described as a 'killing field' where people are being starved and subjected to endless violence. Despite evidence of war crimes and genocide, international support for Israel continues, while attempts to suppress free speech on Palestine have turned this into a domestic issue. The author argues that Israel's actions aim to rid Gaza of Palestinians and annex the West Bank, and that the world must acknowledge and condemn these atrocities. They express frustration at begging people to care about Palestinian suffering, emphasizing the need to continually raise voices against these actions.</p>

            <h2>Trump's Attacks on Law Firms May Chill Pro Bono Work on Unpopular Causes</h2>

            <p>President Trump's attacks on law firms are causing concern that they will curtail pro bono work on causes unpopular with his administration. The executive orders targeting law firms are seen as intimidation for representing people or causes at odds with Trump's views. This has led to fears that law firms may pull back from politically sensitive cases, potentially limiting challenges to government actions. Some organizations report that law firms have already declined to work with them, citing political ramifications.</p>

This decision follows criticism of Onana's performance in a recent Europa League match, where he was at fault for both goals conceded.

Separately, Newcastle manager Eddie Howe will miss the match due to being hospitalized.</p>
