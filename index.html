          <p>Chinese defense stocks have surged following escalating tensions between India and Pakistan, particularly after Pakistan's reported use of China-made weapons to down Indian jets. Pakistan's Foreign Minister claimed the deployment of Chinese J-10C fighter jets during a clash with India's air force. AVIC, the manufacturer of the J-10C fighter jets, witnessed its subsidiaries' stocks rising significantly, with AVIC Aerospace shares increasing over 6% and AVIC Chengdu Aircraft stocks surging as much as over 16%. This surge reflects the close military cooperation between China and Pakistan, with Pakistan being the largest buyer of Chinese arms, including fighter jets, air defense systems, naval vessels, and UAVs.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. has presented a somber forecast, projecting a decline of approximately one-fifth in its operating profit for the fiscal year ending in March. The automaker cited headwinds from a stronger yen and an estimated $1.3 billion hit from President Trump‚Äôs tariffs in April and May alone. The murkiness of Toyota‚Äôs forecast underscores how the whiplash of Mr. Trump‚Äôs tariff agenda is upheaving the auto industry and leaving many global companies unable to estimate future prospects. Economists and officials are concerned about the tariffs‚Äô broader potential impact on the Japanese economy, as automakers and their extensive network of parts suppliers form the backbone of industrial production in Japan.</p>

          <p>An avatar of the late author Agatha Christie is being used to teach an online writing course, raising ethical questions about the use of artificial intelligence to resurrect the dead. The course, offered by BBC Maestro, uses a digital prosthetic built with AI to represent Christie, drawing on her writings and archival interviews for the script. While Christie's family has approved the project, some ethicists argue that it's problematic to put words in the mouth of someone who cannot consent, even if based on their existing work. The use of AI to create the likeness of Christie raises concerns about the blurring of boundaries between fact and fiction.</p>

A senior British official confirmed the agreement, stating it would benefit both countries, although details remain unclear. The agreement, which could lower British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods and remove taxes on U.S. technology companies, would be a significant win for both nations seeking closer economic cooperation. The announcement follows Trump's earlier imposition of tariffs, which were later paused to allow for trade negotiations.</p>

The study also highlighted concerns about ongoing staff shortages at the National Weather Service and the increasing strain on insurance markets due to more frequent and severe weather events.

          <p>The EU's plan to phase out Russian gas, nuclear energy, and LNG imports by 2027 is facing opposition from eastern European nations, particularly Slovakia and Hungary. These countries, which maintain warm ties with Moscow, have described the EU's proposal as "economic suicide" and a threat to the region's energy security. They warn of higher energy prices for consumers as a result of banning Russian supplies. The European Commission announced plans on Tuesday to phase out Russian gas, nuclear energy and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports by the end of 2027, saying the move "paves the way to ensure the EU's full energy independence from Russia.</p>

Timpson, known for hiring ex-offenders, aims to rehabilitate offenders and reduce re-offending rates. The government has commissioned an independent sentencing review to explore alternatives to prison and examine the use of non-custodial sentences, including increased tagging, to ease overcrowding.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's has postponed its auction of sacred jewels linked to the Buddha's remains in Hong Kong after the Indian government threatened legal action. The sale of the Piprahwa Gems of the Historical Buddha Mauryan Empire had drawn criticism from Buddhist academics and monastic leaders, who deemed it offensive to the global Buddhist community. India argued that the relics constituted inalienable religious and cultural heritage and that their sale violated Indian and international laws.
