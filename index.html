          <p>A shooting at a University of New Mexico dormitory resulted in the death of a 14-year-old and injury to another individual. The incident occurred early Friday morning during a gathering of four people in a dorm room. New Mexico State Police have arrested and charged an 18-year-old suspect with first-degree murder and other offenses. The university has since reopened, offering counseling services to the community, which was shaken by the violence during a new student orientation period.</p>

          <p>Voters in Taiwan have rejected a large-scale recall effort aimed at unseating two dozen lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result ensures that the KMT and its allies will retain their majority bloc in the legislature, posing a continued challenge to President Lai Ching-te's ruling Democratic Progressive Party. This outcome from the unprecedented recall election signals potential legislative gridlock and difficulties for President Lai's agenda ahead of the 2028 elections. The failure of the recall solidifies the current political balance of power.</p>

          <p>Businesses combining laundromats with bars, sometimes called "laundrobars," are gaining attention as a way to make a mundane chore more enjoyable. While new locations have recently opened in Brooklyn, the concept has existed for decades in various parts of the country, offering amenities like beer, food, and arcade games. Owners find that the bar element attracts customers and transforms the experience, though they note the financial challenges of running such a hybrid business. These establishments often become community hubs, hosting events and supporting local charities.</p>

          <p>The Chinese military's procurement department has blacklisted the Aerospace Information Research Institute (AIR) for collusion and bid rigging, suspending it from participating in military procurement activities. This is the second time this year the institute, which is part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has been placed on such a suspension list. The AIR is a critical research body formed in 2019 that specializes in areas closely aligned with military needs, including remote sensing, aircraft design, and electronic countermeasures.

          <p>A routine pre-surgery scan unexpectedly revealed that Christopher Kennedy, a 68-year-old dog trainer, had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a terminal lung disease. As his condition worsened and medications failed, he was given less than a year to live before becoming a candidate for a double-lung transplant. Despite initial reservations and a difficult wait, the 75-year-old successfully underwent the procedure at the Cleveland Clinic and has recovered remarkably. Now with 98% lung capacity, he is training a new therapy dog named Encore to celebrate his new lease on life.</p>

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted Niger's democratically elected president, many analysts report that conditions in the country have deteriorated. The junta, which cited insecurity and economic hardship as justification, has overseen a period of increased job losses, particularly in the non-profit sector, and a crackdown on civil liberties. Human rights groups accuse the regime of suppressing dissent and arresting officials from the former government. With the coup leader sworn in for a five-year term, prospects for a return to civilian rule appear increasingly distant.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a growing problem of loneliness, particularly among its youth, a trend exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and social media. Studies show that one in five teenagers feels lonely, which can impact their academic performance and social development. Sociologists warn that this isolation may also make young people more susceptible to authoritarian thinking and conspiracy theories, posing a potential threat to democracy. The issue is not confined to urban areas, as research indicates that a lack of social opportunities in rural regions also increases the risk of loneliness.</p>

          <p>This article explores the cultural impact and subsequent fall from grace of music mogul Sean Combs, also known as Puff Daddy. For a generation growing up in the 1990s, Combs was a formidable ambassador of Black cool, blending music, fashion, and ambition into an influential aesthetic. He projected an image of hard-earned success and broke barriers by bringing street-inflected culture into mainstream luxury spaces. The author reflects on this inspirational image, contrasting it with the recent revelations of Combs's cruel and depraved behavior, which has curdled his legacy and left many who once admired him feeling betrayed.</p>

          <p>As climate change leads to hotter and more frequent heat waves, more people are forced to stay indoors, potentially contributing to a rise in summer seasonal affective disorder (SAD). While winter SAD is linked to a lack of sunlight, experts suggest that avoiding the sun and heat in summer could have analogous effects, leading to depression, low energy, and social isolation. Extreme heat itself is also associated with mood disorders, aggression, and disrupted sleep. This emerging mental health challenge highlights a difficult choice for many Americans: endure dangerous heat outside or face the psychological toll of being confined indoors.</p>

The author contrasts Trump's desire to be embraced as Scottish with the genuine spirit of the nation, personified by the late comedian Janey Godley, whose famous protest sign captured the rebellious humor of many Scots.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Columbia University's recent deal with the Trump administration marks a dark turn for American higher education. To restore its federal research funding, Columbia agreed to pay a $200 million fine and allow a Trump-approved monitor to review admissions and academic departments, concessions the author calls an "extortion scheme." The author contends that this capitulation, made under the threat of losing vital funding, ends the university's academic independence. It sets a dangerous precedent for other institutions, suggesting they will bend to political pressure rather than resist, undermining their integrity.</p>

          <p>While "eldest daughter syndrome" is a pop psychology term for the pressures felt by first-born girls, a new UCLA-led study suggests there may be a biological basis for it. The research found that when mothers experience high levels of prenatal stress, their first-born daughters tend to show signs of adrenal puberty earlier. This early maturation is believed to foster social and cognitive development, effectively creating a "helper-at-the-nest" for the mother. This effect was not observed in sons or later-born daughters, suggesting an adaptive evolutionary mechanism at play.</p>

          <p>While a growing number of couples are using credit cards to pay for their weddings, financial experts advise a strategic approach to avoid starting a marriage with significant debt. Using credit cards can be beneficial for earning rewards like points for a honeymoon, but only if the balance is paid off immediately with existing savings. With average wedding costs rising and high credit card interest rates, carrying a balance can lead to long-term financial stress. Experts suggest weighing vendor fees and considering wedding insurance for larger expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The decision by CBS to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in 2026 is sparking debate about the future of late-night television. While some see it as a financial move driven by industry-wide pressures like declining ad revenue and the high cost of production, others question the timing, noting it followed Colbert's criticism of a Paramount settlement with Donald Trump. The cancellation highlights the challenges facing traditional broadcast television as audiences and ad dollars shift. The industry will be watching closely as Disney negotiates the future of "Jimmy Kimmel Live," whose contract expires in 2026.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Wesleyan University President Michael Roth argues that the current political backlash against higher education is an orchestrated effort by the Trump administration to undermine civil society. He contends that by attacking high-profile universities, the administration seeks to delegitimize institutions that operate independently of its ideology. Roth acknowledges that universities have real problems, such as ideological narrowness among faculty and a focus on exclusivity, but insists these are not the cause of the assault. He defends the role of college in fostering discovery, critical thinking, and civic purpose.</p>
