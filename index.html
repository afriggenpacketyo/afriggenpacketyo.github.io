          <p>F.B.I. agents arrested Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan for allegedly obstructing justice by helping an undocumented immigrant evade federal immigration agents waiting to arrest him in her courtroom. Democratic leaders condemned the arrest, while Attorney General Pam Bondi defended it, asserting that it sends a strong message to judges that the Trump administration will prosecute them for obstructing justice. The arrest underscores the escalating tensions between the federal government and local officials over immigration enforcement and judicial independence.</p>

          <p>As the United States imposes trade tariffs, the anniversary of the Bandung Conference prompts reflection on international relations. The 1955 conference saw Asian and African nations uniting to advocate for a fairer global system, emphasizing economic and cultural cooperation, decolonization, and a rejection of Cold War bipolarization. The U.S. undermined the conference, pressuring countries to counter China's influence. Today, the Bandung Conference's principles could be a model for China to foster solidarity among like-minded nations amid current geopolitical challenges.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is demanding answers on whether a 2-year-old U.S. citizen from Louisiana was deported to Honduras along with her mother and 11-year-old sister. The judge expressed strong suspicion that the government deported a U.S. citizen without due process. The child's mother, sister, and the child were taken into custody during a routine check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The father filed for temporary custody to prevent the deportation, but ICE proceeded with the removal.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion at the Shahid Rajaee port in Iran resulted in at least 14 deaths and over 750 injuries, causing extensive damage to infrastructure. The blast, which blew out windows and destroyed cars, occurred after a fire broke out and spread to containers storing flammable materials.

          <p>The Trump administration's arrest of Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan is being viewed as an attempt to intimidate the judiciary. Attorney General Pam Bondi's comments suggest a broader message that judges who oppose the administration will be targeted. Critics argue that the prosecution undermines judicial independence and the separation of powers. While Dugan's actions are being scrutinized, the administration's motives are being questioned, with concerns raised about political interference in the justice system.</p>
