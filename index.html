          <p>A new report details the destructive rare earth mining practices in Myanmar's Kachin State, where Chinese companies use in-situ leaching, injecting chemicals into mountains to extract minerals vital for green technologies. Activists report deaths and severe environmental damage, including toxic leakage into rivers and health problems for unprotected workers. While a local independence organization has taken control of the region, they have not yet enforced more responsible mining, and activists are urging international oversight and engagement to ensure the benefits are shared with local populations. The rare earth trade is worth billions, and risks financing conflict and destruction in the region.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder sparked global protests, the Black Lives Matter movement faces disappointment as initial hopes for change remain largely unfulfilled, especially in the US. Despite increased awareness and some policy changes like bans on the knee-to-neck maneuver, many feel the country has failed to maintain a proactive interest in equality. The Trump administration's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, coupled with continued instances of police violence against Black people, contribute to this sentiment. However, some remain hopeful, emphasizing the resilience and survival skills of Black communities.</p>

While the UN insists it is doing all it can to stop the conflict, some citizens question the effectiveness of peacekeeping efforts. The UN Security Council must decide by May 31 whether to lift or maintain South Sudan's arms embargo.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a large drone and missile attack on Kyiv, injuring at least 17 people and damaging buildings, as a prisoner swap between Ukraine and Russia is set to continue. Russia fired 14 ballistic missiles and 250 drones, with Ukraine claiming to have shot down six missiles and 245 drones. Meanwhile, Ukraine alleges that Russian forces have executed over 150 captured Ukrainian soldiers since the start of the full-scale invasion. Despite the ongoing conflict, the exchange was prepared following bilateral peace talks in Istanbul last week.</p>
