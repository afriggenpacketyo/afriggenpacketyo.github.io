          <p>Puer, a region in China renowned for its fermented tea, is witnessing a shift as younger generations embrace coffee. Local growers are increasingly cultivating coffee beans to cater to the growing demand for espressos, lattes, and artisanal varieties. This diversification represents a modern twist on the region's traditional beverage industry, with families like the Lioas, who have been growing tea for generations, now venturing into coffee cultivation. The shift reflects a broader trend in China where younger consumers are exploring and appreciating the unique flavors of hand-drip coffee, moving away from mass-produced commercial options.</p>

          <p>Melody Farris was convicted of murdering her husband, Gary Farris, whose charred remains were found on their property in 2018. The investigation revealed a dysfunctional family dynamic, including Melody's affair and financial tensions.

The prosecution presented evidence of blood in the basement and suspicious online searches, while the defense suggested Scott, who was physically capable of moving Gary's body, had a financial motive.

          <p>Brian Fanion, a Massachusetts detective, was convicted of murdering his wife, Amy, after an investigation revealed suspicious web searches on his work computer. Eleven days before Amy's death, Fanion searched "gsr testing" (gunshot residue) despite not being assigned to any relevant investigations. Other searches included "household poisons" and "how to make a murder look like a suicide." The prosecution argued that these searches, combined with Fanion's affair and the lack of gunshot residue on Amy's wound, indicated premeditation, while the defense claimed the searches were related to household hazards and a TV show.</p>

While the two comedians have since reconciled, Kimmel's remarks stemmed from Leno's role in the "Tonight Show" debacle involving Conan O'Brien.

          <p>Donald Trump's job approval rating has reached a new low of 39% at his 100-day mark, the lowest of any president in the past 80 years, according to an ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll. The poll indicates widespread economic discontent and disapproval of many of Trump's policies. However, Trump maintains a lead over Democrats in Congress in terms of trust to handle the nation's main problems. The poll also reveals concerns about a potential recession and negative views on Trump's economic policies.</p>

          <p>Australia is contemplating capping the number of international students to address the country's unaffordable housing crisis.
