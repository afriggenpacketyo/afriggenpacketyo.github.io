          <p>San-ikukai Hospital in Tokyo has utilized its newly opened "baby hatch" for the first time, providing a safe and anonymous avenue for parents unable to care for their infants. The hospital, only the second in Japan to offer this service, aims to be a last resort for women facing unplanned pregnancies or isolated births, accepting babies up to four weeks old. Staff attend to the infants within one minute of their arrival, after which the hospital notifies a child welfare center. The Tokyo government has established a specialized committee to monitor the baby hatch operation. Optimism Score: 60</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her first major speech since losing the 2024 election, criticizing the Trump administration's policies and warning of a potential constitutional crisis. Speaking at an Emerge America event in San Francisco, Harris accused Trump of abandoning American ideals and implementing a narrow, self-serving vision. She specifically targeted Trump's trade war, calling it the "greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history," and criticized his immigration policies, particularly the deportation of American citizens without due process. Harris called on Americans to stand together and resist the administration's agenda, but stopped short of announcing any future political plans. Optimism Score: 40</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the changing dynamics in Asia, particularly the decline of American influence and the rise of China. The article uses the backdrop of the 50th anniversary of the American withdrawal from Vietnam to explore how countries in the region are adapting to a new reality where China plays a more dominant role. It highlights instances where China has stepped in to fill the void left by the U.S., such as providing aid to Myanmar and modernizing a military base in Cambodia. The article also touches on the enduring appeal of American ideals and the complex feelings of countries that still seek American support despite China's growing presence. Optimism Score: 50</p>

Despite a midseason trade to acquire Doncic, the Lakers struggled throughout the series, failing to capitalize on Minnesota's missed shots and ultimately losing in the first round for the second consecutive year.

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has revised down its economic and inflation projections for the current fiscal year, citing concerns over the impact of U.S. tariffs on the global economy. The central bank now expects the Japanese economy to grow by 0.5 percent, down from its previous forecast of 1.1 percent, and core consumer prices are projected to rise by 2.2 percent, lower than the earlier projection of 2.4 percent. Despite these concerns, the BOJ has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate steady at around 0.5 percent, maintaining its commitment to achieving sustainable 2 percent inflation.

          <p>European auto giants are reporting a sharp decline in first-quarter profits, with several suspending or cutting their full-year financial guidance, attributing the industry's woes to President Trump's trade tariffs. Stellantis, Mercedes, and Volvo Cars have all taken measures to address the tariff-related uncertainties, such as withdrawing financial guidance, cutting costs, and adjusting production plans. While Trump's recent move to ease car tariffs provides partial relief, analysts warn that the fast-changing nature of these tariffs will likely keep long-term corporate investment decisions at bay. Volkswagen, however, expects to meet its annual forecasts but at the bottom end, citing increasing trade restrictions and political uncertainty. Optimism Score: 45</p>

Researchers have received numerous reports from the public of nuisance biting, initially suspected to be midges or clegs, but further analysis showed the areas were swarming with mosquitoes. The insects are most often spotted in woodland areas, particularly pine forests in the east, though they are often found inland in our biggest cities. Optimism Score: 65</p>

          <p>This New York Times guest essay argues that the United States military lacks the personnel and materiel needed to fight a major war. The authors, Mackenzie Eaglen and Brady Africk, contend that the U.S. has traded a larger, more durable military force for one that is high-tech but brittle. They cite the war in Ukraine, Israel's battles in the Middle East, and U.S. operations against the Houthis in Yemen as examples of modern conflicts that require both advanced systems and sheer volume of munitions. The authors call on President Trump to refocus the Pentagon and ensure the military has the resources to endure and win a large-scale war. Optimism Score: 40</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the agreement signals a commitment to a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine.

          <p>Several individuals who fled authoritarian regimes are expressing concerns about the tactics employed by the Trump administration, drawing parallels to the methods used in their home countries. These concerns range from government agents aggressively questioning people returning to America to pressure on universities and attacks on news organizations. While some immigrants believe Trump is being unfairly targeted, others, like a professor who grew up in Turkey, feel a chilling effect on free expression and academic freedom. Journalist Maria Ressa, who faced attacks from the former president of the Philippines, emphasizes the importance of resisting fear and defending one's rights. Optimism Score: 40</p>

          <p>Japan's central bank held its policy rate at 0.5% for a second straight meeting, as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs weigh on the outlook for the country's economy.

The central bank highlighted that it will continue to raise its policy rate "if our economic and price forecasts are realised," but also flagged that Japan's growth is likely to moderate due to a slowdown in other economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits.
