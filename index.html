          <h2>EHRC Releases Interim Guidance on Single-Sex Spaces Interpretation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-26 12:13:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has issued interim guidance clarifying the UK Supreme Court's ruling that defines 'woman' and 'sex' as biological in the 2010 Equality Act. This guidance addresses how organizations should interpret the ruling, particularly concerning single-sex spaces. According to the EHRC, trans women (biological men) can be excluded from women-only spaces like hospitals and schools, while ensuring trans people are not left without any facilities. The commission plans to launch a consultation to seek views from stakeholders and provide an updated code of practice to the government by the end of June.</p>

          <p>A special tribunal has been established to prosecute Russia's alleged crimes in Ukraine, but its effective functioning faces significant hurdles. While the tribunal can investigate Russian leaders, including President Vladimir Putin, he cannot be prosecuted while in office due to head-of-state immunity. The tribunal's jurisdiction and the scope of its investigations are still being defined, with disagreements over whether to include events prior to the full-scale invasion in 2022. Political will and support from key nations are also uncertain, potentially delaying or derailing the tribunal's progress.</p>

          <p>A significant explosion at the Shahid Rajaee port, a key commercial hub in Iran, resulted in multiple fatalities and hundreds of injuries. The blast, suspected to be caused by flammable materials, led to widespread damage and fires that crews are working to extinguish. While Iranian officials are investigating the incident, some analysts suggest the explosion may be linked to a shipment of solid fuel for ballistic missiles. The incident occurred during ongoing nuclear talks between Iranian and U.S. officials in Oman.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is advocating for the proper disposal of prescription medications, warning against flushing them down the toilet. While the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) offers free drop-off sites, Kennedy emphasizes that flushing medications can contaminate water systems, potentially exposing people to harmful substances. Although some medications, like certain opioids, are safe to flush according to the FDA, most should be disposed of at designated take-back locations to prevent misuse and protect public health. The DEA sees National Prescription Drug Take Back Day as a way to prevent "medication misuse and opioid addiction from ever starting."</p>

          <p>David F. Sandberg's "Until Dawn," based on a PlayStation game, is a meta-horror film that blends horror tropes with video game mechanics. A group of young adults arrives at a remote cabin in the woods, only to find themselves in a time loop where they must die repeatedly to find a way to survive the night. The film is self-referential, combining familiar horror elements with unexpected twists and turns.

The phrase can teach children to doubt their own emotions, invalidate their experiences, and short-circuit emotional processing.

This can rewire a child’s stress response, making it harder to trust, regulate, and feel safe being fully themselves.</p>

          <p>Residents of New Orleans' Ninth Ward fear that a proposed port development could destroy the area's post-Katrina renaissance. The project, involving a grain terminal, raises concerns about noise, traffic, safety, and property devaluation. Residents worry that the industrial project could annihilate a vital bohemian enclave of the arts. The community has a history of resilience, having rebuilt after Hurricane Katrina, and they are now fighting to protect their neighborhood from industrial encroachment.</p>

          <p>Project 2025, a vast far-right plan for a second Trump administration, guides the attack on government. The plan aims to reshape America and reframe the government's relationship with every American. The project is focused on illegal immigration, but also on legal immigration and the point is to have fewer people who are born overseas in the US, by whatever means necessary. The project also advocates for mass deportation, detention centers, reducing the number of visas, and finding people who lied on their citizenship applications, to revoke citizenship, denaturalization.</p>
