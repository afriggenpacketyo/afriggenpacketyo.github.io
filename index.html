          <p>With a record number of foreign nationals residing in Japan, foreigner associations are urging Japanese politicians and the public to recognize their contributions beyond just labor. At a recent event in Tokyo, panelists discussed issues related to education, diversity, and policy-making, highlighting the need for clear immigration policies and forums for foreign residents' voices to be heard. Concerns were raised about the lack of relevant parties involved in immigration policy, and the need to protect the religious needs of foreign residents, particularly those in the technical internship program. The Japanese government has outlined a roadmap for harmonious coexistence, but some argue it lacks a clear vision for the future of immigration.</p>

          <p>The president of the US-China Business Council suggests the United States may overestimate its leverage in tariff negotiations with China, indicating that Beijing has been preparing for this situation since 2018. According to the president, China is not as desperate for a deal as the White House might believe and views the US tariff policy as part of a broader strategy to contain China's growth. The comments come after President Trump suggested he was considering slashing tariffs on China, a claim Chinese officials have dismissed as "fake news."</p>
