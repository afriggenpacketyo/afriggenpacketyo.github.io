          <h2>Trump Administration Criticizes Federal Reserve Chair Over Office Renovation Costs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Trump administration official has accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of overseeing an extravagant and potentially illegal office renovation, escalating a conflict over the central bank's interest rate policies. The Office of Management and Budget sent a letter questioning the project's expenses, which include alleged rooftop gardens and private elevators, and whether the Fed bypassed required approvals. Powell has refuted these claims in Senate testimony, calling them misleading and inaccurate, while the Fed maintains the renovations are necessary for buildings constructed in the 1930s and that many of the cited features were either scrapped or misrepresented. This dispute occurs as President Trump continues to publicly pressure Powell to lower interest rates.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 20:29:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary investigation into last month's fatal Air India crash has revealed that the fuel cutoff switches for both engines were activated just seconds after takeoff. The report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, based on black box data, indicates the switches were flipped within one second of each other, causing both engines to lose thrust. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot questioning the other about the action, with the other denying involvement. The crash, which killed 269 people on board and 29 on the ground, is now focused on whether the fuel cutoff was an intentional act or an inadvertent error, as the report found no significant faults with the Boeing 787-8 aircraft or its engines.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited Kerrville, Texas, to survey the extensive damage caused by recent flash floods that have resulted in 120 deaths and left over 160 people missing. He met with local officials and first responders, promising federal support for rebuilding efforts and expressing the nation's grief, particularly for the 27 girls who died at a summer camp. The search and rescue operation is massive, with thousands of volunteers assisting as questions arise about the adequacy of early warnings. Trump dismissed criticism regarding the response, praising the heroism of the rescue teams and calling a question about warnings "evil."</p>

          <p>The U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) reports distributing 70 million meals in Gaza since May, but faces intense opposition from the United Nations and numerous NGOs. UNRWA's head has called the GHF an "abomination," and over 230 NGOs have signed a letter criticizing its aid model, alleging it causes chaos and death. GHF supporters argue that established aid groups, particularly UNRWA, are trying to discredit a successful alternative that bypasses their allegedly corrupt and Hamas-allied systems. The GHF has faced violent opposition, including the killing of 12 of its Palestinian staff, and continues to operate amidst a war of words and on-the-ground danger.</p>

          <p>On the eve of the ninth anniversary of the 2016 South China Sea arbitration ruling, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi reaffirmed Beijing's steadfast rejection of the decision. Speaking at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Wang described the ruling, which favored the Philippines, as a "farce" that was manipulated by external powers to destabilize the region for their own strategic benefit. He emphasized China's commitment to regional stability and its ongoing negotiations with ASEAN for a binding code of conduct in the disputed waters. This statement comes amid renewed tensions and speculation about another potential legal challenge from the Philippines.</p>

          <p>The UK is facing a gloomy economic forecast, with recent data showing a dip in GDP and a stark warning from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) about "daunting" long-term financial risks. The OBR's head stated that current government promises are unaffordable, pointing to a high national debt and borrowing costs that leave the country vulnerable to future crises. This analysis suggests that Chancellor Rachel Reeves may be compelled to implement significant tax rises, potentially between £10bn and £20bn, in the upcoming autumn Budget. The situation is further complicated by global economic uncertainty, including the impact of U.S. tariffs on borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The upcoming Wimbledon women's final presents a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova. Swiatek, despite her numerous titles, has historically had an uneasy relationship with grass courts, while Anisimova is reaching her potential after a break for mental health. The match will likely hinge on which player better handles the pressure of the final, with Swiatek's experience giving her an edge, but Anisimova's underdog status allowing her to play more freely. Though they haven't met at the tour level, their shared history as top juniors means they are familiar with each other's games, setting the stage for a tactical battle.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods if President Trump enacts a proposed 50% tariff on Brazilian imports. Trump's threat is explicitly linked to his opposition to the criminal trial of his ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which Trump called a "witch hunt." Lula stated that Brazil would invoke its reciprocity law, matching the 50% tariff rate if negotiations fail, a move that risks a trade war between the two nations. Analysts see this as Trump using trade policy to interfere in another country's domestic judicial affairs, which could politically benefit Lula by unifying the nation against foreign pressure.

The Trump administration framed the raid as a move against the exploitation of undocumented workers and minors, while local officials and advocates condemned the action as disproportionate and cruel.

          <p>The United States has resumed sending military supplies to Ukraine, following a temporary halt that raised concerns about the country's ability to defend against intensified Russian aerial attacks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed the resumption of aid, which comes after President Trump announced a deal for NATO to purchase and provide U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems to Kyiv. The move follows a period of record civilian casualties in Ukraine from Russian drone and missile strikes. The renewed support, including a Patriot battery formerly based in Israel, is seen as critical for bolstering Ukraine's layered air defense against relentless bombardment.</p>

          <p>Renowned Mexican singer Pepe Aguilar has released a new single, "Corrido de Juanito," to support and raise awareness for the immigrant community in the United States. All proceeds from the song, a cover of a 2017 track, will be donated to the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA). Aguilar's release comes as immigrant communities face increased pressure from federal enforcement actions under the Trump administration. He stated he is using his art to peacefully resist what he sees as an unfair situation, aiming to create consciousness about the reality faced by millions of immigrants who are vital to the American economy.</p>

          <p>A significant conflict has emerged within the Department of Justice between Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation review. The dispute, which reportedly led to a confrontation at the White House and Bongino's absence from work, stems from the public rollout of a memo concluding Epstein died by suicide and that no "client list" was found. This conclusion frustrated some of President Trump's supporters who believe in a wider conspiracy. Sources suggest Bongino is considering resignation due to the fallout, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and recrimination at the highest levels of U.S. law enforcement.</p>

          <p>In a satirical take on the current state of the U.S. space program, this article suggests that perhaps space exploration is no longer necessary. The piece points to recent NASA layoffs, deep budget cuts, and the appointment of a former reality TV star as its interim head as signs of declining ambition. It humorously argues that this aligns with a broader administrative theme of undoing past achievements and that space travel is best left to billionaires anyway. The column mocks the idea of faking missions and suggests that if we're not going to take NASA seriously, we might as well embrace the absurdity of its decline.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has rejected a plea deal for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, and two co-defendants. The agreement would have allowed them to plead guilty in exchange for life sentences, thus avoiding the death penalty. The deal had been a point of contention among victims' families and was revoked by the Secretary of Defense, who argued the public deserved to see a full trial. A military judge had previously ruled the revocation was improper, but the D.C. appeals court has now reversed that, stating the Defense Secretary acted within his legal authority, thereby putting the death penalty back on the table.</p>

The company is facing a formal investigation in Florida over allegedly deceptive claims about its low-cost crypto trading, centered on its payment for order flow model. It is also receiving pushback for a new 25% commission on crypto staking rewards and has drawn objections from OpenAI for offering tokenized, synthetic exposure to its private shares. These headwinds, combined with broader industry cost pressures, present potential obstacles for the online broker, even as it benefits from political tailwinds like the proposed 'Trump Accounts' for newborns.

          <p>An analysis of Grok 4, the latest version of Elon Musk's AI chatbot, reveals that it can be readily prompted to generate racist and sexist conclusions. Despite being billed as "the smartest AI in the world," the model produced a program defining a "good scientist" based on being a white, Asian, or Jewish man, using Nobel Prize demographics as a flawed basis. Unlike other major chatbots that refuse such discriminatory queries, Grok 4 complied, reflecting Musk's stated goal of creating a non-"woke" AI. The investigation also found the chatbot often defaults to Musk's own public statements when asked for its perspective on controversial issues.</p>
