          <p>Following a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, former President Donald Trump announced he has started arranging a potential meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump stated that after this bilateral meeting, he would join both leaders for trilateral talks, calling it a positive first step in resolving the nearly four-year-long war. While Zelenskyy expressed readiness for such a meeting, the Kremlin's response was noncommittal, only acknowledging a discussion about increasing the level of representatives in existing negotiations. This development follows previous unsuccessful attempts to bring the two leaders together for direct talks.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have indicted thirty alleged members and leaders of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua in Colorado on severe charges including murder-for-hire, drug trafficking, and firearms offenses. The indictment follows a nine-month investigation and details a plot to kill two individuals for $15,000, with an extra $5,000 for returning their severed heads as proof. During the operation, law enforcement recovered 69 firearms, some linked to violent crimes in the Denver and Aurora areas. Officials stated that the arrests have disrupted a dangerous cycle of violence and led to a significant reduction in calls for service in the affected community.</p>

          <p>The trial for Hernandez Govan, the man accused of organizing the 2021 murder of Memphis rapper Young Dolph, began this week. Prosecutors allege that Govan, 45, directed the two shooters who ambushed and killed the 36-year-old artist at a local bakery. The state's key witness is Cornelius Smith Jr., one of the admitted gunmen, who testified that Govan hired him for the killing as part of a larger conflict involving another local music figure. Govan's defense is attempting to discredit Smith, portraying him as an unreliable witness seeking a lighter sentence for his own charges.</p>

          <p>A coalition of twenty states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department for imposing new immigration enforcement conditions on federal grants for crime victims. The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration is illegally forcing states to choose between forfeiting crucial funding for services like emergency shelters and domestic abuse hotlines, or complying with unlawful demands to assist federal immigration agents. The states, which collectively receive over $500 million annually from these grants, contend the new rule undermines trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities, ultimately harming public safety.</p>

          <p>Just before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's scheduled meeting with President Trump, Russia launched a wave of overnight airstrikes on multiple Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odesa. Ukrainian officials reported that a drone attack on a residential building in Kharkiv killed seven people, including a toddler and a teenager, with dozens more injured across the country. Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as a cynical and demonstrative act by Russia, intended to exert pressure and undermine diplomatic efforts. The strikes highlight the brutal reality of the ongoing conflict as leaders convene in Washington to discuss potential paths to peace.</p>

          <p>At least five states, including Mississippi, Louisiana, and West Virginia, are deploying National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to support the Trump administration's federal crackdown on crime and homelessness. This move follows President Trump's executive order that federalized local police forces and activated the D.C. National Guard. The deployment of outside troops is seen as an exercise of tighter federal control over the city, which the administration justifies as an emergency response, though local officials note that violent crime is lower than during Trump's first term. The presence of armed troops has drawn protests and criticism from some who view it as a military occupation.</p>

          <p>The opening of Camp East Montana, a new large-scale migrant detention center at Fort Bliss, Texas, has been met with protests from immigration advocates. The facility, which can currently hold 1,000 migrants and may expand to 5,000, is part of the Trump administration's effort to increase detention capacity for mass deportations. Critics, including Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar, argue the funds could be better spent on community services and that detainees may lack proper access to legal counsel. In contrast, administration officials and supporters like Republican Sen. John Cornyn assert that the facility is necessary for holding individuals who have no legal right to be in the country.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could serve as an opportunity to geographically realign the sport, potentially doing away with the traditional American and National Leagues in favor of Eastern and Western Conferences. Manfred suggested that such a change would reduce travel wear and tear on players and create more appealing postseason broadcast schedules. While the idea could face pushback from traditionalists concerned about competitive balance and the loss of historic rivalries, it could also foster new regional rivalries.

However, legal experts argue that the president lacks the constitutional authority to regulate state-run elections, as that power resides with Congress and the states themselves.

The new legislation, which now heads to the governor's desk, mandates that homeowners will be guaranteed at least 2% interest on these funds, closing a loophole and providing additional financial support during their recovery process.

          <p>The union representing over 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants is continuing its strike, defying a ruling from the Canada Industrial Relations Board that deemed the job action illegal and ordered them back to work. The strike, now in its third day, has caused the cancellation of hundreds of flights, stranding tens of thousands of passengers during a peak travel period. Union leaders have stated they are willing to face penalties, including fines and jail time, and will only end the strike through a negotiated settlement. The dispute centers on demands for higher salaries and pay for ground time.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of the 2025 season, is projected to move north through the Atlantic, bringing life-threatening surf and rip currents to the U.S. East Coast this week. While the Category 4 storm is not expected to make landfall, its powerful winds and large size will generate dangerous ocean conditions from Florida to New England. Officials have issued storm surge watches and evacuation orders for parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks due to the risk of significant coastal flooding. The National Hurricane Center is urging the public to heed local warnings and stay out of the water.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that the average American worker's earnings have lagged behind the rise in the cost of living by 1.2 percentage points over the last four years. This gap highlights the ongoing financial strain on many households since the pandemic, with educators experiencing the largest deficit between pay growth and inflation. The analysis suggests that despite a dynamic labor market, many Americans' purchasing power has eroded, affecting their ability to save for emergencies and long-term goals, and contributing to widespread economic dissatisfaction.
