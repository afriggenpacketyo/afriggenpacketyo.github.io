          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called for a thorough examination of the entire Federal Reserve, questioning its overall success and mission effectiveness. This statement comes amid escalating tensions between the White House and the central bank, particularly concerning interest rate policies and reports of President Trump considering the dismissal of Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Bessent also criticized the Fed's handling of inflation and suggested that an easing of monetary policy may be warranted given the current economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are advising savers on critical missteps to avoid as high-yield certificates of deposit (CDs) from the 2023-2024 period begin to mature. A primary warning is against allowing CDs to automatically renew, as renewal rates are often significantly lower than the original promotional rates. Experts also caution against chasing the highest available rate without considering the term length, which could lock up funds needed sooner. Instead, they recommend reevaluating personal financial goals to align savings strategies with future needs, such as using a high-yield savings account for more liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates Pakistan is lagging in its readiness to implement artificial intelligence in public services, ranking behind regional neighbors like India and Bangladesh. While the country has a national AI policy, experts criticize it for lacking a comprehensive strategy and sufficient investment in education and upskilling the workforce. Concurrently, the lack of regulation has fueled a surge in low-quality, AI-generated 'slop' content on platforms like YouTube, raising concerns about misinformation. Despite these issues, some Pakistani entrepreneurs are successfully leveraging AI tools for economic opportunities, highlighting the technology's dual potential.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine have intensified their cross-border drone strikes, with both sides reporting record or near-record numbers of attacks ahead of potential ceasefire talks. Russia claimed to have downed over 100 Ukrainian drones in one night, causing disruptions at Moscow airports, while Ukraine reported intercepting a massive wave of Russian drones and missiles that caused casualties and damage in Kyiv and other regions. Amid the escalating conflict, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has called for new negotiations, and the Kremlin has acknowledged President Trump's efforts to facilitate a peaceful settlement, though no firm plans have been set.</p>

          <p>The China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has reported a significant breakthrough in uranium exploration, setting a new national depth record for discovering a sandstone-type uranium deposit. This type of deposit is considered highly valuable as it is typically larger and more cost-effective to mine compared to other sources like volcanic rock. The discovery underscores China's advancing technological capabilities in resource exploration. This development is crucial for the country, which is heavily reliant on uranium imports to fuel its nuclear power and weapons programs.</p>

Backed by major crypto investors, the firm plans to replicate MicroStrategy's successful bitcoin accumulation but will focus on ether, differentiating itself by generating yield through staking. The company's chairman highlighted that this approach makes ether a more productive asset than bitcoin, as staking provides a dividend-like return that current ether ETFs do not offer. This launch comes as institutional interest in ether grows, partly due to new regulatory clarity. (not investment advice)</p>

While Ishiba has vowed to remain in power, his government is now on shaky ground and could face a no-confidence vote.

While toddlers are often eager to help, parents may discourage them for efficiency's sake, inadvertently diminishing their enthusiasm.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of mid-July 2025, average mortgage rates are hovering around 6.75% for a 30-year loan and 5.95% for a 15-year loan, presenting challenges for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. Experts suggest that borrowers with strong credit profiles in the mid-to-high 700s are best positioned to secure favorable rates. To improve chances of qualification, financial advisors recommend paying bills on time, correcting credit report errors, and shopping around with multiple lenders. While rates are higher than in recent years, there is some optimism that they may stabilize if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old unlicensed driver, Cain Byrne, has been sentenced to over 11 years in jail for killing an 81-year-old pedestrian in a hit-and-run crash in South Yorkshire.

Byrne, who has numerous previous convictions for dangerous driving, fled the scene. The judge described him as having an 'utter disregard for the law' during sentencing.</p>

          <p>The price of gold, currently around $3,362 per ounce, is influenced by a complex interplay of economic factors, making it a key commodity for investors. Its value is largely driven by supply and demand, global economic conditions, and its traditional role as a hedge against inflation. During times of economic or geopolitical uncertainty, investors often turn to gold as a safe-haven asset, which can drive up its price. Other significant factors include interest rates, currency fluctuations, and the policies of central banks that hold large gold reserves. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union Commission has proposed a controversial policy shift that would condition development aid to African and other nations on their cooperation with migration enforcement, including deportations and border control. This move has been condemned by policy experts across Africa as coercive and neocolonial, undermining trust and partnership. Critics argue that the policy ignores the root causes of migration, such as poverty, conflict, and governance failures, some of which are exacerbated by European trade and foreign policies. They warn that using aid as a political weapon could damage long-term relations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A biologist explains that heart cancer is extremely rare primarily because adult heart cells divide very infrequently, a process that dramatically declines after age 20. Cancer arises from mutations that occur during cell division, so the low rate of division in heart cells provides fewer opportunities for such errors to occur. Additionally, the heart's protected location within the chest shields it from direct exposure to many carcinogens. While this resistance to cancer is beneficial, it also means the heart has a very limited ability to repair itself after injury or disease.</p>
