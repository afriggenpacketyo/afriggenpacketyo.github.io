          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 11:41:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point rate cut has substantially lowered mortgage costs, with 30-year fixed rates falling to 6.13%. This reduction translates to monthly savings of over $600 on a $1 million mortgage compared to earlier this year, potentially saving over $200,000 in interest over the loan's lifetime. Improved affordability expands purchasing power for homebuyers and offers attractive refinancing opportunities for current homeowners. Experts anticipate further rate cuts, suggesting continued favorable market conditions for qualified borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, has been removed as patron from three charities—Julia's House, Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, and the Children's Literacy Charity—after a 2011 email surfaced calling Jeffrey Epstein her "supreme friend." This contradicted her earlier public denunciation of Epstein as a "gigantic error of judgment." A spokesperson for the duchess stated the email was sent under duress due to Epstein's threats of defamation. The Teenage Cancer Trust, where she has been a patron for 35 years, is also reviewing her position.</p>

          <p>Pfizer announced its acquisition of weight loss drugmaker Metsera for up to $7.3 billion, including future payments, marking a significant push into the burgeoning obesity drug market. This move follows Pfizer's previous setbacks in developing its own obesity drug candidates due to safety concerns. Metsera brings a promising pipeline of oral and injectable treatments, including a potential once-monthly GLP-1 drug, which analysts estimate could generate over $5 billion in peak annual sales. The deal is expected to close by year-end, positioning Pfizer to compete with existing market leaders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When broiling fatty steaks, proper ventilation is crucial to manage smoke and prevent potential fire hazards, as rendered fat is highly flammable. This article emphasizes that high-fat cooking methods significantly increase particulate levels in the air, necessitating open windows or full extractor fans. Beyond safety, managing fat correctly allows it to baste the meat from within, imparting tenderness and depth of flavor. Techniques like patting the steak dry and generous seasoning contribute to optimizing the fat's contribution to the finished meal.</p>

The "ex parte" nature of the order, allowing censorship without hearing defendants, and its rapid enforcement by government agencies, sets a troubling precedent for pre-publication censorship. This article highlights fears that such rulings, including "Ashok Kumar" orders applicable to unnamed individuals, will have a chilling effect on investigative journalism.

          <p>China's crude oil imports from Russia decreased by 15.2% year-on-year in August, totaling 7.94 million tonnes. This article notes that this decline was largely offset by significant increases in imports from other partners, including a 50.4% jump from Brazil and a nearly 90-fold increase from Indonesia. Analysts are divided on whether the dip from Russia is a temporary fluctuation due to maintenance at key production sites or indicative of a broader trend in China's sourcing strategy. Overall, China's total crude oil imports remained steady.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's long-awaited Tesla Diner in Los Angeles, designed as a rest stop for EV owners, is critiqued for its "utterly mundane" dining experience despite its expensive, retro-futuristic aesthetic. This article reviews the establishment, noting its functional failures, such as a narrow spiral staircase, and the absence of promised features like robots and roller skates. The menu, featuring fancified yet unremarkable items like Wagyu chili, is deemed simultaneously over- and under-considered. The review concludes that the diner, much like Musk's political alignment with Trump, is a conservative, backward-looking vision of the future, primarily serving as an Instagram museum rather than a culinary innovation.</p>
