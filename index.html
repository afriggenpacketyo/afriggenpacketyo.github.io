          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter, appointed by George H.W. Bush, passed away peacefully at his home at the age of 85. Souter, despite being a Republican appointee, became a consistent member of the court's liberal wing, often frustrating Republicans with his alignment with liberal justices. He played a crucial role in decisions such as reaffirming Roe v. Wade and dissenting in Bush v. Gore. After retiring in 2009, Souter returned to New Hampshire but continued to serve on the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, leaving behind a legacy of judicial independence and intellectual rigor.</p>

          <p>David H. Souter, a Republican appointed to the Supreme Court by George H.W. Bush, died at 85, after a nearly two-decade tenure that saw him become a key member of the court's liberal wing, much to the disappointment of conservatives. Souter, a private individual who preferred books to Washington society, retired relatively early at 69, providing Barack Obama with a Supreme Court vacancy. The article emphasizes Souter's commitment to the Constitution as a living document and his belief in the judiciary's role in addressing social problems, which often put him at odds with conservative expectations, particularly in cases involving abortion rights and federalism.</p>

          <p>The United States has granted refugee status to 54 white Afrikaner South Africans, descendants of Dutch and French colonizers, who could arrive in Washington DC, following claims of racial discrimination. This move comes after Donald Trump's executive order prioritizing consideration for Afrikaners facing racial discrimination in South Africa, where significant wealth inequality persists between white and black populations. Affirmative action policies and high crime rates have fostered a sense of targeted racism among some white South Africans, a claim echoed by Trump and his advisors. The resettlement process was expedited, with the Department of Health and Human Services providing support for housing and basic needs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested he is considering reducing tariffs on Chinese goods to 80% from the current 145% ahead of key trade talks in Switzerland, though this rate remains significantly higher than tariffs in other recent trade agreements. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will be leading discussions with Chinese officials, aiming to achieve stability in trade relations that could form a foundation for future agreements. The current high tariffs have led to a decline in goods moving from China to the U.S., raising concerns about potential price increases and shortages. Trump emphasized the need for China to open its market to the USA for mutual benefit.</p>

          <p>President Trump referred to the U.S.-Canada border as an "artificially drawn line," suggesting it should be erased, which sparked debate about the border's historical and cultural significance. The border, largely following the 49th parallel, was established through treaties between the U.S. and Britain and shaped by considerations of fur trade and river systems. While technically man-made, the border has real-world consequences, affecting Indigenous territories and daily life for those living near it. Experts emphasize that dismissing the border as artificial downplays its complex history and importance to North American life.</p>

UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds emphasized the seriousness of the situation, stating that thousands of jobs in the automotive sector were at risk without the agreement, which has been hailed by JLR's chief executive as securing certainty for the industry and its workforce.</p>

          <p>While Chinese citizens celebrated the reported combat success of the J-10C fighter jet in the India-Pakistan conflict, Beijing has maintained a cautious stance, likely due to geopolitical considerations and military prudence. Pakistan claimed to have used the Chinese-made J-10C to shoot down Indian Rafale fighter jets, marking the J-10 family's first combat success. The Chinese government and official media have largely remained quiet, with the foreign ministry urging both sides to exercise restraint. China's restraint is partly due to its diplomatic relationship with both India and Pakistan, the latter being a key buyer of Chinese arms.</p>

Weighing 495 kilograms and measuring 1.17 meters in diameter, it poses a greater risk than average space debris, although the annual risk of injury from space debris remains low.
