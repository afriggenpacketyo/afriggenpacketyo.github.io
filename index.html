          <p>Israeli military operations in Gaza have resulted in at least 81 Palestinian deaths and over 400 injuries within a 24-hour period, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. One notable strike occurred near a stadium in Gaza City being used as a shelter for displaced individuals, leading to multiple fatalities, including children. Despite ongoing international efforts and calls for a truce, negotiations between Israel and Hamas remain deadlocked, with mediators struggling to broker a new deal. The continued violence underscores the difficulty in reaching a lasting peace agreement and brings the severe civilian toll of the conflict into sharp focus.</p>

The article details the family's six-year wait for justice, marked by legal delays, and their efforts to counter the hatred that led to their son's death by founding the "BlazeItForward" kindness movement. It recounts the night Blaze disappeared, the investigation that uncovered Woodward's ties to a violent extremist group, and the emotional trial.

          <p>France is significantly increasing its stake in satellite operator Eutelsat, positioning it as a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. The French state led a €1.35 billion investment, becoming the largest shareholder in an effort to bolster Europe's technological sovereignty in the space sector. However, experts express skepticism about Eutelsat's ability to match Starlink's scale, noting its LEO satellite constellation is less than a tenth the size of its American rival's. While Eutelsat may struggle in the mass market, it is well-positioned to serve security-sensitive and enterprise segments that prioritize European jurisdictional control. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quemoy Island, a territory administered by Taipei but located less than 10km from mainland China, serves as a unique case study in the cross-strait relationship. Once a heavily militarized front line, the island has transformed into a quiet community caught between two political systems. Despite its history as a symbol of Taipei's governance model, on-the-ground observations reveal the limitations of influence from both Beijing and Taipei. The island's 130,000 residents navigate a complex identity, highlighting the nuanced realities that exist beyond the broader geopolitical standoff between the two powers.</p>

          <p>In response to the perceived threat from Russia, five NATO countries bordering Russia or Belarus are withdrawing from the 1997 Ottawa Convention, which bans anti-personnel mines. Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland plan to restart production and deployment of land mines along their eastern borders as a key part of a new, formidable defensive strategy. This move aims to create a significant deterrent, but it is highly controversial due to the long-term danger mines pose to civilians, long after conflicts end. The plan signals a dramatic escalation in border security, creating what some are calling a new, explosive "Iron Curtain."</p>

          <p>Despite its international isolation, Afghanistan's Taliban government is eager to develop a tourism industry, welcoming a small but growing number of foreign visitors. Officials highlight the country's improved security since the end of the war as a key selling point, hoping that tourism revenue can help the poverty-stricken nation and strengthen its economy. While thousands of tourists visited last year, the ethics of visiting are debated, given the government's severe restrictions on women and girls. Some travelers believe their spending directly supports local people, not the regime, and offers a chance to see the country's reality firsthand.</p>

          <p>New regulations have gone into effect across France, banning smoking on all beaches, in public parks, and near schools and libraries. The move is part of a broader government strategy to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032 and protect children from the dangers of passive smoking, which causes thousands of deaths annually. The ban, which does not apply to e-cigarettes or the terraces of bars and restaurants, comes with potential fines up to €700.

The victim, Jay Hulme, reported the abuse to both the police and the church, but initially faced disbelief and inaction, with the Bishop of Leicester even accusing him of witchcraft. The stalker, Venessa Pinto, used anonymous online accounts to spread false and threatening allegations, including accusations of sexual assault against children. After a prolonged ordeal, Pinto was eventually convicted, and both the police and the diocese have since acknowledged their failings in the case.</p>

The measure advanced after intense negotiations secured the support of several Republican holdouts, narrowly passing 51-49. The legislation, which includes significant spending and tax cuts, now moves to a final debate and vote, though its passage remains uncertain due to narrow Republican majorities and Democratic opposition. The process highlights the deep policy divisions and challenges facing the administration's legislative agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fast-moving brush fire, named the Lake fire, broke out near Silverwood Lake in San Bernardino County, quickly growing to 478 acres and prompting mandatory evacuations. The blaze, which started late Saturday afternoon, forced over 100 people at the reservoir to flee, with some being evacuated by boaters and jet skiers to a safer location. Evacuation orders are in place for areas south of Highway 138, with warnings issued for regions to the north. Fire crews are battling the zero-percent-contained fire from the ground and air, with gusty winds expected to pose a challenge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave affects the UK, this article explains the "urban heat island effect," a phenomenon that causes cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. Dark surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain the sun's energy, while waste heat from vehicles and air conditioning further elevates temperatures. In contrast, rural areas benefit from the natural cooling effects of vegetation and water. This effect means urban populations are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, as rising global temperatures will make heatwaves in cities more frequent and intense.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved a $5 increase in general admission fees for the L.A. Zoo, set to take effect on July 1. The price hike is part of the city's effort to address a budget crisis for the upcoming fiscal year. Under the new rates, adult tickets will cost $27, children's tickets will be $22, and senior tickets will be $24. The decision follows concerns from the zoo's director that proposed budget cuts, including a reduction of 53 positions, would negatively impact zoo operations and the visitor experience.</p>
