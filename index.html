          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 05:02:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans residing in the United States. This ruling overturns a hold placed by a California judge that had kept TPS in place, allowing affected individuals to legally live and work in the country due to unsafe conditions in their home country. The Trump administration aims to terminate these protections and work permits by April 2025, earlier than the previously scheduled end date of October 2026. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the ruling, with lawyers for the TPS holders expressing shock at the decision's lack of reasoning and its significant humanitarian and economic impact.</p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion article argues that Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump share more similarities than differences, particularly in their ideological opposition to the political establishment. Both men are portrayed as outsiders who challenged the status quo, with Reagan opposing DÃ©tente with the Soviet Union and Trump embracing some Democratic policies. The article asserts that both presidents champion conservative ideas centered on the individual, such as tax cuts, a strong national defense, and pro-life stances. While trade may be a separating issue, the author contends that both leaders used tariffs when necessary to protect American interests. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has decided not to finalize a proposed rule that would have allowed Medicare and Medicaid to cover GLP-1 drugs for obesity treatment. Despite this, some states, such as South Carolina, are independently choosing to cover these expensive weight loss medications, though with stringent prerequisites. Access to these drugs remains limited for many due to high costs and rigorous approval processes, with South Carolina estimating only a small fraction of eligible beneficiaries will meet the requirements. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested that future coverage might be possible as costs decrease. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has reduced its five-year loan prime rate (LPR), a key reference for mortgage loans, by 10 basis points in an effort to stabilize its struggling property market. This move follows an earlier cut to the seven-day reverse repo rate and aims to boost domestic demand and ensure economic stability. However, analysts suggest that this moderate cut may not be sufficient to revive the property sector, which has been a persistent drag on the Chinese economy due to solvency issues among major real estate developers. The action comes amid heightened external risks during Donald Trumpâ€™s second presidency.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Trump administration's imposition of tariffs aimed at boosting U.S. manufacturing and raising revenue, collecting these tariffs effectively is proving difficult. Trade experts cite increased incentives for smuggling and transshipping, where businesses route products through third countries to evade taxes. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) faces understaffing and a lack of resources to screen imports effectively, particularly with the surge in low-value packages from Chinese e-commerce platforms. Business owners report filing trade complaints with little effect, highlighting the challenges in prosecuting trade fraud and the potential loss of revenue for the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>The NBA playoffs this year guarantee the end of a long-standing title drought for one of the remaining teams: the Indiana Pacers, Oklahoma City Thunder, Minnesota Timberwolves, or New York Knicks. Three of these teams have never won a title in their current city, while the Knicks haven't won since 1973. The absence of usual powerhouses like Steph Curry and LeBron James signals a shift towards a younger generation of stars, including Jalen Brunson, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Tyrese Haliburton, and Anthony Edwards. This wide-open competition marks a new era of parity in the NBA, with multiple teams vying for their first championship in decades.</p>

          <p>A Texas showerhead salesman conducted an online experiment to gauge consumer interest in a more expensive 'Made in the USA' version of his product following President Trump's tariffs on Asian imports. Despite over 25,000 website visitors, no one purchased the domestic version, highlighting the difficulty in competing with cheaper imports. The article also explores the struggles of existing U.S. manufacturers, who face challenges in sourcing parts and competing with overseas prices. While tariffs aim to encourage domestic manufacturing, the experiment suggests that consumer price sensitivity and the complexity of rebuilding domestic supply chains pose significant obstacles.</p>

          <p>Faced with the potential loss of contact with Voyager 1, NASA engineers successfully revived the spacecraft's primary roll thrusters after they had been dormant for two decades. The decision was made when the backup thrusters, used since 2004, showed signs of weakening due to fuel line residue. With the Deep Space Station 43 antenna scheduled to go offline for upgrades, engineers risked reactivating the primary thrusters, suspecting an electronics glitch had caused them to shut down initially. This successful remote fix ensures the antenna remains aligned with Earth, allowing Voyager 1 to continue its interstellar journey and potentially celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2027.</p>

Strogatz, a recent graduate, examines questions about love, romance, and friendships, using original music to enhance the storytelling. Small's experiences living through the AIDS epidemic and witnessing failed relationships shaped his perspective on love, leading him to prioritize friendships as his closest connections.

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest electric car battery maker, excluded U.S. onshore investors from its Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) due to increasing tensions between the United States and China. This exclusion marks a significant shift from previous IPOs, such as Alibaba's, and underscores the deepening financial decoupling between the two countries. CATL, labeled a Chinese military company by the Pentagon, faced pressure from U.S. lawmakers to deter Wall Street banks from participating in the listing. Despite these challenges, the IPO was successful, raising $4.6 billion, with major investors including Kuwait's sovereign wealth fund and Oaktree Capital Management.</p>

          <p>China is leveraging President Donald Trump's negative agenda in Latin America by offering financial support, infrastructure investments, and visa exemptions to several countries in the region. During the CELAC summit, China's President Xi Jinping presented China as a reliable partner, contrasting Trump's tariffs, aid cuts, and immigration restrictions. While China's economy is growing slower and the new credit line is smaller than in previous years, it allows China to project itself as a more trustworthy partner than Washington. Experts express concern over China's invitations to Latin American politicians to showcase its "model of governance."</p>

No passengers were injured, but the incident underscores the ongoing human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka, where 139 elephants have been killed by trains in the past 17 years.
