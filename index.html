          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 20:28:53 EDT</div>

          <p>Former President Trump has filed a $10 billion libel lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal's publisher, News Corp, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch. The suit alleges a recent article falsely claimed Trump sent a "bawdy" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which the former president has labeled a "FAKE." This legal action faces a high bar, as public figures must prove "actual malice" in defamation cases. The lawsuit comes amid pressure for more transparency on the Epstein case, with the Justice Department also moving to unseal related grand jury testimony.</p>

          <p>Shares of the fintech company Block, formerly known as Square, experienced a significant jump of over 10% after it was announced that the firm will join the S&P 500 index. The company is set to replace Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron. This inclusion often leads to a stock rally as index-tracking funds must purchase the new company's shares to rebalance their portfolios. Despite this positive development, Block's stock has underperformed this year, and the company has issued a cautious outlook citing challenging macroeconomic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>California Construction Industry Faces Labor Shortages Amid Heightened Immigration Enforcement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 20:20:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A general contractor in Los Angeles reports significant labor shortages in the construction industry, attributing the issue to workers' fears of increased immigration raids under the Trump administration. Many undocumented but highly skilled laborers are reportedly staying home, leading to project delays and increased costs for consumers. This shortage is particularly critical as thousands of homes need rebuilding after recent wildfires. A UCLA Anderson Forecast report corroborates these concerns, predicting that a rise in deportations will deplete the state's construction workforce and hinder housing production.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died from injuries sustained after being pulled into an active MRI machine at a medical facility in Westbury, New York. According to police, the man entered the MRI room wearing a large metallic chain around his neck, which caused the powerful magnet to draw him into the machine. He was transported to a hospital in critical condition and later succumbed to his injuries. An investigation into the incident is ongoing, highlighting the critical safety protocols required around MRI machines due to their strong magnetic fields.</p>

          <p>In an interview, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons confirmed the agency will use government data from programs like Medicaid to locate and arrest undocumented immigrants.

He also addressed the controversial practice of ICE agents wearing masks during operations, defending it as a safety measure for officers despite concerns about impersonation. Lyons attributed a more than 800% increase in attacks on ICE agents to the agency's heightened visibility and the political climate surrounding immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Following a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) for President Trump, medical experts have provided context on the common condition. CVI occurs when veins, particularly in the legs, struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool and lead to swelling and discomfort. The White House physician described the president's case as "benign and common," especially in older adults, and confirmed no other serious cardiovascular issues were found. Treatment for CVI often involves lifestyle changes like compression, elevation, and exercise, with more serious cases potentially requiring minimally invasive procedures.</p>

Despite their unpopularity, this article notes that wasps are vital apex predators in the ecosystem, acting as natural pest controllers.

Influential MAGA figures continue to demand more information, believing powerful elites are being protected. This dynamic illustrates the difficulty Trump faces in managing the conspiratorial elements of his movement, especially after his administration's report downplayed the existence of further explosive revelations.</p>

          <h2>Northern Ireland to Offer RSV Vaccine to Premature Babies</h2>

          <p>A vaccination program in Northern Ireland for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) will be extended to include premature babies starting this autumn. A long-acting injection, Nirsevimab, will be offered to infants born too prematurely to have benefited from the RSV vaccine given to their mothers during pregnancy. RSV is a common and highly infectious virus that can cause severe respiratory illness, and it is a leading cause of hospitalization in infants. Health officials stated the new program will strengthen the health service's winter preparedness and protect a particularly vulnerable group of children.</p>

          <p>This article revisits a remarkable event from 2005, when a 12-year-old Ethiopian girl was rescued from kidnappers by a pride of lions. The girl had been taken by men intending to force her into marriage and was missing for a week. According to reports from the time, three lions chased the captors away and then "stood guard" over the girl until she was found by police. A wildlife expert suggested the girl's whimpering may have been mistaken by the lions for the sound of a cub, preventing them from attacking her. The incident is remembered as a "miracle" in the region.</p>

          <p>The announcement that "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" will end in 2026 has sent shockwaves through the television industry, fueling debate about the viability of the traditional late-night talk show format. While CBS cited financial pressures, the move has drawn scrutiny for its timing, coming days after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount's legal settlement with President Trump. The article analyzes the multiple challenges facing the genre, including shrinking audiences, declining ad revenue, and the rise of social media clips that cannibalize live viewership, questioning if the format can survive in the modern media landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has identified a potential trigger for ulcerative colitis, finding that an interaction between certain gut bacteria and a specific gene variant can provoke an overactive immune response. Researchers found that in people with a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene, the immune system fails to regulate a protein called STING, leading to chronic inflammation when exposed to a molecule produced by some gut microbes. This discovery helps explain the unpredictable nature of the disease and why treatments vary in effectiveness. The findings could pave the way for more precise, personalized therapies for the inflammatory bowel disease.</p>

          <p>Golfer Shane Lowry expressed disappointment after receiving a two-stroke penalty during the second round of The Open for a rules violation he claims he did not see. Officials determined that his ball moved after his club touched foliage during a practice swing in the rough on the 12th hole. Lowry stated he was looking at the ball and did not see it move, but accepted the penalty to protect his reputation. The R&A, the sport's governing body, issued a statement explaining that the movement was discernible on video and that the player's own vision is not the deciding factor in such a ruling.</p>

          <p>Public broadcasters like NPR and PBS are facing a severe financial crisis after Congress passed a bill to rescind $1.1 billion in previously allocated federal funding. The cuts, part of a larger package targeting foreign aid, are expected to force many smaller, rural stations to reduce programming or even shut down entirely. Media leaders and figures like filmmaker Ken Burns warned the impact will be devastating, particularly in communities that rely on public media for local news and emergency alerts. The move fulfills a long-term goal of some conservatives who view the organizations as having a left-leaning bias.</p>

          <p>This article provides an inside look at the White House's struggle to manage the political fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein case. Initially, President Trump was reportedly frustrated and felt betrayed by his MAGA supporters for not accepting his declarations that the case was baseless, resisting calls for more action. However, his strategy shifted abruptly after The Wall Street Journal published a story about an alleged "bawdy" letter from Trump to Epstein. This prompted Trump to reverse course and order the Justice Department to seek the unsealing of grand jury testimony, seemingly to regain control of the narrative and redirect his base's anger toward the media.</p>
