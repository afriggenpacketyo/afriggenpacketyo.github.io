          <p>Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve has been suspended for one WNBA playoff game and fined due to her aggressive behavior and critical comments towards officials after a recent loss to the Phoenix Mercury. The league detailed her actions, which included aggressively pursuing and verbally abusing a game official, failing to leave the court promptly after ejection, making inappropriate comments to fans, and delivering remarks in a post-game press conference. Reeve specifically criticized the officiating crew as "f***ing malpractice" after a controversial play where star player Napheesa Collier was injured. This unprecedented playoff suspension for a WNBA coach underscores broader league-wide concerns about officiating consistency, as other coaches and the commissioner have also addressed these issues.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel accused former Director Christopher Wray of lying to Congress regarding the deployment of 274 plainclothes agents at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Patel clarified that these agents were sent for crowd control *after* the riot began, a role he deemed against FBI standards and a failure of "corrupt leadership." He emphasized a commitment to transparency, suggesting that agents coming forward are now revealing the truth about the events. Former President Trump also weighed in, alleging the agents acted as "agitators and insurrectionists," while a Justice Department Inspector General report previously found no evidence of undercover agents inciting violence.</p>

          <p>The European Ryder Cup team established a commanding 11½–4½ lead over the United States, requiring only two and a half more points from 12 singles matches for retention. This historic lead marks Europe's largest ever before the singles matches, reflecting a dominant performance against an American side struggling with leadership and form. The day was also marred by "thuggish, moronic, and personal insults" from American galleries directed at European players like Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, prompting security intervention. Despite the unsportsmanlike conduct from some fans, Europe's pragmatic captain Luke Donald remains cautious, acknowledging the strength of the US team.</p>

          <p>President Trump directed the deployment of federal troops to Portland, Oregon, and other ICE facilities, authorizing "Full Force" against perceived threats from "antifa" and "domestic terrorists." Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Portland officials vehemently rejected the order, stating there was "no need for military troops" and calling it a "threat to communities across Oregon." Attorney General Pam Bondi also announced the deployment of DOJ agents to safeguard ICE facilities and arrest individuals engaged in federal crimes, citing "onslaught of violence." This move follows a presidential memorandum targeting "domestic terrorism" and comes amidst clashes at ICE centers in Chicago and Dallas.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler experienced an unprecedented slump at the Ryder Cup, losing his first four matches and becoming the first American to do so. Despite his dominant form throughout the year, Scheffler's individual prowess failed to translate into success in the team format, exposing weaknesses in his putting under pressure. The article suggests that the Ryder Cup's intense, sprint-like format, demanding clutch moments, differs significantly from the stroke-play events where he typically excels. His struggles became emblematic of the broader American team's overwhelming defeat, raising questions about his mindset in team competitions.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's new book, "Life, Law, & Liberty," offers a rare glimpse into his 30-year tenure, during which he was often the swing justice. Kennedy asserts "The cases swung, not me," as the court became more conservative, expressing worry about the current antagonistic tone in American discourse and even within Supreme Court opinions. He reveals his internal conflicts on abortion, a moral wrong for him but not necessarily a legal one, and his evolving stance on gay marriage, influenced by the impact on children of gay parents. The article highlights his opposition to strict originalism, advocating for liberty's meaning to evolve over time.</p>

The floods also dislodged approximately 1,000 residential-sized propane tanks in Globe, creating a serious hazmat concern, though none ignited.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article investigates the effectiveness of collagen supplements for reducing signs of skin aging, a popular but debated topic in health and wellness. While some users report benefits like brighter skin and stronger hair, consultant dermatologists express skepticism about oral supplements reaching the skin in effective quantities. Collagen is a large molecule, and even hydrolyzed peptides face challenges getting past the gut and into the dermis. Experts suggest marine collagen is preferable over bovine or vegan options, but ultimately, robust evidence supporting significant effects from oral or topical collagen is lacking. Dermatologists recommend sunblock, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking as more impactful anti-aging strategies.</p>

          <p>Bali, often idealized as a tropical paradise on social media, is increasingly facing the harsh realities of overtourism, leaving many visitors disillusioned. Tourists are encountering crowds, traffic, and extensive construction, a stark contrast to the spiritual Shangri-La image. Recent severe floods, which killed over a dozen people, have been exacerbated by poor waste management and unchecked urban development, prompting the local government to restrict new construction. Critics argue that tourists themselves contribute to the problem by congregating in popular "Instagrammable" areas, missing the island's rich culture and natural beauty beyond the congested south. Efforts are underway by businesses and authorities to promote sustainable development and responsible tourism.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump posted an AI-generated image on Truth Social depicting himself firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, intensifying his ongoing criticism of Powell's monetary policy. Trump, who has nicknamed him "Too Late Powell," has repeatedly attacked the Fed for its cautious approach to interest rate cuts, despite a recent reduction this month. Firing a Fed chairman would be an unprecedented move, and a recent Supreme Court decision indicated the president lacks the authority to remove Fed officials at will. Economists and investors fear such an action could undermine the Fed's crucial independence, potentially causing longer-term interest rates to rise if the Fed were perceived to act in political interests.

While welcomed, opposition parties criticized the government's slow response and called for broader cyber reinsurance schemes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California faces a widely acknowledged housing shortage, but the exact scale of the problem remains elusive, with estimates ranging from 56,000 to 3.5 million units. This article explains that the discrepancies arise from varying methodologies, including target vacancy rates, calculations of "pent-up demand," and definitions of "affordable housing." Researchers also grapple with messy data and the localized nature of housing markets. Despite the differing figures, a consensus exists that the shortage is substantial, prompting lawmakers to pass sweeping changes to housing law. Experts suggest focusing on the overall magnitude of the problem rather than a single precise number to guide policy.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has reached a confidential settlement in its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, who relentlessly spread baseless claims of election rigging in 2020. The lawsuit, stemming from Giuliani's allegations that Dominion systems manipulated votes, was a significant part of his efforts to cast doubt on the 2020 election results, undermining public confidence in U.S. elections. This settlement follows similar agreements by Fox News and Newsmax with Dominion. The legal and financial setbacks have been substantial for Giuliani, including disbarment and previous orders to pay millions to defamed election workers, highlighting the severe consequences of spreading election conspiracy theories.</p>

Coach Lincoln Riley defended his clock management, but acknowledged the defense's shortcomings, which allowed over 500 yards and struggled to pressure the quarterback.

          <p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer launched a strong attack on the Reform Party, labeling it "toxic" and "unpatriotic" ahead of Labour's annual conference in Liverpool. Starmer accused Reform leader Nigel Farage of "grubbing around in America" for personal gain and "talking our country down," framing Labour as the patriotic alternative. He specifically criticized Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for hundreds of thousands of migrants already in the UK, arguing it would "tear this country apart." Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood also weighed in, stating that while legal migration is good, long-term settlement should be linked to broader community contributions.</p>

Postecoglou acknowledges the urgent need to improve ruthlessness in front of goal, emphasizing the players' receptive mindset amidst the recent tactical changes.
