          <p>As trade tensions escalate between China and the United States, China is urging its citizens to remain united and resilient. The Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, emphasized the government's commitment to focusing on domestic issues and turning challenges into strategic opportunities. China retaliated against US tariffs with its own levies on American goods, causing Chinese stocks to decline. The Chinese sovereign fund is intervening to stabilize the market, signaling a determined effort to manage the economic impact of the trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is relaxing electric vehicle sales targets and reducing potential fines for car manufacturers in response to tariffs imposed by the United States. These measures aim to support the UK car industry as it transitions to electric vehicle production, with a ban on new petrol and diesel cars still set for 2030. Smaller firms will have more flexibility and some hybrid vehicles can stay on the market until 2035. The government is also providing tax breaks for EV purchases and improving charging infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite heightened trade tensions with the US, China's central bank is opting for stability over devaluation in managing the yuan. The People's Bank of China set the yuan's daily reference rate to a four-month low, but it remains above the key 7.2 benchmark. This move signals an intention to stabilize the currency rather than sharply devalue it to offset US tariffs. Analysts expect the central bank to maintain this strategy until the next round of tariffs is announced. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the ruling junta declaring a state of emergency and appealing for international aid, analysts remain skeptical about potential for ceasefire talks. The quake's aftermath is likely to be used by the junta to undermine resistance efforts and consolidate power. A lasting resolution to the ongoing civil war seems increasingly unlikely.</p>
