          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack expressed significant concern about stubborn inflation, noting the central bank has missed its 2% target for over four years. She highlighted that the Fed faces a "challenging time" balancing the fight against inflation with protecting employment, especially with persistent price pressures in the services sector. Hammack's comments align with recent warnings from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and follow economic data that has tempered market expectations for aggressive interest rate cuts, underscoring the delicate path monetary policy must navigate.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the ultimate winner of the technological rivalry between the United States and China will be decided by global consumers. While the US currently holds an advantage in many advanced technologies, China is rapidly catching up by emphasizing cost-effective alternatives and building a robust manufacturing supply chain. Chinese firms are now commercializing their own advanced AI models and chips, offering viable options to the global market. The piece suggests that market share and consumer adoption, rather than just technological superiority, will ultimately determine which nation sets global standards.</p>

A former pioneering heart surgeon, he became the church's 17th president in 2018 and led it through a period of significant change, including announcing 200 new temples. Under his leadership, the church rescinded controversial anti-LGBT policies from 2015 and ended its long-standing ties with the Boy Scouts of America.

          <p>Following their victory over Pakistan in the Asia Cup final, the Indian cricket team sparked controversy by refusing to accept the winner's trophy from the Asian Cricket Council president, who is also Pakistan's interior minister. The incident, described as a "departure from tradition," delayed the ceremony and drew criticism from Pakistan's captain, who accused India of disrespecting the sport. This event is the latest in a series of politically charged moments during the tournament, reflecting the heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed nations after a recent brief military conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New archaeological research suggests that the mysterious collapse of the ancient Sanxingdui civilization in southwestern China may have been caused by an internal conflict. According to a leading scholar, a war for control of the capital city likely occurred during the civilization's later period, leading to the destruction of city walls and religious sites. This internal strife is believed to have spurred a mass exodus of the population from the city. The Sanxingdui ruins, dating back around 4,500 years, are a pivotal archaeological site for understanding early Chinese history.</p>

In preparation, authorities had evacuated over 53,000 people to temporary shelters, closed four airports, and canceled more than 180 flights.

While not specifying the issue, she recently had to cancel an appearance due to a kidney stone.

          <p>As autumn begins, UK health officials are warning of a seasonal rise in both flu and COVID-19 cases, urging the public to understand the differences in their symptoms. While both can cause serious illness, flu typically presents suddenly with fever and aches, whereas COVID-19 symptoms have evolved to often resemble a cold, though a hoarse throat has become a hallmark of recent variants. Last winter, flu led to over 8,000 hospitalizations in the UK. Authorities are strongly encouraging eligible individuals to receive both the flu and COVID-19 booster vaccines to reduce severe illness and hospital strain.</p>

          <p>The increasing popularity of weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro is creating a two-tier system that benefits the wealthy, as access through the UK's National Health Service (NHS) is tightly restricted. While these drugs can be highly effective, stringent and inconsistent NHS eligibility criteria create a "postcode lottery," forcing many to pay hundreds of pounds per month on the private market. This dynamic risks exacerbating health inequalities, as obesity rates are significantly higher in more deprived areas. Experts warn that without wider, more equitable access, good health could become a luxury reserved for those who can afford to pay.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD is implementing significant price cuts in Japan in an effort to boost its struggling sales in the country. Despite opening numerous sales locations, the carmaker has sold only 5,300 vehicles there since early 2023, facing strong loyalty from Japanese consumers to domestic brands like Toyota. BYD is offering discounts up to 1 million yen (US$6,700), which, combined with government subsidies, could halve sticker prices. However, this strategy is risky in Japan, where discounting is rare and could alienate early buyers and harm the brand's resale value.</p>

The fiber-optic cables allow the drones to remain connected to their pilots even in the presence of electronic warfare systems that jam traditional radio frequencies.

          <p>Manchester United's all-time leading goalscorer, Wayne Rooney, has harshly criticized the state of his former club, stating it is "broken" and that he has "no faith" in current manager Ruben Amorim. Rooney described the club's culture as gone, pointing to a lack of fight and character from the players, some of whom he believes "don't deserve to wear the shirt." His comments follow a 3-1 defeat to Brentford, which left the team in 14th place in the Premier League. Rooney called for "big changes" to restore the club's identity.</p>

          <p>A widow from Oxfordshire is petitioning for a new law that would require police to provide dedicated support to families whose loved ones have died by suicide. Mimi Conder launched the campaign for "Jason's Law," named after her late husband, after her family was left to navigate the confusing aftermath of his death alone, without any official guidance. She is calling for the mandatory assignment of a family support officer (FLO) in such cases to explain the investigation and inquest processes. Currently, police only deploy FLOs for suspicious deaths, not for suicides.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Arizona, caused by record-breaking rainfall, have resulted in at least three deaths. Two fatalities occurred in the city of Globe, where a massive search and rescue operation is underway for potentially more missing people. Another person was found dead near a submerged vehicle in Scottsdale. The situation in Globe is further complicated by about 1,000 residential propane tanks that were swept away from a distributor, creating a widespread hazardous materials situation throughout the downtown area. Local officials have declared an emergency, describing the flooding as unprecedented.</p>

          <p>Two veterinarians in Scotland are renewing their appeal for population management of the rare Soay sheep on the remote St Kilda archipelago, arguing that hundreds starve to death each winter. They contend that the sheep, descended from domesticated animals, should be protected under welfare laws and that their numbers on the main island of Hirta are unsustainably high. However, the National Trust for Scotland and the Scottish government maintain that the sheep are wild animals, not farm livestock. The vets are proposing a controlled cull to ensure adequate grazing and reduce suffering.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques Vice President Kamala Harris's new election memoir, "107 Days," arguing it showcases a politician overly focused on the spectacle of politics rather than substantive policy. The author contends the book reveals that Harris's vague campaign style was not a strategic misstep but a true reflection of her political identity, which lacks a unique agenda distinct from Joe Biden's. The memoir is described as portraying a candidate captured by the adoration of celebrity supporters and rally crowds, fatally disconnected from the concerns of ordinary voters, and exculpating herself from her campaign's failures.</p>

While the force would not ban membership, concerns have been raised about potential conflicts of loyalty.

          <p>A Goldman Sachs report suggests that China's central bank is increasingly likely to implement monetary easing measures, including interest rate cuts, in the fourth quarter of the year. This forecast is driven by slowing economic momentum and growing pressure on policymakers to bolster growth. The projection includes a potential 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio. However, the analysts note that the People's Bank of China may take no action if the country remains on track to meet its "around 5 percent" annual growth target. (not investment advice)</p>
