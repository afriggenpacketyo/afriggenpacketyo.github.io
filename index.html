          <p>CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, announced impressive first earnings since its IPO, surpassing revenue expectations with a 420% increase compared to the previous year. The company's revenue reached $981.6 million, exceeding the anticipated $853 million, fueled by a five-year deal with OpenAI worth up to $11.9 billion. Despite a widened net loss due to stock-based compensation costs, CoreWeave projects strong revenue for the second quarter and the full year of 2025, driven by increasing demand for its Nvidia GPU rental services. The company's future growth hinges on securing sufficient power for its data centers, with 300 megawatts of contracted power added during the quarter.</p>

He points out that white people in South Africa remain a privileged class, owning a majority of the country's land, and that crime statistics do not show Afrikaners are disproportionately targeted.

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin will not attend peace talks on the war in Ukraine in Istanbul on Thursday, despite calls from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for him to attend. Russia's delegation will instead be headed by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky. Trump floated the possibility of joining the meeting himself if Putin did. The US is expected to send a high-level delegation to the talks.</p>

          <p>The House is pushing forward on President Trump's budget bill, but Republicans remain divided on key issues such as Medicaid and tax cuts. The Ways and Means Committee advanced its portion of the legislation, but the cap on the state and local tax deduction remains unresolved. The Energy and Commerce Committee debated for over 25 hours before advancing its portion, which includes cuts to Medicaid and work requirements. The Agriculture Committee is also working to find cuts, with contentious issues surrounding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</p>

A parole hearing will likely be scheduled before the end of the year, but Newsom could block their release.
