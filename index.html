          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva for a second day of high-stakes negotiations aimed at easing tensions stemming from President Trumpâ€™s trade war. The talks have major implications for the global economy, which has been disrupted by tariffs imposed by both countries, impacting supply chains and potentially slowing global growth. Mr. Trump has imposed a minimum tariff of 145 percent on all Chinese imports, while China has hit American products with a 125 percent import tax. Ahead of the meetings, Mr. Trump suggested he might lower tariffs to 80 percent if China makes concessions, though China has been steadfast in its refusal to do so.</p>

          <p>A recent four-day clash between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan, marked by new military technology and entrenched religious nationalism, raises concerns about future conflicts. The conflict involved waves of airstrikes, antiaircraft volleys, and the use of weaponized drones deep into each nation's territory, escalating rapidly. International diplomacy played a crucial role in de-escalating the situation, but the underlying political realities and the determination of both sides to gain an upper hand remain significant challenges. The article suggests that without significant changes in political dynamics, further confrontations are likely, potentially leading to dangerous outcomes.</p>

          <p>Comedian Jim Gaffigan humorously suggests extending Father's Day into a month-long celebration, following Mother's Day. He proposes a system where fathers receive presents on even days and are left alone on odd days, creating a "Ramadad" experience. While acknowledging the idea is new, Gaffigan playfully argues that fathers deserve an entire month of recognition. He emphasizes the importance of honoring mothers on Mother's Day before transitioning to the proposed Father's Day Month, filled with Dad jokes and off-and-on celebrations.</p>

          <p>Puerto Rico is attempting to capitalize on the global trade war by attracting international companies to relocate their manufacturing plants to the island, which would exempt them from tariffs. Government officials are promoting Puerto Rico's tax incentives, U.S. jurisdiction, and skilled workforce to companies in sectors such as aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. Despite these efforts, the island faces challenges including chronic power outages and costly shipping regulations. The government is also working with universities to align curriculums with industry needs.</p>

          <p>Wildfires have broken out across Britain amid the driest start to spring in nearly 70 years, affecting areas in Scotland, Wales, and England. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service deployed firefighters and a helicopter to combat a large forest fire near Fauldhouse, with mainland Scotland under an "extreme" wildfire risk warning. Similar fires occurred in southwest Wales and Dartmoor, Devon. Unusually dry conditions have amplified the risk, with England experiencing only 56 percent of its average rainfall in April.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the 10% baseline tariff rate on imports is likely to remain in place for the "foreseeable future," echoing President Trump's previous comments. Lutnick rejected the idea that consumers would bear the increased costs caused by the tariffs, asserting that businesses and countries will pay. However, data indicates that businesses are already attempting to pass costs onto consumers, and consumer confidence has decreased since the tariff announcement.</p>

          <p>Despite claims by some business leaders, AI is not yet capable of replacing human workers, with many companies regretting layoffs made in anticipation of AI taking over jobs. Generative AI platforms primarily enhance search capabilities and are not reliable enough for core business operations. Building AI systems is expensive and requires giving up data and intellectual property to tech companies, which many businesses are hesitant to do. While AI will eventually transform the workforce, that day is still years away, and businesses should be wary of believing it exists today.</p>
