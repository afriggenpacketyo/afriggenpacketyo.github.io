          <p>British-South African endurance athlete Lewis Pugh has completed a 62-mile swim around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness about the plight of sharks. Pugh aimed to challenge public perceptions of sharks, which he says have been unfairly maligned by the film "Jaws," and to advocate for their protection. He swam for multiple hours a day in the frigid waters, enduring harsh weather conditions and the mental challenge of being hyper-aware of sharks in the water. Pugh, who has previously swum in extreme environments, emphasized the urgent need to protect sharks, highlighting that around 100 million are killed each year.</p>

          <p>Germany, along with key Western allies, has lifted range restrictions on weapons supplied to Ukraine, as announced by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. This decision allows Ukraine to attack military positions within Russia, a capability it previously lacked, to better defend itself. The Kremlin has responded by calling the move "dangerous," while Merz reaffirmed Germany's commitment to supporting Ukraine. This shift marks a significant change in policy, as Western nations initially hesitated to provide long-range weapons to avoid escalating the conflict; the new government has emphasized that it will no longer disclose what weapons it is sending to Ukraine, instead adopting a position of strategic ambiguity.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has responded to Donald Trump's recent criticism of Vladimir Putin, attributing the remarks to "emotional overload." Trump had called Putin "absolutely crazy" following Russia's aerial assault on Ukraine, which resulted in numerous casualties. Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, suggested that Trump's comments reflected the emotional strain of the situation. Meanwhile, Germany's chancellor, Friedrich Merz, announced that allies had removed range limits on arms supplied to Ukraine.

The article argues that this was a political assassination fueled by an ideology that is spreading through American institutions, dividing people into oppressors and oppressed, and targeting Jews first. It calls for a clear line to be drawn, reaffirming that no political grievance justifies murder and that violence in the name of justice is still violence.</p>

Despite the transmissibility, the Trump administration plans to limit booster vaccine access to specific groups, requiring major clinical trials before approving them for wider use.

Both parties have agreed to fast-track trade negotiations, with the EU reiterating its "zero-for-zero" offer to eliminate tariffs on cars and industrial goods. Despite the positive signals, businesses remain uncertain due to Trump's flip-flopping on border taxes, and existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars remain in place. The EU is also considering further retaliatory tariffs on US goods, including targeting tech firms and banks.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized Vladimir Putin for the escalating attacks in Ukraine, calling his actions "absolutely CRAZY." However, Trump has not taken any new actions to increase pressure on Russia, refusing to join Europe in imposing new financial sanctions or offering additional military assistance to Ukraine. This has created a strategic void where Trump complains about Russian aggression but is unwilling to make Putin pay a price. Experts note that Trump's pattern is to signal a pullback from the conflict, express shock at Russian attacks, and then fail to implement meaningful consequences.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent actions and statements suggest a potential vision of a world divided into spheres of influence dominated by the United States, China, and Russia. This vision includes efforts to exert greater American influence in the Western Hemisphere, potentially at the expense of allies and existing security arrangements. Critics argue that this approach reflects a desire for a return to a 19th-century style of imperial rule, while analysts caution against attributing a strategic vision to Trump's actions. Trump has also expressed a desire for a summit meeting soon with Mr. Putin.</p>
