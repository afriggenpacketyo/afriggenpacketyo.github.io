          <p>China is proceeding with the construction of a colossal hydropower dam on the Tibetan plateau, a project set to surpass the Three Gorges Dam as the world's largest. Estimated to cost approximately $167 billion, the dam is projected to generate 300 billion kWh of electricity annually, more than Britain's total output. The project, part of China's broader strategy to utilize the region's hydropower potential, has raised significant security and ecological concerns for neighboring India. The dam's location on a major river flowing into India creates geopolitical tensions over water resources and regional stability.</p>

          <p>Authorities have determined that a deadly fire at a Massachusetts assisted-living facility, which killed 10 people, was accidental. The investigation points to two potential causes: a malfunctioning oxygen concentrator or the careless disposal of smoking materials in a resident's room. While the exact cause remains undetermined, officials emphasized the significant role that medical oxygen played in the fire's rapid and devastating spread. Following the tragedy, first responders were commended for their heroic efforts, as shown in bodycam footage of them rescuing elderly residents from the catastrophic blaze.</p>

          <p>England's advancement to the Euro 2025 final is being credited in large part to the performance of substitutes Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang. This article draws parallels between their impact and that of Alessia Russo and Ella Toone in the victorious Euro 2022 campaign. Both Kelly and Agyemang were instrumental in the dramatic quarter-final comeback against Sweden and the semi-final win over Italy, scoring crucial late goals after coming off the bench. Their performances have sparked debate among fans and pundits about whether they should be included in the starting lineup for the final.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that July 2025 is marked by a significant trend of capitulation to political pressure from the Trump administration. The author connects several events, including Paramount's cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" and House Speaker Mike Johnson's decision to recess Congress to avoid a vote on releasing Jeffrey Epstein files. The piece suggests these actions are attempts by corporations and political figures to avoid conflict with the president. Jon Stewart's criticism of his parent company and the ongoing intrigue surrounding the Epstein case are highlighted as key examples of this dynamic.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused former President Barack Obama of "treason" in relation to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump's claims are based on a recently declassified report from the Director of National Intelligence, which he alleges shows a conspiracy to undermine his presidency. In a rare response, Obama's office sharply rebuked the allegations, labeling them "bizarre," "ridiculous," and a "weak attempt at distraction." The controversy arises as the Trump administration faces pressure to release more information regarding the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

          <p>A Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph taken by Stanley Forman in 1975, which captured a woman and child falling from a collapsed fire escape, led to significant safety reforms in Boston. The haunting image depicted 19-year-old Diana Bryant, who was killed in the fall, and her 2-year-old goddaughter, who survived. The shocking photo prompted the city to implement new regulations requiring fire escapes to be certified as safe every five years, a rule that did not exist at the time.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Hershey Company has confirmed it will implement a low double-digit price increase across its candy portfolio due to the soaring cost of cocoa. The company attributes the change to an unprecedented global cocoa shortage, driven by adverse weather conditions and disease in key growing regions like Ghana and the Ivory Coast. Cocoa prices have risen dramatically, forcing the confectionary giant to adjust its pricing. As part of its strategy, Hershey also plans to focus on products that are less cocoa-intensive to mitigate the impact of the volatile commodity market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration is deliberately purging women from the highest ranks of the U.S. military. The author points to a pattern of recent firings, including the first female head of the U.S. Naval Academy and the first female Chief of Naval Operations, as evidence. The piece cites Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's past writings, which expressed concerns about "social engineering" in the military, to suggest the removals are ideologically driven. The author concludes that these actions send a chilling message that women are not welcome in military leadership.</p>

          <p>A report from BBC Scotland News examines the impact of overtourism on Edinburgh's historic Royal Mile, which now features 72 tourist-focused gift shops. Long-time residents claim the area has lost its community feel, with essential local shops like butchers and grocers being replaced by souvenir stores. The influx of tourists, which reached five million last year, and the conversion of residential properties to short-term lets have strained local life. While the tourism industry supports over 40,000 jobs, locals argue the city council has not done enough to balance the needs of residents with the demands of mass tourism.</p>

Although the chipmaker's second-quarter revenue and earnings surpassed estimates, with its analog chip business showing strong growth, investors focused on the weaker outlook. The company projected third-quarter revenue with a midpoint of $4.625 billion, below the consensus of $4.59 billion, and earnings per share guidance also came in lower than anticipated. The forecast overshadowed the otherwise solid performance in the recent quarter for the key automotive and industrial supplier. (not investment advice)</p>

Recently, Bezos has reportedly sought to improve his relationship with the administration, especially as his company Blue Origin competes with Elon Musk's SpaceX for government contracts.
