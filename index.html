          <p>An active shooter incident at Fort Stewart in Georgia resulted in five soldiers being shot and injured by a fellow service member. The shooting occurred in the 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team area, prompting a temporary lockdown of the military base. The suspect, a male soldier, was apprehended by law enforcement approximately 30 minutes after the incident was first reported. Officials have confirmed there are no fatalities and stated there is no longer an active threat to the community, with President Trump being briefed on the developing situation.</p>

          <p>Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Abigail Spanberger, reportedly accepted $50,000 in campaign donations from Pin Ni, the president of Wanxiang America. The company is the U.S. subsidiary of a Chinese conglomerate with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. This revelation has drawn criticism, particularly as Spanberger, a former CIA officer, has championed policies like EV tax credits that could benefit Wanxiang's business interests. Critics argue the donations conflict with her national security background, while records show Pin Ni has a history of donating to both Democratic and Republican candidates.</p>

          <p>ESPN has finalized a five-year agreement to become the exclusive U.S. home for WWE's premium live events, including WrestleMania and Royal Rumble, starting in 2026. The deal is reportedly valued at an average of $325 million per year, a significant increase from the previous agreement with NBCUniversal's Peacock. These events will stream on ESPN's new direct-to-consumer platform, with some also being simulcast on linear networks. The partnership aims to expand WWE's audience and help ESPN attract a younger, more diverse, and more female viewership to its services.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that "great progress" was made regarding the war in Ukraine during talks between his envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. The meeting was described as "highly productive" ahead of a Trump-imposed deadline for a ceasefire agreement. Following the talks, the White House imposed an additional 25% tariff on India for purchasing Russian oil, signaling continued economic pressure. Despite the optimistic tone, expectations for a definitive settlement remain muted as Russia continues its military attacks on Ukrainian cities.</p>

          <p>A massive wildfire is sweeping through the Aude region of southern France, scorching an area larger than Paris and prompting the Prime Minister to declare it a "catastrophe on an unprecedented scale." The blaze, which officials say is the largest in France since 1949, has resulted in at least one death, multiple injuries, and the destruction of numerous homes. Over 2,150 firefighters are battling the fire, which is being fueled by severe drought, high temperatures, and strong winds. Authorities have linked the disaster to the impacts of global warming.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is struggling to disburse its allocated funds before the fiscal year ends, a situation current and former officials attribute to political interference from the Trump administration. Despite Congress signaling budget increases, the agency is billions of dollars behind in awarding grants due to funding freezes, staff cuts, and politically motivated reviews of research proposals. Officials fear that failing to spend the money will force them to return a massive sum to the Treasury, which could then be used to justify future budget cuts, effectively setting the agency up to fail.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's threat to impose secondary tariffs on countries trading with Russia could have significant global economic consequences, primarily by affecting energy prices. If the tariffs, which could tax goods at 100%, deter major buyers like China, India, and Turkey from purchasing Russian oil, the reduced global supply could cause prices to spike. However, the impact might be mitigated by OPEC+'s spare capacity and Russia's use of a "shadow fleet" to obscure its exports. The policy has already hit India with a 50% total tariff, potentially raising U.S. consumer prices on goods like iPhones manufactured there. (not investment advice)</p>

The perception of financial comfort is shaped by major expenses that constitute a person's financial life.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has published a new, significantly shorter list of "sanctuary jurisdictions" that it alleges obstruct federal immigration enforcement. The updated list, released by the Department of Justice, now includes only four counties nationwide and the state of Illinois. Notably, Monroe County, Indiana, which was the only Indiana jurisdiction on the previous list from May, has been removed. Local officials in Monroe County were unaware of any specific negotiations that led to their removal, having previously dismissed the designation as political theater while facing threats of withheld federal funding.</p>

          <p>The Nashville-based band Rainbow Kitten Surprise has announced a new album, "Bones," set for release on September 26. The 10-track collection is described as a rawer, more direct follow-up to their sprawling 2024 record, born from a prolific writing session that yielded nearly 160 songs. Frontwoman Ela Melo calls it a "spill-your-guts-out record," with straightforward lyrics and a sound built for live performance. Melo, who is recently sober, notes that the lyrics often channel past experiences, reflecting on how relationships are affected by substance use with a newfound clarity and control.</p>

After finding the unit with desirable features like a garage and in-unit laundry, they focused on decorating with bold paint choices, vintage and thrifted furniture, and an extensive personal art collection. They say the key has been to be bold and ask for forgiveness, not permission, from their landlord. Beyond the decor, they have found a deep sense of belonging in their neighborhood's strong community atmosphere.</p>

          <p>The political standoff over Texas redistricting has escalated, with Democratic lawmakers who fled the state reporting a bomb threat at their hotel in Illinois. The lawmakers evacuated but stated they would not be intimidated. The threat follows calls from some Republicans to have them "hunted down." Meanwhile, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has petitioned the state supreme court to declare the seat of the top House Democrat vacant for abdicating his duties. This high-stakes confrontation began when Democrats left Texas to block a vote on a new congressional map pushed by Republicans to gain a partisan advantage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When planning for retirement, both certificates of deposit (CDs) and annuities offer safety, but they serve different purposes. CDs are simple, FDIC-insured products ideal for short-term savings and preserving principal, though their returns may not outpace inflation. Annuities are more complex insurance contracts designed to provide a guaranteed income stream for life, addressing the risk of outliving one's savings. The best choice depends on individual needs: CDs offer liquidity and simplicity, while annuities provide longevity insurance. For many, a combination of both products can create a balanced retirement strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

The BBC spoke with employees who confirmed receiving partial payments, though the small amounts and soaring inflation are causing resentment. With no functioning banks, payments are distributed discreetly and dangerously by couriers at designated meeting spots. A senior Hamas source claimed the group had stockpiled hundreds of millions of dollars in cash in underground tunnels before the war began, enabling these continued payments.</p>

The operation, which resulted in as many as 16 arrests, has revived fears of widespread immigration sweeps.

          <p>President Donald Trump is threatening to place Washington D.C. under direct federal control, revoking its 'home rule' governance, in response to what he calls rampant youth crime. The threat followed an assault on a 19-year-old federal employee who worked for the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). Trump, backed by Elon Musk, stated he would "federalize" the city if local authorities do not get crime under control, specifically calling for minors as young as 14 to be prosecuted as adults. Such a move to suspend local governance would be unprecedented and likely face significant legal and political challenges.</p>
