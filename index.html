        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy showed significant signs of strain in July as key indicators fell short of forecasts. Retail sales, a primary measure of consumer spending, grew by only 3.7%, a notable slowdown from the previous month, signaling weakening domestic demand. Additionally, industrial output and fixed-asset investment also lost momentum, underperforming expectations. These figures reflect the combined pressures of a prolonged property downturn and ongoing trade headwinds, creating a challenging economic outlook for the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Air Canada has begun proactively canceling flights as a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants looms, threatening widespread travel disruptions. The airline initiated a gradual suspension of operations, with a full grounding expected by Saturday if a deal is not reached. The union's primary grievances revolve around low wages and unpaid labor, while the airline states it has offered a significant pay increase. This labor dispute could impact approximately 130,000 travelers daily, forcing the carrier to offer refunds and arrange alternative travel options.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan to counter a Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas by redrawing his own state's congressional maps. The proposal, called the 'Election Rigging Response Act,' would require a special election in November to approve new boundaries that could neutralize the five House seats Republicans aim to gain in Texas. Newsom framed the move as a necessary response to protect democracy from partisan gerrymandering, stating California would not 'unilaterally disarm' in what is becoming a national political battle over electoral maps.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The series finale of 'And Just Like That' concludes Carrie Bradshaw's story by leaving her single, a resolution that feels more authentic to the show's core themes than the original 'Sex and the City' ending. After exploring widowhood and rekindling old romances, Carrie ultimately finds contentment in her own company and the strength of her friendships. This conclusion realigns with the original show's often-stated premise that female friendships can be the most enduring and important relationships, providing a more nuanced and arguably more fitting end for the iconic character.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' expectations despite facing trade tariff challenges. The growth was primarily driven by strong performance in net exports, which contributed significantly to the GDP after contracting in the previous quarter. On an annualized basis, the economy grew 1%, providing a positive signal amid an uncertain global trade environment. The Bank of Japan has since upgraded its economic forecast for the fiscal year but remains cautious about global slowdowns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new high-speed drone capable of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), a technological advancement that could significantly enhance its naval capabilities. The jet-powered uncrewed aircraft can launch from the decks of various warships without a runway, even in rough seas, and then transition to fast, long-range flight. This innovation could effectively transform vessels like destroyers and frigates into mini aircraft carriers, expanding the operational reach and versatility of the Chinese navy.

          <p>As President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepare to meet in Alaska, their primary objectives for the summit appear to be starkly different. Putin likely seeks to gain international recognition, project strength, and secure territorial concessions in Ukraine, thereby rehabilitating his position on the world stage. In contrast, Trump's main goal seems to be casting himself as a global peacemaker, potentially leading him to seek a quick resolution, even if it lacks substantive detail, to claim a diplomatic victory and fulfill a campaign promise.</p>

One of the tracks will be released as a single to mark the 80th anniversary of VJ Day.</p>

This reported refusal of service highlights the political tensions surrounding Vance's visit and reflects a similar incident he encountered at a Pennsylvania restaurant during the election season.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is set to increase its number of data centres by nearly 20%, with almost 100 new facilities planned to meet the growing demands of artificial intelligence. This major expansion, however, is raising significant concerns among experts about the immense strain it will place on the country's energy and water resources. Critics warn that the huge consumption could lead to higher utility bills for consumers and exacerbate environmental issues, prompting calls for companies to bear the infrastructure costs and for more sustainable operating methods.</p>

          <p>A new AI-driven technology is poised to transform the experience of watching foreign-language films by digitally manipulating actors' lip movements to perfectly match dubbed audio. Tools like DeepEditor, developed by the company Flawless, analyze and alter video to create a seamless visual and auditory experience, making it appear as if the actors are genuinely speaking the new language. This innovation could significantly broaden the appeal of international cinema in markets like the U.S., where audiences have traditionally been resistant to subtitles and conventional dubbing.</p>

While famous athletes have been immortalized as Barbie dolls in the past, the initial phase of this partnership focuses on promoting grassroots initiatives rather than creating dolls of the players.</p>

          <p>As the Social Security program marks its 90th anniversary, concerns about its long-term financial stability are mounting. The program, which provides benefits to nearly 70 million Americans, is facing a significant funding gap, with its trust funds projected to be depleted by 2034. Without congressional intervention to address the shortfall, future beneficiaries could face a benefit cut of up to 23%. This looming insolvency has eroded public confidence, even as a majority of Americans consider the program one of the government's most important.</p>

          <p>Financial commentator Jim Cramer argued that while parts of the stock market show signs of 'froth,' particularly with recent speculative IPOs, investors should not exit their positions. He contends that the market's rational side, exemplified by strong, disruptive initiatives from companies like Amazon and insider confidence at Eli Lilly, is powerful enough to outweigh the irrational exuberance. Cramer's advice is to stay invested in quality companies, suggesting that the positive momentum in legitimate stocks is intrinsically linked to the speculative runs seen elsewhere.

          <p>The California Coastal Commission has unanimously voted to oppose SpaceX's proposal to increase its annual rocket launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base from 50 to 95. Commissioners cited significant concerns about the environmental impact of sonic booms on wildlife and residents, as well as negative effects on public access and coastal resources. The vote escalates a regulatory conflict, as SpaceX and military officials argue the launches are federal activities exempt from state oversight, a claim the commission disputes for the company's commercial missions.</p>
