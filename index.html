          <p>Micron Technology is set to stop supplying server memory chips to data centers within mainland China, a decision following a 2023 government ban that impacted its business in critical infrastructure. According to sources, this move is a direct response to the business failing to recover from Beijing's restrictions, which were seen as retaliation for U.S. curbs on China's tech industry. The company will, however, continue selling to Chinese customers with data centers outside of China and maintain its supply to the automotive and smartphone sectors within the country.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Greene King, a major UK pub chain, has identified coffee shops and food delivery apps as significant new rivals competing for consumers' leisure time and money. He acknowledges that pubs must adapt to changing trends, such as the growing number of non-drinkers, by improving their food and coffee offerings to create more comfortable and inclusive environments. While emphasizing the unique community role of pubs, the CEO also calls on the government to provide regulatory breathing space, particularly by reforming the business rates system which disproportionately taxes the hospitality industry.</p>

          <p>Indonesia is pursuing direct export channels to China for its fresh durians, aiming to significantly increase profits by bypassing intermediary countries like Malaysia and Thailand. Currently, these neighboring nations assist with the necessary phytosanitary approvals and cold-chain storage required by Chinese authorities for Indonesian produce. By improving its own certification and refrigeration infrastructure, Indonesia hopes to independently access the lucrative Chinese market, which consumes over 90% of the world's durian supply, and capture a larger share of the value chain.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study highlights the dual environmental threats facing Shanghai, as the city is both sinking and experiencing rapidly rising sea levels. Researchers attribute at least 94% of the urban subsidence to man-made activities, with the city's construction on soft sediment exacerbating the natural tendency of delta regions to sink. This issue is compounded by a global mean sea-level rise that has accelerated since 1900, creating a significant challenge for the coastal metropolis and other key delta cities like Shenzhen and Hong Kong.</p>

While markets in Hong Kong, mainland China, and Japan saw significant losses, the Kospi managed to close marginally up after reaching a new intraday peak, demonstrating investor confidence in the national economic outlook.

          <p>The interim government of Peru has announced it will impose a state of emergency in the capital city of Lima following violent clashes between anti-government protesters and police. The demonstrations, which decry low wages and corruption, turned deadly when a 32-year-old hip-hop singer and protester was shot and killed, with over 100 others injured. Despite calls for his resignation, the new President Jose Jeri has refused to step down, vowing to maintain stability and blaming the violence on "delinquents" who infiltrated peaceful marches.</p>

While this fragmented support might allow for expansive spending packages, analysts suggest that more conservative fiscal voices within her own party and the differing priorities of coalition partners could stall significant reforms and create policy uncertainty.

          <p>Fans of Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv have been barred from attending their Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham due to significant public safety concerns. West Midlands Police classified the fixture as "high risk," citing intelligence and violent clashes involving antisemitism that occurred during a Maccabi match in Amsterdam in 2024. The decision, aimed at preventing potential protests and disorder, has sparked criticism from UK political leaders who argue it unfairly penalizes fans, while some local and pro-Palestinian groups have welcomed the measure.</p>

          <p>China's largest annual shopping event, Singles' Day, has commenced nearly a month early this year as retailers attempt to invigorate a sluggish consumer market. Platforms like Alibaba and JD.com launched major sales campaigns in mid-October, a departure from the traditional November 11 start date. This move is a response to weakened retail growth caused by economic challenges, including a property crisis and high youth unemployment, which have made Chinese consumers more cautious with their spending despite government efforts to boost the economy.</p>

          <p>The first and only debate in the Virginia Attorney General race was heavily focused on violent and incendiary text messages sent by the Democratic challenger, Jay Jones. Incumbent Republican Jason Miyares criticized Jones for a message stating a former GOP House Speaker should get "two bullets to the head," arguing it disqualified him from serving as the state's top prosecutor. Jones apologized for his words, calling them shameful and embarrassing, but also pivoted to criticize Miyares for not holding former President Trump accountable for his own extreme rhetoric.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted John Bolton, former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, on charges of mishandling classified information. The indictment alleges that Bolton unlawfully transmitted national defense information to unauthorized relatives via personal email and retained classified documents at his home after leaving his post. Bolton has declared his innocence, framing the charges as a politically motivated act of retribution by Trump and an effort to intimidate opponents, a claim echoed by other recently indicted Trump critics.</p>

          <p>China has introduced sweeping new export controls on rare earth minerals, tightening its grip on the global supply and escalating trade tensions with the United States. The new rules require government approval for exporting products containing these critical minerals, which are essential for everything from smartphones to advanced military hardware. This move is seen as a strategic assertion of Beijing's dominance in rare earth processing, giving it significant leverage over global supply chains and in negotiations with Washington, which has reacted with threats of retaliatory tariffs.</p>

          <p>A long-acting injection for preventing HIV, cabotegravir, has been approved for use by the NHS in England and Wales, aligning their policy with Scotland's. The shot, administered every other month, provides an alternative to daily pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pills and is intended for high-risk individuals for whom daily medication is not practical. Health experts hope this new option will help the UK achieve its goal of ending new HIV cases by 2030 by improving access and adherence to preventative therapy for vulnerable populations.</p>

This article suggests that if the Dodgers continue their current trajectory, they could finish with a 13-1 record, surpassing the historic postseason runs of teams like the 1976 Cincinnati Reds and 2005 Chicago White Sox in the modern expanded playoff era.</p>
