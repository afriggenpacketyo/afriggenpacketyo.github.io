        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are leveraging the "first sale rule," a decades-old U.S. customs law, to reduce the financial impact of tariffs. This rule allows importers to calculate customs duties based on the initial sale price from the overseas producer to a vendor, rather than the inflated price from the vendor to the U.S. retailer. By using the factory price, companies can strip out the middleman's profit and pay a lower import duty. The first sale rule requires at least two sales, independent parties, proof the item was destined for the U.S., and documentation of the first sale price.</p>

          <p>Several European countries are reconsidering or expanding their nuclear energy programs as they seek greater energy independence. Denmark is analyzing advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors, to complement solar and wind power. Germany has dropped its opposition to atomic power, while Spain has signaled an openness to reviewing the shutdown of its nuclear plants. This shift is partly driven by the costs associated with renewables, and a desire for more reliable energy sources, but Denmark explicitly stated they do not plan a return to traditional nuclear power plants.</p>

          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant drop in April, plummeting 49% year-on-year, as the company faces reputational challenges and increased competition. This decline occurred despite overall battery electric car sales rising 34.1% in Europe during the same period. Tesla has suffered brand damage due to CEO Elon Musk's political involvement with former U.S. President Donald Trump, leading to protests at dealerships. The company also faces growing competition from traditional automakers and aggressive Chinese players, with BYD surpassing Tesla in European pure electric car sales for the first time.</p>

NPR President Katherine Maher called the order retaliatory and viewpoint-based discrimination.

          <p>A 19-year-old man in New Zealand died after sustaining a head injury while participating in "RUNIT," a social media-driven tackling game involving full-contact collisions without protective gear. Police have urged caution due to the significant safety and injury risks associated with the game. The game, loosely based on rugby and NFL, involves competitors running at each other and colliding in a designated area. Experts in head injuries have strongly condemned RUNIT, highlighting the high risk of serious brain injury.</p>

The IMF praised government planning reforms and infrastructure investments but suggested some changes to fiscal rules, such as reducing the frequency of Office for Budget Responsibility assessments.

          <p>Food inflation in the UK has reached its highest annual rate in a year, driven by rising beef and fresh produce prices.

The British Retail Consortium reported that food prices rose 2.8% in the year to May, with a steakhouse chain reporting a 20% increase in beef costs. Farming industry experts and restaurant owners warn that increased production costs and minimum wage increases could further impact consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

Some observers fear his reemergence could jeopardize mediation efforts, while others argue that sidelining him is counterproductive.
