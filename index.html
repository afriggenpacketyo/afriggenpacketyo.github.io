          <h2>Women Plead Not Guilty to Stalking McCann Family</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two women, Julia Wandel and Karen Spragg, have denied stalking the family of Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in 2007. Wandel is accused of sending letters and messages to the McCann family and visiting their home, while Spragg faces a charge of stalking involving serious alarm or distress. Both women entered not guilty pleas at Leicester Crown Court and are scheduled to go on trial in October. The case highlights the continued public interest and, for the McCanns, the persistent intrusion into their lives after their daughter's disappearance. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Conservative party is pushing to amend the Crime and Policing Bill to restrict police recording of non-crime hate incidents (NCHIs), arguing it wastes police time on ideology rather than justice. NCHIs are alleged acts perceived as motivated by hostility or prejudice. Policing Minister Diana Johnson contends this plan is unworkable and would hinder monitoring of serious antisemitism and racist incidents. The debate centers on balancing free speech with the need to address potential escalations of hate. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is exploring increasing tariff-free rice imports from the United States as part of ongoing trade negotiations regarding levies imposed by Washington. The proposal suggests raising the import amount to approximately 410,000 tons from the current 350,000 tons. This consideration arises amidst growing domestic demand for more affordable imported rice due to supply shortages and rising prices in Japan. The move reflects Japan's effort to balance protecting its agricultural sector with addressing consumer needs and maintaining trade relations. </p>
