Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander cited concerns over privacy and the potential for misuse of personal information. The judge stated that unlimited access to medical and financial records betrays the government's commitment to citizens. The ruling prevents DOGE from installing software or altering SSA computers, but allows for limited data access with written permission, emphasizing the importance of protecting citizen privacy. </p>

            <p>The White House is restructuring the National Security Council (NSC) with aides who are considered loyal to President Trump's agenda. Derek Harvey, a military intelligence analyst, is expected to be named senior director for intelligence. This move follows the ousting of six NSC aides earlier in the month. Harvey, who previously worked on Middle East affairs, was forced out of the NSC during Trump's first term. The restructuring signals a shift towards advisors more closely aligned with the president's policies and priorities.</p>

            <p>The US is planning to impose port fees on Chinese ships in an effort to revive American shipbuilding and challenge China's dominance in the industry. The fees will be based on cargo weight, container volume, or vehicle count, starting in 180 days and increasing over the next three years. This decision follows concerns about global trade disruption due to President Trump's tariff policies. Some experts suggest that cargoes originally destined for the US are being redirected to European ports, potentially raising prices for US consumers.</p>

One explanation for the US's trade aggression is that it is using tariffs to pressure countries into negotiating resolutions to trade imbalances, though this strategy imposes costs on everyone and disrupts global supply chains.</p>

            <p>A resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, was delayed after a contentious day in court. The hearing, intended to decide whether the brothers should receive a new sentence that could allow their freedom, was postponed until May 9. The delay came as attorneys fought with prosecutors and sought the recusal of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. The judge will consider requests from both sides at the May hearing, complicating the timeline for any potential decision on the brothers' fate.</p>

            <p>Chinese scientists have developed the world's fastest flash memory, named "Poxiao," capable of erasing and rewriting data in 400 picoseconds. Researchers at Fudan University unveiled the device, which shatters the speed barriers of modern storage by 100,000 times. While the current prototype holds limited data, its design promises a future where AI can read and write as fast as it thinks. This breakthrough in electron physics may soon blur the line between memory and computing, potentially revolutionizing information storage speed.</p>

In Hull and East Yorkshire, Reform UK has nominated Olympic champion Luke Campbell as its candidate. In the West of England region, the Green Party candidate, Mary Page, sees herself as a strong challenger to Labour. Voters appear to be restless, with local elections potentially handing power to smaller, driven groups due to low turnout and political disengagement.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration will impose fees on Chinese-built vessels docking at U.S. ports, following a U.S. Trade Representative investigation. The investigation concluded that China's acts, policies, and practices were unreasonable and burdened U.S. commerce. The fees, starting in 180 days, will be based on vessel tonnage and container volume, increasing over several years. Vessel owners may be eligible for fee remission by ordering U.S.-built ships. Bulk exports and empty ships are exempt. This action aims to counter China's dominance in the shipbuilding industry. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Fire services in England are facing a significant funding shortfall after the government failed to provide the same level of compensation for tax increases as the police. While police forces received full coverage for the rise in employers' National Insurance contributions, fire services are only receiving top-up funds covering 50% of the increase. This shortfall is equivalent to the cost of a fully-staffed fire engine, impacting the ability of fire services to maintain safety standards. The government has declined to comment on the discrepancy.</p>
