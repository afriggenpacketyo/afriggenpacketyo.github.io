          <p>Rapper Lil Nas X, whose real name is Montero Lamar Hill, pleaded not guilty to four felony charges in Los Angeles, including three counts of battery with injury on a police officer and one count of resisting an executive officer. The 26-year-old artist was arrested last week after being seen nearly naked on a Los Angeles street, reportedly charging at officers. His bail was reduced to $75,000 due to no prior convictions, with his father expressing support for his son. The legal proceedings continue for the Grammy-winning "Old Town Road" singer.</p>

          <p>Financial markets are largely anticipating a quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September, following Chair Jerome Powell's recent remarks suggesting a policy adjustment. However, uncertainty surrounds the pace of subsequent cuts, with market experts debating the Fed's future aggressiveness amid ongoing inflation concerns and a resilient economy. Some analysts, like Morgan Stanley's Lisa Shalett, question the urgency and impact of cuts, while others, like Ed Yardeni, foresee an earnings-led bull market continuing despite potential policy missteps. The market's initial optimism from Powell's speech has given way to caution regarding the longer-term economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the U.S. government from deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvadoran national, after immigration officers took him into custody at a routine check-in. Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March and later returned to face human trafficking charges, alleges authorities are trying to coerce a guilty plea by threatening deportation to Uganda, a country where he has no ties. The judge expressed concerns about conditioning constitutional rights on a plea deal and the lack of demonstrated safety for him in Uganda. This case has drawn international attention and protests from his supporters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at punishing individuals who burn the American flag, alleging such acts incite riots and express contempt for the nation. The directive instructs the Justice Department to prosecute flag desecration that violates content-neutral laws, like those against violent crimes or property damage, rather than the act of burning itself, while acknowledging Supreme Court rulings protecting flag burning as free speech. It also targets foreign nationals involved in flag desecration with potential visa revocations. Legal experts argue the order cannot override First Amendment protections established by prior Supreme Court decisions.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is expected to start the season opener against the Houston Texans after recovering from a back issue, showing no setbacks in recent workouts. However, the availability of left tackle Alaric Jackson, crucial for Stafford's protection, remains uncertain as he will return to full-team drills next week following blood-clot issues. Jackson's ability to manage his condition under increased workload will determine his playing status, with the team hoping for a trajectory similar to Stafford's recovery. Coach Sean McVay expressed optimism about Stafford's readiness, highlighting the importance of a strong offensive line for the Super Bowl contender.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the share of working Californians represented by unions has remained stable, ranging between 16% and 18% over the past two decades, contrasting with a nationwide decline in union membership. Researchers attribute California's resilience to consistent new organizing efforts, particularly in the medical industry and at companies like Starbucks. While some unions, such as United Food and Commercial Workers, experienced declines due to automation, the state's proactive union activity has largely counteracted national trends. This stability highlights California's unique labor landscape compared to the broader U.S.</p>

          <p>Reverse mortgages allow homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly mortgage payments, a popular option for retirement income. However, borrowers must still pay property taxes, homeowners insurance, and maintenance costs, and failure to meet these obligations can lead to severe consequences. Defaulting can make the entire loan balance immediately due, trigger quick foreclosure proceedings, and negatively impact credit scores, unlike traditional mortgages. While offering flexibility, experts advise seniors to understand these responsibilities and maintain emergency funds to avoid potential financial distress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's recent logo redesign, part of a brand refresh, has sparked public outrage and caused the restaurant chain's value to drop by nearly $100 million.

Loyal customers, who associate the original image with "homestyle country cooking" and a "simpler time," felt alienated by the change. The incident underscores the challenges legacy brands face in modernizing their image without alienating their core customer base, even as the company maintains its restaurants will retain their old-timey vibe.</p>

          <p>The search for 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro intensified over the weekend, with San Bernardino County Sheriff’s investigators joined by the baby's father, Jake Haro, at a dusty field in Moreno Valley. Jake and Rebecca Haro were arrested on suspicion of killing their son after Rebecca's initial report of a kidnapping was deemed fabricated. Jake Haro, who was on probation for child cruelty from a 2018 incident, was present during the search, though Emmanuel's body was not found. Investigators believe Emmanuel is deceased, and the focus remains on recovering his remains while the parents maintain their innocence.</p>

          <p>Britain's Cameron Norrie progressed to the second round of the US Open after his opponent, Sebastian Korda, retired due to injury while Norrie was leading 7-5, 6-4. Korda, who recently returned to tour after a three-month shin stress fracture lay-off, called a medical timeout for an abdominal issue in the second set. Norrie, despite feeling "nervous" about the match, will now face either Francisco Comesana or Alex Michelsen. While advancing due to an opponent's injury is not ideal, it marks Norrie's continued participation in the tournament.</p>

This unusual appointment of someone without prior curatorial or administrative experience at a high-profile institution comes amidst accusations of retaliation. Nakagawa's predecessor, Jane Raleigh, stated her dismissal was due to her public support for an ongoing union organizing campaign. The leadership change occurs as the Kennedy Center seeks a significant funding boost from Congress, facing a condition to rename its opera house after the First Lady.</p>
