          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has detailed his vision for a future driven by "personal superintelligence," an advanced AI that acts as a personalized companion to help individuals achieve their goals. This concept moves beyond simple automation, aiming to empower users in creative, personal, and professional aspects of their lives. The strategy also heavily incorporates AI-integrated glasses, like the Meta Ray-Bans, which Zuckerberg believes will become primary computing devices. This pivot from the metaverse to AI has been credited with boosting Meta's recent strong financial performance.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing a cautious approach due to persistent inflation and economic uncertainty. The decision saw a rare dissent from two governors who favored a rate cut, highlighting internal debate. Fed Chair Jerome Powell justified the hold by noting that inflation remains above the 2% target and the economy is still in good shape, signaling that future policy decisions will remain dependent on incoming economic data.

          <p>The Canadian government has announced its plan to formally recognize a Palestinian state in September, a move that follows similar declarations from France and the United Kingdom. Prime Minister Mark Carney stated this policy shift is contingent upon the Palestinian Authority implementing significant democratic reforms, including holding general elections in 2026 without the participation of Hamas. The decision is driven by growing concerns over the expansion of Israeli settlements and the severe, deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>An Israeli woman who was formerly held hostage by Hamas has publicly condemned UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's plan to recognize a Palestinian state. She argued the move risks rewarding terrorism and could disincentivize Hamas from releasing the remaining hostages, as it might grant legitimacy without requiring a ceasefire. Lawyers representing other hostage families have echoed these concerns, expressing fear that the UK's conditional approach could inadvertently prolong the conflict rather than promote a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>A significant technical failure within the UK's air traffic control system resulted in major flight disruptions across the country, grounding thousands of flights and leading to numerous cancellations. The radar-related problem at the NATS control center in Hampshire lasted only 20 minutes but created a substantial backlog affecting major airports like Heathrow and Manchester. This incident marks the second major outage for NATS in two years, prompting apologies from the firm and calls for an investigation into the repeated system failures.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Imposes 50% Tariff on Copper Pipes and Wiring</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new 50% tariff on specific copper products, including pipes, tubes, and wiring, justifying the move on national security grounds. However, the levy notably excludes raw copper materials like ores and cathodes, making its scope narrower than what the market had anticipated based on the president's earlier statements. This unexpected limitation caused U.S. copper prices to fall sharply, as the policy is seen as primarily aiding domestic manufacturers rather than providing a significant boost to the U.S. copper mining industry.

          <p>This political analysis suggests that by formally declining to run for California governor in 2026, Kamala Harris has strategically kept the door open for a potential 2028 presidential campaign. Committing to a gubernatorial run would have likely required her to forswear a White House bid and presented the immense challenge of governing the state while campaigning nationally. While she would enter a 2028 Democratic primary as a nominal front-runner, she would also face a potentially crowded field and carry the political burden of the 2024 election loss.</p>

Although Arm's earnings per share met analyst forecasts and its second-quarter revenue guidance was in line with projections, this was insufficient to prevent the stock's decline, reflecting market sensitivity to top-line performance in the tech sector.
