          <p>A federal jury has ordered David Walls-Kaufman to pay $500,000 to the widow and estate of Metropolitan Police Officer Jeffrey Smith, who died by suicide after the January 6th Capitol riot. The jury found Walls-Kaufman liable for assaulting Smith during the riot, awarding punitive and compensatory damages to Smith's widow and estate. Judge Ana Reyes dismissed the wrongful-death claim, stating that a reasonable juror could not conclude Walls-Kaufman's actions directly caused Smith's death, though the officer's family maintained that the assault contributed to his psychological trauma. The officer's death was determined to be in the line of duty by the District of Columbia Police and Firefighters' Retirement and Relief Board in 2022.</p>

          <p>The law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher conducted an internal investigation into allegations against San Jose State's transgender volleyball player, Blaire Fleming, for conspiring to injure a teammate. This investigation occurred during the same period that partners at the firm represented the Mountain West Conference in a legal request to maintain Fleming's eligibility to compete in women's college volleyball. The allegations stemmed from a Title IX complaint and a lawsuit claiming Fleming discussed plans to have teammate Brooke Slusser spiked in the face during a game. The Mountain West Conference investigation, led by Tim Heaphy, closed without finding sufficient evidence to corroborate the allegations of misconduct.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, the agreement quickly unraveled as Israel reported renewed missile launches from Iran. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that Israel would respond forcefully to any violation of the ceasefire, ordering the military to continue attacking Tehran. Iranian media denied launching missiles after the ceasefire took effect, while Israeli first responders reported casualties in Beersheba from an Iranian missile strike. The conflict between Israel and Iran, which began on June 13, has resulted in at least 974 deaths in Iran and 28 deaths in Israel.</p>

          <p>China is preparing to hold a large military parade in Beijing on September 3 to mark the 80th anniversary of the victory over Japan in World War II. The parade will showcase the People's Liberation Army's latest missile systems, weaponry, and aircraft, and it will include thousands of goose-stepping soldiers. These parades have become more frequent since Xi Jinping took power in 2012, reflecting a shift in China's defense strategy and foreign policy amidst intensifying geopolitical rivalry with the United States. The PLA has not fought a war since the 1990s, and these parades serve as a demonstration of its capabilities.</p>

The discovery highlights the dangerous conditions and the cruel nature of irregular migration routes, according to regional president Marga Prohens.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Vox article explores the decline of deep reading and its potential impact on politics, suggesting that the rise of digital media may be reverting society to an oral culture. The article references Walter Ong's theory on how oral and literate minds diverge, arguing that the digital age increasingly resembles pre-literate societies. Some analysts believe this reversion underlies political dysfunction, eroding commitment to pluralism, objectivity, and the rule of law. However, the article also acknowledges that writers may overestimate the social harms of cultural marginalization and that historical analogies can be misleading.</p>

The developer plans to install new windows, an energy-efficient roof, and updated light fixtures, as well as add a gazebo, resident gardens, and ADA-compliant sidewalks, but the authority's final decision will depend on addressing management concerns.</p>

          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts in 2024, certificate of deposit (CD) rates remain competitive, offering returns significantly higher than traditional savings accounts. As of June 24, 2025, the highest CD rate is 5.5% APY, offered by Gainbridge® on its 5-year CD, which requires a $1000 minimum opening deposit. Historically, longer-term CDs have offered higher interest rates, but this pattern doesn’t necessarily hold today, with the highest average CD rate for a 12-month term. When choosing a CD, consider factors beyond just the APY, such as the term length and any potential penalties for early withdrawal. (not investment advice)</p>

The author suggests that Democrats are elevating vulgar, cruel, and combative figures, mirroring Trump's corruption and disdain for the public. Cuomo's past allegations of sexual misconduct and his aggressive behavior as governor are highlighted as reasons he is unfit for leadership, yet the Democratic establishment is embracing him, which the author sees as a moral failure and a squandering of other talent.</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who resigned amid sexual harassment allegations, is running for mayor of New York City. Cuomo is considered a frontrunner in the Democratic primary, though he faces a strong challenge from Zohran Mamdani, a progressive state representative. Cuomo's campaign is heavily funded by wealthy donors, including some typically known for supporting Republicans, and he is focusing on his record as governor and promises to address crime and affordable housing. His rivals have highlighted the allegations that led to his resignation, but Cuomo maintains the complaints were politically motivated.</p>

The newly launched MateBook Fold Ultimate Design laptop features Huawei’s Kirin X90 system-on-a-chip (SoC), manufactured by SMIC using its 7-nm process node. This finding dampens speculation that Huawei had made the leap to SMIC’s 5-nm process, which is difficult to scale due to US sanctions.

          <p>A Vox article analyzes President Trump's declining popularity during his second term, noting that he is now the most unpopular he has been. The article suggests that Trump's popularity falls when he is at the center of the news, making high-profile efforts to pursue his agenda, and that when he recedes into the background, his popularity somewhat recovers. This creates a conundrum, as Trump is uniquely capable of capturing the limelight but also incapable of doing anything quietly. This trend may suggest that the public prefers inaction, which seems to be causing his popularity to decline.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times criticizes a statement from the Trump White House claiming that "blue-collar wage growth" saw the largest increase in nearly 60 years under Trump. The author argues that the claim is misleading and employs cherry-picking to lie with statistics, as it covers the first five months of the year, including the last three weeks of the Biden administration. The author questions the methodology and suggests that any measurable phenomenon likely reflects the Biden economy, not Trump's policies, and the author says that little of significance happens in the first five months of a new presidential term.</p>

          <p>One of the oldest movie studios in Los Angeles, Occidental Studios, is up for sale amid a drop in filming in the area and increasing competition from other locations. The potential sale reflects shifts in the entertainment industry, with rising competition from studios in other cities and countries, as well as the aftermath of filming slowdowns during the pandemic and industry strikes of 2023. The studio, which dates back to 1913, is being marketed to new-media businesses seeking a flagship location with historical significance, but it may also seek a long-term tenant to take over the studio.</p>

          <p>Literacy experts suggest that parents should not teach their 3-year-olds how to read, as children at that age learn language best through play and interaction with caregivers. While children can learn individual letters at a young age, it is not developmentally appropriate, and oral language skills are more valuable at this stage. Research suggests that ages 5 to 7 are the prime time to teach reading, as it requires a level of brain development that is not yet sufficient in younger children. Focusing on play, exploration, and language development in the early years can better prepare children for reading later on.</p>
