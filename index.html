          <p>Zia Yusuf's resignation as Reform UK's chairman is significant due to his central role in the party's rise since the general election. Yusuf, a self-made multi-millionaire, donated Â£200,000 to Reform and later became chairman. His heritage and organizational skills were crucial in broadening the party's appeal, but his management style caused friction within Reform. The party now faces the challenge of finding a new chairman who can help build the infrastructure needed for long-term electoral success. </p>

          <p>The world could be facing another 'China shock' due to overcapacity in Chinese manufacturing, leading to deflationary pressures globally. Chinese producers are offering steep discounts on exports, causing anxiety in Asia about being swamped by cheap imports. While this situation poses risks to local industries, it could also provide some relief to inflation-hit economies by lowering consumer costs. Economists predict that this influx of low-cost goods may prompt central banks to consider further rate cuts to stimulate growth. (not investment advice)</p>

He used his platform to speak out against authoritarianism and the atrocities of the Nazi regime, even after his German citizenship was revoked.

          <p>India's central bank has implemented a substantial interest rate cut, lowering its benchmark policy rate to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. The decision, exceeding market expectations, was driven by softening inflation and slower-than-desired growth amid global uncertainty. While the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate, it acknowledged potential risks from weather-related issues and evolving tariff concerns. Given the significant rate cut, the central bank indicated limited room for further monetary policy support and shifted its stance to neutral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erin Patterson, accused of cooking a fatal mushroom lunch, told her trial that she wanted the meal to be "special" for her relatives. Patterson's in-laws and another guest died after the lunch, while one guest recovered after being in a coma. Patterson denies intentionally poisoning her guests, claiming that the mushrooms may have been accidentally included from foraged ones. The prosecution argues that Patterson deliberately poisoned the food in a plot to kill her relatives. </p>

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban is part of a broader series of immigration restrictions implemented during his second term. The ban, which targets foreign nationals from 19 countries, follows measures such as suspending the asylum system and ending temporary legal residency for thousands. While the ban includes exemptions, it is expected to face legal challenges and disproportionately affect those seeking refuge. Experts note that the ban is more likely to withstand legal challenges compared to his first ban in 2017. </p>

The essay suggests that in a world focused on speed, there's value in knowing when to move with purpose and precision.
