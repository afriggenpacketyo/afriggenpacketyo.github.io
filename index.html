          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasts an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season for 2025, predicting 13 to 19 named storms, with 6 to 10 becoming hurricanes and 3 to 5 potentially major hurricanes. The article provides the list of names for the 2025 season, including Andrea, Barry, and Chantal, which are part of a rotating six-year cycle managed by the World Meteorological Organization. The practice of naming storms helps with communication and preparation efforts, and names of particularly devastating storms are retired. The list was last used in 2019 and will be used again in 2031, offering a system for tracking and discussing storms effectively. </p>

          <p>At least 31 people were killed and over 200 injured after Israeli forces opened fire near an aid distribution site west of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

Local witnesses suggested the shooting occurred around 1,000 yards from the aid site, which is run by the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.

          <p>Syrians are increasingly calling for peace with Israel, reflecting a notable shift in the country's political landscape as direct talks between Syria and Israel take place. Facilitated by the U.S., these discussions mark a departure from decades of hostility, influenced by a change in U.S. policy following President Trump's meeting with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Syrians express a desire to move beyond the Palestinian cause, focusing on their own country's interests and economic development.

Over half of LAFD's fire engines and nearly half of its ladder trucks are operating beyond their recommended lifespans.

          <p>The Trump administration is deporting individuals to countries they are not from, arguing their home countries won't accept them due to criminal records, sparking legal challenges. Tuan Thanh Phan, a Vietnamese man, was deported to South Sudan, a country with significant instability, despite plans for him to return to Vietnam. Immigration lawyers are suing, arguing that migrants need more time to contest deportations to third countries and should have a credible fear interview. The administration defends its actions by emphasizing public safety and international agreements, while critics argue it violates due process. </p>

This low-key attendance raised speculation and led to the absence of bilateral talks between China and other countries, including the US.
