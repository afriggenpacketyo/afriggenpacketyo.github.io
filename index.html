          <p>Severe flooding in Texas, caused by torrential rains, has resulted in at least 70 fatalities, with the majority occurring in Kerr County where dozens of children are among the dead. Search and rescue operations are ongoing for missing individuals, including several campers from the submerged Camp Mystic. In response to the disaster, President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for Kerr County, activating federal resources, including FEMA and the U.S. Coast Guard, to aid in the extensive response and recovery efforts underway.</p>

          <p>The devastating flash floods in central Texas, which have claimed nearly 70 lives, underscore the difficulties in predicting extreme weather events amplified by climate change. Despite timely warnings from the National Weather Service, the rainfall's intensity, equivalent to a rare 1-in-1,000-year event, far exceeded initial forecasts. The article notes that while forecasters identified record atmospheric moisture, precisely predicting the location and volume of such historic downpours remains a significant challenge, compounded by staffing shortages at federal agencies.</p>

          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Sonay Kartal and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova was halted after the electronic line-calling system failed to make a call on a crucial point. The malfunction occurred when a Kartal shot went visibly long, but no audio call was made, forcing the chair umpire to order a replay of the point. Pavlyuchenkova, who eventually won the match, expressed frustration, stating a game was 'stolen' from her and questioning why the umpire didn't overrule the system's error, though the All England Club defended the procedure.</p>

          <p>In a joint declaration, leaders of the BRICS nations condemned recent military strikes on Iran but refrained from directly attributing blame to the United States or Israel. The statement expressed grave concern over the attacks and called for a de-escalation of violence in the Middle East. While supporting a two-state solution for Palestine, the declaration also directly criticized Israel for its occupation of Palestinian territory and called for its withdrawal from Syria's Golan Heights, a region formally annexed by Israel in 1981.</p>

          <p>The desperation caused by Libya's broken healthcare system is highlighted by the story of a 7-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis whose family undertook a dangerous boat journey to Italy to find treatment. After failing to get necessary medication in politically fractured Libya, the family's plight went viral online, prompting a hollow promise of aid from the Libyan government. The story illustrates a wider crisis where Libyans are forced into irregular migration for basic healthcare, a system failure that human rights groups say is a grave indictment of the state.</p>

          <p>Military experts writing in the official PLA Daily newspaper argue that the Chinese military requires significant structural changes to effectively counter modern drone threats. The article suggests that China will likely establish specialized counter-drone units capable of rapid responses, addressing the inefficiencies of traditional units. This analysis comes as unmanned aerial vehicles have played an increasingly decisive role in recent conflicts, including the war in Ukraine and clashes between Israel and Iran, prompting a strategic shift in military planning.</p>

          <p>In his latest book, acclaimed biographer Ron Chernow delves into the complex life of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, one of America's most enduring literary figures. The article explores Twain's journey from a boy in Hannibal, Missouri, to a global celebrity whose sardonic humor was rooted in personal pain and a lifelong fear of poverty. Chernow argues that Twain's work remains relevant because he engaged so deeply with timeless American themes of race, class, politics, and corruption, making him a vital presence even today.</p>

          <p>Renowned documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has described the White House's push to eliminate federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as "shortsighted" and "misguided." In an interview, Burns argued against the perception that public media like PBS and NPR are left-wing, noting they primarily serve rural areas where they may be the only available broadcast signal. He stressed that these cuts threaten essential services like children's programming, educational content, and emergency information, which are vital to communities across the country.

          <p>European Union leaders are in a critical week of negotiations to secure a trade deal with the United States and avert President Trump's threatened tariffs of up to 50% on EU imports. With a July 9 deadline approaching, the EU is aiming for a framework agreement similar to the one the UK secured, as a comprehensive deal appears unattainable. A split has emerged among member states, with some, like Germany, favoring a quick deal to avoid a trade war, while others, like France, are wary of an imbalanced agreement.

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico in northern Peru, which is believed to have been a vital trading hub for early American civilizations. The site, located about 200km north of Lima, likely connected communities from the Pacific coast, the Andes, and the Amazon basin. Researchers say the discovery is significant for understanding the development of societies after the decline of the Caral, the oldest known civilization in the Americas, and sheds new light on ancient trade networks and cultural exchange.</p>
