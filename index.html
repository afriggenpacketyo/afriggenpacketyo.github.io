          <p>A man has been found guilty for his involvement in a gang-related shooting in Hackney, London, that was part of a feud between rival Turkish gangs. The attack resulted in a nine-year-old girl suffering life-changing injuries when a bullet struck her in the head as she dined with her family. The court also convicted the man of attempting to murder three men who were the intended targets at the outdoor restaurant. The girl's mother described the devastating impact on her daughter, who now lives with a titanium plate in her skull and a bullet still lodged in her brain.</p>

Zelenskyy, while expressing a desire for a lasting peace, emphasized the need for reliable security guarantees, referencing the failure of past agreements.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of the 2025 season, has re-strengthened into a Category 4 storm and is expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast. While the storm's core is forecast to pass between Bermuda and the U.S. without making landfall, its large size will still generate dangerous coastal conditions. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for the Turks and Caicos and parts of the Bahamas. Officials in North Carolina's Outer Banks have issued evacuation orders for some zones due to the risk of high waves and flooding.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a downturn, with Bitcoin falling to around $115,000 after reaching a new record high last week. The price drop was triggered by investor concerns over higher-than-expected wholesale inflation data, which cast doubt on a potential Federal Reserve rate cut. This sentiment led to over $500 million in forced liquidations of long positions, with traders being forced to sell their assets to cover debts. The broader crypto market also declined as investors await further economic signals from the upcoming Federal Reserve symposium. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swiss watchmaker Swatch has issued an apology and withdrawn a global advertisement that featured an Asian male model making a "slanted-eye" gesture. The ad sparked a significant backlash on Chinese social media, with many users accusing the brand of racism and calling for a boycott of its products. Despite the apology, criticism has continued, highlighting the sensitivity of marketing in China, a major market for the company. This incident follows similar controversies faced by other Western luxury brands like Dolce & Gabbana and Dior in recent years for culturally insensitive advertising.</p>

          <p>Doctors at a Shanghai hospital have successfully saved a patient who suffered a near-decapitation injury in an accident involving a robotic arm. The patient's cervical vertebrae were severed and crucial neurovascular structures were damaged, leading to immediate paralysis and a heart attack.

          <p>Director Francis Ford Coppola has undertaken a six-city tour to promote and discuss the themes of his self-funded epic, "Megalopolis," which was a critical and commercial failure upon its 2024 release. The events, featuring unmoderated discussions and whiteboard presentations, represent an unusual attempt by a creator to personally cultivate a cult following for their own work. While some film experts find the director's active facilitation of a fanbase atypical, the tour has drawn sold-out crowds, suggesting a fascination with Coppola's process and self-mythology. The film itself remains difficult to access legally in North America.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Giants center fielder Jung Hoo Lee made a spectacular and unusual catch during a game against the Tampa Bay Rays, which commentators have dubbed the "catch of the decade." While sliding for a deep fly ball, Lee appeared to have the ball deflect off his glove but managed to secure it between his legs for the out. The play left both commentators and his manager amazed, with manager Bob Melvin initially fearing Lee had been injured. Lee, who is in his second season, described the play as a "funny catch" that was influenced by heavy winds.</p>

This trend is a reversal from the high rates of job hopping seen in 2021 and 2022, and is reflected in a low quits rate, a barometer of worker confidence. A cooling labor market, slower job growth, and global instability are contributing factors, causing employees to be more cautious about seeking new opportunities.

While companies promise economic benefits and jobs, Native American tribes and environmental groups are strongly opposed. They argue the projects threaten sacred sites, risk contaminating waterways with chemicals like cyanide, and will permanently scar the treasured landscape. The debate highlights the tension between economic development and the preservation of cultural heritage and the environment in a region historically contested between the U.S. government and the Lakota Sioux.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Sportswear Firm Xtep Reports Record Profit Driven by Marathon Boom</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 06:30:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese sportswear company Xtep International announced a record interim net profit of 913.6 million yuan, a 6.4 percent increase from the previous year. The growth was largely fueled by a surge in sales for its professional running shoe brands, Saucony and Merrell, which saw a 32.5 percent jump in revenue. This success is attributed to a marathon boom in China, where the company has effectively marketed its high-end running gear. The strong performance of its professional segment validates the company's strategy of acquiring full control of the brands' distribution in China.</p>

          <p>At least seven people were shot and killed by gunmen at a pool hall in the Ecuadoran city of Santo Domingo, marking the latest massacre in the nation's struggle with escalating gang violence. Security footage reportedly showed masked attackers opening fire on people at the entrance before continuing the assault inside. This incident follows a similar pool hall attack last month and another mass shooting at a cockfighting ring in April. Ecuador, once peaceful, has been destabilized by transnational drug cartels using its ports for shipping, leading to a dramatic increase in its homicide rate.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times opinion piece argues that President Trump's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense system is a massively expensive and strategically flawed venture. The author compares the estimated $175 billion project to France's failed Maginot Line, suggesting it misapplies lessons from Israel's smaller-scale "Iron Dome" to the vastly different challenge of defending the U.S. from global threats. The article contends that the system would be vulnerable to advanced evasive missiles and drone swarms, and that its exorbitant cost is unconscionable given other national priorities.

          <p>A fisherman using a sonar device on the Mississippi River in Minnesota has likely solved the 57-year-old disappearance of Roy Benn. The fisherman discovered a submerged 1960s-era Buick and alerted authorities. Upon recovering the severely deteriorated vehicle, investigators found human remains inside and used the VIN to identify it as belonging to Benn, who was reported missing in 1967. The remains are pending official identification, but authorities believe they belong to Benn and have notified his remaining family, bringing potential closure to the decades-old case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Veterinarians and public health experts are noting a significant increase in the percentage of dogs in California testing positive for exposure to anaplasmosis, a bacterial disease spread by the same tick that transmits Lyme disease. According to the Companion Animal Parasite Council, the rate nearly tripled between 2021 and 2024. Because dogs are more frequently bitten by ticks and tested for such diseases, they serve as sentinels for human risk. The rise is attributed to factors including climate change, which allows ticks to expand their territory, and increased development in animal habitats.</p>

          <p>The number of active short-term rental registrations in Los Angeles has seen a notable decrease over the past year, dropping by 6% according to city data. Hosts cite increasingly complex regulations, the threat of significant fines, and the general hassle of frequent guest turnover as reasons for delisting their properties. Some homeowners are shifting to mid-term rentals (stays of 30 days or more) as a less regulated alternative. The decline is also influenced by recent wildfires that removed rental properties from the market in affected areas like Pacific Palisades and Altadena.</p>

          <p>Despite some public calls for cancellation due to local issues, Los Angeles is legally and financially locked into hosting the 2028 Olympic Games. The Host City Contract signed with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not provide an exit clause for the city and would expose it to billions of dollars in potential lawsuits for breach of contract. Unlike Denver, which withdrew from the 1976 Winter Games before such contracts were ironclad, L.A. faces immense liability. With most of its sponsorship goal met and venues already in place, preparations are far advanced, making a withdrawal practically unfeasible.</p>
