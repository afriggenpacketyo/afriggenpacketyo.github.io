          <p>David and Victoria Beckham were recently photographed showing strong affection while on vacation, presenting a united front despite an ongoing, widely reported rift with their son Brooklyn and his wife, Nicola Peltz. The family tension, which reportedly began around the time of the couple's 2022 wedding, persists despite attempts at reconciliation. This public display of their enduring bond comes as the couple celebrates their 26th wedding anniversary, signaling the strength of their personal relationship even as broader family challenges remain a point of public interest and speculation.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that any peace deal negotiated between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin without Ukraine's direct involvement would be a "dead decision." He firmly rejected the idea of ceding any Ukrainian territory, a concept Trump had suggested could be part of a potential deal. The statement comes as a summit between Trump and Putin is being planned for Alaska, raising concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about being marginalized in negotiations to end the ongoing war with Russia.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested numerous protesters at a demonstration in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the UK's Terrorism Act. The government banned the organization in July, making public support for it a criminal offense punishable by significant prison time. The protest was organized by the group Defend Our Juries, with participants holding signs stating "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action." The police had issued a public warning that any such displays would lead to arrests.</p>

          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are experiencing a resurgence by replacing vacant anchor stores like Sears with unconventional tenants such as churches, bowling alleys, and expanded bookstores. This strategy aims to transform malls into community hubs, driving what is known as "cross-shopping" and increasing foot traffic from diverse demographics, including Gen Z. Landlords are subdividing large retail spaces for a mix of entertainment, dining, and service-oriented businesses, a trend that data suggests is successfully revitalizing once-declining enclosed malls across the country.</p>

          <p>Roland Mehrez Beainy, the owner of the "Trump Burger" restaurant chain in Texas, has been detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and is facing deportation. Beainy, a Lebanese national, allegedly overstayed his visa, which expired in February 2024. ICE stated that enforcement actions are applied regardless of political beliefs, even as Beainy's pro-Trump establishment gained national attention for its theme and support of the former president. This case highlights the Trump administration's stringent immigration policies, which have affected some of his own supporters.</p>

While theoretically possible and intriguing to physicists, the concept is entirely speculative, as commercial-scale fusion reactors do not yet exist. The proposal revives a centuries-old dream, but this time it is grounded in nuclear physics rather than mystical pursuits.</p>

          <p>A captain with the Los Angeles County Fire Department is facing multiple felony charges for allegedly faking a work-related injury to fraudulently collect over $25,000 in disability insurance payments. Prosecutors allege that Thomas Merryman submitted forged documents, including a physician's note, to an insurance company for an injury that could not have occurred because he was not on duty at the time. The district attorney's office stated that fraudulent disability claims by public servants will not be tolerated, as they undermine the system for those with legitimate needs.</p>

          <p>The annual Perseid meteor shower, a popular summer astronomical event, is expected to be less spectacular this year during its peak on August 12-13. According to NASA, a bright full moon will coincide with the peak, its light likely washing out the view of all but the brightest meteors. The Perseids originate from debris left by the Swift-Tuttle comet and are known for their bright fireballs. While viewing conditions are not ideal, skygazers in the Northern Hemisphere might still catch a few meteors in the predawn hours.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Frustrated by government inaction, a group of volunteers in Los Angeles' Sawtelle neighborhood painted their own crosswalks at an intersection they deemed dangerous. The Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) quickly removed the unsanctioned markings, citing liability concerns and the need for comprehensive studies before any installation. The incident highlights a broader issue of low "state capacity" in Los Angeles, where bureaucratic processes delay or prevent the delivery of basic public services. After public pressure, the city did repaint the crosswalks, but the underlying systemic inefficiency remains a major challenge.</p>

The Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) Road provides critical access to the border area where deadly clashes with China have previously occurred. Additionally, India is constructing an alternative route to reduce reliance on the primary road.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that while the Trump administration is complicit in the current famine in Gaza, the groundwork was laid by the preceding Biden administration. The author contends that President Biden repeatedly failed to use U.S. leverage to prevent Israel from using starvation as a weapon of war, despite numerous warnings from the UN and aid groups. The article claims the Biden administration undermined humanitarian efforts, flouted U.S. laws banning arms shipments to countries blocking aid, and ultimately enabled the catastrophe. The author concludes this complicity is a significant stain on Biden's presidential legacy.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the legal and political implications of Texas Republicans asking the FBI to help locate Democratic state lawmakers who fled the state to block a redistricting bill. The author argues that FBI involvement would be a lawless overreach of its authority, as its jurisdiction is limited to federal crimes, not enforcing civil state warrants. Such an action would transform the FBI into a political tool for the party in power, undermining a core democratic norm. The piece frames this as a critical test of whether the FBI can remain a neutral law enforcement agency.</p>

          <p>This opinion column notes the irony of Vice President JD Vance decrying partisan gerrymandering in California while his own party has heavily utilized the practice in states like Texas. The author agrees with Vance's principle that representation should not be so warped but points out that Texas Republicans have created maps that disproportionately favor them. The piece argues that gerrymandering is a bipartisan problem that ultimately harms democracy by eliminating moderate voices and entrenching partisan power, citing the case of a moderate Republican whose district was eliminated by Democrats.</p>
