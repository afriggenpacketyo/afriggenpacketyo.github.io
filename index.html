          <h2>Missouri Lawmakers Push to Repeal Abortion Rights Amendment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 19:33:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Missouri Republican lawmakers have approved a referendum to repeal the abortion-rights amendment approved by voters last year, seeking to ban most abortions except in cases of sexual assault, incest, or medical emergencies. The proposed constitutional amendment, which also prohibits gender transition surgeries for minors, will go back to voters in November 2026 or sooner if the governor calls a special election. This action follows a dramatic swing in Missouri's abortion policies, where a near-total ban was triggered after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, but voters later approved an amendment guaranteeing abortion rights until fetal viability. Protesters opposing the ban were removed from the Senate chamber after the vote.</p>

          <p>Rosa Chang, a Korean-born artist, is teaching Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) students the centuries-old tradition of indigo and natural dyeing. Her class, "Mindful Colors: Natural Dyes from Korea and Beyond," explores the relationship between color and nature, using plants like indigo and marigold to create various hues. Chang, who grew tired of the toxic fabrics in the fashion industry, emphasizes indigo's cultural significance and medicinal benefits. Students are working on final projects that showcase the skills they've learned, appreciating the sustainability and historical process involved in natural dyeing. Chang also wrote a children's book, "My Indigo World," to honor her ancestors and share the science and history behind indigo dye.</p>

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber has voluntarily taken a 25% pay cut for the 2025-26 school year due to funding cuts imposed by the Trump administration. Other leaders at Harvard are also making voluntary contributions to address the financial challenges. This action follows a hiring pause and scrutiny of discretionary spending at the university. The Trump administration froze $2.2 billion in funding after accusing Harvard of failing to uphold civil rights laws and foster an environment of intellectual creativity, demanding reforms in governance, leadership, and admissions practices. Harvard has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the funding freeze, with Garber stating the university will not comply with demands that dictate what it can teach or who it can admit.</p>

          <p>Becky Hill, the former court clerk who handled Alex Murdaugh's trial, has been arrested and charged with misconduct in office, obstruction of justice, and perjury. The charges stem from allegations that she misused her position for personal gain, shared sealed information with a reporter, and made false statements under oath. Murdaugh's lawyers had previously requested a new trial, claiming Hill improperly influenced the jury, though a judge denied the request. Hill resigned from her position in March 2024, and the State Ethics Commission found probable cause that she misused her position to enrich herself and promote a book about the trial.</p>

This growth is attributed to new clients and increased demand for infrastructure, including a significant deal with OpenAI. Despite the positive revenue, CoreWeave's net loss widened due to stock-based compensation costs, and the stock price initially dipped before stabilizing.

The investigation also revealed that a deckhand delayed waking the captain, posting a video of the approaching storm on social media instead.

          <p>Wisconsin judge Hannah Dugan has been indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly helping a man evade immigration authorities, escalating a clash between the Trump administration and local officials. Dugan is accused of obstructing justice and concealing a person from arrest after she allegedly escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, who was in the U.S. illegally, out of her courtroom through a back door to avoid ICE agents. Dugan has filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing she is entitled to judicial immunity, while prosecutors maintain she acted unlawfully. The state Supreme Court has suspended Dugan from the bench pending the outcome of the case.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem faced criticism from House Democrats during a hearing on the department's 2026 budget, with Ranking Member Bennie Thompson stating it's a "sad day for DHS" under her leadership. Democrats accused Noem of breaking the law and making America less safe, particularly regarding immigration policies. The hearing addressed incidents such as members of Congress attempting to access a detention center and the deportation of individuals, including children. Noem defended the Trump administration's border control efforts and argued that ICE arrests are conducted with due process, while Republicans highlighted what they described as "total operational control" of the southern border.</p>

The proposal also includes a $100 monthly premium for adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" already on Medi-Cal, starting in 2027.
