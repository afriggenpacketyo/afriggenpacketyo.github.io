          <p>Several European auto manufacturers, including Stellantis, Mercedes, Volvo Cars, and Porsche, have either withdrawn or lowered their financial guidance for the year, citing uncertainties stemming from President Trump's trade tariffs. Stellantis, owner of brands like Jeep and Dodge, withdrew its full-year guidance, while Mercedes scrapped its 2025 earnings forecast due to tariff-related volatility. Volvo Cars, heavily reliant on European imports, also ditched its financial guidance for 2025 and 2026, implementing cost-cutting measures. Volkswagen, however, maintained its guidance but expects results at the lower end of forecasts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Growing opposition to Israel's ongoing war in Gaza is emerging from within the country, with thousands of Israeli reservists signing letters demanding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government halt the fighting and prioritize a deal to secure the release of remaining hostages held by Hamas. The reservists, including former Mossad chief Danny Yatom, express concerns that Netanyahu is prioritizing his own interests over national interests and the hostages' well-being. Some reservists are refusing to return to service, causing a looming crisis for the military. Critics argue that the war's continuation undermines Israel's claim of maintaining the most moral army in the world.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the University of Glasgow have confirmed the increasing presence of mosquitoes in Scotland, identifying over 20 different species, including some found as far north as Shetland. The findings come from a citizen science project where the public reported sightings of nuisance biting insects, initially suspected to be midges or clegs. The research team used traps to monitor mosquito populations across the country. The insects are most often spotted in woodland areas, particularly pine forests in the east, though they are often found inland in our biggest cities.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis argues that the U.S. military, despite possessing advanced equipment, lacks the necessary personnel and resources to sustain a large-scale war. The authors contend that the armed forces are equipped only for short, high-intensity conflicts, and that modern warfare requires both advanced systems and a large volume of staple munitions. They highlight the military's struggle to maintain adequate stocks of ammunition and precision-guided missiles. The analysis urges Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to prioritize resources that directly strengthen combat power, such as active service members, ammunition, new ships, and aircraft.</p>

          <p>Several individuals who fled authoritarian regimes are expressing concern over President Trump's tactics, drawing parallels to the methods used in their home countries. They cite instances of government agents aggressively questioning people returning to the U.S., the targeting of news organizations critical of the president, and the suppression of dissent. Some immigrants, however, believe Trump is not behaving like an autocrat, while others feel that some of the administration's tactics reminded them of those used by the regimes they fled. The varied perspectives highlight the complex experiences of immigrants under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>India's developing trade deal with the United States and its ongoing conflict with Pakistan could hinder the recovery of ties between New Delhi and Beijing. While China-India relations had been improving, these issues could add complexity, potentially complicating China's broader efforts to engage with the developing world. President Trump announced a tariff rate on Indian imports, prompting India to move quickly on an economic deal with Washington. The situation presents challenges for China's diplomatic and economic strategies in the region.</p>

          <p>A California Assembly committee modified a controversial bill that aimed to end solar credits for owners of rooftop solar systems, narrowing its scope to only apply to those who sell their homes. The original bill would have limited the program's benefits to 10 years, but the committee removed that provision after concerns were raised about legal challenges. The bill is intended to address the rising electric bills for those without solar panels, which are attributed to the credits given to rooftop solar owners. Opponents argue that the bill would reduce the value of homes with solar panels and that electric bills are rising due to excessive utility spending.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris, in her first major public remarks since leaving office, criticized President Trump's tariff policies as "reckless" and a potential cause of recession. Speaking at a gala event in San Francisco, Harris said the tariffs would increase everyday costs and impact retirement accounts and small businesses. She also warned that if the system of checks and balances in the government falls apart, the country would face a constitutional crisis. Harris praised individuals standing up to the Trump administration, including those speaking out about deportations without due process and judges upholding the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Japan's central bank held its policy rate at 0.5% for a second straight meeting, citing concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs on the country's economy. While inflation has remained above the BOJ's 2% target, allowing for potential rate increases, the trade tensions have complicated the central bank's plans. The BOJ stated it will continue to raise its policy rate "if our economic and price forecasts are realised." The central bank expects inflation to range between 2-2.5% in fiscal year 2025 and 1.5 to 2% in fiscal year 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

Democratic Senator Tim Kaine criticized Republicans for preventing a future vote on the resolution, arguing that the American public needs to know who to blame for the economic consequences of the tariffs.
