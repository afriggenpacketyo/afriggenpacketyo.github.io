          <p>President Trump announced a plan to impose a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors and chips, aiming to encourage domestic production. Companies currently building or committed to establishing manufacturing facilities in the United States will be exempt from this new duty. This policy is part of a broader effort to onshore supply chains for critical technologies, though specific criteria for the exemption have not been fully detailed. The move directly impacts major technology firms and the global semiconductor industry, signaling a significant shift in trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

The new measure, set to take effect on August 27, is part of a U.S. strategy to increase economic pressure on nations trading with Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. India's foreign ministry has called the tariff "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable," stating that its oil imports from Russia began after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe.</p>

The suspect, identified as 28-year-old Quornelius Radford, reportedly used his personal weapon in the attack. Officials stated that all five victims are in stable condition and expected to recover, with three requiring surgery. The motive for the shooting is still under investigation by the Army's Criminal Investigative Division, but authorities have indicated there is no reason to believe it is related to terrorism.</p>

In a bizarre turn of events, recreation officials reported that the same woman returned to the park the following morning and was arrested while attempting to climb back onto the same roof. Park staff expressed their surprise, noting that the incident was unlike anything they had seen in decades of service.</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombings, new and historical photos contrast the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 with their vibrant present-day cityscapes. The bombings, which led to Japan's surrender in World War II, caused an estimated 210,000 deaths by the end of that year. Today, structures like the Hiroshima Peace Memorial's dome stand as solemn reminders of the event. At a recent ceremony, Hiroshima's mayor spoke of the enduring lessons of the tragedy amid rising global tensions and the continued threat of nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>Cosmetics company E.l.f. Beauty reported a 30% drop in net income for its first fiscal quarter, falling to $33.3 million. The company, which sources about 75% of its products from China, attributed the decline to the impact of new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Citing uncertainty around future trade policy, E.l.f. declined to provide a full-year revenue forecast. Despite the profit decline, the company's revenue and adjusted earnings per share still beat Wall Street expectations, though revenue growth has slowed compared to previous years.

          <p>This article compares the earning potential of a $10,000 deposit in a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) versus a money market account. With current rates, a CD at 4.45% APY would earn slightly more over six months than a money market account at 4.32% APY. The key difference is that the CD rate is fixed, guaranteeing the return, whereas the money market account rate is variable and likely to decrease if the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates. This makes a CD a more predictable option for maximizing interest in the short term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida's largest utility, Florida Power & Light (FPL), is seeking a rate hike of almost $10 billion over the next four years, a proposal that could be the largest in U.S. history. FPL argues the increase is necessary to ensure grid reliability and invest in solar generation and battery storage. However, environmental and consumer advocacy groups oppose the plan, arguing it would exacerbate the state's affordability crisis and primarily serve to boost shareholder profits.

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's attempts to shift media focus away from his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The author argues that tactics such as ordering supporters to stop discussing the topic, creating distractions, and selectively releasing information have largely failed and may have increased scrutiny. Actions like the Justice Department's release of spliced jail footage and the mystery surrounding a canceled high-level meeting have only fueled more questions. The analysis suggests that the president's handling of the situation continues to draw attention back to the matter.</p>

The administration accused the university of fostering a hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli students. UCLA's chancellor stated that the suspension of funds from agencies like the NIH and NSF would be "devastating" for life-saving research. This action follows a recent trend of the administration targeting universities over issues of antisemitism and comes after UCLA settled a related lawsuit with Jewish students.</p>

          <p>This analysis explores the predicament facing the Democratic party regarding redistricting, as Republicans, urged by President Trump, aggressively pursue mid-decade gerrymandering in states like Texas. For years, Democrats championed nonpartisan commissions to draw political maps, a move that has now limited their ability to retaliate in blue states like New York and California. This has led to a reassessment of their good-government stance, with some Democrats now arguing for a more aggressive counter-strategy to prevent what they fear could be permanent one-party control of the House.</p>
