          <p>Stord, an Atlanta-based logistics startup, has acquired Ware2Go, a UPS subsidiary, to enhance its e-commerce capabilities and challenge Amazon's dominance. The acquisition aims to provide smaller businesses with the infrastructure needed to compete with Amazon's Prime service, particularly in checkout and fulfillment. Stord's founder, Sean Henry, emphasizes the importance of scale in logistics and the need for independent merchants to offer rapid delivery services, which is a critical factor for competing with larger companies. The acquisition will help Stord level the playing field by offering infrastructure for smaller businesses to checkout and fulfill orders more quickly. </p>

          <p>India is experiencing a growing boycott of Turkey due to Ankara's support for Pakistan in the recent conflict between the two nations, affecting tourism, trade, education, and aviation. Social media campaigns have fueled public outrage, leading to a significant drop in tourism bookings to Turkey and the suspension of services by travel platforms. Indian traders are also rejecting Turkish goods, and educational institutions are canceling agreements with Turkish universities. While analysts believe the boycotts may have a limited impact on bilateral trade, continued tensions and Turkey's perceived lack of impartiality in the Kashmir dispute could hinder future relations between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Federal investigators are expected to provide an update on the Mexican navy ship CuauhtÃ©moc that crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in two deaths and multiple injuries. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is collecting evidence to determine the cause of the incident, while commercial water traffic in the area remains suspended. Preliminary reports suggest the ship lost power before the collision, causing it to strike the bridge and snap its masts. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has refuted claims that staffing cuts impacted the Coast Guard's ability to prevent the accident, asserting that Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) was fully functional during the incident.</p>

          <p>Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio suggests that Moody's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating understates the real threat to U.S. Treasuries, as the agency does not account for the risk of the government printing money to cover its debts. Dalio explains that while credit ratings assess the risk of default, they fail to consider the potential for currency devaluation due to excessive money printing. U.S. stocks declined as Treasury yields rose in response to Moody's downgrade, and Dalio warns that the risks for U.S. government debt are greater than conveyed by rating agencies. Bridgewater's assets under management have decreased significantly since 2021.</p>

          <p>Nigerian women are advocating for a new legislation, the 'Reserved Seat for Women bill,' to address their underrepresentation in parliament, where they hold only a small fraction of seats. Gender rights advocates argue that the current political landscape systemically excludes women, and the bill would reserve a specific number of seats for women in federal and state legislatures. Supporters believe that increasing women's participation in government could lead to more equitable policies and a more stable economy. Despite having prominent women in international roles, Nigeria ranks poorly in women's representation in national parliaments, prompting calls for urgent action to align with global democratic norms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts explain that home equity loans and HELOCs have different interest rates due to the fixed versus variable nature of the rates, the flexibility of draw periods, and secondary market requirements. Home equity loans typically have higher, fixed rates because lenders assume the risk of future rate increases, while HELOCs offer lower, variable rates that adjust with economic conditions. The flexible draw periods of HELOCs allow lenders to manage capital more dynamically, often resulting in lower initial rates. Home equity loans are frequently sold to outside investors, driving higher fixed-rate pricing, while HELOCs are kept on banks' balance sheets, resulting in lower starting rates.

          <p>Britain and the European Union have reached a significant agreement to enhance security cooperation and reduce trade barriers imposed after Brexit, signaling a potential reset in relations. The deal, politically sensitive for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, involves concessions on fishing rights and adherence to European standards for food exports. Key aspects include easier border crossings for British citizens, streamlined pet travel, and the resumption of some British meat product sales in the EU. The agreement also includes plans for a "youth experience" program to facilitate travel and work opportunities for young Europeans in Britain and vice versa, though details are still under negotiation.</p>

          <p>Portugal's center-right Democratic Alliance has secured a victory in a snap election, allowing it to continue ruling as a minority government; however, the most notable outcome was the significant rise of the hard-right Chega party, which garnered over 22 percent of the vote. Chega's surge marks a shift in Portugal's political landscape, as it becomes a potent force that will likely pressure the government to adopt more right-leaning stances on issues like immigration. The election results highlight a broader trend in Western Europe, where hard-right parties are gaining traction by capitalizing on anti-immigration sentiment and economic resentments. Despite the center-right's victory, the lack of acceptable coalition partners will continue to pose challenges.</p>

          <p>A new agreement between the UK and the EU aims to "reset" their relationship, potentially boosting economic growth by reducing trade barriers, especially for food producers. The deal simplifies regulations on plant and animal health, which should ease the export of over 1,500 products. While the government claims this agreement could add Â£8.9 billion to the UK economy by 2040, it would only recoup a fraction of the GDP lost due to Brexit. A key concession from the UK was extending the fisheries agreement by 12 years, disappointing some fishing communities, but the SPS agreement is likely to help reverse the loss of fish exports.</p>

          <p>The remains of Pattie Wu-Murad, a Connecticut woman who disappeared during a solo hiking trip in Japan in April 2023, have been recovered. After an extensive search yielded no results, Wu-Murad's backpack and a hiking shoe were found near a stream in September 2024. Earlier this year, a member of the original search team discovered additional personal items and remains, which were later confirmed to be Wu-Murad through DNA testing. The family expressed their gratitude for the support they received and hope that more evidence will be found to clarify the circumstances of her death.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire mother, Heather Strong, discovered she had a rare heart condition, Atrial Septal Defect (ASD), after suffering two strokes at a young age, and her experience led her to have her family checked, revealing that two of her three adult daughters also had the same condition. All three women underwent a quick, outpatient procedure to close the holes in their hearts, performed by the same doctor, Dr. Carey Kimmelstiel, at Tufts Medical Center. The Strong family hopes their experience will encourage others to get checked for any health concerns and to face them head on, as early detection and treatment can prevent future strokes and other complications.</p>

          <p>Transgender service members are facing a difficult decision following the Supreme Court's ruling that allows the Trump administration to enforce its ban on transgender individuals in the military: either voluntarily separate from the military or risk being discharged. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a memo outlining the voluntary separation process for service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and a new memo details how commanders will identify and refer individuals for health check-ups that could lead to removal. Advocates argue that enforcing the ban causes irreparable harm to careers, while the administration maintains that expressing a false gender identity cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.</p>

          <p>Newly released audio from the investigation into former President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents reveals instances where Biden struggled to recall dates of key events, including the death of his son, Beau. The audio is from Robert Hur's investigation, which took place shortly after the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, and it captures Biden pausing and appearing to struggle with details. The Biden administration had previously resisted releasing the audio, but the Trump administration has now done so, rejecting arguments that disclosing such evidence could prevent future cooperation from high-profile subjects. The release follows reports of Biden's inner circle allegedly shielding aspects of his diminishing mental capacities during his presidency.</p>

While some Okinawans are indifferent or even supportive of the US military, others express anger over sexual assault allegations and crimes committed by American soldiers. Despite the economic benefits and jobs provided by the bases, critics argue that they contribute to Okinawa's status as Japan's poorest prefecture and make the island a target for China.

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on auto parts are causing significant job losses in Windsor, Ontario, the heart of Canada's auto-making industry. Many smaller auto-parts plants, which employ around 9,000 workers, are struggling due to the 25 percent tariffs on imported autos and some auto parts. While automakers are unlikely to move assembly plants, there is growing concern that tariffs will devastate parts makers, leading to layoffs and economic hardship. The tariffs have created uncertainty and complexity for businesses, making it difficult to plan and maintain competitiveness in the integrated North American auto industry.</p>

          <p>The European Union has reduced its economic growth forecast for 2025 by nearly half a percent, citing trade uncertainty from President Trumpâ€™s tariffs as a major factor. The European Commission now projects a GDP growth of only 0.9 percent for the euro area and 1.1 percent for the entire EU, with Germany particularly affected by declining exports. While growth is expected to return in 2026, that projection has also been scaled back. Increased spending on armaments and the military could help spur more growth across Europe, but the threat of natural disasters related to climate change remains a risk.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) has criticized the UK government's deal with the EU on fishing access as a "total capitulation" that undermines future negotiations. The agreement, which extends existing access for EU boats in exchange for reduced checks on food exports, has sparked concerns about the UK losing leverage and the EU continuing to take a disproportionate share of resources in UK waters. While some sectors, like salmon farming, welcome the deal for cutting red tape, others view it as a betrayal that sacrifices the fishing industry for broader political gains. The UK government has announced a Â£360m fund to invest in coastal communities as part of the agreement.</p>

          <p>Petronet LNG, India's top gas importer, anticipates an increase in the country's liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports in the coming months to meet the growing demand for electricity. The increase is due to emergency measures asking companies to operate underutilized gas-based power plants at higher capacity from May 26-June 30 to meet electricity demand in the country. The narrowing price gap between spot and long-term LNG prices is also pushing some companies to step up purchases, he said, adding Indian customers prefer LNG prices at below $10 per million British thermal units.
