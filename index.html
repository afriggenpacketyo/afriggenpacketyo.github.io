          <h2>Author Claims New Evidence Solves 500-Year-Old Mystery of the Princes in the Tower</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 11:34:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book by author Philippa Langley, who previously helped locate the remains of King Richard III, presents a controversial theory about the two young princes who vanished from the Tower of London in the 15th century. Langley's 'Missing Princes Project' argues that, contrary to the popular narrative popularized by Shakespeare, the boys were not murdered by their uncle, Richard III. Instead, she claims to have uncovered extensive archival evidence suggesting both princes survived and lived under different identities. This re-evaluation of history challenges the long-held belief of Richard III's guilt, attributing the child-killer narrative to propaganda from the subsequent Tudor dynasty.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act, establishing the first significant federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the United States. The legislation, which passed with bipartisan support, primarily targets the $250 billion stablecoin market, aiming to create clearer rules for digital currencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The bill was part of a broader "Crypto Week" in Congress that also saw the passage of legislation to regulate other digital commodities and prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a retail central bank digital currency. The signing ceremony occurred amid ongoing political pressure regarding the release of files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 11:30:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that grants it significant access to valuable oil reserves in Guyana. The deal was finalized after an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration panel ruled in Chevron's favor, rejecting Exxon Mobil's claim of a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region's Stabroek Block. While Exxon stated it respects the ruling, the outcome is a major strategic victory for Chevron, solidifying its position in one of the world's most promising new oil discoveries. The integration of the two companies is expected to result in some headcount reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The process to elect a new judge to Germany's Federal Constitutional Court has been controversially halted, reportedly due to a targeted social media campaign against a leading candidate. Law professor Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf, who had cross-party support, faced intense opposition from right-wing media outlets that labeled her a "left-wing radical" and spread disinformation about her legal positions. A political consultancy's analysis of social media activity revealed a coordinated campaign with petitions, paid ads, and networking aimed at preventing her election. The incident has raised serious concerns about the influence of manipulative online campaigns on Germany's democratic institutions and judicial appointments.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" will end its run in May 2026, and the network will retire "The Late Show" franchise entirely. The network described the move as a purely financial decision and praised Colbert's successful tenure, during which the show has been number one in late night for nine consecutive seasons. Colbert informed his audience during a taping, expressing his gratitude to CBS, his staff, and the viewers, confirming that he is not being replaced and the entire broadcast is being discontinued. The decision has prompted speculation, including from guests like Senator Adam Schiff, about whether political factors played a role in the cancellation.</p>

          <p>A recent financial article explores how reverse mortgages can serve as a tool for retirees to supplement their Social Security benefits, particularly for those who are "house rich but cash poor." It outlines three primary strategies: creating a steady monthly income stream from home equity, accessing funds for unexpected healthcare costs, and delaying Social Security claims to secure larger future benefits. The article suggests this financial product could help homeowners aged 62 and older convert their home's equity into usable income without having to sell their property. However, it also stresses the importance of understanding the product's complexities before making any decision. (not investment advice)</p>

Describing herself as having "high loneliness" and a "very low" extroversion score, Khazan chose improv as a commitment device to force herself into social situations, despite finding the art form itself uncomfortable. The excerpt humorously recounts her first class, filled with awkward warm-up games like "Zip Zap Zop" and juggling invisible objects.

While both carriers have trimmed their 2025 outlooks, they are outperforming rivals by generating significant revenue from premium cabins and partnerships, such as Delta's lucrative American Express deal.

Growers report that rising costs, especially for labor, are making the crops financially unviable, as they cannot pass the full expense on to consumers. This trend is turning these seasonal favorites into luxury items, with prices for both having increased substantially over the past decade, and it is sharply reducing Germany's self-sufficiency in strawberry production.</p>

Despite these changes and the challenges of his newfound fame, the experience of once again piloting a steamboat had a profound effect on him. It allowed him to reconnect with a cherished past, feeling as though the intervening years of war, mining, and literary fame had momentarily slipped away.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Salzburg Festival's program is set to explore themes of power, conflict, and crumbling authority, mirroring current global crises. Artistic director Markus Hinterhäuser has curated a lineup of operas and plays that examine historical power struggles, from Handel's "Giulio Cesare in Egitto" to Verdi's "Macbeth." The festival, running from July to August, continues its tradition of offering a diverse range of productions, including the annual "Jedermann" performance and a new work by director Peter Sellars. The program also features numerous Russian artists who have distanced themselves from the current regime, highlighting a commitment to artistic expression amid political turmoil.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the annual Salvadoran Day celebration in Los Angeles have suspended the cultural festival portion of the event due to community fears following recent immigration raids in Southern California. While the large public festival, which typically draws over 30,000 people, is canceled, the traditional liturgical services honoring El Salvador's patron saint, the Divine Savior of the World, will proceed. The decision reflects the community's anxiety and a desire to avoid putting undocumented individuals at risk. Organizers are encouraging people to participate in the religious ceremonies, which will be held in August, either in person or through social media, as a show of solidarity and prayer.</p>

The exchange follows a confrontational letter from OMB Director Russell Vought, who accused Powell of mismanagement and echoed President Trump's criticism of the central bank.

          <p>President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to petition the court for the release of all pertinent grand jury testimony related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This move comes after the administration faced significant backlash, including from its own supporters, over a recent Justice Department memo that concluded Epstein had no "client list" and died by suicide. The president framed the action as an effort to end a "SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats." A judge will have the final say on any release, a process that could be lengthy and involve objections from individuals named in the testimony.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that former President Donald Trump's long-standing strategy of leveraging conspiracy theories is now backfiring on him with the Jeffrey Epstein case. For years, Trump cultivated his base's distrust of institutions by nodding to theories like QAnon, which often centered on powerful figures involved in pedophile rings. Now, after his administration declared an end to the Epstein inquiry, his most ardent followers are turning on him, unable to accept a conclusion that contradicts the deep-state narrative he helped foster. This situation illustrates the dangers of the post-truth political environment Trump championed, where the fictions he exploited have become too powerful for him to control.</p>

          <p>The tragic drowning of 27 people at Camp Mystic in Texas has highlighted a history of failed efforts to establish a modern flood warning system on the Guadalupe River. A key failure point appears to be a denied 2018 state grant application that would have funded a new network of gauges and sensors, leaving the area with an inactive system. The camp's owner, who also died in the flood, is also under scrutiny for waiting over an hour to evacuate after receiving a severe flood warning. This disaster, which echoes a similar 1987 tragedy, underscores the devastating consequences of inadequate funding and potential missteps in emergency response.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced that no further action will be taken against the Irish language rap group Kneecap following a criminal investigation into their recent performance at the Glastonbury Festival. The investigation was launched over comments made on stage, which came after weeks of controversy surrounding the trio's pro-Palestinian stance. After consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, police determined there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction for any offense. The group had previously condemned the investigation as an act of "political policing intimidation," while their performance at the festival was not livestreamed by the BBC.</p>

He suggested that any revisions to the USMCA would likely focus on tightening rules-of-origin requirements for products, rather than targeting companies based on their country of origin.

This makes deep libraries of family-friendly shows a valuable asset for services like Disney+, Netflix, and Paramount+.
