          <p>A research team at Xian Technological University in China has used DeepSeek's AI model to generate automatic military simulation scenarios. The AI-based system can produce 10,000 military scenarios in 48 seconds, significantly reducing the time it takes for commanders to plan. Fu Yanfang, who led the team, noted that the key advantage of DeepSeek's LLM is its ability to deconstruct and reconstruct complex battlefield situations through training on massive datasets. This redefines the future of war design by enabling AI to directly produce various geographic environments, force deployments, event logic, and operational strategies for simulation scenarios.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail service has been fully shut down as of 12:01 a.m. Friday due to a strike by rail engineers over pay raises, inconveniencing over 300,000 daily commuters. The union, representing about 460 engineers, claims they haven't received a pay raise in five years, while NJ Transit argues they offered a competitive deal. Negotiations have been unsuccessful, and a federal mediator was involved. NJ Transit suggests people work from home and has implemented a contingency plan with additional bus service, though it can only handle about 20% of daily train riders. The last NJ Transit strike was in 1983 and lasted three weeks.</p>

The Danish pharmaceutical giant said Jørgensen would remain in his post for a period to support a smooth transition to new leadership. This decision comes as Novo Nordisk's stock price has declined significantly over the past year due to disappointing trial results for its next-generation treatments.

          <p>Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles is urging House committees to investigate Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell, accusing him of obstructing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. This follows criticism from the Trump administration, which claims O'Connell supports "pro-illegal policies." O'Connell signed an executive order to track interactions with federal immigration authorities after ICE agents arrested nearly 200 people in Nashville. Ogles argues that the executive order is being used as a political weapon against law enforcement. House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan is already holding a hearing on threats to ICE operations.</p>

          <p>Mike Novogratz described the arduous four-year, $25 million journey to list his crypto firm, Galaxy Digital, on the Nasdaq, calling the process "unfair, infuriating, and un-American." He said the process, which should have taken 45 to 90 days, stretched to 1,320 days and required nine rounds of comments with the SEC. Galaxy's auditing costs were significantly higher than traditional firms due to regulatory scrutiny. Despite the challenges, Novogratz believes the ordeal strengthened the company, which funded itself primarily through investment gains and trading. He expects auditing fees to decrease by up to 40% now that Galaxy is listed.</p>

          <p>Producing a vehicle entirely from U.S.-sourced parts is currently not feasible due to the complexities of the global automotive supply chain and the high costs involved. While President Trump is pressuring automakers to increase U.S. investments, experts say sourcing all parts domestically would significantly raise vehicle prices, potentially pricing consumers out of the market. Ford CEO Jim Farley noted that 15% to 20% of commoditized parts are difficult to source in the U.S., including semiconductors and labor-intensive wiring harnesses. Analysts estimate that material costs alone would add thousands of dollars to a vehicle's price. Experts estimate that the average cost increase for an American-assembled U.S. full-size pickup would jump at least $7,000 to source as many components as currently possible from the U.S. and Canada.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that his administration will send letters to other nations informing them of the tariff rates the U.S. will impose on imports. These letters, to be sent by the Treasury and Commerce Secretaries, will outline "very fair" rates that countries will pay to do business in the United States. This move follows negotiations with major trading partners over Trump's April 2 tariffs. Walmart has warned that it will start raising prices due to the impact of U.S. tariffs, despite a temporary easing of tariffs on Chinese imports. The Trump administration aims to spur domestic and foreign businesses to shift manufacturing to the U.S.</p>

The recent midair collision near Reagan National Airport is used as an example of what can happen when several layers of defense fail. The article suggests that near-misses should be taken seriously and that the country is under resourcing the system, which may lead to tragedy.</p>

          <p>Tesla's April sales data indicates continued demand weakness, with significant declines in key markets like the UK, Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden. UK registrations were down 62% year-over-year, while Germany saw a 46% dip. In China, Tesla's sales and exports decreased by 6% compared to last year, and 25.8% sequentially compared to March. This weakness is attributed to factors such as Elon Musk's political stances alienating some customers, and increased competition from Chinese domestic EV manufacturers like BYD, Nio, and XPeng. The first three months of the year saw Tesla deliveries drop by 13% versus a year ago.</p>
