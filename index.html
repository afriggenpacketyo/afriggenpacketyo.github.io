          <p>The Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with deporting a group of migrants with criminal records who are currently being held at a U.S. naval base in Djibouti. This ruling clarifies a previous order, allowing for their removal to third countries like South Sudan, even if it's not their country of origin. The decision came despite a lower court's injunction and dissenting opinions from Justices Sotomayor and Jackson, who expressed grave concerns about the deportees' safety and the legality of the administration's actions. The administration argued the deportations are a "win for the rule of law."</p>

          <p>Zarah Sultana, a Member of Parliament for Coventry South, has announced she is resigning from the Labour Party to help establish a new political party with former leader Jeremy Corbyn. Sultana, who was suspended from Labour last year, cited the current government's stance on Gaza, growing poverty, and welfare policies as key reasons for her departure. She aims to create an alternative to what she describes as a "broken" Westminster system. The move highlights ongoing divisions within the UK's left-wing political landscape, with some former colleagues expressing regret over her decision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article in the Los Angeles Times proposes a new model to make popular anti-obesity GLP-1 drugs more affordable through employer-sponsored health insurance. The author suggests eliminating the complex system of rebates and manufacturer coupons that inflates list prices. Instead, manufacturers would offer a transparent, lower price directly to health plans, similar to their direct-to-consumer cost, with employers and employees sharing the expense. This approach, the contributor argues, could significantly improve access to these transformative medications for millions of Americans without drastically increasing insurance premiums.</p>

          <p>A new analysis breaks down the staggered implementation of President Trump's recently passed legislative package, revealing that many of its most significant effects will not be felt until after the 2026 midterm elections. Key changes, such as new work requirements for Medicaid recipients and alterations to the Affordable Care Act, are scheduled to begin in 2026. Conversely, changes to food assistance programs (SNAP) could start this year, while certain tax adjustments, like the increased SALT deduction cap, are temporary and set to expire.

          <p>President Trump's major legislative package includes a provision creating a temporary federal tax exemption for tipped workers. The new rule allows individuals to deduct up to $25,000 in tips from their annual taxable income, a policy aimed at benefiting a majority of service industry employees. However, the tax break is not permanent and is scheduled to phase out at the end of 2028 unless extended by Congress. Tax experts note the policy will likely be administered by the IRS and Treasury, with debate continuing over its long-term economic impact and who benefits most. (not investment advice)</p>

The report details how mini marts and other small shops openly sell counterfeit and smuggled tobacco for a fraction of the legal price, costing the UK billions in lost tax revenue. This illicit trade is linked to international organized crime, people trafficking, and the exploitation of illegal workers. Law enforcement officials express frustration, stating they are "losing the war" due to underfunding, low penalties, and the sophisticated nature of the criminal networks involved.</p>

To overcome opposition from fiscally conservative and moderate Republicans, last-minute deals were struck, including targeted benefits for specific states like Alaska's whaling industry. The process involved a record-breaking seven-hour procedural vote in the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson and President Trump worked to persuade holdouts.

          <p>A man who had recently been arrested for impersonating a U.S. Marshal was shot and killed by sheriff's deputies in San Luis Obispo County, California. The man, identified as Andrew Biscay, was found with a fake badge, a self-made firearm, and a jacket with "U.S. Marshal Deputy" on it during his prior arrest. Deputies encountered him again after a woman reported he was near her home. Officials state that when confronted, Biscay aimed what appeared to be a handgun at them, prompting them to open fire. The weapon was later identified as a realistic pellet gun.</p>

          <p>A former security contractor for the new U.S.-backed aid distribution sites in Gaza has told the BBC that he witnessed colleagues repeatedly open fire on hungry and unarmed Palestinians. Speaking anonymously, he described a culture of impunity where guards were told to "shoot to kill" if they felt threatened. He recounted one incident where a guard used a machine gun on a slow-moving crowd of women and children, and another where contractors laughed after shooting a man. The aid organization, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has categorically denied the allegations as false.</p>

          <p>China is making a concerted effort to establish global leadership in the critical technology sectors of artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. According to a recent report, the country's strategy for AI dominance hinges on its control over vast datasets essential for training advanced models. Simultaneously, China's electric vehicle industry is being shaped by an intense domestic price war, which is driving innovation and expanding its market share. These parallel efforts underscore China's ambition to be at the forefront of the next wave of technological and industrial development.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have intensified their bombardment across the Gaza Strip, with rescuers reporting at least 69 Palestinians killed on Thursday. One of the deadliest strikes hit a school in Gaza City that was being used as a shelter for displaced families, killing 15 people. The Israeli military stated it was targeting a "key" Hamas operative in that location. These attacks come as international pressure continues to mount on both Israel and Hamas to agree to a new ceasefire and hostage release deal proposed by the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>President Trump held a nearly hour-long phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, according to the Kremlin. The call took place shortly after the White House confirmed it was halting some shipments of weapons to Ukraine, a decision the administration attributed to a review of U.S. military stockpiles. The Kremlin reported that the two leaders discussed the ongoing war in Ukraine, the Middle East, and the recent passage of Trump's major legislative bill in Congress. This development signals a complex and evolving dynamic in U.S. foreign policy toward the region.</p>

          <p>A new independent study estimates that more than 80,000 Palestinians were killed in the Gaza war between October 2023 and January 2025, a figure substantially higher than official reports. The research, led by a University of London academic and based on household surveys in Gaza, suggests the death toll is at least 40% greater than the numbers released by Gaza's Ministry of Health. The study concludes that the ministry's figures, while not exaggerated, represent a conservative minimum count of the conflict's true human cost, with women and children accounting for over half the violent deaths.</p>

          <p>The BBC has issued a formal apology for broadcasting a controversial performance by the rap-punk group Bob Vylan at the Glastonbury festival. During the set, the band, who are outspoken critics of Israel's actions in Gaza, led the crowd in a chant of "Death to the IDF." The BBC's director-general called the incident deplorable and announced new policies for future festival coverage, including keeping "high risk" acts off live broadcasts. The performance has led to a police investigation and the reported revocation of the band's U.S. visas.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece authored by former State Department diplomats argues strongly against a plan by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to overhaul the department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL). The authors contend that the proposed reorganization would effectively shutter offices devoted to human rights, lay off most of its expert staff, and limit its function to dispensing minimal aid. They warn this would cripple America's ability to promote democracy and justice globally, undermine U.S. foreign policy, and send a dangerous message to both allies and adversaries.</p>
