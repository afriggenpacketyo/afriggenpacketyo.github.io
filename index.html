          <p>A 19-year-old Australian surfer, reported missing after failing to return from a surf, has been safely rescued. He was found on North Solitary Island, an uninhabited island approximately seven miles off the coast of New South Wales, after spending a night stranded. A large-scale land and water search was initiated by police after his family raised the alarm. The rescue was hailed as a "one in a million miracle" by his father, and the teenager is now receiving medical attention.</p>

The disruptive fans were reportedly trying to get close to Chinese actor Tian Xuning, who was seated in the business-class section.

          <p>More than 30 construction workers were successfully rescued after a partial collapse in a large industrial tunnel being built under Los Angeles. The workers, who were about 400 feet underground, were trapped between the cave-in and the tunnel's entrance but managed to navigate over the debris to a boring machine for extraction. No major injuries were reported, and officials, including Mayor Karen Bass, praised the first responders and the workers' composure.

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo is experiencing a period of optimism driven by both political and sporting developments. A recent peace deal with neighboring Rwanda, if it holds, could bring stability to a region plagued by decades of conflict.

          <p>Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have developed a robot that performed a realistic gallbladder removal surgery with what they described as 100% accuracy. The machine, which uses a machine learning system similar to ChatGPT, was trained on surgical videos and was able to operate with the skill of an expert human surgeon. In a significant advance, the robot could adapt to unexpected situations and respond to voice commands from the research team. This breakthrough marks a major step toward creating clinically viable autonomous systems for use in real-world operating rooms.</p>

This sector, comprising about 43% of the city's housing units, is accessible to a wide range of income levels, not just the poor. The system keeps rent levels significantly lower than the private market and helps to moderate private rental prices as well. While not without challenges, such as a complex allocation system, Vienna's long-term political commitment to treating housing as a basic need offers a powerful example for other cities.</p>
