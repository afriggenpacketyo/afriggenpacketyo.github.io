          <p>Mexico has transferred 26 prominent cartel figures to U.S. custody, a significant development in a collaboration with the Trump administration aimed at dismantling drug trafficking networks. The extradited individuals include leaders from groups like "Los Cuinis," an affiliate of the CJNG cartel, and figures connected to the Sinaloa Cartel. This action follows a previous transfer of 29 cartel members and is part of ongoing efforts to combat the flow of illegal drugs, with Mexico securing a U.S. agreement not to seek the death penalty for the defendants. The move highlights increased cooperation on security under President Claudia Sheinbaum.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive timeline of the highly publicized Karen Read case, culminating in her recent acquittal on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe. Read was accused of striking O'Keefe with her SUV in 2022, but her defense argued she was framed in a cover-up involving law enforcement. The case was marked by a previous mistrial, intense public scrutiny, claims of evidence tampering, and the eventual firing of the lead state police investigator. Read was ultimately convicted only of driving under the influence and sentenced to one year of probation.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The meeting, set for August 15th, follows Trump's efforts to broker a peace deal, which included setting a deadline for a ceasefire that has since passed. The location in Alaska, once Russian territory, holds historical significance. The White House has framed the summit as a "listening exercise," while reports suggest a potential U.S.-backed deal could involve Ukraine ceding some territory, a proposal Ukraine's President Zelenskyy has firmly rejected.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops and federal agents have been deployed on the streets of Washington D.C. following an order from President Donald Trump, who also assumed control of the city's police force, citing concerns over violent crime. The deployment of 800 troops and 500 federal agents has been met with resistance from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who described the move as an "authoritarian push" and disputed the administration's claims about crime rates. The White House stated the action is the start of a month-long operation to arrest violent criminals, while the mayor urged residents to protect the city's autonomy.</p>

Prosecutors allege she accepted luxury items, such as Chanel bags and a valuable necklace, as bribes and lied about a high-end pendant she wore at a NATO summit. The arrest was sought over fears she might destroy evidence. Her husband, former President Yoon, also faces a trial for insurrection charges following his ouster from office in April.</p>

The administration had frozen $584 million in federal funding, citing allegations of antisemitism and discrimination at the university. However, U.S. District Judge Rita F. Lin ruled that the suspension of the NSF grants violated her previous injunction against such terminations, stating the indefinite suspension was a termination "in name only." The ruling directly affects about 300 NSF grants for research into areas like cancer and clean energy, though hundreds of other grants remain frozen.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation has found that a new federal immigration detention center in Florida, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," is holding individuals who have no criminal history, including recipients of the DACA program. This contradicts the administration's claims that the facility would house "the worst of the worst" criminal immigrants. The article highlights the case of a DACA recipient and father of three U.S. citizens who was detained after a traffic stop. Federal data indicates that nearly half of all migrants detained by ICE in June lacked a criminal record, raising concerns among immigration advocates about the current immigration crackdown.</p>

          <h2>UK Driving Theory Test to Include Questions on CPR and First Aid</h2>

          <p>The UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will add questions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and how to use a defibrillator to the driving theory test starting in early 2026. The change aims to equip the millions of learner drivers who take the test each year with basic life-saving skills, as drivers are often the first to arrive at the scene of an emergency. Learning materials have already been updated to include information on these procedures. The DVSA hopes this initiative will help prevent avoidable deaths from events like cardiac arrest, where immediate intervention can dramatically increase survival rates.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) has lifted the boil water notice for thousands of households in the Granada Hills and Porter Ranch neighborhoods, ending a weeklong water service disruption. The issue began when a faulty, 57-year-old valve became stuck, severely impeding water flow to approximately 9,200 homes. After resuming water flow on Monday, the DWP confirmed on Tuesday that the water is now safe to drink following testing. The agency is advising residents to thoroughly flush their home plumbing systems and is providing a $20 credit to affected customers for the inconvenience.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has formally acknowledged that France used "repressive violence" in Cameroon during the African nation's fight for independence in the 1950s. In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron accepted France's role and responsibility for events that cost "tens of thousands of lives." This admission follows a 2022 report by French and Cameroonian historians which detailed how French forces used mass displacement and supported brutal militias to crush the independence movement, with the repression continuing even after Cameroon's independence in 1960. The move is part of Macron's broader effort to confront France's colonial history.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police have arrested four teenagers suspected of being part of a "celebrity burglaries" crew that targeted high-profile homes, including the ransacked residence of actor Brad Pitt. The suspects, identified as street gang members, are allegedly behind a string of break-ins targeting actors and professional athletes. The investigation began after Pitt's Los Feliz home was burglarized in late June. Police Chief Jim McDonnell noted that such criminals have become more sophisticated, using surveillance and Wi-Fi jammers, and often target celebrities whose travel schedules are public, making their homes vulnerable to theft.</p>

          <p>Health experts are warning that the risk of contracting Vibrio vulnificus, a so-called "flesh-eating" bacteria, is increasing as climate change leads to warmer ocean waters. The bacteria, which thrives in warm coastal environments, can enter the body through open wounds and cause severe, rapidly spreading infections that are fatal in one in five cases. Cases are now being reported further north in the U.S., beyond traditional areas like Florida. The danger is particularly heightened during hurricane season, which brings more severe storms and flooding, further spreading the bacteria into communities from the warmer seas.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 approaching an all-time high, after new data showed inflation was slightly lower than economists had anticipated. The consumer price index for July was 2.7% higher than a year ago, holding steady from June and beating expectations. This positive report has increased investor hopes that the Federal Reserve will have the justification to cut interest rates at its upcoming September meeting. Traders are now pricing in a 94% probability of a rate cut, which would stimulate the economy by making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peach farmers in California's Central Valley are facing a significant reduction in their harvest, with some seeing 30% fewer peaches this year due to the effects of climate change. Warmer winter temperatures have disrupted the essential "sleep cycle" for stone fruit trees, which require a certain number of hours below 45 degrees to properly regulate nutrients and produce a full crop. This phenomenon has impacted not only peaches but also plums, apricots, and cherries, leading to smaller yields and higher consumer prices. The situation highlights the direct threat that a changing climate poses to agriculture and food supply chains.</p>
