          <p>Brendan Cox, the husband of the late MP Jo Cox, has called on the Irish rap group Kneecap to issue a more sincere apology following footage of the band allegedly calling for the killing of MPs. Cox argues that Kneecap's initial apology, which suggested a conspiracy against them, did not adequately address the gravity of their words. He expressed willingness to meet with the band if they genuinely reflect on the implications of their statements and maintain clear boundaries against political violence. Counter-terrorism police are assessing the footage, and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has advocated for prosecution.</p>

          <p>General Motors (GM) surpassed Wall Street's first-quarter expectations but is reassessing its 2025 financial guidance and suspending additional stock buybacks due to expected cost increases and uncertainty related to Donald Trump's auto tariffs. While earnings per share and revenue exceeded estimates, GM's previous guidance is now considered unreliable. The company expects to offset some of the North American tariffs but is awaiting clarity on the economic and regulatory environment. (not investment advice)</p>

These cost-cutting measures are intended to help Pfizer recover from the decline in its COVID business and improve its stock performance.</p>
