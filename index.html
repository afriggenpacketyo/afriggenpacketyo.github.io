Regional bank shares and investment bank Jefferies tumbled in the U.S. over concerns about bad loans. While South Korea's Kospi bucked the trend with a rise, other major indices like Japan's Nikkei 225 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 experienced declines. Singapore's non-oil domestic exports unexpectedly rebounded, but overall market sentiment remained cautious. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has announced sweeping new curbs on rare earth exports, tightening its control over the global supply of these critical minerals essential for technology and military equipment. This move is seen as a strategic leverage point in its trade dispute with the U.S., prompting threats of additional tariffs from President Trump. While China claims the restrictions are for civilian use and compliance, experts suggest they aim to disrupt American supply chains and influence ongoing trade negotiations. The article highlights China's near-monopoly in rare earth processing.</p>

          <p>Indiana University has ordered its student-run newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student (IDS), to cease print editions and fired its director of student media, Jim Rodenbush, who resisted the directive. Editors accuse the university of "unlawful censorship" and a "breach of editorial independence," as administrators allegedly sought to prevent news content in print. While the university claims it's a shift to digital-first media to address financial deficits, free expression groups condemn the actions as a blatant attack on First Amendment rights.</p>
