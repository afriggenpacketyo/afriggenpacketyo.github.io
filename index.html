          <p>The European Union's executive arm, the European Commission, was taken to court by The New York Times for denying a journalist's request for text messages between its president, Ursula von der Leyen, and Pfizer's CEO, Albert Bourla, during Covid-19 vaccine negotiations in 2021. The General Court in Luxembourg ruled that the commission should have provided credible explanations for not releasing the messages, emphasizing the importance of transparency in matters of public interest. The court stated that the commission failed to plausibly explain why messages related to vaccine procurement during a public health crisis would lack important information. The New York Times hailed the decision as a victory for accountability in the EU, though the commission can appeal the verdict.</p>

          <p>China has confirmed that a Japanese national has been imprisoned in Shanghai for spying, marking the first official comment on the case. The man, reportedly in his 50s, was sentenced to 12 years on espionage charges after being detained in December 2021 and indicted in August 2023. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman stated that the case was handled strictly in accordance with legal procedures, ensuring the individual's rights and interests. The spokesman also called on Japan to respect China's judicial sovereignty and educate its citizens to abide by Chinese laws, as this is not the only case of a Japanese national being charged with espionage by Chinese authorities in recent years.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a rise in volatile trading after the Japanese conglomerate announced a share buyback of up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion). The company's operating income for the last three months of the financial year exceeded analyst estimates, although it was lower than the same period last year. Sony also shared details regarding a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of the shares to shareholders through dividends. The financial unit is set to list its financial operation this year and will be classified as a discontinued operation in Sony's accounting from the current quarter; however, Sony's outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was lackluster.</p>

          <p>China has issued a warning to the UK regarding its new trade deal with the US, expressing concerns that it could compel British companies to exclude Chinese products from their supply chains. Beijing argues that the agreement violates the principle that international agreements should not target third countries. The UK-US deal offers Britain relief from US tariffs on car and steel exports, contingent upon compliance with strict American security requirements. China fears these clauses are designed to pressure allies into economically isolating China, despite recent efforts to improve bilateral ties between the UK and China.</p>

          <p>Several members of the Trump administration, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

They argue that welfare should be a short-term hand-up rather than a lifetime handout, emphasizing the need for recipients to work, participate in job training, or volunteer. They point to the success of the 1996 welfare reform under President Bill Clinton, which included work requirements and led to a decrease in child poverty. The administration believes that work provides purpose, dignity, and strengthens families and communities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met with Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia, a day after announcing the lifting of U.S. sanctions on the war-ravaged country. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman oversaw the meeting, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan joining by phone. Trump encouraged al-Sharaa to seize the historic opportunity to stabilize Syria, urging him to sign onto the Abraham Accords, expel foreign terrorists, deport Palestinian terrorists, and help prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State group. The toppling of the Assad regime in December 2024 led to the formation of a transitional government led by al-Sharaa, a former al-Qaeda member.</p>

          <p>President Trump's fast-tracked deal for a copper mine in Oak Flat, Arizona, has intensified the fight to protect the sacred land of the Western Apache. The U.S. Forest Service plans to trade a portion of Oak Flat to Resolution Copper, a foreign-owned mining company, which would destroy most of the area. Apache Stronghold, a nonprofit, has been fighting the land swap, citing religious freedom concerns. A judge has granted an injunction temporarily blocking the land swap while the Supreme Court considers the case, highlighting the clash between economic interests and Native American religious and cultural rights.</p>

Inter Miami, like PSG, struggles to balance a star-studded forward line with the rest of the team, leading to defensive vulnerabilities and inconsistent performances. The team's Concacaf Champions Cup challenge ended early, and they have developed a habit of conceding goals.

          <p>Senator Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., argues that Republican proposals to implement work requirements for Medicaid eligibility could have disastrous results for Americans. He contends that these requirements, which involve complex rules and paperwork, would primarily serve to kick people off their health care coverage rather than incentivize work. Warnock emphasizes that providing basic health care to eligible individuals encourages employment and strengthens the economy. A new report estimates that millions could lose Medicaid coverage in 2034 if they are unable to meet the proposed work requirements.</p>
