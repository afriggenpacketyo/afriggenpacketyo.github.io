          <p>A semi-truck driver, Jashanpreet Singh, arrested for DUI following a fatal eight-vehicle crash in Ontario, California, is in the United States illegally, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Singh, an Indian national, entered the U.S. via the Mexico border in 2022 and resides in Yuba City, California. The crash resulted in three deaths and four hospitalizations. The State Department previously paused worker visas for commercial truck drivers due to concerns about risks posed by foreign truckers. The article provides context by referencing a similar lawsuit filed by Florida against California and Washington regarding illegal immigrants obtaining commercial driver's licenses. The investigation is ongoing to determine if Singh had a valid commercial driver's license. </p>

          <p>Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers playfully requested his 311-pound teammate, Broderick Jones, to stop tackling him after touchdowns, citing his age of 41. The request came after Jones tackled Rodgers following a touchdown pass against the Cincinnati Bengals. Despite the celebration, the Steelers lost to the Bengals, with Joe Flacco leading a game-winning drive. Rodgers, who threw for 249 yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions, expressed excitement about facing his former team, the Green Bay Packers, for the first time since leaving for the New York Jets two seasons ago, while denying any animosity towards the organization. </p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa has formed over the Caribbean and is expected to bring significant rainfall to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. The storm's path beyond that is uncertain, but it is not expected to have major impacts on the mainland United States. As of Wednesday night, Melissa was located about 335 miles south-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and about 295 miles south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, moving west at 1 mph with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph. A hurricane watch is in effect for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti, and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Jamaica, with rainfall forecasts predicting 5 to 10 inches in some areas. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is constructing a White House ballroom with funding from private donors, primarily from the tech and crypto industries. Companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Coinbase, Ripple, and Tether, along with investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, are potential donors. Microsoft and Google have secured contracts for AI and cloud tools, while Amazon Web Services received cloud-credit incentives during Trump's second term. Google's parent Alphabet will contribute $22 million to the Trust for the National Mall as part of a legal settlement, and Paolo Tiramani donated $10 million in stock. Meredith O'Rourke is leading the donor effort, with the Trust for the National Mall managing donations and the National Park Service leading design and construction.</p>

          <p>The final New York mayoral debate was dominated by personal attacks between candidates Cuomo and Mamdani, with tensions rising over housing initiatives and sexual assault allegations. Immigration and ICE raids became a proxy battle over how each candidate would deal with Trump, with accusations of being too cozy or a puppet. Sliwa provided levity with zingers directed at both Cuomo and Mamdani. The safety of Jewish New Yorkers was also a major point of contention, with accusations of enabling antisemitism. Mamdani faced criticism for evading questions, and the debate ultimately did not shift the status quo, with Cuomo emphasizing his experience and Mamdani positioning himself as the candidate of change. </p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea (BOK) maintained its benchmark interest rate at 2.5% on Thursday, continuing a pause that began in May, while monitoring household debt and stability in the housing market. This decision aligns with economists' expectations and follows stricter property measures in Seoul aimed at curbing borrowing. The BOK cited stable inflation and an improving economic growth outlook as reasons for the pause, but cautioned about uncertainties due to trade talks with the U.S. and the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on exports. The central bank will maintain a rate cut stance to mitigate downside risks to economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New Jersey attorney general has filed a lawsuit against Amazon, alleging discrimination against pregnant employees and staffers with disabilities in its New Jersey facilities. The lawsuit claims Amazon violated state anti-discrimination law by placing these workers on unpaid leave, denying reasonable accommodations, and delaying responses to accommodation requests. The state's investigation found that Amazon allegedly retaliated against workers who sought accommodations, including firing them for failing to meet productivity requirements. Amazon denies the accusations, stating that it approves over 99% of pregnancy accommodation requests and does not have fixed quotas.

          <h2>Oil Prices Surge After Trump Administration Sanctions Russian Oil Companies</h2>

          <p>Oil prices jumped about 3% after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Russia's two largest crude companies, citing Moscow's "lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine." Global benchmark Brent rose $1.83 to $64.42 per barrel, and U.S crude oil rose $1.74 to $60.24 per barrel. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the sanctions, stating they would harm the Kremlin's ability to raise revenue for its war. The sanctions are related to a canceled meeting between President Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pregnant women in ICE detention have reported instances of medical neglect, including bleeding, miscarriages, being shackled, and denial of prenatal care, according to civil rights organizations. The groups sent a letter to ICE and Senate committees, detailing interviews with over a dozen women. The letter highlighted cases of women detained despite informing officers of their pregnancy, even in domestic disputes. Advocates urged ICE to review and release pregnant detainees, ensure timely medical care, and close facilities with documented violations. The Department of Homeland Security dismissed the reports as unsubstantiated claims. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to demolish the entire East Wing of the White House to add a ballroom, with the project costing $300 million.

          <p>President Trump and his legal team have requested approximately $230 million from the Justice Department to settle two federal damage claims related to past investigations. The claims pertain to the FBI and special counsel investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago. The potential settlement raises conflict-of-interest concerns, as top Justice Department officials, including the deputy attorney general and associate attorney general, previously defended Trump in these cases. Approval of the settlement would require sign-off from these officials, raising ethical questions. (not investment advice)</p>

While the government aims to bring menopause into the mainstream, concerns have been raised about low health check uptake in some communities. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump imposed Ukraine-related sanctions on Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft, marking the first such measures in his second term. This decision sent oil prices higher by more than $2 a barrel. The president's move reflects growing frustration with Vladimir Putin over the war. Trump had previously relied on trade measures, such as tariffs on goods from India, rather than sanctions. The sanctions represent a significant policy shift for Trump. </p>
