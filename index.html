            <p>A Cessna 310 crashed near I-95 in Boca Raton, Florida, killing all three people on board and injuring one person on the ground. The plane, which departed from Boca Raton Airport en route to Tallahassee, crashed onto the Tri-Rail tracks, causing service disruptions. Witnesses reported the plane appeared to have experienced difficulties and was attempting to return to the airfield before the crash. Authorities are investigating the cause of the accident, which has resulted in road closures and commuter delays in the area. The crash debris was widespread and included a charred car near the site.</p>

            <p>The United States and Japan are expanding their space cooperation to include defense and military initiatives, driven by concerns over China and other Indo-Pacific rivals. Jun Kazeki, a director general in Japan's cabinet, cited China and Russia's "untransparent and irresponsible" conduct in space as a key influence. This decision reflects Tokyo's heightened national security concerns, formalized in the 2023 "Space Security Initiative," which aims to expand the use of space systems for national security and strengthen collaborations with allies. The deepened collaboration was discussed at a forum in Washington, highlighting the growing strategic importance of space.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to bring back Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador, but the government has failed to provide information about his whereabouts. Lawyers claim that sensitive foreign policy considerations are preventing them from providing the information. Immigration experts criticize the administration's reluctance, calling it a violation of the rule of law and raising concerns about Abrego Garcia's safety, who had previously been granted relief from deportation due to gang threats. The judge has ordered daily updates on the plan to bring Abrego Garcia back.</p>

            <p>Prosecutors have rested their case against Victor Antonio Martinez-Hernandez, an illegal immigrant accused of murdering Rachel Morin in Bel-Air, Maryland. During a video interview, Martinez-Hernandez denied knowing Morin and claimed he was not in Bel-Air at the time of the murder, though later he admitted to being in the area after initially lying. Authorities found internet searches on his phone for "Bel Air, [Md.]" and "Rachel," along with images and media coverage of the case. Autopsy results revealed Morin died from strangulation and blunt force trauma after suffering 15 to 20 blows to the head.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is planning significant budget cuts to NOAA and NASA, specifically targeting climate science research programs. NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research would face near elimination, and NASA would see a 20% overall budget loss, impacting planetary science, earth science, and astrophysics research. The cuts would also scrap missions like the Nancy Grace Roman space telescope and the Mars Sample Return. Experts warn that these cuts would undermine US research capabilities, compromise public safety, and harm various sectors relying on climate and scientific data.</p>

            <p>China announced it will increase tariffs on U.S. goods, escalating the trade war between the two largest economies. The new tariffs, ranging from 84% to 125%, are in response to the U.S. raising tariffs on Chinese goods, which now total 145%. China's Ministry of Commerce said it would file another complaint with the World Trade Organization. The tariffs will affect products like soybeans, aircraft, and medicines. The trade war has caused alarm in financial markets and raised fears of a global economic slowdown.</p>

Despite the positive end to the week, economists caution that the ongoing trade tensions could negatively impact economic growth.

            <p>President Trump has threatened Mexico with new tariffs over its failure to deliver water under a 1944 treaty, sparking a dispute over water rights along the U.S.-Mexico border.

The treaty requires both nations to share water from the Rio Grande, Colorado, and Tijuana rivers. The dispute adds to already strained relations, as Trump has previously imposed tariffs on Mexico over immigration and fentanyl concerns.</p>

The hearing focused on whether the court should rescind a request filed by the previous DA, George Gascón, to resentence the brothers to 50 years to life, potentially making them eligible for parole. Hochman argues the brothers are still lying about the circumstances of their parents' murders and have not taken full responsibility.

            <p>Christopher Kamon, the former CFO of Tom Girardi's law firm, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in stealing millions from clients. Kamon controlled the firm's bank accounts and facilitated the transfer of client funds for Girardi's personal expenses and his own separate scheme. He embezzled over $6.5 million using phony vendors and kickbacks. Kamon's sentencing follows Girardi's fraud conviction, with both facing additional charges in Chicago for misappropriating funds from plane crash victims' families.</p>

Structured around Lennon's only full-length post-Beatles concert, the film imagines how the couple's television viewing informed their view of America.
