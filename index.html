          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed leaders from Latin America and the Caribbean, cautioning against tariff wars and advocating for global peace and stability through solidarity and cooperation. In veiled remarks directed at the United States, Xi emphasized that "bullying or hegemonism only leads to self-isolation." His message aligns with China's broader strategy to garner support from the Global South amidst trade tensions with the U.S., as Washington seeks to expand its influence in Latin America, including pressuring Panama regarding Chinese control over the Panama Canal. China's foreign minister will chair a meeting with foreign ministers from the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.</p>

          <h2>Art Market Shows Signs of Weakness at Riggio Family Auction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 22:50:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent auction of the Riggio family art collection at Christie's in New York revealed a cautious art market, with subdued bidding and many items presold. Experts attributed the tepid sale to economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs, which could negatively impact the global art market. Despite a total of $272 million including fees, the sale fell short of pre-sale expectations, and a major Warhol painting was withdrawn mid-auction, signaling weakness in that market. However, paintings by artists like Gerhard Richter and Vincent van Gogh sold above estimates, indicating some demand remains, but overall, the auction highlighted a shift from the frothy art market of 2022.</p>

          <p>The United Nations' aviation council has ruled that Russia is responsible for the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014, which resulted in the deaths of all 298 people on board.

The case was launched by Australia and the Netherlands, with both countries welcoming the ruling and calling on Russia to make reparations for its actions.

The potential value of the plane has raised legal and ethical questions, citing the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which restricts gifts from foreign governments.

          <p>A Democratic National Committee (DNC) panel has recommended redoing the elections of David Hogg and Malcolm Kenyatta to party vice-chair positions, citing violations of the party's charter during the February election. The resolution stems from a challenge by Kalyn Free, who lost to Hogg, alleging improper voting procedures that favored male candidates. This development comes amid controversy surrounding Hogg's efforts to primary Democrats he deems insufficiently aggressive against President Trump. DNC Chair Ken Martin expressed disappointment and expects DNC members to resolve the matter fairly.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposed cuts to NOAA threaten to end decades of CO2 data collection, according to climate scientists. The cuts would eliminate funding for NOAA's global CO2 program, degrading the nation's ability to project how climate change could impact us in the future. The Keeling Curve, a graph plotting the rise of carbon dioxide, shows that more carbon dioxide was present in the atmosphere last year than ever before in recorded history. Scientists say turning off a program like this would be like turning off the headlights on a dark street at night.</p>

However, the agriculture sector experienced slow growth due to insecurity and high input costs. President Bola Tinubu's reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira, have led to a cost-of-living crisis for many Nigerians. Poverty remains high, with nearly half of the population living in poverty in 2024, and inflation is expected to remain above 20%.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged by over 40% in the past year, reaching record highs due to factors like unpredictable US trade policies and geopolitical uncertainty. While gold is seen as a safe-haven asset, it is not immune to price fluctuations and major surges have been followed by significant falls. The recent increase is attributed to central banks buying gold to add to their official reserves. Experts suggest that while gold may continue to rise, a market bubble could form, leading to potential losses for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

While GLP-1 drugs can help a wide spectrum of people lose weight, their risks are likely justified for only a smaller subset of Americans. To say whether the health benefits a person might gain from taking the drugs are worth the expense and likely gastrointestinal distress, physicians cannot rely on weight alone. The primary metric by which anti-obesity drugs are judged and distributed is weight, however, the primary goal should not be changes in weight alone, but changes in health.</p>
