        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean semiconductor firm SK Hynix has announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, driven by strong global demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in artificial intelligence. The company's performance significantly surpassed market expectations, with revenue climbing over 35% and operating profit jumping nearly 69% year-over-year. SK Hynix, a key supplier to Nvidia, expects this momentum to continue, projecting that its HBM sales for the full year will double compared to 2024. This success has positioned the company to challenge Samsung for the top spot in the global memory market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has refuted media reports claiming President Donald Trump is named in unsealed Justice Department documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, calling the stories a politically motivated fabrication by Democrats and the media. This response comes as the administration faces pressure to release more information about the convicted sex offender. A federal judge recently denied a Justice Department request to unseal grand jury files from Epstein's Florida case, citing secrecy rules. Meanwhile, Republicans are pursuing testimony from convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, though her credibility is being questioned by some leaders.</p>

          <p>Columbia University will pay a $200 million settlement to the federal government to resolve a dispute over its handling of antisemitism on campus. The agreement will lead to the reinstatement of $400 million in federal research grants that the Trump administration had frozen. As part of the deal, Columbia will implement reforms it had previously announced, including new rules for protests, a ban on face masks, and the appointment of an independent monitor to oversee compliance. While the university does not admit wrongdoing, its acting president stated the settlement is an important step to move forward and get its federal research partnership back on track.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has declassified additional documents related to the 2016 election, claiming they show Obama administration officials fabricated intelligence to undermine Donald Trump's campaign. Gabbard accused officials of orchestrating a "treasonous conspiracy," prompting a sharp rebuke from Democrats and former Obama staff who called the allegations ridiculous. Current and former intelligence officials have expressed alarm that the release, which includes details about a human source and signal intercepts, irresponsibly risks compromising sensitive intelligence sources and methods. The move is seen by critics as a politically motivated attempt to distract from other issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The court found the order invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The Trump administration had argued the amendment's jurisdiction clause does not apply to children of undocumented immigrants, an interpretation the court rejected as unmoored from established legal principles. This ruling upholds a lower court's block on the policy, though the White House has stated it will appeal the decision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the death of singer Ozzy Osbourne at 76, this article reflects on how his band, Black Sabbath, invented the genre of heavy metal. Originating from industrial Birmingham, the band reacted against the optimistic hippie culture of the late 1960s, opting instead for a darker, heavier sound inspired by horror films. Guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style, developed after an industrial accident, created the genre's signature detuned, powerful riffs. The band's controversial themes of death and black magic, combined with Osbourne's wailing vocals, defined a new musical template that influenced countless rock bands for decades to come.</p>

          <p>After making his debut at first base for the San Francisco Giants, Rafael Devers made a surprising admission, stating he prefers playing a defensive position over being a full-time designated hitter. This contrasts sharply with his previous stance while with the Boston Red Sox, where he had been adamant about exclusively handling DH duties. Devers explained that playing on the field keeps him more active and mentally engaged in the game, rather than constantly focusing on his next at-bat. His successful debut included two base hits in the Giants' 9-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber has defended the league's policy banning political signage at games, following fan protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. House representatives has introduced a resolution to halt a federal plan to shoot approximately 450,000 barred owls in the Pacific Northwest over the next 30 years. The plan, approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, aims to protect the threatened northern spotted owl, which is being outcompeted by the more aggressive barred owl. Proponents of the resolution argue the culling is inhumane, unworkable, and a waste of taxpayer money. However, some scientists and conservationists warn that stopping the removal of barred owls will likely lead to the extinction of the spotted owl.</p>

Researchers concluded that fewer than a quarter of the tests gave clear guidance, and nearly half advised consulting a doctor regardless of the outcome, potentially straining NHS services.

Supporters argue that eliminating the tax would improve the city's "anti-job climate" and foster economic growth, but city officials are raising alarms about the consequences. The tax generates over $800 million annually for the city's general fund, which pays for essential services like police and fire departments. The city's administrative officer warned that passing the measure could force a 50% cut to public safety staffing, framing it as an assault on these core services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy expanded by 0.6% in the second quarter, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth, which beat economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and chemical products. This surge was partly attributed to firms expediting shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. While domestic consumption also saw a modest increase, analysts remain cautious, suggesting that the export-led growth may not be sustainable if global trade softens under the threat of new tariffs.

Carfentanil can be lethal in doses far smaller than fentanyl and may not be detected by some fentanyl test strips, increasing the risk of accidental overdose. This case highlights a concerning rise in deaths involving the drug, which health officials say threatens recent progress made in reducing overall opioid overdoses.</p>

          <p>A House Oversight subcommittee has voted to subpoena the Justice Department for its complete investigative files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The motion, which passed with bipartisan support, seeks to increase transparency following a recent DOJ review that asserted Epstein had no incriminating "client list." The move signals growing pressure from Congress for more information, even as some Republican leaders have resisted action on the issue. The subpoenas will also seek communications related to the case from former presidents, attorneys general, and FBI directors, though the Justice Department has historically resisted such congressional requests.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is showing early signs of a shift, with a notable 34% increase in the number of sellers compared to buyers in May, the highest rate since 2013. Despite this rise in inventory, it remains a seller's market as home prices continue to climb, hitting a record median of $396,000 in June. Many current homeowners with low-interest mortgages are hesitant to sell, which keeps supply tight and prices high, particularly for updated, turnkey properties. Experts suggest that while the market is still competitive, buyers may find more negotiating power with homes that have been on the market for longer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new AI Action Plan is a strategic bet on deregulation and private sector empowerment to achieve U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence, according to this analysis. The plan, heavily influenced by recommendations from major tech firms like OpenAI and Google, aims to strip away federal and state regulations, streamline environmental reviews for data centers, and promote widespread AI adoption. It reflects a "build, baby, build" philosophy, deferring to Silicon Valley's expertise and financial power. This approach prioritizes speed and innovation over cautious oversight, which could accelerate prosperity or hasten a technological bust.</p>

The identical spacecraft will fly in tandem to provide detailed measurements of how energy from the sun couples with our planet's magnetosphere. This process creates space weather, which can generate spectacular auroras but also disrupt GPS signals, power grids, and satellites. By better understanding these dynamics, scientists hope to eventually predict and mitigate the potentially dangerous effects of solar activity on critical Earth-based and space-based infrastructure.</p>
