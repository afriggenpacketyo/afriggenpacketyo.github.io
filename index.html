The administration is demanding detailed information on these patents and their licensing agreements, suggesting Harvard has breached its obligations to taxpayers.

The league announced it is collaborating with local and federal law enforcement to pursue criminal charges, including potential felonies, against those responsible for the disruptions. This response follows multiple incidents across the country, with the league emphasizing that the safety of players, officials, and fans is its highest priority and that such reckless behavior is unacceptable.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15 to negotiate a potential ceasefire in the war with Ukraine. Trump suggested that a peace deal could involve territorial swaps between the two nations, a proposal Ukraine has consistently rejected in the past. The Kremlin has confirmed the summit, which follows discussions between Putin and a U.S. special envoy. Some analysts view the meeting as a diplomatic victory for Moscow, allowing Russia to negotiate over Ukraine's head while potentially destabilizing the region further.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Reportedly Directs Military to Target Latin American Drug Cartels</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 19:20:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has reportedly directed the U.S. military to develop plans for targeting drug cartels in Latin America, a significant escalation in his administration's approach to combating the flow of illicit drugs. This directive follows earlier actions, such as designating several cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations, which provides more legal authority for national security-level responses. The move aligns with the administration's broader strategy of treating the drug crisis as a national security threat rather than just a law enforcement issue. It remains unclear when or if any military action would be implemented under this new directive.</p>

          <p>The new horror film 'Shaman,' directed by Colombian-born Antonio Negret, offers a unique take on the demonic possession genre by grounding it in Andean folklore. The movie follows two American missionaries in a remote region of Ecuador whose son becomes possessed, forcing them to confront local spiritual beliefs and the powerful demon known as the Supay. Filmed on location with the cooperation of an indigenous community, the movie incorporates the Kichwa language and traditional rituals, providing an authentic cultural perspective. The director aimed to create a more personal and raw film that explores themes of cultural conflict and ancient terror.</p>

          <p>A new biography by author Andrew Lownie, titled 'Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York,' presents a deeply unflattering portrait of Prince Andrew, likely cementing his exclusion from public life. The book details his alleged arrogance, poor judgment, and extensive connections to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, establishing links earlier than previously known. Based on hundreds of interviews, the biography recounts numerous anecdotes of rudeness and scandals involving money and sex. Royal commentators suggest the book effectively seals Prince Andrew's fate, making any return to royal duties virtually impossible given the severe damage to his reputation.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire in the Keratea region, southeast of Athens, has resulted in the death of an elderly man who was found inside his home. The blaze, fanned by strong winds, spread rapidly, destroying homes and prompting evacuation alerts for thousands of residents in seven different areas. This fire is one of more than 50 that have broken out across Greece in the last 24 hours, marking one of the worst days for wildfires this summer. Firefighting efforts are being hampered by thick smoke and intense winds, with another major fire also burning in the western region of Ancient Olympia.</p>

Lovell is celebrated for his calm leadership that guided his crew safely back to Earth after an in-flight explosion, turning a potential disaster into a 'successful failure.' He was also a key member of the historic Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon, during which he famously described Earth as a 'grand oasis.'

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to occupy Gaza City, a move that is opposed by both the Israeli security establishment and a majority of the public. This analysis from The Atlantic argues that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision is driven by his political dependence on his coalition's hard-right partners, who advocate for the annexation and resettlement of Gaza. The article suggests Netanyahu is beholden to this minority faction for his political survival, leading him to pursue policies that contradict the strategic advice of his military leaders and the desires of the Israeli people.</p>

          <p>Fast-food chain Wendy's has cut its full-year sales forecast, citing increased competition and economic pressures on its customer base, particularly lower-income consumers. Executives noted that these consumers are eating out less, with breakfast being one of the first meals cut from their spending. The company's global sales are now expected to decline by 3% to 5%, a significant revision from previous projections. This contrasts with competitor McDonald's, which has seen success in attracting value-conscious customers with its expanded value menu, highlighting the competitive challenge Wendy's faces.

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as potential 'illegal migrants' in a social media post. He had alerted authorities and vowed to ensure their deportation before it was revealed the crew was rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease research. After learning the truth, Lowe apologized for the false alarm and pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause. The rowers, which include a former Royal Marine, said they found the incident 'hilarious' as people on the shore watched them suspiciously.</p>

          <p>This article explores the motivations behind the recent trend of fans throwing sex toys onto the court during WNBA games, a phenomenon that players and officials have called 'super disrespectful.' While some incidents appear to be random acts of immaturity, a group associated with a meme-coin called Green Dildo Coin has claimed responsibility for some disruptions. A spokesperson for the group stated the 'viral stunts' were intended to garner attention for their new cryptocurrency, not to express dislike for women's sports. The incidents have led to at least two arrests and a strong condemnation from the league.</p>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that home prices are beginning to fall in some U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West. Among the 50 largest metro areas, cities like Austin and Miami have seen the most significant price drops, with median listing prices falling nearly 15% and 19% respectively since 2022. This trend is attributed to rising housing inventory in these areas, partly due to a pandemic-era construction boom. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to face tight inventory and rising prices, creating a divided national housing market. (not investment advice)</p>
