          <p>An intentional act of violence occurred in East Hollywood when a driver plowed their car into a crowd outside a music venue, injuring at least 30 people. The incident took place early Saturday morning after the driver was reportedly removed from a nearby establishment. Following the crash, bystanders pulled the driver from the vehicle and assaulted them, during which an unknown individual shot the driver. Police are investigating the crash as an assault with a deadly weapon and are searching for the person who fired the gun.</p>

          <p>During a concert in San Francisco, pop star Katy Perry experienced a technical issue with a large mechanical butterfly prop she was riding. While suspended over the audience and singing her hit "Roar," the prop suddenly dropped several feet, startling the singer. Perry quickly recovered and continued her performance without further incident, later making a lighthearted comment about the malfunction. This type of aerial prop is common in large-scale concerts, with other artists occasionally facing similar technical difficulties during their shows.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch. The suit, seeking at least $20 billion in damages, claims the newspaper published a false and defamatory story about a "bawdy" birthday letter allegedly signed by Trump for Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. Trump has vehemently denied the report, labeling the letter a fake. A spokesperson for Dow Jones stated the company has full confidence in its reporting and will defend against the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Actors Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O’Connell, married for 18 years, have revealed their unique approach to managing their finances. The couple maintains separate bank accounts and contributes quarterly to a "community pot" for shared family expenses. The amount each contributes varies depending on who is working more at the time, a system they adopted to support their decision to always have one parent at home with their twin daughters. This financial independence is part of the unconventional framework that has supported their long-lasting Hollywood marriage.</p>

For Barcelona, the deal represents a low-risk opportunity to acquire a talented, experienced player who could be a major asset if he rediscovers his top form.

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has condemned the United States for imposing visa restrictions on Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. The sanctions, enacted by the Trump administration, target Moraes and other officials involved in the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Lula described the US action as unacceptable interference in another nation's judicial system and a violation of sovereignty. The move follows a ruling by Justice Moraes that placed new restrictions on Bolsonaro, a Trump ally, as he awaits a verdict on charges of attempting to overturn the 2022 election.</p>

          <p>In the first Test match between the British and Irish Lions and Australia, flanker Tom Curry delivered a powerful and aggressive performance that was instrumental in the Lions' 27-19 victory. Alongside fellow flanker Tadhg Beirne, Curry's physicality and relentless play set the tone early and answered any critics who may have doubted his form. Coach Andy Farrell described their contribution as "immense." Curry's performance, which included a try, was a key factor in the win, putting the Lions in a strong position for the remainder of the series against the Wallabies.</p>

          <p>Nearly 100 people were arrested across the United Kingdom during demonstrations protesting the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. Protests took place in London, Bristol, Manchester, and other cities, with many arrests made under the Terrorism Act for displaying signs in support of the group. The UK government banned Palestine Action earlier this month, making support for the group a criminal offense, following a break-in at an RAF base. The protests occurred ahead of a High Court challenge to the ban filed by the group's co-founder.</p>

          <p>Major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have criticized the R&A's enforcement of slow-play rules during the third round of The Open. Both golfers' groups were warned by officials for being over their allotted time, a day after another player received a controversial penalty. Stenson noted the inconsistency of being warned for being a few minutes behind on Saturday after the first two rounds ran significantly over schedule. DeChambeau advocated for a new system that times every individual shot, arguing the current approach is unfair and that officials are reluctant to properly enforce the rules.</p>

The incidents occurred near centers run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Witnesses described indiscriminate fire, while the Israeli military stated it fired warning shots after people approached troops and ignored calls to keep their distance. The GHF claims the shootings happened far from its sites, highlighting the deadly chaos surrounding aid distribution in the catastrophic humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>The Pennsylvania-based Christian group Generation Life is engaging in "beach outreach" at the Jersey shore, speaking with young people about love, relationships, and chastity. The activists aim to present a countercultural message, suggesting that true intimacy and self-worth are found outside of modern hookup culture, which they see as transactional and damaging, particularly due to social media. Rather than focusing on abstinence, they define chastity as seeing a person's whole worth. Their approach highlights the challenges of promoting a traditional message to a largely secular and sexually liberal generation.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Japan's upper house election, far-right parties are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration concerns to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Parties like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan are using rhetoric similar to Western nationalist movements, blaming foreigners for crime and social disruption. This sentiment is fueled by a surge in tourism and the visibility of foreign workers needed to address Japan's labor shortage. These parties advocate for nationalist "Japanese First" policies, opposing immigration and arguing that the nation can sustain itself with a smaller, purely Japanese population.
