          <p>Silicon Valley startup Tensor is developing what it calls the world's first personal "robocar," a luxury electric vehicle designed with Level 4 autonomy. The vehicle features a retractable steering wheel, an extensive sensor array, and an AI system that operates independently of the cloud for enhanced privacy. Unlike competitors focused on robotaxi fleets, Tensor is targeting the consumer market, partnering with automaker VinFast for manufacturing with a planned release in 2026. This approach could shift the paradigm of car ownership from relying on ride-hailing services to the direct consumer purchase of autonomous technology.</p>

The company priced its long-awaited Initial Public Offering at $23.50 per share, raising $800 million, but the stock price dropped after opening. This public offering follows two previous delays due to market volatility and comes amid a resurgence in the live events market, which has boosted sales but also created unpredictable revenue streams. StubHub faces competition from rivals like Ticketmaster, which is currently under scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, marking the first reduction of the year in an effort to support a slowing labor market. The move, which brings the rate to a range of 4% to 4.25%, was long advocated for by President Trump, although he had pushed for a larger cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the challenge of simultaneous slowing job gains and rising inflation, stating the central bank's focus has shifted toward employment risks. This decision occurs amidst significant political pressure on the Fed, including a recent attempt to remove a board member. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet's Waymo is partnering with Lyft to introduce its autonomous robotaxi service in Nashville next year, marking the first commercial collaboration between the two companies. Following the announcement, Lyft's stock price surged by over 10%. Under the agreement, Lyft will manage the fleet's operations, including vehicle maintenance and depot management, and will eventually integrate the Waymo vehicles into its own ride-hailing platform. This deal expands Waymo's significant lead in the U.S. robotaxi market and provides a strategic boost for Lyft as it competes with its larger rival, Uber.</p>

          <p>In his first vote since being confirmed, newly-appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran was the sole dissenter in the central bank's decision to lower its key interest rate by a quarter point. Miran, a White House economic advisor, voted for a more aggressive half-point cut, highlighting disagreement within the Federal Open Market Committee. His appointment is seen by critics as a move by President Trump to influence the Fed's independence, as the president has been publicly demanding lower interest rates. The dissent underscores the widening division among policymakers regarding the future direction of monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points is expected to provide a positive outlook for the mortgage market. Mortgage rates, which had already fallen to a three-year low in anticipation of the cut, are likely to see continued downward pressure. This development offers potential savings for both prospective homebuyers and existing homeowners considering a refinance. While the full impact depends on various economic factors, including the 10-year Treasury yield, the current trend encourages borrowers who have been waiting for more favorable conditions to explore their options.

This finding provides strong support for the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in our primate ancestors' fruit-based diets.

Once hired remotely, these operatives gain access to a company's network, effectively creating a security breach from within. Kurtz emphasized that this sophisticated tactic demonstrates how AI is "democratizing destruction" for adversaries, making cyberattacks easier and faster to execute. He argued that companies now require AI-based defense systems to counter these evolving AI-powered threats, a field his company is actively pursuing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Republican Lawmakers Urge Trump Administration for Emergency Aid for Farmers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 13:58:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican lawmakers from farm states are pressing the Trump administration to provide a substantial economic aid package for farmers by the end of the year. They warn of a potential "financial calamity" in rural America due to low crop prices and the ongoing trade war, which have severely impacted farm income. The proposed aid would be similar to the $23 billion in payments issued during Trump's first term, though some lawmakers suggest a larger amount is now needed. The discussions highlight the political pressure on the administration to support a key constituency that is feeling the negative effects of its trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lithuanian prosecutors have announced the disruption of a plot, allegedly led by Russian military intelligence, to carry out bomb attacks across Europe using mail parcels. Suspects from several countries were reportedly recruited via Telegram to send homemade incendiary devices concealed in items like massage cushions. Several parcels containing the flammable substance thermite were shipped to the UK and Poland, with some devices exploding at logistics centers in Germany and England. The international investigation, involving multiple European and North American agencies, has led to the seizure of additional explosives intended for future attacks.</p>

          <p>A sharp drop in mortgage rates to a multi-year low has triggered a nearly 60% week-over-week surge in refinancing applications, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Homeowners who purchased homes in 2023 and 2024 at much higher interest rates are the primary group positioned to benefit from substantial monthly savings. Borrowers with large loan balances, good credit, and those with adjustable-rate mortgages also stand to gain significantly from locking in a new, lower fixed rate. The trend reflects homeowner optimism that the current rate environment provides a valuable opportunity to reduce long-term housing costs. (not investment advice)</p>
