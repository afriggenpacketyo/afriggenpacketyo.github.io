          <p>A police officer and three civilians were fatally shot in a Midtown Manhattan office building by a gunman who then died by a self-inflicted wound. The deceased officer, Didarul Islam, was a four-year NYPD veteran praised by Mayor Eric Adams for his dedication and service to the city. The incident prompted a massive police response and lockdown of the 44-story building on Park Avenue, with authorities urging the public to avoid the area. The investigation is ongoing into the motive of the shooter, who used an AR-style weapon.</p>

          <p>Singapore Airlines experienced a significant drop in its share price, falling over 8% after reporting a 59% decline in first-quarter net profit. The company attributed the downturn to lower interest income and a share of losses from associated companies, specifically noting the financial impact of its 25.1% stake in Air India. Despite the profit plunge, the airline noted that demand for air travel remains strong, and it is confident in its long-term strategy to maintain its industry-leading position. The carrier also cited geopolitical uncertainties as a continuing challenge for its operating environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah II to discuss plans for a humanitarian aid airlift to the Gaza Strip, using Jordan as a hub. This diplomatic effort comes amid mounting international and domestic pressure on Germany to take a stronger stance with Israel regarding the severe humanitarian crisis in the enclave. A recent survey indicates that nearly 75% of Germans, across most political affiliations, believe their government should apply more pressure on Israel to allow aid and end the conflict.</p>

The desperation is so severe that residents are resorting to "self-distribution" by climbing onto moving trucks to secure food.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland are being viewed as a valuable, if unconventional, opportunity to strengthen the transatlantic relationship. The interactions, which included a freewheeling press Q&A, provided Starmer with significant face time with the American president ahead of a planned state visit. While navigating the president's unpredictable style presents challenges, Downing Street reportedly sees the access as crucial for aligning on key issues like the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where they hope to see a toughening of the U.S. outlook.</p>

          <p>USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA after the organization denied his waiver request for a final season of eligibility. Wingfield, a transfer player, is challenging the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," arguing that circumstances including the pandemic and a season-ending injury should grant him an exception. The lawsuit claims the denial robs him of a significant name, image, and likeness (NIL) opportunity and the chance to enhance his career at USC. He is seeking an injunction to allow him to play in the upcoming season.</p>

Cramer argues that investors may have "tariff ennui," as the pattern of threatening high tariffs followed by a negotiated deal with concessions has become familiar.
