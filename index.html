          <p>A woman is recovering from serious injuries after a funicular crash in Lisbon, Portugal, that killed 16 people, including her husband. She recalls that they switched seats just before the incident, a decision that likely saved her life while sealing his fate. The crash, which also killed two other Canadian citizens, was attributed by officials to a failed cable on the historic railway tram. The woman, Hind Iguernane, was unaware for days that her husband, Aziz Benharref, had died, as she drifted in and out of consciousness in the hospital while staff searched for him.</p>

The workers, suspected of visa violations, were part of the largest single-site enforcement action in ICE history, which has strained U.S.-South Korea relations. South Korean officials have expressed deep concern over the detentions, which they say have shocked the Korean public and could jeopardize future investments. In response to the raid, Seoul is negotiating with Washington for better visa access for its skilled workers to prevent similar incidents.</p>

          <p>Attendees of a campus event at Utah Valley University have described widespread panic after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot while speaking. Witnesses reported hearing a loud bang before seeing Kirk fall, leading to a chaotic scramble for safety among the approximately 3,000 people present. The single shot is believed to have been fired from a nearby rooftop. Several eyewitnesses, including students and a former congressman, expressed their shock and trauma, with some noting a surprising lack of security measures like bag checks at the large public gathering.</p>

          <p>The Flanders Festival Ghent has canceled a scheduled performance by the Munich Philharmonic due to the involvement of its incoming Israeli chief conductor, Lahav Shani. Organizers cited concerns over Shani's perceived attitude toward the Israeli government, which they labeled a "genocidal regime," despite acknowledging his past calls for peace. The decision has drawn sharp condemnation from German Culture Minister Wolfram Weimer, who called it "pure antisemitism" and an attack on cultural freedom. Both the orchestra and the city of Munich criticized the move as a form of collective punishment that undermines democratic values.</p>

          <p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has vowed to accelerate a major modernization program for the country's military after multiple Russian drones violated its airspace. The incident, which occurred during Russian strikes on Ukraine, is being viewed by European officials as a deliberate provocation and a significant escalation. In response, Poland has implemented air traffic restrictions in its eastern regions and is proceeding with the planned closure of its border with Belarus.

          <p>Following his fatal shooting at a Utah university, many are examining the career of Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and ally of Donald Trump. At 18, Kirk co-founded Turning Point USA, a student group that grew into a major force in galvanizing young conservatives through campus rallies and social media. The organization was instrumental in mobilizing youth support for Trump's political campaigns, making Kirk a household name in Republican circles. Kirk, 31, was known for his provocative rhetoric on cultural issues and amassed a significant following online, solidifying his role as a key influencer in the modern conservative movement.</p>

          <p>Israel has conducted a series of targeted assassinations against its enemies across the Middle East for the past two years, with mixed results. The campaign has eliminated high-ranking leaders from Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran in locations including Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen. While some killings, like that of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, contributed to a ceasefire, others have failed to halt ongoing conflicts, such as the Houthi attacks from Yemen. This long-term strategy of targeting individuals has reshaped regional dynamics but has not consistently achieved Israel's ultimate goal of ending hostilities or dismantling these organizations.</p>

While Ossoff's office and social media posts claimed he "championed" the bipartisan bill, records show he was not a co-sponsor and did not vote on it. Republican colleagues, including the bill's sponsor, Rep. Derrick Van Orden, accused Ossoff of using veterans as "political props" and telling a "bald faced lie."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Twenty-four years after the 9/11 attacks, the nature of terrorist threats has fundamentally changed due to the rise of the internet and artificial intelligence. While al-Qaida operated as a centralized organization requiring significant time and resources, modern extremists can leverage online tools for instant radicalization, planning, and fundraising. The internet, social media, and generative AI have allowed terrorist groups to weaponize information, creating a decentralized and more complex threat landscape. This evolution requires counterterrorism strategies to adapt, focusing on public-private partnerships with tech companies and global diplomacy to combat digital extremism.</p>

The Miami Dolphins suffered a blowout loss, with their creative but physically soft style under coach Mike McDaniel drawing criticism.

Some family members, like Elizabeth Miller, support plea agreements as a way to finally achieve closure and obtain a factual account of the attacks.

          <p>Each autumn, male brown tarantulas in Colorado leave their burrows for a perilous journey to find mates, a trek that lasts from mid-September to mid-October. Once sexually mature, the males wander in search of female burrows, where they must carefully signal their romantic intentions to avoid being eaten. The females, who can live up to 30 years, remain in their dens, and the mating process is a risky endeavor for the males, who often become a post-coital meal. Despite their fearsome reputation, these tarantulas are generally harmless to humans and play a beneficial role in controlling pests.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece contrasts the intense outrage from Donald Trump's supporters over the Jeffrey Epstein scandal with their indifference toward the E. Jean Carroll case. The author argues this discrepancy reveals a deep-seated misogyny, where the only victims deemed worthy of defense are young, fallen girls, who serve as a symbol of purity. Adult, successful, and articulate women like Carroll, who challenge patriarchal norms, are dismissed or attacked. This selective sentimentalization allows the MAGA movement to feel morally righteous in defending abused children while simultaneously ignoring or denigrating other female victims of sexual abuse, particularly those who accuse their political leader.</p>

          <p>Official statistics show a 10% drop in the number of asylum-seekers receiving welfare in Germany, accompanied by a decrease in overall asylum applications, placing the country third in the EU for new claims. In political news, the German parliament has lifted the immunity of far-right AfD politician Maximilian Krah to allow for an investigation into alleged money laundering and bribery during his time in the European Parliament. The decision was supported by all parliamentary groups, including Krah's own. This follows numerous scandals that have surrounded the controversial politician, including an aide being on trial for spying for China.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reportedly asked the European Union to impose tariffs of up to 100% on China and India for their purchases of Russian oil, a move that has been met with caution in Europe. The proposal is seen as an attempt to further punish Russia's war economy, but European officials are wary of alienating key global partners and being drawn into Trump's contentious trade strategies. Analysts suggest the EU is unlikely to agree, given its own complex trade relationship with Russia and a general aversion to using tariffs as a primary policy tool. The timing also appears awkward, as Washington is currently negotiating a trade deal with New Delhi.</p>

Dismissing doubts about his age, Vardy stated that he feels as fresh as ever and is motivated to prove his critics wrong.

          <p>Israel's recent attack targeting Hamas leadership in Qatar underscores the limitations of its long-standing goal to eliminate the militant group. Despite nearly two years of a devastating military campaign that has killed many of Hamas's top leaders and thousands of fighters, the organization continues to survive and even recruit new members. Hamas has demonstrated an ability to withstand staggering losses and melt into the civilian population, making the goal of "total victory" appear elusive. This persistent resilience, coupled with Israel's growing international isolation, suggests that its current military strategy may be a recipe for an endless and unwinnable conflict.</p>

This article presents the killing not as an isolated incident but as part of a disturbing trend that includes recent assassination attempts on Donald Trump and attacks on other politicians. The event is poised to make Kirk a martyr for the conservative cause and will likely deepen the nation's already severe political divisions. With increasingly divisive rhetoric fueled by social media and easy access to firearms, the incident raises bleak questions about the future of public life and whether American politics has become an inherently violent arena.</p>

The move is part of President Xi Jinping's broader anti-corruption campaign within the military. The Rocket Force, established in 2015, is a critical branch of the PLA responsible for managing China's strategic and nuclear missile arsenal, making integrity within its supply chain a national security priority.</p>

This financial transformation is attributed to a combination of minimal spending in previous years, a beneficial takeover by the Friedkin Group that managed the club's debt, and future revenue from a new, larger stadium.
