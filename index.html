          <p>Toyota has announced that the redesigned 2026 RAV4 SUV will be offered exclusively as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid model, eliminating the traditional gas engine option. This decision reflects the growing popularity and customer demand for hybrid vehicles, aligning with Toyota's long-standing leadership in hybrid technology. The move comes despite a slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles, with automakers increasingly turning to hybrid models to meet fuel economy regulations. In 2024, electrified vehicle sales accounted for 43.1% of Toyota's domestic sales, and the RAV4's hybrid variants already represent a significant portion of its sales.</p>

          <p>A new report by ICF forecasts a significant increase in electricity demand, potentially jumping by 78% by 2050, alongside rising costs, posing substantial energy challenges for the United States.

          <p>Scientists predict that the Axial Seamount, an underwater volcano located 300 miles off the Oregon coast, could erupt later this year. The volcano, which last erupted in 2015, is showing signs of increased activity, though scientists emphasize that the eruption poses no danger to people on land. The first sign of an eruption will be a sharp increase in the number of earthquakes around the volcano, caused by magma moving toward the surface. Experts expect the eruption to continue slowly for about a month, with lava flows spreading across the caldera.</p>

          <h2>FDA Tightens Access to COVID Boosters, Calls for New Clinical Trials</h2>

          <p>The FDA will continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for high-risk groups but will require vaccine makers to conduct new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. This decision means that many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. The FDA's new leadership, under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aims to balance access for vulnerable populations with the need for more evidence for the general population. The agency is urging vaccine makers to run new randomized studies in adults between 50 and 64 and in children under 5.</p>

          <p>At least two Navy SEALs are facing disciplinary action after racist memes were shared in a Signal chat targeting a Black fellow SEAL. The memes, which included depictions of slavery, resurfaced after the targeted sailor reported them. The SEAL who reported the memes had previously had his Trident revoked but it has since been reinstated. Platoon and team leaders are also facing administrative actions for not adequately addressing the sailor's concerns about racist behavior. This incident underscores ongoing concerns about racial issues within Naval Special Warfare Command.</p>

          <p>The NFL is debating a potential ban on the Philadelphia Eagles' signature play, the "Tush Push," with the Packers citing player safety and pace of play as reasons. Despite some coaches expressing safety concerns, NFL executive Jeff Miller states that data doesn't support safety being an issue. Others argue that the play, similar to a scrum in rugby, doesn't belong in football. The play involves the quarterback being pushed forward by teammates for short-yardage gains, sparking debate over its fairness and potential dangers.</p>

The vaccine, a meningitis B vaccine, is 30-40% effective and aims to reverse soaring numbers of infections, which reached over 85,000 cases in 2023. This vaccine wasn't designed for gonorrhoea. It's the meningitis B vaccine currently given to babies. Experts say the bacteria that cause the two diseases are so closely related that the MenB jab appears to cut gonorrhoea cases by around a third.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that red meat studies with industry links were more likely to report favorable results compared to those without such connections. The review, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that industry-funded studies often neglected to compare red meat to heart-healthy plant-based protein sources. This raises concerns about how financial interests can shape the understanding of the health consequences of dietary choices. Experts suggest that more independent funding for nutrition research is needed to ensure unbiased and reliable results.</p>
