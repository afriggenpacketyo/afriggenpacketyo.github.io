          <p>Kate Forbes, Scotland's Deputy First Minister, has announced she will not seek re-election in the 2026 Holyrood election. The Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP cited a desire to prioritize her family and not miss the early years of her daughter's life. First Minister John Swinney praised her invaluable contribution to public life over the past decade, during which she rose to become finance secretary and narrowly lost the 2023 SNP leadership contest. Forbes will continue to serve as an MSP and in her government role until the election, expressing her ongoing support for Swinney and the party's goals.</p>

          <p>A recent survey has revealed that deep emotional bonds with pets are leading to some surprising sentiments, amplified by a viral AI trend. The survey, which asked 1,000 Americans about their connection with their pets, found that 31% would consider dating an AI-generated human version of their animal companion. This sentiment was particularly strong among Millennials and Gen X. The findings highlight the significant emotional support pets provide, with 77% of respondents stating their pet offers better support than an ex-partner and 38% trusting their pet more than their closest human friends.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic political maneuver, Democratic legislators have left Texas to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to pass a new congressional map. The Democrats argue the proposed map is a partisan gerrymander designed to unfairly expand the GOP's majority in the U.S. House. They accuse Governor Greg Abbott of using disaster relief for recent floods as political leverage for the redistricting effort. In response, Governor Abbott has threatened to have the absent lawmakers removed from their offices, citing a legal opinion, a move the Democrats have defiantly challenged.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Seasonal employees at Yosemite National Park reportedly worked for weeks without pay this year due to federal budget cuts and hiring backlogs within the National Park Service. Several workers stated they were asked to perform duties as volunteers in exchange for free housing while waiting to be officially hired, a situation some described as exploitative. The issue stems from a strained Human Resources division, which struggled to onboard seasonal staff after a series of firings and rehirings earlier in the year. The National Park Service's policy prohibits employees from volunteering in roles similar to their paid work to prevent such situations.</p>

          <p>A recent federal report from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health shows a promising decrease in depression and suicidal behaviors among teenagers between 2021 and 2024. The prevalence of serious suicidal thoughts in adolescents aged 12-17 dropped from nearly 13% to 10%, with a corresponding decline in suicide attempts. Experts suggest this improvement may be linked to increased openness among teens about their struggles and better access to specialized treatment. However, the report also highlights that access to mental health care remains a challenge, with millions of teens still experiencing suicidal thoughts.</p>

          <p>A musical advertisement from cryptocurrency firm Coinbase has generated significant buzz by satirizing the UK's economic challenges, including strikes and a high cost of living. Titled "Everything is Fine," the ad depicts a nation in decline and has divided opinion, with many in the tech and venture capital sectors praising its message while others criticize it as misleading. The ad has been interpreted as a sharp critique of the UK government's handling of the economy and its perceived slowness in embracing cryptocurrency innovation. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong stated the ad's theme of updating a failing financial system is not specific to the UK or any political party.</p>

          <p>The Ann Arbor District Library has achieved remarkable success with its "Summer Game," an interactive challenge that has engaged thousands of residents, more than half of whom are adults. The game evolved from a simple reading challenge into a comprehensive library-using game inspired by corporate loyalty programs. Players earn points by solving puzzles, exploring local history, and discovering the library's diverse offerings beyond books, such as tools and art.

          <p>This article from the "My Unsung Hero" series recounts a powerful story of kindness experienced by Eileen Freiberg-Dale while she was caring for her husband after a traumatic brain injury. Overwhelmed with new responsibilities and grieving, she was struggling to rake the leaves in her yard when a friend of 15 years, Jonathan Lilienfeld, appeared unexpectedly. He simply put his arm around her, told her to rest, and proceeded to rake and bag all the leaves himself. Freiberg-Dale recalls this simple, unsolicited act of help as a heroic rescue during one of the most difficult times of her life.</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old woman faces child abuse charges in New Zealand after she was discovered attempting to conceal a two-year-old child inside her suitcase during a long-distance bus trip. The bus driver found the child, who was overheated but otherwise physically unharmed, during a routine stop when he noticed the bag moving in the luggage compartment. The child was taken to a hospital for examination. Authorities noted the child could have suffered from suffocation or heatstroke, and the woman's actions represented a significant failure in her duty of care.</p>

          <p>President Trump's policies, including a federal hiring freeze and the firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner, are raising concerns about the accuracy of data crucial for Social Security beneficiaries. The hiring freeze has reportedly forced the BLS to use less precise methods for tracking inflation, which could lead to an inaccurate cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026. Furthermore, the dismissal of the BLS Commissioner after the release of poor employment numbers threatens to politicize the independent agency, potentially eroding public trust in the economic data that directly impacts retirees' incomes.

          <p>Although the Trump administration has given Nvidia assurances it can resume selling its H20 AI chips to China, analysts predict the company will still face a declining market share. A Bernstein report forecasts Nvidia's share of China's AI chip market will drop from 66% to 54% by 2025. This is attributed to the rise of domestic Chinese competitors like Huawei, which have gained ground due to U.S. export controls. Additionally, Nvidia is now facing direct scrutiny from Beijing's cyberspace regulators over national security concerns related to its chips, further complicating its recovery in the crucial market.</p>

          <p>The main forum representing the families of Israeli hostages has condemned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reported strategy to secure their release primarily through military action. After the release of harrowing videos showing emaciated hostages, reports emerged that Netanyahu favors a "decisive military victory" over a negotiated deal. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum called this approach a "fraud" and an "illusion," stating that Netanyahu is leading both Israel and the hostages toward devastation.

          <p>A growing number of older activists in the UK are risking arrest and lengthy prison terms by protesting in support of Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed as a terrorist organization by the government. Many of these protesters, some in their 70s and 80s, say they were never political before but felt compelled to act due to the scale of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The proscription makes it illegal to support the group, yet weekly protests continue, leading to over 200 detentions. Critics, including UN experts, have called the government's move a dangerous precedent that infringes on democratic freedoms.</p>

          <p>In a critical opinion piece, commentator Timothy Garton Ash argues that the Democratic party made a catastrophic error by not encouraging President Joe Biden to step aside ahead of the election. The article contends it was obvious to most Americans that Biden was too old for a second term, yet the party establishment and insider journalists failed to challenge his candidacy. Ash suggests a mix of fear of losing access, party tribalism, and deference to the presidency led to this failure. The lesson, he argues, is for the party to listen to voters and for journalists to speak uncomfortable truths.</p>

The team environment appears more relaxed, and the players seem to be responding to his methods. However, the manager and observers know that these positive signs will mean nothing if the team cannot deliver consistent results once the Premier League season begins.</p>
