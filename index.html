          <p>Virginia Giuffre, who accused Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein of sexual assault, has died by suicide at the age of 41. Giuffre's family confirmed her death, stating she had been a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking and that the toll had become unbearable. She was a prominent voice in the fight against sexual abuse, alleging that Epstein and Maxwell trafficked her to Prince Andrew when she was 17, a claim Andrew has denied. Giuffre had recently been living in Western Australia with her family and had posted about a car accident three weeks prior to her death.</p>

          <p>A Milwaukee judge, Hannah Dugan, was arrested by F.B.I. agents on charges of obstructing immigration agents. The charges allege that she guided an undocumented immigrant through a side door in her courtroom to evade agents waiting in the public hallway. This arrest marks a significant escalation in the Trump administration's conflict with local authorities over deportations. The administration has been demanding that local officials cooperate with federal efforts to deport undocumented immigrants, threatening investigation or prosecution for non-compliance.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked an executive order from President Trump that aimed to cancel collective bargaining rights for most federal workers. U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman issued the injunction following a lawsuit from the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), which argued the order would violate federal workers' labor rights and is unconstitutional. The order exempted numerous agencies from bargaining with unions and would affect a significant portion of federal workers represented by unions. The temporary injunction will remain in effect until the NTEU lawsuit is resolved.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has drafted a counterproposal to a Trump administration peace plan that has been criticized for conceding too much to Russia. While the counteroffer maintains some of Kyiv's original demands, it suggests potential compromises on previously non-negotiable issues. The plan includes provisions for no restrictions on the Ukrainian military, a European security contingent backed by the U.S. to guarantee security, and the use of frozen Russian assets for war damage repairs. Notably, the plan omits demands for Ukraine to fully regain all territory seized by Russia or insistence on joining NATO.</p>

          <p>Five individuals have been arrested and charged with fraud for allegedly submitting false claims for disaster relief funds from FEMA, falsely claiming their properties were damaged in recent Los Angeles wildfires. The defendants are accused of fraudulently collecting thousands of dollars in federal disaster-relief funds.

The research is particularly relevant given the rise of self-driving vehicles, where passengers are more prone to motion sickness than drivers.</p>

          <h2>California Faces License Plate Shortage, Announces New Numbering System</h2>

          <p>California is running out of its current combination of license plate numbers and letters and will implement a new sequence for newly registered vehicles starting next year. The current sequence, which began in 1980, is projected to end in 2026 due to the increasing rate of new vehicle registrations. The new sequence will consist of three numerals, followed by three letters, and one numeral (e.g., "000AAA0"). The accelerated depletion of license plate numbers is partly attributed to fears of increased car prices due to potential trade wars.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that Russia and Ukraine are "very close to a deal" following talks between his envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. The Kremlin described the talks as "constructive," while Trump urged both countries to finalize the agreement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, however, emphasized the need for "real pressure on Russia" to accept an unconditional ceasefire. Reports suggest the potential agreement may involve Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.</p>

          <p>China is taking a notably tougher stance towards the Trump administration during his second term, reacting to tariffs with its own countermeasures and demonstrating a reluctance to back down. Unlike Trump's first term, there is no apparent prospect of a meeting between President Xi Jinping and Trump. China has become more assertive in its rhetoric, criticizing American "bullying" and seeking international support for its position. This shift in approach may stem from China's experiences during Trump's first term.</p>

Doge's website lists savings from contracts, grants, and leases, but only about half have supporting documentation. US media has also highlighted accounting errors. A source familiar with a contract for a facility in Texas to house migrant children stated that the Doge's figure is based on speculative figures and that the actual savings from early termination were approximately $153 million.</p>
