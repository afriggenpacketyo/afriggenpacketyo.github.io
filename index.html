          <p>Perplexity AI offered to acquire Google's Chrome browser for $34.5 billion, highlighting the antitrust pressure on Google ahead of a looming court decision regarding its search monopoly. The U.S. Department of Justice has suggested Google divest Chrome to foster competition, but Google opposes this, citing government overreach. Analysts have valued Alphabet's non-search assets, with Chrome potentially worth $50 billion due to its user base and advertising revenue contribution. A Chrome divestiture could significantly impact Alphabet's stock, but some analysts believe a complete breakup would benefit shareholders (not investment advice). The article provides context on Google's diversification efforts and regulatory challenges. The company is actively trying to maintain a steady path forward.</p>

          <p>McDonald's and Wendy's reported a decline in breakfast sales, attributing the trend to economic uncertainty and financial pressures on low-income consumers. Executives noted that low-income consumers are cutting back on discretionary spending, opting to skip breakfast or eat at home instead of purchasing fast food. Analysts suggest that rising fast-food costs and broader economic pressures like inflation and high credit card interest rates are contributing to the decline. The article also mentions that Starbucks and Dunkin' are experiencing success with breakfast sales, contrasting the struggles of McDonald's and Wendy's. This may be a sign of the times.</p>

          <p>Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich unveiled plans for new settlements in the occupied West Bank, aiming to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state. The plan involves building nearly 3,500 new apartments in the E1 area, which critics say would divide the West Bank. Smotrich threatened to assert full Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank if France, the UK, and Canada recognize a Palestinian state. The announcement has drawn condemnation from Palestinian officials, rights groups, and Arab countries, who view it as a violation of international law and an obstacle to peace. The plan will not promote harmony in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump's federal crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., has resulted in approximately 100 arrests and the deployment of 800 National Guard troops. Federal law enforcement agents from various agencies are patrolling the city, and a juvenile curfew zone has been extended in the Navy Yard. Protests have emerged across the city opposing the federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department and the presence of the National Guard. The article also discusses conflicting crime statistics, with some officials claiming a significant decrease in violent crime while others dispute the accuracy of the data.

          <p>An inquest jury concluded that the death of a 14-year-old girl at Huntercombe Hospital was unlawful, citing insufficient staff training and inadequate care. Ruth Szymankiewicz, who was being treated for an eating disorder, was left alone to self-harm and was later found unconscious. The jury identified contributing factors such as the employment of a staff member with fake ID and the hospital's failure to prevent her from accessing harmful material online. Her parents expressed grief and criticized the system meant to care for her. This is a tragic event.</p>

          <p>Researchers have used artificial intelligence to design two new potential antibiotics effective against drug-resistant gonorrhoea and MRSA. The AI designed the drugs atom-by-atom, and they successfully killed superbugs in laboratory and animal tests. While the compounds require years of refinement and clinical trials, the MIT team believes AI could usher in a "second golden age" of antibiotic discovery. The study interrogated 36 million compounds, including those not yet discovered, to identify promising candidates and ensure they were not toxic to humans. This may lead to a new age of medical treatments.</p>

The PIF's annualized returns since 2017 dropped to 7.2% from 8.7% the previous year, and international investments fell to 17% of the portfolio. Lower oil prices and reduced Aramco dividends are expected to limit PIF's investment funds, leading to increased investments in high-growth areas like AI (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi claimed that the election authority enabled "vote theft" to boost Narendra Modi's BJP in the 2024 general elections. Gandhi alleged that electoral rolls were manipulated in a key state, and the INC found discrepancies in electoral data. The Election Commission of India (ECI) refuted Gandhi's claims, while the BJP accused the opposition of undermining public confidence. The opposition bloc staged a protest in the capital, calling for a session to discuss the allegations. India's elections are always under scrutiny.</p>

          <p>France, the UK, Canada, and Australia plan to formally recognize a Palestinian state, despite conditions that make the plan impossible to achieve. These conditions include Hamas disarming, renouncing terrorism, and accepting Israel's right to exist. The article argues that this move is driven by domestic political pressure to appease supporters who are critical of Israel. The initiative has pushed the region away from stability, and the issue for protesters is Israel, not Palestine. The region is always in turmoil.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tax law changes could complicate Roth conversions, which transfer pretax IRA funds to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. While the new tax cuts may make Roth conversions more appealing, higher income from conversions can impact eligibility for certain tax breaks. Weighing Roth conversions requires considering multi-year state and federal tax impacts, and experts advise knowing the impact on Medicare premiums. The article provides context on tax planning strategies and potential implications for retirees (not investment advice). The tax code is always changing.</p>
