            <p>The Federal Trade Commission is suing Uber, alleging deceptive billing and cancellation practices related to its Uber One subscription service. The FTC claims Uber misled consumers about the service's benefits, made cancellation difficult, and charged users without consent. Uber disputes the allegations, stating its sign-up and cancellation processes are clear and compliant with the law. The FTC's action marks its first major move against a tech company since President Trump's second term began, signaling continued scrutiny of Big Tech. Optimism surrounding the situation is low, as the FTC has taken an aggressive stance against tech companies. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump is supporting Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after reports surfaced of a second Signal chat leak involving sensitive military information. This follows an earlier incident where attack details were shared in a group chat that included Hegseth's wife and lawyer. The BBC confirmed that Hegseth shared information about air strikes against Yemen in the second chat, but the White House denies classified information was shared. Critics argue such discussions could jeopardize US military personnel, while Trump dismisses the reports as media sensationalism.

            <p>President Trump will meet with executives from Walmart, Target, Home Depot, and Lowe's to discuss the impact of his trade policies on their businesses. Retailers are facing increased pressure from tariffs, which threaten to disrupt their import-heavy business models and raise prices for consumers. Walmart, with a larger proportion of domestically sourced goods, may be less affected than Target, which relies more on overseas manufacturing. This meeting highlights the growing tension between the administration's trade agenda and the concerns of major retailers regarding profitability and consumer affordability.</p>

Vice Chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe will serve as interim chairman while a search for a permanent replacement is conducted.

He will receive an automatic life sentence without parole after local prosecutors took the death penalty off the table, respecting the wishes of a majority of victims' families. Crusius has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms at the federal level for hate crimes and weapons charges, bringing some closure to the community impacted by this tragedy.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration, led by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, is threatening New York with "serious consequences" if it does not halt its congestion pricing program in Manhattan. The program charges a $9 toll on most passenger vehicles entering Manhattan south of 60th Street during peak hours, similar to systems in cities like London. Duffy argues that the toll is an illegal attempt to backfill the budget of New York's transit system and is giving the governor a deadline to comply or face potential withholding of federal funding. New York leaders defend the program, citing early successes in reducing traffic and generating revenue for public transit improvements.</p>

This attack comes as Trump's team is exploring legal options to potentially remove Powell before his term expires in 2026, raising concerns about the Fed's independence.

While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents are significantly more negative on his economic policies.

            <p>The Supreme Court is considering a case that could impact whether Americans have to pay out-of-pocket for preventive-care services under the Affordable Care Act. The dispute centers on how to classify members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which makes recommendations on preventive medical services. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the task force's structure violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. A decision against the task force could limit access to life-saving medical care, while the Trump administration argues that the constitutional violation can be remedied. The case has significant implications for healthcare access and affordability.</p>
