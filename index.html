          <p>A suspect, now deceased, shot a Kentucky State Police trooper before fleeing to a Baptist church in Lexington and injuring multiple people. The incident, which began at a separate location, prompted a large response from state and local police who secured the suspect at the church. The injured trooper is receiving medical attention, and Governor Andy Beshear has called for prayers for all affected by the violence. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities working to determine the full scope of the incident.</p>

          <p>A serious incident occurred at London Southend Airport when a 12-meter aircraft crashed shortly before 4:00 PM BST, erupting into a large fireball upon impact. An eyewitness, who was watching planes with his family, saw the aircraft bank unusually hard after takeoff before it inverted and hit the ground. Multiple flights have been cancelled, and emergency services, including police and fire crews, are on the scene. The airport has confirmed the incident and is working with authorities, asking the public to avoid the area.</p>

          <p>Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal are advancing a bipartisan bill to impose severe sanctions on Russia and any countries aiding its war effort in Ukraine. The legislation would grant the president authority to levy tariffs up to 500% on nations like China, India, and Brazil that support Russia's economy by purchasing its goods. This move signals a potential "turning point" in the conflict, aiming to close the door on diplomacy with Putin and provide a powerful economic tool to compel an end to the war. The bill has garnered broad support with 85 cosponsors in the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In central Denver, a 1940s fortune cookie factory has been converted into a unique, privately funded art gallery that is free to the public. Founder Amanda Precourt, who purchased the dilapidated building nearly a decade ago, hopes the space will serve as a place for community connection and mental wellness through art. The gallery, named the Cookie Factory, opened in May with an inaugural exhibition by artist Sam Falls. Precourt envisions the gallery as a gift to the city, fostering discussion and providing a peaceful place for contemplation.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee report released one year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump reveals significant security failures by the U.S. Secret Service. The investigation found that the agency had denied or failed to fulfill at least 10 requests for additional resources, including counter-snipers and drone countermeasures, for his 2024 campaign rallies. The report accuses former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle of providing false testimony to Congress regarding these denials. It highlights a pattern of communication breakdowns and negligence that contributed to what the committee chairman called a "preventable tragedy."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nigeria's former President Muhammadu Buhari died in London on Sunday following a "prolonged illness," a presidential spokesperson said. "President Buhari died today in London at about 4:30 p.m. (1530 GMT)," President Bola Tinubu's spokesperson wrote in a post on X. He did not disclose the nature of the 82-year-old's illness. Buhari had been in the UK for the past three months. Buhari first led Africa's most populous nation as a military ruler after a coup in the 1980s. He later rebranded himself as a "converted democrat" and then defeated incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan in 2015 in what was judged to be Nigeria's fairest election to date. He remained in power until 2023. Tinubu ordered flags to fly at half-staff in honour of Buhari, whose tenure was dogged by health rumours. Buhari's government faced accusations of a lack of transparency over his illness, especially as he sometimes took long absences. However, Buhari's health was still kept from the public, although he admitted that during one of the trips he had "never been so ill" and that he had received several blood transfusions. Buhari seized power in 1983 as a military ruler, promising to revitalize a mismanaged country. Taking a tough line on corruption, he also questioned Nigeria's bailout conditions sought by the International Monetary Fund. But his first stint was short-lived. He was removed after only 18 months by another military officer, Ibrahim Babangida, and spent much of the following 30 years in fringe political parties and trying to run for president. After his 2015 election win, Buhari took six months to name his cabinet. During that time, the oil-dependent economy was hobbled by low crude prices, prompting people to call him "Baba Go Slow." He won a second victory in 2019, despite his first term being blighted by Nigeria's first recession in a generation, militant attacks on oilfields, and repeated hospital stays. Many hoped Buhari, a retired major general, would crack down on armed groups, just as he had as the country's military head of state. In 2009, the likes of Boko Haram began an Islamist insurgency, initially confined to the northeast, but which later spread to other regions, leaving swathes of Nigeria outside the control of its stretched security forces. Boko Haram and its splinter faction, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), later turned to suicide bombings, kidnappings, and attacks on civilians and military targets. During 16 years of violence, more than 36,000 people have been killed and another 2 million displaced, according to the United Nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte this week as the administration considers a new strategy to support Ukraine. The plan involves selling U.S. weapons to NATO allies, who would then transfer their existing, often compatible, military hardware to Ukrainian forces. This approach could expedite aid to Ukraine as it faces intensified Russian attacks. The meeting comes as a bipartisan group of senators pushes for a tough sanctions bill against Russia, signaling a potential escalation in the U.S. and European response to the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in central Gaza killed ten people, including six children, who were waiting to collect water from a tanker, according to local emergency officials. The Israeli military acknowledged the incident, stating that a "technical error" caused a munition targeting an Islamic Jihad militant to miss its mark by dozens of meters, and expressed regret for any harm to civilians. Verified video from the scene in the al-Nuseirat refugee camp shows the aftermath, with injured people and children among scattered water containers. The incident is currently under review by the Israeli military.</p>

Despite the immense financial challenge of rebuilding, estimated at half a million dollars, and the increasing risk of future floods due to climate change, the family is determined to restore their home.

In a social media post, Trump urged his followers to "let Pam Bondi do her job," highlighting a deepening feud within his administration's top legal and investigative circles over the handling of the politically sensitive Epstein case.</p>

However, Camp Mystic successfully appealed these designations, which would have required flood insurance and stricter building regulations.
