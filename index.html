        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Labour leader Keir Starmer has condemned Reform UK's proposal to eliminate indefinite leave to remain for migrants, labeling the policy as both "racist" and "immoral." The policy, championed by Nigel Farage, would require legally residing migrants to reapply for visas under stricter rules, potentially leading to deportations. Starmer clarified that he believes Reform supporters are not racist but are frustrated with the previous government's failures, emphasizing that targeting legal residents would "rip this country apart." He made these remarks at the Labour conference amid internal questions about his leadership and declining poll numbers.</p>

His 2019 tempranillo earned first place in an international competition, highlighting the growing prominence of Texas as a wine-producing state, which shares a similar climate to Spain's Rioja region.

          <p>The Zombies, a key band in the 1960s British Invasion, experienced a prolonged and unconventional path to rock and roll acclaim. Their initial hit, "She's Not There," brought them early fame in America, but financial struggles and a sense of creative stagnation led to their breakup. Their seminal 1968 album, "Odessey and Oracle," was initially a commercial failure but gained a cult following over time, with the track "Time of the Season" becoming a major hit a year after the band had already disbanded. Decades later, the surviving members have been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, cementing their legacy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Secretary of Defense to deploy federal troops to Portland, Oregon, to address perceived threats from "antifa" and other groups, authorizing the use of "Full Force." This move has been met with strong opposition from local and state officials, including Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, who stated the deployment is "unwanted, unneeded, and un-American." Over 100 community leaders signed an open letter arguing that federal intervention would be counterproductive, harm the city's economy, and recall the divisive deployment of federal agents in 2020.

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries expressed hope that a government shutdown can be avoided ahead of the Tuesday funding deadline, as top congressional leaders are scheduled to meet with President Trump. A key point of contention is the Democratic push to extend the Affordable Care Act's enhanced tax credits, which are set to expire. Jeffries argued that failing to act now would send a "shock to the system" for many Americans, while Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise advocated for a short-term funding bill to allow for further negotiations. Both sides have stated a desire to find a bipartisan agreement to keep the government operating.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Lopez is starring in "Kiss of the Spider Woman," a film adaptation of the Broadway musical, which she describes as the role she has been waiting for her entire life. Growing up in the Bronx, Lopez was deeply influenced by movie musicals and idols like Rita Moreno and Chita Rivera, who originated the role on stage. She discusses the personal challenges she faced during filming, as her divorce from Ben Affleck, an executive producer on the film, was finalized. Lopez views the movie as a "love letter" to the Latin and queer communities and reflects on how the difficult period helped her grow personally.</p>

The Des Moines school board stated it was unaware of any immigration issues, noting that background checks conducted during his 2023 hiring process revealed no problems and that he had affirmed his U.S. citizenship.

          <p>Amid political skepticism about official government statistics, alternative data sources are providing a different perspective on the true rate of inflation. While the official Consumer Price Index (CPI) reports annualized inflation at 2.9%, other measures like the Truflation Price Index and Zillow's Rent Index suggest lower rates. However, leading indicators from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) and the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) point toward rising price pressures, suggesting future inflation may increase. These alternative metrics aim to address potential shortcomings in official data, such as outdated expenditure weights and inadequate adjustments for product changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is developing an industrial "pull" system to mass-produce rockets and satellites, modeling the process on automotive manufacturing to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. This new approach contrasts with the traditional "push" system, where components are made based on forecasts, often leading to delays and waste. In the "pull" model, final assembly dictates the production schedule, pulling components from suppliers only as they are needed, which ensures consistent quality and greater flexibility. Researchers believe mastering scalable space production is crucial for dominating the future of the rapidly growing global space industry.</p>

While overall rental rates are still rising, the pace of increase has slowed, allowing local entrepreneurs to move into spaces with established foot traffic.

This settlement follows Dominion's previous high-profile resolutions with Fox News for $787.5 million and Newsmax for $67 million over similar election lies.

However, because the images were not distributed and the victims were not minors, they found they had little legal recourse. The case has spurred a legislative effort in Minnesota to hold the services enabling such content accountable, shedding light on how technology has outpaced legal protections against this form of digital abuse.</p>

          <p>According to self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi, many people fail to increase their income not due to a lack of intelligence or desire, but because of certain underlying beliefs. The first is the false notion that one should already know how to manage money and earn more, which creates shame and prevents seeking help. Another is the belief that success should come easily if one is talented, ignoring the necessity of patience and systematic effort. Finally, the tendency to procrastinate by telling oneself they will start "later" allows goals to perpetually recede. Overcoming these mental blocks is the crucial first step toward taking meaningful action to improve one's financial situation.</p>

          <p>A series of mass shootings occurred across the United States over the weekend, resulting in multiple fatalities and injuries. In Southport, North Carolina, a shooter opened fire from a boat into a crowd at a waterfront bar, killing three people and wounding at least eight others before a suspect was detained. In Eagle Pass, Texas, a shooting at a casino left two people dead and five injured. Additionally, an attack on Bourbon Street in New Orleans killed one woman and wounded three other people. These incidents contribute to the more than 320 mass shootings that have taken place in the U.S. so far this year.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Latinos in the U.S. are installing air quality sensors at their homes and community centers to gather localized pollution data and advocate for environmental justice. These citizen-led initiatives, such as one organized by the Hispanic Access Foundation, aim to address the disproportionate impact of air pollution on communities of color, which often live near industrial hubs and high-traffic areas. The data collected helps fill gaps left by official government monitoring and provides concrete evidence for demanding better regulations and enforcement, especially as the current administration moves to roll back environmental protections. This grassroots movement empowers residents to take action on local health concerns like high asthma rates.</p>

          <p>Cepee Tabibian, who helps American women move abroad, dispels several common myths about the expatriate experience. She cautions that living abroad is not as cheap as many believe, with housing costs rising globally, and advises against overpaying, which can exacerbate local affordability issues. Tabibian also refutes the ideas that Americans are unwelcome and that loneliness is inevitable, noting that community can be built with patience and effort. She stresses that life abroad is not a perfect fairy tale and still involves bureaucracy and personal challenges, but also emphasizes that it's never too late to make the move and that the first destination doesn't have to be permanent.</p>

The filing also details accounts of inadequate medical care, a lack of basic hygiene supplies, and emotional distress in a "prison-like environment."

This aggressive spending is creating an interconnected web of financial relationships, as partners like Nvidia and CoreWeave are also investors in OpenAI, leading some analysts to draw parallels to the self-referential vendor financing that preceded the dot-com bubble. While CEO Sam Altman defends the high costs as necessary to build foundational AI, the company is projected to generate only $13 billion in revenue this year, raising questions about the sustainability of its ecosystem.

The author points to the deployment of the National Guard in cities, purges of government agencies, and challenges to the electoral process as evidence of a "Putinization of America." The piece contends that the Constitution's power relies on active defense and that complacency is dangerous, warning that the integrity of the upcoming midterm elections should not be taken for granted.

          <p>Despite the ever-present threat of urban fires, the United States has made remarkable progress in fire safety over the past four decades. The per-capita civilian fire death rate has decreased by approximately two-thirds since 1980, and the total number of reported fires has been cut in half. This significant improvement is not due to a single breakthrough but rather the accumulation of small, crucial advancements. Key factors include the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms and automatic sprinklers, safer furniture materials, a major decline in cigarette smoking, and improved electrical and heating safety standards in modern building codes.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs is scheduled to be sentenced after being found guilty on two counts of transportation for engagement in prostitution earlier this year.

While he was acquitted of more serious sex-trafficking and racketeering charges, he still faces a potential maximum of 20 years in prison. Prosecutors have recommended a sentence of at least four to five years, whereas his defense team is arguing for a 14-month sentence, which would result in his immediate release due to time already served.</p>

The revised plan makes the e-ID optional and keeps the system entirely in public hands, with data stored locally on users' smartphones rather than in a central database. Supporters argue it will streamline many online bureaucratic and commercial processes, while opponents maintain fears that it could still undermine privacy and be used for tracking purposes, despite the new safeguards.</p>
