          <p>An AI-generated psychedelic rock "band" called The Velvet Sundown has gained over a million monthly listeners on Spotify, sparking debate within the music industry. While some see AI as a creative tool, many artists and professionals express concern over copyright infringement, artistic integrity, and the potential for AI content to saturate streaming platforms. The situation has prompted major record labels to file lawsuits against AI music generation platforms like Suno and Udio, accusing them of mass copyright infringement for training their models on human-created music without permission.</p>

          <p>A weather system moving over the Gulf of Mexico has a high chance of developing into a tropical depression, prompting warnings for the northern Gulf Coast. Officials anticipate heavy downpours and potential flooding across southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, regardless of whether the system intensifies. In New Orleans, which could see up to 10 inches of rain, residents are taking precautions by collecting sandbags to protect their properties from the looming threat.</p>

          <p>Police have taken 21 children, ranging in age from two months to 13 years, into custody from a couple in Arcadia, California, amid a complex investigation. The case began after an infant suffered a traumatic head injury, which uncovered evidence of emotional and physical abuse by nannies. Authorities are now investigating whether the couple, who are the legal parents to all the children, were involved in a surrogacy scam by misleading surrogate mothers across the United States.</p>

          <p>A powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the southern coast of Alaska, initially prompting a tsunami warning for the peninsula. The warning was later downgraded to an advisory and then canceled entirely as officials determined that large, widespread waves were not expected. The quake, which was felt throughout the region, led to precautionary evacuations in some coastal communities, but no significant damage or injuries have been reported.</p>
