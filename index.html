          <p>Ben Rhodes argues that the United States is at risk of becoming a corrupt nation where political power is used for personal gain, drawing parallels to Vladimir Putin's Russia and Viktor Orban's Hungary. The author contends that President Trump has allegedly more than doubled his personal wealth since starting his 2024 election campaign, with foreign money flowing into his family's ventures, and alleges Qatar gifted Trump a plane. Rhodes asserts that the fusion of political and personal interests erodes checks and balances, weakens moral frameworks, and empowers oligarchs. He warns that the justice system is being captured by loyalists, similar to what has occurred in Hungary, posing a fundamental danger to American democracy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rwanda announced its withdrawal from the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) due to ongoing tensions with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo). The decision follows Rwanda being blocked from assuming the rotating presidency of the 11-member bloc, a move Kigali views as a violation of its rights. Rwanda accuses DR Congo of manipulating the bloc, citing the presence of the Rwanda-backed M23 armed group in eastern Congo, which has led to broader conflict between the two nations. The foreign ministry stated that it sees "no justification for remaining in an organization whose current functioning runs counter to its founding principles."</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to invest Â£86 billion in the science and technology sector to fund research in areas like drug treatments and longer-lasting batteries. The package includes up to Â£500 million for regions across the UK, allowing local leaders to decide how the funds are spent based on their area's expertise. Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the investment would create jobs and boost national security, with the package expected to be worth more than Â£22.5 billion per year by 2029. While the funding was welcomed, research backers emphasized the need for a decade-long plan to train workers and address financial challenges at universities to secure the UK's reputation for science.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that microplastics from polylactic acid (PLA), a widely used biodegradable material, can enter the metabolic cycle of bacteria and cells in the gut after ingestion. Researchers in China and the United States discovered that these microplastics altered gut metabolism and damaged the gut barrier in mice. The findings suggest that exposure to PLA microplastics could potentially contribute to conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes. The study highlights concerns about the widespread use of PLA in food packaging and disposable tableware.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have excavated an ancient workshop on the Greek island of Paros, revealing a wealth of unfinished sculptures and other artifacts. The site, known as Floga, has been under study since the mid-1980s, but the latest dig uncovered new architectural remains and various vessels. The artifacts included semi-finished marble sculptures, mainly of Aphrodite, clay heads of female figures, and clay molds and stamps. Based on the findings, the site was reorganized at the end of the third century B.C., serving as both a residential space and a sculpture workshop, with the discovery of a room identified as an andron.</p>

          <p>The disappearance of Jermain Charlo in June 2018 remains unsolved, with the Missoula Police Department and other agencies continuing their investigation. Charlo was last seen at The Badlander bar in Missoula, Montana, and security footage shows her with her ex-boyfriend, Michael DeFrance. DeFrance initially claimed he dropped her off at a supermarket, but later changed his story, leading to suspicion. Cellphone data indicated Charlo's phone was near DeFrance's residence after her disappearance, and DeFrance later admitted to discarding her phone in Idaho. Despite searches and investigations, Charlo has not been found, and DeFrance has not been named a suspect.</p>

The chancellor's focus is on long-term capital spending, earmarking 2.7% of GDP for capital spending, the highest sustained level in nearly half a century. The review aims to prioritize long-term challenges, such as industrial energy prices and social care costs, and "rewire the state" to boost growth.</p>

          <p>China has approved some qualified rare earth export applications and expressed its willingness to deepen dialogue with other nations regarding export controls. This development comes as rare earths, strategic resources, are playing a central role in Beijing's trade negotiations with Washington. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated that it recognizes the growing global demand for medium and heavy rare earths in sectors such as robotics and new energy vehicles, and as a responsible major power, it has taken legitimate civilian needs of other countries into account, approving export applications accordingly.</p>

          <p>Iranian rapper Tataloo, whose real name is Amir Hossein Maghsoudloo, is facing execution after being convicted of "insulting Islamic sanctities." Tataloo's music, popular among Iranian youth, challenged the theocracy and became increasingly political after the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini. Despite previously supporting a hard-line presidential candidate and appearing in a music video backing Iran's Revolutionary Guard, his later criticisms of the authorities led to his arrest and subsequent death sentence. Activists have expressed concern for his safety, especially after reports of a suicide attempt in prison.</p>

The move reflects a growing divide between California's political leadership and the federal government.

Trump defended the deployment, stating that if local officials couldn't handle the situation, the federal government would step in.</p>

          <p>Teachers are increasingly seeking flexible work arrangements to balance their personal and professional lives, particularly after becoming parents. A primary school teacher, Alice Cole, returned to work part-time after having her first child and believes that offering flexible options is crucial for addressing recruitment and retention issues in the profession. Data suggests that the number of new teachers entering the profession has decreased, while experienced staff members are leaving for better work-life balance or higher salaries. The government is trying to improve this by offering teachers a 4% pay rise and encouraging schools to offer flexible hours.</p>

          <p>The UK's plans to modernize and potentially expand its nuclear arsenal have been criticized for undermining international non-proliferation efforts and fueling a global nuclear arms race. Critics argue that the plans contradict the spirit of the non-proliferation treaty and increase the risk of tactical nuclear weapons being deployed in conflict zones. The government defends the spending by citing Russian "nuclear coercion" as the biggest threat facing the UK. Experts contend that retaining or increasing nuclear weapons does not make Britain safer and that gradual disarmament is the only way to escape the nightmare of nuclear warfare.</p>
