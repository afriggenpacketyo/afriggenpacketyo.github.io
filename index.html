          <p>Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management is investing $900 million in real estate company Howard Hughes, purchasing 9 million newly issued shares at a 48% premium to the previous closing price. This move increases Pershing Square's stake to 46.9% and signals Ackman's intention to transform Howard Hughes into a diversified holding company, acquiring controlling interests in both public and private operating companies, while continuing its core real estate development business. The investment strategy mirrors that of Warren Buffett, indicating a long-term value-oriented approach. Shares of Howard Hughes experienced an 8% increase in premarket trading following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Berkshire Hathaway board has unanimously voted for Greg Abel to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO on January 1, 2026, while Buffett will remain chairman. This decision, revealed at the annual shareholder meeting, assures shareholders that Buffett, at 94, will continue to guide the company and assist Abel with significant acquisition opportunities amidst potential market volatility. Buffett emphasized that Abel, 62, will have the final say on company operations and capital deployment after the transition. Despite the CEO change and somewhat disappointing earnings, Berkshire shares only decreased by 2% in premarket trading, with the company's market value exceeding $1.1 trillion at Friday's close. Abel has been Buffett's designated successor since 2021.</p>

          <p>Gregory J. Moore, the former divorce attorney of Aliza Sherman, has been charged with murder, aggravated murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy in connection with her 2013 stabbing death. Sherman, a Cleveland Clinic nurse, was found stabbed more than 10 times near where she was supposed to meet Moore to discuss her divorce. Moore, who previously served jail time for lying to police during the investigation and admitted to calling in bomb threats to delay trials, allegedly planned to kidnap Sherman to delay her divorce trial, according to the indictment. The case was reopened in 2021 by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, leading to Moore's arrest in Texas.</p>

          <p>Temu, the China-based low-cost retailer, has stopped shipping goods from China to the U.S. following the expiration of the de minimis tariff exemption. This exemption allowed low-value parcels to enter the U.S. without tariffs, but its end means Temu's China-sourced products now face high tariffs. Temu is transitioning to a local fulfillment model, with sales in the U.S. now handled by locally based sellers and orders fulfilled from domestic warehouses. The company is also actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform, aiming to help them reach more customers and grow their businesses. U.S. consumers had complained about tariff surcharges that sometimes doubled the value of the merchandise.</p>

          <p>Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, is navigating a delicate balance between criticizing President Trump and working with Republicans to serve his state's interests. As the only Democratic senator up for re-election in a state Trump won in 2024, Ossoff faces a tough challenge. While he has vocally criticized Trump's actions, including his attempts to wield the federal government against critics, Ossoff also emphasizes his commitment to bipartisanship and delivering for Georgia. He supports initiatives like lowering tariffs on Georgia pecans and backs incentives for electric vehicle construction. Ossoff's approach aims to appeal to a broad range of voters in a state that has recently swung between parties.</p>

          <p>This article examines the potential impact of secondary sanctions, specifically those targeting third countries doing business with Russia, under a possible second Trump administration. Despite existing Western sanctions, Russia's economy has shown resilience, but tighter banking sanctions and the threat of secondary measures could alter the landscape. Senator Lindsey Graham is preparing legislation to expand sanctions to countries importing Russian energy products, potentially targeting China and India, who are key trading partners with Russia. While the enforcement of secondary sanctions under a Trump administration remains uncertain, Russia is exploring alternative payment systems like "The China Track" to mitigate the risk of these sanctions.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett announced that Greg Abel will become the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year, with Buffett remaining as chairman. Abel, who currently oversees all of Berkshire's non-insurance companies, has been the designated successor since 2021. Known for his business acumen and hands-on management style, Abel joined Berkshire in 2000 and transformed MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a leading wind energy producer. While Abel is well-regarded, analysts note that he faces the challenge of matching Buffett's legendary performance and may have less leeway due to not controlling a significant portion of Berkshire's stock.</p>

          <p>A new study in the American Journal of Psychiatry reveals that more American adults with mental health needs are engaging in talk therapy, while the use of psychiatric medications without therapy has decreased. Between 2018 and 2021, the percentage of adults receiving psychotherapy rose from 6.5% to 8.5%, marking a shift from previous trends where medication use was increasing. This change may reflect greater awareness and accessibility of talk therapy, partly due to the expansion of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also found that the types of providers offering talk therapy have expanded to include licensed counselors and social workers.</p>

          <p>President Trump, in an interview with NBC News, attributed the "good parts" of the economy to his policies, while blaming the "bad parts" on his predecessor, Joe Biden. Trump defended his tariffs, asserting they would enrich the country, despite concerns about economic uncertainty. This approach mirrors his previous attempts to shift responsibility for economic challenges to Biden, such as the U.S. economy's contraction in the first quarter of the year. Trump's remarks highlight his strategy of selectively taking credit for positive economic outcomes while deflecting blame for negative ones.</p>

          <p>Samantha Montano, an emergency management professor, warns that the Trump administration's cuts to disaster management agencies will result in increased death tolls from extreme weather events, earthquakes, and pandemics. The dismantling of agencies like FEMA and NOAA will impair the ability to accurately predict, prepare for, and respond to disasters. Montano emphasizes that emergency managers will lack essential data for issuing warnings and evacuation orders, leading to more devastation. She criticizes the administration for reducing funding for these agencies during a time when climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of hazards.</p>

          <p>Ari Ne'eman, a disability rights advocate and researcher, reflects on the history of the disability rights movement as a source of hope amidst current policy shifts that threaten key protections. Ne'eman highlights the importance of coalition-building among diverse disability groups, drawing parallels to the successful fight against Reagan-era cuts. He notes that disability remains a constituency with crossover appeal, making it crucial to foreground disability in the defense of programs like Medicaid. Ne'eman also expresses concern over Secretary Kennedy's statements on autism, emphasizing the need for research focused on improving services and supports for autistic individuals.</p>

Separately, jury selection begins in New York City for Sean "Diddy" Combs' trial, where he faces charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy.

          <p>U.S. crude oil futures experienced a decline following the decision by OPEC+ to surge production for a second consecutive month. The increase in output, exceeding initial forecasts, has raised concerns about an oversupplied market. This situation is compounded by fears of a recession fueled by President Trump's tariffs, which could dampen demand. Consequently, oilfield service firms anticipate a decrease in investment in exploration and production, reflecting the prevailing weak price environment. (not investment advice)</p>

The agency highlights the use of social engineering tactics, where criminals trick employees into divulging login credentials.

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has reduced the benefit clawback from 100% to 50% for certain beneficiaries facing overpayment issues, yet experts warn that this may still cause financial hardship.

Beneficiaries may owe money due to overpayments resulting from reporting errors or agency mistakes. While the reduced rate is an improvement, advocates emphasize that losing half of one's benefits can still be devastating, especially for those relying on Social Security for essential expenses.</p>

          <p>Trump's policies have shaken global investors' confidence in America's economic and political stability, leading to talk of "de-dollarization" and a decline in the dollar's value. This decline contradicts conventional wisdom that tariffs would strengthen the dollar. Trump's erratic trade agenda and disregard for international agreements are undermining the dollar's dominance as the world's reserve currency. The end of dollar dominance would force the US government to pay much higher interest rates, making it harder to avoid tax hikes or entitlement cuts, and reducing Americans' living standards.</p>

Experts suggest that a negotiated settlement may be a more effective approach than further military escalation.
