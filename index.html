          <p>Kyiv experienced a deadly Russian missile and drone attack, resulting in at least nine fatalities and 60 injuries, including children, according to Mayor Vitali Klitschko. The attack caused fires due to falling drone wreckage, raising concerns about individuals trapped under the debris of a destroyed residential building. Blasts were also reported in Kharkiv, injuring at least two people, as tensions remain high in the region. The attack occurred shortly after former US President Trump criticized Ukrainian President Zelensky for allegedly hindering peace negotiations by refusing to recognize Russian control of Crimea. </p>

          <p>Campaigners are advocating for individuals convicted of murder, manslaughter, or stalking to be restricted to specific geographic areas after their release from prison. This proposal aims to enhance victim safety and provide a sense of freedom for those who have been targeted, as current exclusion zones can make victims feel trapped. While some experts raise concerns about potential breaches of perpetrators' human rights, victims argue that their safety and well-being should be prioritized. The Ministry of Justice states that exclusion zones are in place to prevent offenders from approaching their victims, but victim advocates feel it should be flipped to restrict the movement of the offenders instead.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Public defiance against Hamas is increasing in Gaza, with more Palestinians openly criticizing the group for its role in the territory's ongoing crisis. Protesters are holding Hamas responsible for plunging Gaza into its worst crisis in over 70 years, and some are calling for the group to relinquish control. Speaking out against Hamas is dangerous, as the group has historically suppressed dissent through violence and intimidation, as demonstrated by the recent abduction and torture of a young protester. Despite the risks, some Gazans are losing their fear and demanding change, signaling a potential shift in the balance of power.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Harvard professor Jeffrey Frankel analyzes various economic indicators to assess the probability of a US recession, noting that while no single factor guarantees a downturn, several signs point to increased risk. Declining consumer and business confidence, coupled with an inverted yield curve, suggest a potential economic slowdown. Prediction markets are pricing in a higher probability of recession, and real-time GDP estimates show a concerning trend. Frankel estimates the odds of a US recession at 60% for the coming year, emphasizing the uncertainty and potential for economic challenges ahead. </p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faces scrutiny over a costly and controversial military operation in Yemen aimed at stopping Houthi attacks on commercial ships. The operation has failed to restore regular traffic through the Red Sea and has escalated into an expensive engagement with potentially wider implications involving Iran. Sensitive details about the operation were reportedly shared in an unsecured conversation on Signal by Hegseth. The financial burden of the operation is expected to reach $2 billion in May, raising questions about the effectiveness and long-term consequences of the US military involvement in Yemen.</p>

          <p>Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang Yong expressed concerns about the negative impact of trade tensions, particularly those stemming from US tariffs, on the South Korean economy and the global market. He noted that these tensions are creating headwinds for South Korea, increasing downside risks to economic growth, and affecting key industries such as semiconductor production and automobile manufacturing. Rhee hopes that the political instability in South Korea will subside after the presidential election in June, as this will bring more stability to the economic outlook. The Bank of Korea recently held its benchmark policy rate steady, citing concerns about exchange rate volatility.</p>

          <p>South Korea's SK Hynix exceeded quarterly revenue and operating profit estimates due to strong demand for its high bandwidth memory offerings used in AI chipsets. Revenue rose approximately 42% year-on-year, while operating profit surged 158%. Despite these gains, the company cautioned about macroeconomic uncertainties, including U.S. tariff policy, which could create demand volatility in the second half of the year. The company expects a relatively limited impact from tariffs on its artificial intelligence server demand, and expects demand from consumer electronics to benefit from new AI products.</p>

          <p>Fox News shared its latest poll numbers, which show President Trump’s approval rating is now far behind every other 21st-century president at a similar point. Trump’s approval rating is 44% at almost 100 days in office, compared with 54% for Joe Biden, 62% for Barack Obama and 63% for George W. Bush at the same point. He’s even behind himself: Trump’s approval rating was 45% at the 100-day mark of his previous term in office. The poll is driven in part by economic issues, with just 38% approving of how he is handling the economy, versus 56% who disapprove.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily paused discovery in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's wrongful deportation, following a request from the Trump administration. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was deported to El Salvador despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution. The Trump administration claims Abrego Garcia's alleged MS-13 affiliation makes him ineligible to return to the United States, a claim his wife and attorney deny. The judge had previously ordered government officials to testify under oath, but the administration has asserted that providing detailed information would be inappropriate and an invasion of diplomatic discussions.</p>

          <p>South Korea's GDP contracted by 0.1% year-on-year in the first quarter, marking the first contraction since the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to a fall in construction. The GDP figure missed expectations and is a reversal compared to the previous quarter's rise. Political uncertainty surrounding the impeachment trials of former President Yoon Suk Yeol and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo contributed to the economic slowdown. The country's export-led economy has also been affected by trade war turmoil, including tariffs imposed by the U.S. ANZ forecasts that the BOK will deliver two to three more rate cuts by the end of the year and for fiscal stimulus to exceed 1% of GDP in 2025.</p>
