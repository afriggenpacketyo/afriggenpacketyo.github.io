        <p>Mongolia's parliament has ratified a deal with China to jointly construct a new 19.5-kilometer cross-border rail connection, aimed at increasing Mongolia's coal exports to China. The project, which had been delayed for over a decade, is expected to be completed in 2027 and includes coal terminals on both sides of the border. This move signifies a strengthening of ties between Mongolia and China, particularly in the context of ongoing trade tensions involving the United States. The new railway is part of China's broader efforts to build a pan-regional rail network to enhance connectivity with its neighbors.</p>

        <p>Lisa Whelchel, star of "The Facts of Life," has responded to claims made by co-star Mindy Cohn that a "greedy b----" sabotaged a potential reboot of the show. Whelchel explained that the project fell apart due to the writers' strike, actors' strike, and the passing of Charlotte Rae and Norman Lear. Cohn had previously alleged that one of the actresses went behind the backs of the others to secure a separate spinoff, leading to the reboot's cancellation and fractured relationships. Whelchel expressed disappointment that the reboot did not materialize, as the cast had been eager to work together again.</p>

        <p>A false post on Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter, claiming a pause on tariffs led to significant volatility in the stock market, causing swings of $2.4 trillion. The erroneous headline originated from a relatively obscure account with a blue verification badge, which helped amplify the falsehood. Major news organizations initially reported the false information, before retracting it after a White House denial. This incident highlights the potential dangers of social media in spreading misinformation and influencing financial markets, particularly with verification systems that incentivize virality over accuracy.</p>

        <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson and Representative Anna Paulina Luna have reached an agreement to address the issue of proxy voting for new parents, aiming to end the legislative paralysis in the House. The agreement formalizes a "vote pairing" procedure, allowing an absent member to coordinate with a present member on the opposite side of an issue to offset the absence. However, some Democrats have criticized the deal as inadequate, arguing that it fails to provide real solutions for lawmakers who are new parents.</p>
