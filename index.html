          <p>The United States and Iran convened in Oman for talks regarding Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, focusing on uranium enrichment. The negotiations, described as "very serious and work-focused," involved the exchange of written points, indicating a deeper dive into specifics compared to past discussions, with both sides acknowledging existing disagreements on major issues and details. A U.S. official noted the talks were "positive and productive," with plans for further meetings in Europe, while Oman expressed hope for an agreement based on mutual respect and commitments. However, a major explosion at an Iranian port occurred simultaneously, killing four and injuring hundreds, adding complexity to the discussions.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge expressed concerns over the deportation of a two-year-old American citizen to Honduras, alleging it occurred without due process. The judge's attempt to contact the child's mother was thwarted when informed the family was already en route to Honduras, raising suspicions that the government deported a U.S. citizen improperly. The Department of Homeland Security defended the action, stating the parents chose to take the child with them, while the father's efforts to prevent the deportation were allegedly hindered, including claims of ICE attempting to detain him. A hearing has been scheduled to further investigate the circumstances surrounding the deportation.</p>

Critics argue that Trump's policies, intentionally or not, serve Moscow's interests by creating rifts with traditional allies and altering the U.S. government itself, thus undermining American influence and bolstering Russia's position on the global stage.</p>
