          <h2>FDA to Narrow Covid Vaccine Approvals, Requiring Trials for Younger Adults</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 18:12:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA will approve Covid vaccines for high-risk individuals but will require more clinical trials for healthy adults under 65 before wider use. Agency leaders cited uncertain benefits for younger people already vaccinated or previously infected, proposing trials where participants are randomly assigned the vaccine or a placebo. Some experts criticize the new criteria as overly restrictive, potentially limiting access for healthy individuals at high risk due to their jobs or other circumstances. The revised approvals process could impact insurance and public coverage, aligning with a recent decision to narrow eligibility for the Novavax vaccine. This article indicates a shift towards a risk-based approach to Covid vaccination, emphasizing the need for more data on low-risk individuals.</p>

          <p>Google is introducing AI Mode in its search engine, functioning like a chatbot to provide comprehensive answers and follow-up queries. This move aims to disrupt Google's traditional search business before AI competitors can. The tech giant has been hesitant to fully embrace AI due to its reliance on reliably providing accurate answers, but is now introducing Gemini to the Google Search shopping experience with a new chatbot that allows users to refine their searches. Gemini’s chatbot abilities will be added to the company’s Chrome web browser and the company introduced a new subscription service for developers called Google A.I. Ultra, a $250-a-month suite of all of its A.I. tools.</p>

          <p>President Trump seems to be abandoning efforts to support Ukraine and is backing away from joining a European pressure campaign for new sanctions on Russia, signaling a desire to pursue business deals with Moscow. After a call with President Putin, Trump told European leaders that Russia and Ukraine must resolve the war themselves, diverging from his previous threats of sanctions if Russia didn't agree to a ceasefire. This shift has created a fissure within NATO, as European allies intend to proceed with sanctions regardless. A White House official stated that additional sanctions would hinder economic opportunities for Americans, highlighting Trump's focus on maximizing economic benefits.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden received his last prostate cancer blood test in 2014, according to a spokesperson, two days after revealing his aggressive form of prostate cancer. The spokesperson clarified that Biden had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer prior to Friday. Biden, who turned 72 in 2014, was within the typical age range for prostate cancer screenings at the time. Doctors often advise discontinuing routine testing after 70 or 75 due to the slow-growing nature of prostate cancer in older men and the potential risks of testing and treatment.</p>

          <p>An exotic dancer known as The Punisher testified in Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex-trafficking trial, explaining how he discovered his client's identity. He described being hired to perform in "sexy, erotic scenes" with Combs' then-girlfriend, while Combs watched. The dancer only realized the client was Combs when he saw his name on a hotel television. Also in court, Regina Ventura, the mother of R&B singer Cassie, testified that Mr. Combs had made threats towards her, and that he would "release 2 explicit sex tapes of me".</p>

          <p>Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa criticized Kamala Harris and Xavier Becerra for allegedly covering up Joe Biden's cognitive decline, which he claims led to President Trump's election victory. Villaraigosa based his remarks on excerpts from a new book arguing that Biden's inner circle concealed his deteriorating state. He accused Harris and Becerra of failing to protect the American people by not speaking out about Biden's condition. Both Harris and Becerra are potential candidates for California governor in 2026.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has postponed its annual Women's Conference following advice related to the Supreme Court's ruling on the legal definition of a woman. The ruling, which defines a woman based on biological sex, prompted concerns that allowing trans women to attend the conference and participate in positive action measures could face legal challenges. The NEC voted to delay the conference pending a review of positive action measures. The Labour Party must make sure all its procedures "comply with the Supreme Court's clear ruling".</p>
