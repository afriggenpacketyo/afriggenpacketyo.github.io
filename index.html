            <p>China's consumer prices contracted for the second consecutive month in March, dropping 0.1% year-on-year, while producer price deflation deepened to 2.5%. These figures come as Chinese exporters face increasing pressure from an escalating trade war with the U.S., which has seen tariffs raised significantly by both sides. Despite these deflationary pressures, core inflation, excluding food and fuel, showed a slight rebound, and Chinese Premier Li Qiang has emphasized boosting domestic consumption as a key economic priority.

The Chinese government has reiterated its commitment to defending its interests and engaging in dialogue based on equality and respect.

            <p>A chaotic series of events unfolded in Eagle Rock after a homeowner, Jillian Shriner, allegedly shot at people fleeing a hit-and-run and was subsequently shot by police. The incident began with a crash on the 134 Freeway, after which three suspects fled into a nearby neighborhood. Shriner, armed with a handgun, reportedly refused police orders to drop the weapon and pointed it at officers, leading to the shooting. She was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries and is being held on suspicion of attempted murder.</p>

            <p>Two couples who married in a joint ceremony in Kirkwall, Orkney, in 1955, attribute their 70-year marriages to spending significant time apart due to work commitments.

They humorously shared that leaving post-it notes instead of constant communication and embracing time apart helped them maintain their relationships. Both couples faced periods of separation due to Tommy's work as a lighthouse keeper and Violet's night shifts at local hospitals.</p>

            <p>Despite Donald Trump's temporary pause on tariffs for most nations, analysts warn that the trade war's 'crazy' week is just the beginning, with the world's two largest economies still locked in a dangerous, intensifying trade war. The current tariffs on Chinese products could provide tax revenue of US$835 billion, but this figure would drop to zero if "China simply stops exporting". Experts are expressing foreboding over the impact the past week’s actions will have on global supply chains.</p>
