          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris was closed on Sunday after a robbery occurred at its opening. French officials reported that several valuable jewels were stolen from the Apollon Gallery in an operation that lasted approximately seven minutes. The suspects, believed to be at least three individuals, reportedly used a construction ladder to gain access and fled the scene on motorcycles. While no injuries were reported, the incident prompted a significant police response and an ongoing investigation into the high-profile theft.</p>

The claims suggest he provided an officer with her date of birth and social security number. This development follows Andrew's decision to relinquish his royal titles amid ongoing scrutiny of his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and allegations made by Giuffre. The reports have been described as "deeply concerning" by political figures, raising questions about the appropriate use of taxpayer-funded security.</p>

          <p>Forest Green Rovers manager Robbie Savage has spoken out against the "vile abuse" he received from opposition fans during a recent match. The former professional player and current pundit stated that while he can handle typical banter, the personal attacks he endured crossed a line and are unacceptable. Savage, who is known for being a divisive figure, criticized the lack of action from stewards and officials to prevent such behavior. He emphasized that no human being should be subjected to such shocking abuse, regardless of their public profile.</p>

          <p>According to neuroscientist Dr. Charan Ranganath, the common understanding of memory as a faithful filing cabinet of past events is incorrect. Instead, memory functions as a resource to help us understand the present, plan for the future, and construct a coherent life story. Forgetting is a crucial part of this process, as our brains prioritize emotionally significant moments and details that are useful for future decisions. This selective recollection shapes our identity and satisfaction, meaning the stories we tell ourselves about our experiences are often more impactful than the experiences themselves.</p>

          <p>While numerous companies have cited artificial intelligence as the reason for recent job cuts, some experts are skeptical, suggesting AI has become a convenient excuse for downsizing. An assistant professor at the Oxford Internet Institute argues that firms may be "scapegoating" the technology to justify layoffs that are actually due to overhiring during the pandemic or other business challenges. This narrative allows companies to appear innovative while masking underlying issues. Recent labor market data from the U.S. shows little evidence of mass unemployment caused by AI.

          <p>An opinion article contends that loosening the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approval standards for rare disease treatments would ultimately harm patients. The author argues that while advocates call for more flexibility to encourage drug development, the FDA is already remarkably flexible, often approving these drugs based on single studies or predicted benefits. Lowering the bar further would risk approving ineffective or unsafe drugs, eroding public trust and giving false hope to vulnerable patients. Instead of weakening regulations, the focus should be on increasing federal research support to develop genuinely effective therapies.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the United States of "murder" and violating his country's sovereignty after a US strike on a boat in Colombian waters. Petro stated that the victim, Alejandro Carranza, was a fisherman with no drug ties whose boat was adrift with a distress signal due to engine failure. The accusation follows President Donald Trump's announcement of a successful strike on a "drug-carrying submarine" in the Caribbean, in which two people were killed. The US has conducted several such strikes recently, which some UN experts have described as "extrajudicial executions."</p>

          <p>Football players across Spain's La Liga staged protests against the league's decision to hold a regular season match in Miami. In multiple games, including those involving Barcelona and Atletico Madrid, players on both teams refused to move for the first 15 seconds after kickoff. The Spanish Footballers' Association (AFE) coordinated the symbolic action to voice opposition to what they call a "lack of transparency" and dialogue from the league. The protest highlights widespread discontent among players and some clubs over moving a competitive fixture abroad, which they argue distorts the competition.</p>

          <p>The identity of the Nazi gunman in the iconic Holocaust photograph known as "The Last Jew in Vinnitsa" has been determined with 99% certainty. German historian Jürgen Matthäus, aided by tips from the public and AI-based facial recognition software, identified the man as Jakobus Onnen, a member of an SS death squad. The research also corrected the location of the 1941 execution from Vinnytsia to Berdychiv, Ukraine, based on a Wehrmacht soldier's war diary. This breakthrough demonstrates how interdisciplinary collaboration and modern technology can uncover new details about historical atrocities.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris stated that former President Joe Biden made a "big mistake" by not inviting Tesla CEO Elon Musk to a 2021 White House summit on electric vehicles. The event featured executives from Ford, GM, and Stellantis, but excluded Tesla, the leading EV manufacturer, a move widely seen as a nod to the United Auto Workers union. In her new memoir, Harris wrote that the snub was illogical and likely alienated Musk, who never forgave the administration and later became a major financial backer for Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has accused the United States of carrying out long-term, covert cyberattacks against its National Time Service Center. The center, based in Xian, is a critical piece of infrastructure responsible for generating and maintaining China's official standard time. This service is essential for the country's defense, finance, transport, and communications sectors. Beijing alleged that the attacks utilized "state-level cyberespionage tools," marking another pointed accusation in the ongoing cyber-espionage rivalry between the two nations.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Liverpool's Tactical Struggles Linked to Departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite significant summer spending, Liverpool has experienced a recent slump, which some analysis attributes to the departure of right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold. His absence is felt not just in goals and assists, but in the team's ability to build up play from the back and bypass high-pressing opponents. Alexander-Arnold's unique ability to play accurate long passes and use his weaker foot provided tactical flexibility that the team now lacks. As a result, new signings like Florian Wirtz are being forced into deeper roles, which may not fully utilize their attacking strengths.</p>

          <h2>Psychologists Explain Why Sexual Desire Often Declines in Long-Term Relationships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 00:56:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>It is common for sexual desire to wane in long-term relationships, a phenomenon driven by both hormonal changes and relational dynamics. Psychologists explain that after the initial passionate phase, the bonding hormone oxytocin becomes more prominent, which can dampen sex drive hormones. For heterosexual women, a "gender orgasm gap" and a lack of focus on their pleasure can also lead to decreased desire over time. Experts advise that open communication, maintaining non-sexual physical affection, and making intentional time for intimacy are key to sustaining a healthy sex life.</p>
