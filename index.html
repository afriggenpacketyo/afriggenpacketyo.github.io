          <p>Hurricane Kiko has intensified into a powerful Category 4 storm in the Central Pacific, currently moving west-northwestward with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph, directly towards the Hawaiian Islands. Forecasters are warning that significant swells from the storm are expected to reach the islands by the end of the weekend, creating conditions for life-threatening surf and rip currents. Acting Hawaii Governor Sylvia Luke has declared a state of emergency, urging residents and visitors to monitor updates, follow official guidance, and prepare for potential direct impacts such as strong winds and heavy rainfall starting early next week. The National Weather Service in Honolulu is closely tracking the hurricane's progression, anticipating possible widespread flooding and high surf.</p>

Powerball officials emphasize playing responsibly, highlighting that each $2 ticket contributes to supporting various good causes within communities.

          <p>Linda Stermer, a Michigan woman, has been convicted for a second time of first-degree murder and arson in the 2007 death of her husband, Todd Stermer. Prosecutors alleged she intentionally set their home ablaze and then ran him over with a van as he fled the fire, an account Stermer vehemently denies, attributing it to a tragic accident. Her initial conviction was overturned after nearly nine years in prison, due to issues with her defense attorney's performance and concerns over witness credibility, leading to a retrial. This complex case, marked by deeply divided family testimonies and expert disputes over fire origins and evidence, ultimately resulted in another guilty verdict after extensive deliberation.</p>

          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from the US and China has developed a novel method for launching millimetre-scale robots using the energy released from collapsing vapor bubbles. This technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles that, upon collapse, generate a strong propulsive force. By precisely controlling the laser, researchers can manipulate the launch and movement of these tiny jumpers, even enabling them to swim in water. This study demonstrates cavitation as an efficient mechanism for propulsion, offering new possibilities for micro-robotics.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick, in his inaugural collegiate coaching role, achieved his first win as head coach of the North Carolina Tar Heels, leading them to a 20-3 victory over the Charlotte 49ers. The team's defense was a key factor, shutting down Charlotte after an early field goal, following a quick 51-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Gio Lopez. This win helps to alleviate some of the criticism Belichick faced after a season-opening loss and ongoing discussions about his personal life.

          <p>Several Mexican Independence Day events in Chicago have been canceled or postponed due to concerns over President Trump's plans to deploy National Guard troops and federal immigration agents to the city. Organizers cited safety risks for the community, particularly given Trump's rhetoric and the planned surge of Customs and Border Protection agents. Despite the cancellations, thousands protested Trump's actions in downtown Chicago, chanting slogans against increased immigration enforcement and his administration's policies. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have publicly criticized Trump's threats, calling them an attempt to intimidate the city.</p>

          <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto was agonizingly close to a no-hitter, needing just one out in the ninth inning, when Jackson Holliday broke it up with a home run, ending Yamamoto's historic bid. The game then spiraled into a nightmare for the Dodgers, as relievers Blake Treinen and Tanner Scott surrendered runs, culminating in a walk-off two-run single for the Orioles. This stunning 4-3 defeat extended the Dodgers' losing streak, marking a new, almost incomprehensible way for the team to lose a game, leaving them stunned and stoic on the field. The sellout crowd at Camden Yards witnessed a dramatic and heartbreaking turn of events.</p>

          <p>China's private holiday accommodation sector, including homestays and guesthouses, is experiencing a significant downturn, leading many operators to regret their investments. Following a brief post-pandemic "revenge travel" boom, the market has been hit by a surge in supply, declining guest spending, and intense price wars, severely squeezing profits. A recent report indicated that nearly 60% of operators, many of whom are relatively new to the market, now express regret over entering the industry. This reflects a broader struggle and a classic boom-and-bust cycle for the sector, leaving many feeling they are working for minimal wages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dame Anna Wintour is stepping down as editor-in-chief of US Vogue after nearly 40 years, transitioning to a global editorial director role, with Chloe Malle taking over as head of editorial content. Wintour, known for her instinctive understanding of the zeitgeist and groundbreaking cover choices, maintained Vogue's relevance by bridging fashion with entertainment and politics. Her departure raises questions about the print magazine's continued influence in a rapidly evolving digital media landscape. Malle reportedly plans to focus on less frequent, collectible issues, acknowledging the challenge of maintaining clout in a crowded, fast-paced world and the need for new strategies.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry is set to visit the UK for several engagements, including announcing a significant donation to Children in Need in Nottingham to combat youth violence. This trip, his first since April, has fueled speculation about a potential meeting with his father, King Charles, as signs suggest easing tensions between them. Harry will also attend the WellChild Awards, an organization supporting seriously ill children, of which he has been a patron for 17 years. The King will be in the UK during this period, making a father-son reunion a distinct possibility and offering a chance for reconciliation.</p>

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has plummeted by over 80% following the Trump administration's elimination of a tariff exemption for low-cost imports, according to the Universal Postal Union. The "de minimis exemption" previously allowed parcels valued at $800 or less to enter without customs charges. This abrupt policy change has caused major operational disruptions, as many foreign postal operators and carriers are unprepared or unwilling to collect the new duties. The UPU warned that the sudden implementation, without sufficient time or guidance, has led 88 postal operators to suspend some or all services to the US. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) this autumn, which will track when non-EU citizens enter and leave the Schengen Area. Designed to enhance security and streamline travel, EES will replace manual passport stamping and require first-time travelers to register biometric information, including fingerprints and a photo. Concerns have been raised about potential long queues during the initial registration phase, particularly at busy points like Dover and Eurostar terminals. The system will be phased in over six months, with full implementation expected by April 2026, aiming for long-term efficiency despite initial hurdles.</p>

          <p>American AI firm Anthropic's decision to restrict its Claude AI service to entities over 50% owned by companies headquartered in "unsupported regions" like China has created significant uncertainty.

Chinese users are expressing concern over continued access and potential refunds, even as some affected companies reassure them that Claude remains available for the time being.

          <p>Singapore, a low-lying island nation, faces an existential threat from rapidly rising sea levels, projected to increase by up to 1.15 meters by 2100. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasized that safeguarding the nation's existence is paramount, as 30% of Singapore is less than 5 meters above mean sea level, putting critical infrastructure at risk. Human-caused climate change is accelerating these rises, with NASA data showing faster-than-expected increases globally. Singapore is investing billions in coastal defenses like seawalls and land reclamation, alongside adopting clean energy, to combat this severe environmental challenge and protect its future.</p>

The incident occurred near the town of Buyo, with only three individuals surviving the tragedy. Search operations are currently underway for the missing victims. Hippopotamuses are a known threat in the region, identified in a 2022 study as the species most frequently involved in fatal or injurious interactions with humans in Ivory Coast.

Health Secretary Wes Streeting condemned Reform for providing a platform for "poisonous lies," while the party stated it does not endorse Malhotra's opinions but believes in free speech.
