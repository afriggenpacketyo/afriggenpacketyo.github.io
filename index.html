          <p>Bristol Myers Squibb reported strong first-quarter results, surpassing expectations and raising its revenue and profit guidance for 2025, driven by newer drug brands and better-than-anticipated sales from older medications. The company is also implementing cost-cutting measures to reduce expenses. However, the company acknowledged the potential impact of tariffs on U.S. products shipped to China, a crucial market for Bristol Myers' growth strategy. Despite these challenges, Bristol Myers remains optimistic about its portfolio of growth drugs offsetting revenue losses from treatments losing exclusivity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump asserted that undocumented migrants should not be entitled to trials before deportation, arguing the system cannot handle the volume. This statement comes amid a legal dispute over the deportation of Venezuelan migrants alleged to be gang members, temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court. Trump administration officials defended their deportation efforts, citing public safety concerns, while Democrats criticized the actions as violating due process rights.

          <p>American Airlines retracted its 2025 financial outlook, citing an uncertain economic climate and weaker leisure travel bookings. The airline experienced a drop in domestic travel demand and projects second-quarter revenue below analyst expectations.

The airline reported a wider first-quarter loss compared to the previous year, partially attributed to economic uncertainty and the tragic accident involving American Eagle Flight 5342.</p>

          <p>The REAL ID Act, passed in 2005 following the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, is set to take effect next month, requiring Americans to obtain federally-compliant identification for air travel.

While supporters argue it enhances national security, critics express concerns about privacy and its impact on immigrants. The Trump administration is implementing the law to prevent undocumented individuals from flying domestically, except when self-deporting on international flights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Early heat waves are becoming more frequent due to climate change, posing significant health risks because people are less acclimatized to high temperatures early in the season. The lack of acclimatization affects physiological responses and behaviors, such as hydration habits and building settings. South Asia is particularly vulnerable, experiencing record-breaking temperatures, and the US is also seeing an increase in early heat waves. Mitigating these dangers requires proactive measures like staying hydrated, avoiding direct sunlight, and recognizing the signs of heat-related complications.</p>

While not expected to be as intense as the 2023 Canadian wildfire smoke, it can still be dangerous for sensitive groups. Winds may shift, bringing wildfire smoke back to the region on Friday.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo has lowered its earnings forecast for the year, citing uncertainty regarding tariffs and consumer spending. The company reported mixed quarterly results, with international sales offsetting weaker demand in North America. CEO Ramon Laguarta cited global trade developments and subdued consumer conditions as contributing factors. The company is taking actions to improve its North American performance, including expanding into multicultural and functional products.</p>

          <p>Sophie Lloyd, a magician who disguised herself as a man to gain membership into the Magic Circle in 1991, is finally being granted membership. She was initially expelled after revealing her deception, which she undertook to challenge the society's male-only policy. The Magic Circle has now apologized and is presenting her with a membership certificate. The event also recognizes Jenny Winstanley, who conceived the stunt.</p>

          <h2>Merck Reduces Profit Expectations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 06:32:03 EDT</div>

          <p>Merck has lowered its full-year profit guidance, citing $200 million in estimated costs for tariffs and a charge tied to a license agreement. The company expects the tariff charge to primarily reflect levies between the U.S. and China. The new outlook does not account for President Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. However, the drugmaker reported first-quarter revenue and profit that beat expectations, driven by strength in its oncology portfolio and animal health products.</p>
