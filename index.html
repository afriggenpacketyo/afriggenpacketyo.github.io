            <p>A former aide to Taiwan's security chief, Ho Jen-chieh, has been expelled from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) amid allegations of spying for Beijing. Ho, who previously served as an assistant to Joseph Wu during his tenure as foreign minister, is suspected of providing classified information to mainland Chinese intelligence agents. Prosecutors detained Ho and searched his home, citing concerns that he might collude with others or destroy evidence if released. The DPP swiftly severed ties with Ho in response to the unfolding scandal, highlighting the sensitivity of espionage cases involving key figures in the Taiwanese government.</p>

            <p>Following an attack by Manchester Arena bomber Hashem Abedi on prison officers at HMP Frankland, the UK government has suspended kitchen use in high-security prison separation centers. Abedi reportedly threw hot oil at the officers and stabbed them with blades fashioned from cooking trays, leaving two male officers hospitalized with serious injuries. This decision affects a small number of the UK's most dangerous and extremist inmates.

            <p>Meta is facing a high-stakes antitrust trial brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that could potentially force the company to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC alleges that Meta monopolized the personal social networking market by acquiring these competitive threats, harming competition and users. Meta argues that it competes with numerous rivals, including TikTok and YouTube, and that its acquisitions have not harmed competition. The trial will test the boundaries of U.S. antitrust laws pertaining to corporate acquisitions and whether Meta's actions actively harmed competition.</p>

            <p>Pfizer has discontinued the development of its experimental daily weight loss pill, danuglipron, after a patient in a trial experienced a liver injury. Although the patient didn't show liver-related symptoms and recovered quickly after stopping the medication, Pfizer made the decision following a review of clinical data and regulatory input. This setback adds to Pfizer's challenges in entering the competitive GLP-1 market, which is dominated by injectable medications from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.

            <p>The UK government has taken control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, to prevent it from closing and ensure the continued production of virgin steel. The move comes after the Chinese-owned Jingye Group, which owns British Steel, intended to refuse to buy enough material to keep the furnaces running. The government invoked emergency powers to order raw materials and direct the company's workforce, but Jingye will retain ownership for now. The Scunthorpe plant employs 2,700 people and is the last in the UK producing virgin steel, which is considered vital for major construction projects.</p>

The Trump administration has not approved any military aid packages for Ukraine since taking office, leading to a depletion of Ukraine's stockpiles. European leaders must increase their risk tolerance in donating military equipment, invest in Ukraine's defense industry, and secure additional air defense missiles. Seizing approximately $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets currently immobilized in European jurisdictions could provide a durable source of non-U.S. assistance for Ukraine.</p>

            <p>This article explores the phenomenon of "Mom Fatigue," a persistent exhaustion experienced by mothers of young children, even when they get adequate sleep. Researchers suggest that poor sleep quality, sleep debt, and the relentless mental load of childcare contribute to this fatigue. Working mothers often juggle childcare and work, leaving little time for relaxation and recovery. Experts recommend that busy mothers take a few minutes each day for "wakeful rest" to mentally zone out and reset their brains.</p>

            <p>The Kremlin criticized Germany's chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz for suggesting Germany might send Taurus long-range missiles to Ukraine. Merz stated he would consider supplying Kyiv with the missiles as part of a wider European support package. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Merz's comments indicate a "tougher position" that would "inevitably lead only to a further escalation of the situation around Ukraine". The Kremlin maintains that European capitals are not inclined to seek peace talks but instead prefer to instigate the continuation of the war.</p>
