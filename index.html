          <p>Republican Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska is advocating for the passage of President Trump's major spending bill, despite acknowledging concerns over its changes to Medicaid. He argues that voting against the legislation would effectively raise taxes by about 20% for middle-class families in his state. The bill, which faces opposition from both moderate Republicans and fiscal conservatives, includes significant tax cuts and new spending on immigration enforcement. Bacon contends the bill's benefits outweigh its drawbacks, emphasizing that it aims to encourage work and reduce the national debt over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) has seen a dramatic rebound, with new listing volumes surging to $14 billion in the first half of the year, an eightfold increase from the same period in 2024. This boom is fueled by Chinese companies seeking to raise capital, driven by supportive policies from Beijing, a slower pace of mainland listings, and fears of delisting from U.S. exchanges. The influx of capital has positioned Hong Kong to potentially become the world's top listing destination this year. Analysts attribute the renewed investor confidence to a rally in Chinese tech stocks and expectations of further economic stimulus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has confirmed that a piece of an airplane wing found in a Raleigh, North Carolina, driveway belongs to a Delta Air Lines flight that landed safely on Tuesday night. The part, identified as a section of a wing flap, came from a Boeing 737-900 flying from Atlanta to Raleigh with 109 passengers and six crew members.

The legislation, which includes extensive tax cuts and increased spending on border security and defense, faces pushback from both moderates and conservative members over changes made in the Senate. Despite pressure from the White House, including direct meetings with President Trump, several GOP holdouts remain unconvinced, putting the bill's passage before the July 4th deadline in jeopardy.

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration policy that suspended the ability of migrants crossing the southern border to seek asylum. Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president exceeded his legal authority, stating that the executive branch cannot unilaterally create an alternative immigration system that bypasses laws enacted by Congress. The judge acknowledged the challenges at the border but affirmed the legal right for individuals in the U.S. to apply for asylum. The decision has been temporarily stayed for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal.</p>

          <p>In a significant escalation of his criticism, President Donald Trump has publicly called for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to resign immediately. Trump's demand, posted on social media, follows his long-standing disapproval of Powell's interest rate policies, which he believes have not been lowered enough to stimulate economic growth. The call for resignation comes as Powell himself suggested that the Fed would have already cut rates if not for the economic impact of the Trump administration's tariff policies. This move challenges the traditional independence of the central bank, although it remains unclear if the president has the legal authority to remove the Fed chair. (not investment advice)</p>

Manchester City Council defended its actions, citing complex data-sharing rules intended to avoid jeopardizing prosecutions.

Conversely, the research found that estrogen-only therapy, typically given to women without a uterus, appears to reduce the risk. This new research provides a more nuanced understanding compared to older studies, emphasizing that the type and timing of hormone replacement therapy are critical factors.

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals that President Donald Trump secured 48% of the Latino vote in the 2024 election, a significant increase from his 36% share in 2020. This near-even split with the Democratic candidate has prompted political experts to analyze the evolving priorities of this diverse demographic. Analysts suggest the shift is not necessarily ideological but reflects a more populist sentiment driven by economic concerns and disillusionment with the Democratic Party's immigration policies. The results challenge long-held assumptions about the Latino voting bloc and signal a need for both parties to re-evaluate their outreach strategies.</p>

          <p>The Southern Resident killer whale population in Washington's Puget Sound, now down to just 73 individuals, is critically endangered due to a crashing population of their primary food source, Chinook salmon. Conservationists are concerned that a proposed Trump administration change to the Endangered Species Act could exacerbate the problem. The proposal seeks to redefine "harm" to exclude habitat destruction, potentially opening protected areas to industrial development. This could undermine revitalization projects aimed at restoring salmon breeding grounds, further threatening the survival of both the orcas and other species like the bald eagle that depend on this ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in the murder case of Fabio Sementilli claim that a continuing love affair between his widow, Monica Sementilli, and her accused co-conspirator, Robert Baker, provides further evidence of their plot. A "48 Hours" investigation uncovered intercepted letters and recorded conversations from jail, revealing the couple's ongoing romantic and sexual relationship after their arrest. Prosecutors argue this demonstrates a "secrecy pact" and motive for the murder, which they allege was for financial gain from a life insurance policy. Monica Sementilli has pleaded not guilty, and her defense contends the affair is irrelevant to proving a conspiracy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's major budget legislation is facing significant hurdles in the House of Representatives, with key sticking points dividing the Republican party. Conservative factions like the House Freedom Caucus are concerned about the bill's projected $3.3 trillion addition to the national deficit over ten years. Meanwhile, moderate Republicans from poorer districts worry about the Senate version's deeper cuts to Medicaid, which could strip health insurance from nearly 12 million Americans. These disagreements have stalled the bill's progress, making it uncertain if Speaker Mike Johnson can secure passage by the president's July 4 deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

Erin Smith, who successfully lobbied for a law recognizing some police suicides as line-of-duty deaths, called the verdict a relief.

          <p>A coalition of former federal health officials is warning that proposed cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's fiscal year 2026 budget could have severe public health consequences. The proposal would slash the CDC's budget by over 50%, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion, which would drastically reduce funding for state and local health departments that rely on federal support. The former officials argue these cuts would dismantle successful programs for chronic disease, HIV, and injury prevention.

          <p>The Pentagon's chief spokesperson has stated that U.S. intelligence assesses that recent American airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities have delayed the country's nuclear program by approximately one to two years. This assessment appears more measured than President Trump's claims of complete obliteration but suggests significant degradation of Iran's capabilities. The evaluation is reportedly based on new intelligence, including video from B-2 bombers, suggesting key components like centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site were destroyed. The full extent of the damage remains a subject of debate, as Iran has also suspended cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified two major trends currently influencing the stock market: global trade developments and the weakening U.S. dollar. He pointed to the new U.S. trade deal with Vietnam, which lowered threatened tariffs, as a positive catalyst for apparel and furniture companies like Nike and Williams-Sonoma that manufacture in the region. Additionally, Cramer noted that the dollar's decline to a four-year low benefits multinational consumer goods companies, such as Procter & Gamble, by making their exports more competitive on the global market. He advised investors to focus on these overarching narratives to understand market movements. (not investment advice)</p>
