          <p>U.S. officials have expressed disappointment with Hamas's response to the proposed Gaza cease-fire, stating that the requested amendments are unacceptable and set back progress. Hamas is seeking guarantees for a permanent end to the war, a key sticking point with Israel. The U.S. envoy to the Middle East said the response was "totally unacceptable and only takes us backward." Despite this setback, the U.S. urges Hamas to accept the original framework for proximity talks to begin immediately to close a 60-day ceasefire deal, which would include the release of living and deceased hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.</p>

The Wall Street Journal previously reported concerns from Musk's associates about his reported drug use impacting his businesses, including Tesla and SpaceX.

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities initially reported 250 million bees escaped, but later corrected the number with assistance from a beekeeper. The public was advised to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away from the incident site. Beekeepers worked to re-hive the bees, aiming to save as many as possible, and the road was closed for about 24 hours to allow the bees to return to their hives.</p>

          <p>Eric Spofford, the former CEO of Granite Recovery Centers, was arrested for allegedly orchestrating a conspiracy to stalk journalists from New Hampshire Public Radio (NHPR). The charges stem from retaliation for an NHPR investigation that revealed allegations of sexual misconduct against Spofford during his tenure as CEO. Spofford allegedly hired individuals to vandalize the homes of the journalist and a senior editor, leading to previous convictions for those involved in the harassment campaign. NHPR expressed gratitude to the Department of Justice for pursuing the case, emphasizing the importance of press freedom.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing severe drought conditions due to exceptionally low rainfall this spring, impacting agriculture, groundwater levels, and potentially leading to rising consumer prices. The Rhine River's low water levels have already increased transport costs, and wildfires have been reported in multiple regions. Experts warn that even if rain falls, it may not effectively recharge groundwater due to the dryness of the soil. Conservation measures are being encouraged, and there's a growing focus on water retention strategies and drought-resistant agriculture to mitigate the long-term effects of climate change.</p>

Experts warn that the tariffs could impact the cost of canned goods and other packaged products, potentially negating Trump's promise to lower food costs. The Can Manufacturers Institute emphasizes that domestic tin mill steel producers have decreased production, making manufacturers reliant on imported materials. Food companies, including Campbell Co. and ConAgra Brands, are already assessing the impact of tariffs and may be forced to raise prices.</p>

This practice goes against NICE guidelines that BMI should not be used to restrict access to joint replacement surgery. Patients are required to lose weight before becoming eligible, but waiting lists for NHS weight loss programs are extensive. The Royal College of Surgeons of England criticized the policy, warning that it could worsen patients' health and mobility.</p>

          <p>The price of a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, a New York City staple, has risen at a Brooklyn bodega due to soaring egg costs and other increased expenses. The owners of El Vacilon Grocery decided to raise the price from $4.50 to $5, the first increase since 2019, as egg prices surged. Despite a revenue decline, the bodega has managed to stay afloat due to owning the building and renting out apartments above the store. The sandwich, referred to as "bandera" by the owners, remains a popular item among locals.</p>

However, many autism scientists argue that genetics are the most significant driver of autism, not environmental toxins. Experts fear Kennedy's focus could distract from genetic research that has facilitated the development of new therapies. The apparent increase in autism rates is primarily attributed to expanding definitions, increased awareness, and better screening methods.</p>

The city's request for federal support from the CDC was denied due to the Trump administration's layoffs within the agency's lead exposure team. Without federal expertise, Milwaukee is navigating the crisis independently, inspecting schools and conducting free blood testing. The incident highlights the potential consequences of federal health system restructuring, where cities may be left to address emergencies without adequate support.</p>
