          <h2>European Automakers Face Significant Financial Strain from US Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Recent corporate earnings reports reveal the substantial financial impact of U.S. tariffs on major European auto manufacturers. Stellantis, the owner of Jeep and Fiat, reported an initial hit of approximately 300 million euros in the first half of the year, with potential full-year costs reaching up to 1.5 billion euros. Similarly, Sweden's Volvo Cars experienced a sharp decline in second-quarter operating profit, prompting plans to shift some production to its U.S. plant. These developments underscore the auto industry's vulnerability to trade protectionism due to its highly globalized supply chains.</p>

          <p>A father is being praised for his heroic actions after saving his four-year-old child from a mountain lion attack in Washington's Olympic National Park. The child was bitten by the animal on a popular trail but sustained non-life-threatening injuries and has since been released from the hospital. Witnesses credited the father's quick intervention with saving the child's life during the harrowing encounter. Park rangers later located and euthanized the cougar, which was fitted with a tracking collar, and confirmed there is no further threat to the public.</p>

According to market researcher Worldpanel by Numerator, this is the highest rate of increase since early last year, prompting shoppers to alter their habits. Consumers are increasingly opting for cheaper supermarket own-brand products and preparing simpler meals at home to manage costs.

          <p>Habibur Masum has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 28 years for the murder of his wife, Kulsuma Akter. Masum fatally stabbed the 27-year-old in Bradford city center last April as she was pushing their infant son in a pram. The court heard that Ms. Akter had been living in a refuge after Masum had previously threatened her with a knife. The judge described the attack, in which Ms. Akter was stabbed 26 times, as vicious and merciless, carried out in full public view.</p>

          <p>As the European Union faces pressure from both the United States and China, it has an opportunity to redefine its strategic position. With the U.S. threatening significant tariffs, the EU could strengthen its bargaining power by pragmatically engaging with China. However, this is complicated by China's economic support for Russia during the Ukraine war, a major point of contention for Europe. The article suggests the EU must consider China's own security concerns regarding its rivalry with the U.S. and reassess its alignment on issues like tech restrictions to forge a more independent and advantageous foreign policy.</p>

          <p>For the second consecutive week, the U.S. House of Representatives is functionally paralyzed due to a stalemate over the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. The House Rules Committee recessed indefinitely after Democrats attempted to force a vote on legislation compelling the release of the documents. Republicans on the committee have refused to hold the vote, leading to a halt in legislative business and preventing several unrelated bills from reaching the House floor. This gridlock highlights the deep political divisions surrounding the issue as the House approaches its August recess.</p>

          <p>A French court has sentenced three individuals to prison for human trafficking, finding them guilty of exploiting undocumented migrant workers during the 2023 grape harvest in the Champagne region. The workers, primarily from West Africa, were housed in squalid, unhygienic conditions and described being treated "like slaves." The director of a servicing company received a two-year jail term, while two recruiters were each sentenced to one year. The case has brought intense scrutiny to labor practices in the renowned wine region, with victims' lawyers calling the ruling a historic decision.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with the added benefit of locking in a fixed rate. While national average yields for one-year CDs are around 2.03%, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some offering over 4.40% APY. Currently, short-term CDs of about one year tend to provide higher interest rates than longer-term options due to an inverted yield curve. Financial experts suggest strategies like laddering CDs to take advantage of high short-term rates while maintaining a long-term savings plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing, current mortgage rates remain a critical factor in affordability. As of mid-July 2025, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is approximately 6.75%, while a 15-year loan averages around 5.95%. Refinance rates are slightly higher, with a 30-year average at 6.81%. Experts advise that borrowers with strong credit scores in the mid-to-high 700s are most likely to secure the best available rates. Shopping around and comparing offers from multiple lenders is also a key strategy for finding the most favorable terms. (not investment advice)</p>

After a review confirmed the interference, Sosa was awarded first base, forcing in the winning run. This marked the first time a Major League Baseball game has ended on a walk-off catcher's interference since 1971, providing a uniquely memorable conclusion to the contest.</p>

          <p>The cost of renting a home in the UK has surged by an average of £221 per month over the last three years, creating significant financial pressure on tenants. According to property portal Zoopla, the sharp increase is forcing some individuals to turn down job opportunities in expensive areas and rely on financial help from parents. While the rate of rent increases has recently slowed, the cumulative effect has made housing affordability a major crisis. Many renters feel that home ownership is an unattainable goal, as high rents make it impossible to save for a deposit.</p>

Suborbital transport involves a vehicle briefly exiting the Earth's atmosphere before gliding to a runway landing.

Experts warn that reducing this funding would be a significant step backward, crippling the ability to track changes in the drug supply and implement timely interventions.

          <p>Stephanie Wambugu's debut novel, "Lonely Crowds," examines the complexities and potential toxicity of a decades-long friendship between two women, Ruth and Maria. The article follows their relationship from a Catholic school in Rhode Island to the competitive 1990s New York art scene, revealing the secrets and misunderstandings at its core. Wambugu challenges the sentimental myth of childhood friends, instead portraying their bond as a liability built on an uneven dynamic of obsession and rejection. The novel suggests that such an intense connection can prevent individuals from developing a true sense of self, independent of the other.</p>
