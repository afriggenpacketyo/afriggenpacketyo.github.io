          <p>OpenAI's launch of its new flagship model, GPT-5, has generated mixed reviews within China's competitive artificial intelligence landscape. While OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described the system as a "PhD-level expert in anything," some Chinese tech observers were less impressed, with one analyst noting it lacks revolutionary breakthroughs. The new model boasts improved performance in areas like coding, math, and visual perception, featuring a built-in "thinking" function. Its reception highlights the escalating global competition and high expectations in the AI sector.</p>

A new state-owned enterprise has been established to oversee the construction and operation of the nearly 2,000km route. The railway will link the existing Lhasa-Shigatse line with a new line from Hotan to Shigatse. This project is a key part of a larger plan to establish a 5,000km plateau rail network centered on Lhasa by 2035, enhancing connectivity and infrastructure in the region.</p>

          <p>Travelers can avoid unexpectedly high cell phone bills abroad by employing several strategies, as highlighted by a reporter's personal experience with a $50 charge in Paris. Experts recommend checking if a carrier like T-Mobile offers international roaming in its plans, which can be cost-effective for basic use. For heavier data users, purchasing a local or international eSIM is often a cheaper alternative to daily roaming packages from major carriers. Additionally, utilizing free Wi-Fi and downloading maps and documents for offline use can significantly reduce data consumption and costs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A critical debate is emerging over how to sustainably feed a growing global population, centering on the trade-off between land use and agricultural intensity. New analysis argues that intensive, industrial farming, despite its criticisms, is more land-efficient than organic or regenerative methods, thereby preserving vital ecosystems like rainforests. This perspective challenges pastoral ideals, suggesting that to avoid clearing more land, humanity must intensify production. However, this approach raises profound ethical questions, particularly its reliance on factory farming and the immense animal suffering it entails.</p>

The charges include insurance fraud, false personation, and forgery, which could result in up to five years in prison if he is convicted.

The fire broke out in the rural Keratea area, prompting evacuations of homes and an elderly care center. Authorities remain on high alert as strong winds are forecast to continue, which could escalate the fire's spread.

          <h2>Health Experts Warn of Fatal 'Refeeding Syndrome' Risk in Famine-Stricken Regions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As catastrophic hunger grips regions like Gaza and Sudan, health experts are warning of the dangers of "refeeding syndrome," a potentially fatal condition that can occur when severely malnourished individuals resume eating too quickly. A sudden influx of nutrients can disrupt the body's electrolytes, leading to critical organ failure or an irregular heartbeat. Aid organizations use specially formulated, low-nutrient therapeutic foods to slowly and safely reintroduce nutrition. Experts stress that preventing this syndrome requires controlled access for aid agencies, which is currently being denied in several conflict zones.</p>

          <p>A Kenyan immigrant living in Michigan for 16 years has decided to self-deport, leaving his American wife and three children, due to the fear and uncertainty of his unresolved immigration case. Samuel Kangethe, who has a master's degree and was working as an accountant, faced a deportable status after a previous marriage was deemed fraudulent. Rather than risk detention and forced removal under the current administration's policies, he chose to leave on his own terms. His story illustrates the personal and familial toll of U.S. immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece analyzes recent statements by Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has begun publicly criticizing her own Republican party. Greene has expressed frustration with the treatment of women in the GOP, denounced Fox News as propaganda, and became the first Republican lawmaker to label the situation in Gaza a genocide. The author suggests that while Greene's motives are likely not progressive, her actions are creating significant infighting. The article posits that this internal conflict, rather than Democratic opposition, could ultimately lead to the collapse of the MAGA movement.</p>

          <p>The FDA has reportedly informed Pfizer that it may not renew the emergency use authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine for children under five this fall. This move could pull the only currently available vaccine for that age group from the market, creating a significant gap in protection. The CDC is now in discussions with Moderna to potentially increase its supply to fill the void, though Moderna's shot is only approved for young children with underlying health conditions. Public health experts have expressed concern over the potential lack of access and the timing of the decision.</p>

Key tips include giving hosts ample notice, keeping visits to a reasonable length like four days, and communicating plans clearly to align expectations.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the implementation of new U.S. tariffs, consumers are likely to face higher prices for many goods, though the full effect has been cushioned by companies absorbing initial costs. Economists predict that these costs will eventually be passed on, with one estimate suggesting an average household cost of $2,400 this year. While overall inflation is expected to rise, it is not projected to reach the highs of 2022. The tariffs are also expected to slow the strong labor market and overall economic growth, but most forecasters do not anticipate a recession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Italian government has approved the revival of a long-debated project to construct the Strait of Messina Bridge, which would connect Sicily to the Italian mainland. If completed, the 2-mile single-span suspension bridge would be the world's longest, with a projected cost of €13.5 billion and a completion date of 2032. The project has faced numerous cancellations over the years due to concerns about cost, seismic activity, and local opposition. Proponents, however, argue it will create over 100,000 jobs and bring significant economic prosperity to southern Italy.</p>
