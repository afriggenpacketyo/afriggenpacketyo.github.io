          <p>A Chinese climber, Guan Jing, was tragically killed by falling rocks on K2, the world's second-highest and notoriously dangerous peak, just a day after successfully reaching its summit with her expedition group. Her body remains at a high altitude, with bad weather grounding helicopter recovery efforts and a Nepali Sherpa injured during an earlier attempt. This incident underscores the extreme inherent risks of K2, known for its treacherous slopes, frequent rockfalls, and extreme weather conditions, making it one of the most difficult and dangerous peaks to ascend globally, with a significantly higher fatality rate than Mount Everest. Past deadly incidents on K2, including a Pakistani climber last month and a Scottish climber in 2021, reinforce the mountain's formidable challenges.</p>

          <p>Andriy Yermak, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's influential chief of staff, is facing both criticism and praise for his significant, unelected role in the ongoing war with Russia. Accused by some former U.S. and Ukrainian officials of wielding immense power and making questionable personnel and policy decisions, including a contentious anti-corruption law later reversed, he is simultaneously lauded for his effectiveness in getting things done and unwavering loyalty to Zelenskyy. Despite an unorthodox approach that has sometimes rankled Washington D.C. politicians, Yermak remains a pivotal conduit for Ukraine's international negotiations and a trusted advisor, especially in pushing for tougher sanctions on Russia.</p>

          <p>A "New Right" movement, comprised of radical intellectuals hostile to American liberal democracy, is significantly influencing Donald Trump's political agenda and shaping discussions about a potential second term. Political theorist Laura Field categorizes these thinkers into groups like Claremonters, post-liberals, and national conservatives, all united by a basic hostility to the current system and a commitment to unremitting culture war. Despite their origins in obscure intellectual circles, their ideas are dramatically reorienting the Republican Party and impacting public discourse, highlighting a perceived intellectual vacuum on the political left and the enduring influence of ideas in politics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy experienced a slowdown in growth between April and June, expanding by 0.3%, a decrease from the previous quarter's 0.7%, but still surpassed forecasts of 0.1% expansion. This unexpected resilience, largely driven by the services sector and construction, might influence the Bank of England's reluctance to cut interest rates, as inflation is projected to peak at 4% later this year. However, experts express doubt about the country's ability to maintain this pace due to a weak global economy, the full impact of recent tax rises, and ongoing speculation about further fiscal changes.

          <p>Aviva's chief executive, Amanda Blanc, has reaffirmed the insurer's unwavering commitment to its climate goals despite growing pushback against net-zero ambitions in the US and UK financial sectors. Her steadfastness comes as several major banks have withdrawn from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, signaling a notable schism in the industry. Blanc emphasized that climate transition plans are crucial for Aviva's core insurance business, directly addressing the increasing frequency of extreme weather events that significantly impact property insurability and necessitate proactive measures. The company also reported a substantial 22% jump in operating profit, indicating strong financial performance alongside its environmental stance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paul Doyle, accused of deliberately driving a car into a crowd at a Liverpool FC victory parade, now faces 24 additional charges, including attempted grievous bodily harm against two babies. The incident in May injured over 130 people, with five of the newly added charges involving children aged six months to 17 years old. Prosecutors allege Doyle used his car "as a weapon" to injure individuals attempting to leave the area. The court has granted his defense more time to consider the extensive new counts and witness statements, with proceedings adjourned until September.</p>

          <p>Rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, have been observed with unusual horn-like growths, leading to nicknames like "Frankenstein bunnies," but scientists reassure the public there's no cause for alarm. This phenomenon is caused by the Shope papillomavirus, a mostly harmless and relatively common affliction that induces wart-like protrusions. The virus is not transmissible to humans or pets and typically does not harm the rabbits unless it grows on their eyes or mouths, impeding their ability to eat. This condition has historical significance, possibly inspiring the jackalope myth, and has contributed to scientific understanding of viruses and cancer.</p>

          <p>Singapore, one of the world's most expensive cities, is experiencing a concerning trend where 60% of its workers are living paycheck to paycheck, significantly higher than the Asia-Pacific average. This strain is attributed to rapidly rising costs, particularly in housing and imports, combined with a cultural shift prioritizing immediate experiences and self-care over long-term financial planning. Real median employment income has declined post-pandemic, and while the importance of saving is acknowledged, many residents find it increasingly difficult to accumulate wealth. This highlights a broader societal challenge in balancing aspirations with economic realities in a high-cost environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police, citing a crime emergency, draws parallels to a 1992 congressional push for law and order following a staffer's murder. However, a key distinction is that 1992 D.C. was indeed the "murder capital," whereas current violent crime rates are at a 30-year low, making Trump's depiction an exaggeration. Local leaders strongly oppose this "historic assault on DC home rule," reminiscent of the public's rejection of federal interference in 1992. This move is fueling renewed calls for D.C. statehood, as residents resent external control over their city's affairs.</p>

          <h2>Columnist Argues Trump's Focus on Grandiose Appearances Undermines U.S. Institutions</h2>

          <p>This opinion article sharply criticizes Donald Trump's preoccupation with superficial appearances and his "makeover" of U.S. government institutions, from the Oval Office to the Smithsonian, arguing it serves his personal image of gilded grandeur and raw power. The author highlights instances like firing a labor statistician, militarizing Washington D.C. despite falling crime rates, and planning a summit with Putin, suggesting these are performative acts rather than substantive governance. The piece contends that Trump's actions, including potential future uses of force and constant fundraising, reflect a disdain for democratic norms and a focus on spectacle over genuine problem-solving, making America "worse than tacky."</p>

          <p>New WWII-era military documents and the rare testimony of a 95-year-old former member are providing further insights into Japan's notorious Unit 731, a germ warfare program active from 1936 to 1945. The unit conducted inhumane medical experiments on live prisoners, including dissections and disease infections, with estimates of 3,000 deaths from Unit 731 alone, and far more from bioweapons developed by other branches. Despite a 2002 Tokyo court ruling confirming these actions, the Japanese government has never apologized, and the U.S. controversially granted immunity to Unit 731 leaders in exchange for their research data, prioritizing Cold War intelligence over justice.</p>

          <p>The FBI has successfully returned a 500-year-old manuscript page signed by Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés to Mexico, part of a collection stolen from Mexico's national archives between 1985 and 1993. The document, penned in 1527, details payments for expeditions to "spice lands" and offers valuable insights into the planning of New Spain's colonization. While no prosecutions will occur as the page had "changed hands several times," the repatriation underscores the U.S.'s commitment to countering artifact trafficking and preserving valuable cultural heritage. The FBI remains determined to locate and repatriate the other missing pages from this significant historical collection.</p>

          <p>Sezzle, a buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) fintech company, has seen its stock surge over 2,200% since its 2023 Nasdaq listing, despite a recent 30% pullback after its Q2 earnings report. The company reported robust revenue growth of 76% and a stellar 28% net margin, with management still expecting 60-65% year-over-year revenue growth. Sezzle operates in a rapidly expanding BNPL market, currently holding only 1.4% market share, indicating substantial growth potential. Its excellent profitability allows for capital return to shareholders, but its volatility means investors should proceed with caution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Western instructors are successfully training Ukrainian troops for the brutal conflict against Russia, despite many trainers lacking direct experience in large-scale, industrialized warfare.

          <p>International negotiations for the world's first legally binding plastic pollution treaty are in a critical final stage, struggling to achieve a breakthrough due to deep divisions among countries. Nations pushing for an ambitious treaty, including Panama, Kenya, France, and Britain, are frustrated by the removal of key articles on the full life cycle of plastics and health impacts. Oil-producing nations resist curbs on virgin plastic production, while others demand stricter controls, highlighting the challenge of reconciling environmental protection with economic interests. Without intervention, plastic production is projected to triple by 2060, further exacerbating environmental and climate issues.</p>
