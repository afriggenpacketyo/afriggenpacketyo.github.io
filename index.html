        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At the annual NATO summit, the U.S. is urging allies to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP, comprised of 3.5% for defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure. While some member states are close to or willing to meet this target, others are struggling to reach the previously agreed 2% threshold. The U.S. seeks concrete plans and commitments from allies, but some European nations may attempt to dilute their pledges. The summit occurs amidst ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East, making it potentially the most consequential in NATO's history, and European aerospace and defense companies are eager for concrete government procurement contracts to scale up production. The article reflects the tensions and expectations surrounding defense spending within the alliance. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NHS Lothian is considering establishing a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression, costing Â£6,000 for a program of infusions and psychotherapy. Ketamine, known recreationally, has shown promise in making patients more receptive to psychotherapy, with one patient reporting improved mood and increased activity. While esketamine nasal spray is approved for moderate to severe treatment-resistant depression in Scotland, intravenous ketamine is not, but can be prescribed 'off-label,' and the Royal College of Psychiatrists is expected to release updated information on psychedelics later this year. The exploration of ketamine as a treatment option offers hope for those with difficult-to-treat depression. </p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. joining the conflict between Israel and Iran, global markets have largely remained stable, with investors viewing the situation as contained. The MSCI World index experienced only a slight decline, and safe-haven assets like the Japanese yen and gold traded mixed. Some analysts believe the strikes on Iran have reduced the nuclear threat in the region, leading to minimal risks of wider conflict. While acknowledging the gravity of the situation, experts do not see it as a systemic risk to global markets. Market reactions have been less aggressive compared to when Israel launched airstrikes against Iran, suggesting a degree of investor confidence in the containment of the conflict. </p>

Japan continues to hope for a resumption of dialogue between the United States and Iran and vows to contribute to peace and stability in the Middle East. While Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba emphasized the importance of de-escalation, the government's stance reflects Japan's security alliance with the U.S. and its concern over Iran's nuclear ambitions.

          <p>The article criticizes the response of Western leaders to the escalating conflict in the Middle East, particularly the war between Israel and Iran, for being passive and failing to address the root causes. It argues that mainstream liberal parties are out of touch with public sentiment and are essentially passengers in Israel's war, unwilling to question its wisdom. The author accuses Western leaders of clinging to unconditional support for Israel, thereby undermining international and human rights law. They are portrayed as managers of a failing world order, prioritizing tribal supremacy over values and human life. The author expresses deep concern over the erosion of political discourse and the increasing disconnect between political establishments and the public. </p>

          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is expected to set ambitious goals that will heavily impact Germany's military, the Bundeswehr. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged financial resources to make the Bundeswehr the strongest conventional army in Europe, NATO's new target of 5% of GDP for defense spending poses a significant challenge. The German government supports allocating 3.5% of GDP to defense and 1.5% to defense-related infrastructure, aiming to achieve the 5% target by 2032. This would require a substantial increase in Germany's defense budget, sparking debate within the coalition government and opposition.

          <p>New York City will use ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary, a system where voters rank multiple candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to voters' second choices. This process continues until one candidate has a majority, and the system aims to ensure that the elected candidate has broad support. The tabulation process will not begin until July 1 due to mail-in ballots, and the results will not be official until July 15.

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has released its first images, showcasing its ability to peer into the universe's depths with unprecedented detail. One image reveals colorful gas and dust clouds in a star-forming region 9,000 light years from Earth, and the observatory is equipped with the world's most powerful digital camera. The telescope is expected to transform our understanding of the universe, potentially discovering a ninth planet, detecting killer asteroids, mapping the Milky Way, and answering questions about dark matter. The observatory will conduct a continuous 10-year filming of the southern night sky, capturing vast amounts of data. </p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory has unveiled its first images, signaling the beginning of a decade-long survey of the night sky, and the observatory is designed to capture cosmic events, such as asteroids and supernovae. The facility will collect data on about 40 billion stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects, and its computer systems will detect changes in the sky. This "discovery machine" will enable astronomers to explore galaxies, stars, and the solar system in new ways. The observatory has already discovered 2,104 previously unseen asteroids, including seven near-Earth asteroids, during test observations. </p>

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that the precision munitions struck their intended targets, and the UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi noted that assessing the damage at Fordo is not yet possible.
