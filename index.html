        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier Li Qiang's recent statements and escalated policy support highlight Beijing's ongoing concerns about the property sector's impact on China's economic growth and domestic demand, especially amid external economic challenges. A State Council meeting emphasized the need to optimize existing policies and enhance implementation to stabilize expectations, stimulate demand, and mitigate risks within the property market. Specific measures include a thorough stocktake of ongoing projects and land supplies, along with increased land supply and financing aid for urban-renewal projects, all aimed at halting the sector's decline and stabilizing it. The article suggests that Beijing is actively seeking solutions to address the property sector's woes while avoiding previous ineffective measures. Optimism surrounding these efforts is cautiously moderate, reflecting the complex nature of the economic challenges.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani is scheduled to make his pitching comeback against the San Diego Padres, marking his first MLB game as a pitcher since August 2023, following right elbow surgery. Ohtani's return is expedited due to injuries within the Dodgers' bullpen, with expectations for him to pitch shorter innings. Despite the pitching return, Ohtani has been performing well as a batter, recently achieving a 3-for-3 performance with two runs scored. Meanwhile, rookie right-hander Roki Sasaki's return remains uncertain due to a shoulder impingement, potentially sidelining him for the remainder of the season.</p>

The Prime Minister argues that the current system is not working for those who need support or for taxpayers, emphasizing the necessity of reform that everyone agrees is needed.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scotland will export up to 100 truckloads of waste daily to England following the implementation of a landfill ban at the end of the year, as current incinerator capacity cannot meet the demand. The ban, covering biodegradable municipal waste, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by diverting waste from landfills to recycling and energy-from-waste incinerators. However, a capacity gap estimated at 600,000 tonnes in the first year will necessitate sending excess waste to landfills in England, raising concerns about increased emissions from transportation. While the long-term strategy involves reducing household waste generation, recycling rates have seen minimal improvement, creating logistical and environmental challenges.</p>

Activists argue that their cities are being handed over to tourists, leading to the systematic pushing out of long-term residents. The Spanish government has responded with measures like ordering Airbnb to remove unauthorized holiday rentals, but deeper systemic changes are being demanded.</p>

          <p>Analysts caution that Donald Trump’s proposed “revenge tax” could deter foreign investment into the U.S. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes a provision, Section 899, allowing the U.S. to impose higher taxes on foreign entities connected to jurisdictions with “unfair foreign taxes” targeting U.S. companies. This measure, classifying digital service taxes and diverted profits taxes as unfair, could lead to additional taxes starting at 5% and increasing annually to 20%. Experts fear this could alienate foreign investors, undermine the dollar’s safe haven status, and potentially trigger trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

This order follows weeks of anti-ICE protests, some of which have turned violent, prompting the president to deploy the National Guard in certain areas. Trump claims that these cities, primarily Democrat strongholds, use illegal aliens to expand their voter base and grow the welfare state, robbing jobs and benefits from hardworking American citizens. The move has drawn criticism from Democrats, who argue that it disrupts key sectors of the economy reliant on immigrant labor.</p>

          <p>Asian shares showed mixed performance, and oil prices increased due to worries that escalating tensions between Iran and Israel could disrupt global crude oil supplies. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rose, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell slightly, and Chinese markets remained relatively unchanged despite data showing stronger retail sales but weaker factory activity. Oil prices surged following Israel’s attack on Iranian nuclear and military targets, reflecting concerns over potential disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz. Companies heavily reliant on fuel, such as cruise operators and airlines, experienced losses, while oil producers and defense equipment manufacturers gained.</p>

          <p>Shared ownership schemes, designed as a stepping stone to homeownership, are facing increasing discontent as complaints to housing watchdogs soar. Buyers report issues with repairs, rising costs, and difficulties in selling their properties, leading to feelings of being trapped. Many shared owners feel they have neither the rights of homeowners nor the flexibility of renters, with some experiencing financial strain and inability to increase their ownership share. The Housing Ombudsman reports a nearly 400% increase in shared ownership complaints over the past five years, highlighting fundamental inequities in the scheme's design.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are facing criticism for their silence regarding recent ICE raids in the city, particularly given the team's large Latino fanbase. While other local sports teams have expressed solidarity with residents experiencing fear and uncertainty, the Dodgers have remained silent, prompting accusations of ingratitude and cowardice. The team's decision to visit President Donald Trump at the White House earlier in the season has also resurfaced, with critics questioning whether the Dodgers regret the visit in light of the administration's immigration policies. The team's lack of response is seen as a betrayal of its loyal fans who are directly affected by the raids.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, driven by government subsidies aimed at boosting consumption amidst persistent deflation. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year in May, surpassing analysts' estimates, attributed to the consumer goods trade-in program, online shopping events, and increased foreign tourism. However, industrial output slowed, and fixed-asset investment growth undershot forecasts, with a deepening contraction in property investment. Analysts caution that falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment, necessitating stronger policy support to sustain economic recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alberto Alemanno argues that Europe, instead of standing up to Trump and Putin, is increasingly mirroring their policies, undermining democratic ideals. The EU and its member states are adopting similar approaches on migration, climate, and civil society, centralizing power and tolerating democratic backsliding. This ideological convergence, driven by a right-wing majority in the European parliament, weakens Europe's ability to address global threats. The author calls for a compelling alternative vision that champions EU-wide action on security, migration, and prosperity, protecting national identities through integration rather than succumbing to authoritarian tendencies.</p>

          <p>Reports indicate that Iran's intelligence chief, Mohammed Kazemi, was killed in an Israeli strike on Tehran, alongside his deputy and another intelligence officer. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the deaths, claiming responsibility for the attack, which was later confirmed by Iranian state media. This strike follows previous attacks on high-ranking Iranian military officials and nuclear scientists. Netanyahu has maintained that Israel's offensive against Iran is a pre-emptive measure to dismantle a covert nuclear weapons program.</p>
