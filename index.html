          <p>Elon Musk's brief tenure at the White House as part of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) concluded after 129 days marked by efforts to cut government spending. Musk's mission to slash spending, initially targeting trillions, resulted in claimed savings of $175 billion through various measures, though the accuracy of these figures has been questioned. His time in government also raised ethical concerns due to potential conflicts of interest between his government role and his business ventures, particularly with SpaceX and Tesla. His departure has sparked debate about the balance between private sector expertise and public service, and the lasting impact of his policies on federal agencies. The efforts to reduce federal spending have been met with mixed reactions, highlighting the complex challenges of balancing fiscal responsibility and public services.</p>

Bessent expressed confidence that China will return to the table once President Trump communicates his preferences. This development underscores the complexities and high-level involvement required to navigate the ongoing trade relationship between the world's two largest economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nathan Laatsch, an IT specialist with the Defense Intelligence Agency, was arrested for allegedly attempting to provide classified information to a foreign government.

The information, found on a thumb drive, was classified at both the Secret and Top Secret levels. This arrest highlights concerns about potential insider threats within the intelligence community and the risks of individuals attempting to sell sensitive information to foreign entities.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily suspended a lower court's ruling that deemed President Trump's global tariffs illegal, allowing the administration to continue collecting import taxes. The White House argued that the lower court's decision overstepped its authority and threatened trade negotiations. This legal battle stems from tariffs imposed on goods from China, Mexico, and Canada, justified by the administration as a response to fentanyl smuggling, as well as a blanket 10% import tax on goods from various countries. The case is expected to eventually reach the Supreme Court, with potential implications for Trump's trade agenda and international relations. (not investment advice)</p>

The situation has sparked a political debate, with Senator Patty Murray questioning Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. about the impact of the cuts on clinical trials.

          <p>China has developed the world's first AI nuclear inspector, a technology disclosed in a peer-reviewed paper by researchers with the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE). The project, built on a protocol proposed by Chinese and American scientists, aims to enhance Beijingâ€™s position in international disarmament talks. Challenges included training the AI with sensitive nuclear data, ensuring the system would not leak tech secrets, and convincing skeptical nations to abandon Cold War-era verification methods.

          <p>Major cuts to USDA funding are severely impacting food banks and school food programs in North Carolina, leading to reduced access to fresh, local produce for students and families. The Trump administration's cuts to the Local Food for Schools program and the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement have resulted in a loss of over $1 billion in annual funding nationwide. Local growers, like Pine Knot Farms, are experiencing devastating revenue losses, potentially leading to layoffs. The cuts exacerbate an already severe hunger crisis, forcing individuals to choose between food and essential medicine.</p>
