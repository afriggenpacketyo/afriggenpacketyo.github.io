            <p>Goldman Sachs reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed analysts' estimates, driven by robust equities trading revenue, with earnings per share at $14.12 against an expected $12.35. The bank's profit increased by 15% to $4.74 billion, while revenues saw a more modest rise of 6% to $15.06 billion. The global banking and markets division experienced a 10% revenue increase, fueled by a 27% surge in equity trading revenue, which offset a slight decline in asset and wealth management revenue. CEO David Solomon acknowledged the uncertain operating environment, hinting at the impact of trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

Siddiq, a former minister, refutes the allegations, claiming the Bangladeshi authorities are conducting a 'trial by media'. The ACC's investigation is ongoing, and Siddiq maintains her innocence.</p>

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has extended an invitation to Donald Trump to visit Ukraine before any agreement is reached with Russia to end the ongoing war. This comes as the US pursues negotiations with Moscow, with Zelensky highlighting Russia's continued attacks on civilians. The invitation follows a deadly missile strike on Sumy, prompting international condemnation. European leaders, including Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, have condemned the attack as a war crime, while the UN has called for an immediate end to attacks against civilians.</p>

            <p>China has implemented visa restrictions on U.S. personnel who have acted egregiously on Tibet-related issues, responding to similar measures by Washington. The reciprocal restrictions follow U.S. concerns over access for foreigners to Tibetan areas. China maintains that Tibet-related affairs are internal matters and opposes interference under the guise of human rights or religion. Beijing welcomes friendly foreign individuals to visit Tibet but opposes those with ulterior motives.</p>

Critics argue that the new Pentagon is prioritizing the deletion of 'woke' ideologies while neglecting far-right extremism.</p>

Students are questioning the financial risk and social pressures associated with college, while parents are prioritizing their children's happiness.

            <p>Proposed cuts to Medicaid could significantly impact long-term care and family caregivers, as the program is a primary source of funding for these services. Reductions could lead to diminished health outcomes for those needing daily care, increased hospitalizations, and greater burdens on unpaid family caregivers. While proponents suggest targeting fraud, the majority of cuts would likely come from reduced enrollment or service limitations. The potential impact includes unnecessary institutionalization and financial strain on families already struggling to afford long-term care.</p>

However, Trump plans to lump electronics in with semiconductors in a separate tariff he says he will announce in the next month or two.
