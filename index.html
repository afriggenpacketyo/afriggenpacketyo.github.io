          <p>Hamas has reportedly issued a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal aimed at ending the conflict with Israel in Gaza. The group stated it is prepared to enter negotiations to implement the framework, which follows President Trump's announcement that Israel had agreed to a two-month truce. However, Hamas is insisting on guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war following the proposed 60-day pause. The negotiations are occurring amid a dire humanitarian situation, with the Gaza Health Ministry reporting over 57,000 Palestinian fatalities and controversy surrounding aid distribution by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has been knocked out of Wimbledon in the third round following a hard-fought match against world number one Aryna Sabalenka. Despite a strong performance that pushed the top seed, Raducanu ultimately lost 7-6, 6-4 on Centre Court. The 22-year-old showed significant resilience, even taking a 4-1 lead in the second set before Sabalenka mounted a comeback. While the loss was disappointing for the home crowd favorite, her competitive play against a three-time Grand Slam champion was seen as a positive sign of her return to form and a significant improvement over previous top-10 encounters.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas's Hill Country have resulted in at least 13 fatalities, with officials warning the number could rise as search and rescue operations continue. The Guadalupe River surged an unprecedented 26 feet in less than an hour following intense rainfall of up to 12 inches, creating a catastrophic and destructive event. A primary focus of the large-scale emergency response, which includes helicopters and drone teams, is on Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp where approximately 20 children were reported unaccounted for after the floodwaters hit. State leaders have mobilized extensive resources to aid the affected communities amid the ongoing crisis.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to protest the Trump administration's immigration policies and a recently passed budget bill that significantly increases funding for enforcement. The rally, which marched from City Hall to the federal building, highlighted the fear and disruption caused by ongoing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids across the Southland. Protesters, including local residents and an assemblymember, voiced their opposition to the mass deportations and the militarized response to previous protests. The event underscores the escalating tensions between local California leaders and the federal government over immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued a temporary stay, pausing the Trump administration's planned deportation of eight migrants from Djibouti to South Sudan, a country with which they have no ties. The men, who were convicted of violent crimes in the U.S., were in legal limbo after a previous court order blocking their removal was lifted by the Supreme Court. Attorneys for the migrants argued that sending them to South Sudan could expose them to torture or harm. Judge Randolph Moss expressed grave concerns, stating the U.S. government cannot send people to physically dangerous situations simply to punish them or send a message to others.</p>

It also introduces significant cuts and new restrictions to social safety net programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which the CBO estimates will cause millions to lose coverage. The legislation also raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion and creates new, temporary tax deductions for tipped workers. (not investment advice)</p>

The runoff from previously parched land overwhelmed riverfront communities with little warning.

Burns emphasizes that America's founding was a bloody and divisive civil war, not a sanitized event, and that understanding this complexity makes the founders' achievements more inspiring. He suggests that in today's divided times, Americans can draw strength from the fact that the nation was forged out of deep conflict.</p>

The legislation creates a "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals over 65 with incomes below $75,000, which is set to expire in 2028. Policy experts note this is not a repeal of the tax on benefits and will not help the lowest-income seniors who already have no federal tax liability.

While the trend is encouraging for a backlog of private companies, venture capitalists remain cautiously optimistic, citing the need for sustained economic stability and noting that many recent IPOs have seen only modest gains before declaring a full market recovery.

          <p>According to a joint finding by Dutch and German intelligence services, Russia is escalating its use of prohibited chemical weapons in Ukraine, including the WWI-era poison gas chloropicrin. The report states that the use of such agents has become "standardized and commonplace," with Russian forces dropping chemicals on Ukrainian trenches to force soldiers into open areas where they can be targeted. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans condemned the actions as showing Russia's "evil face" and called for more sanctions. Ukraine alleges that Russia has carried out 9,000 chemical attacks since the full-scale invasion began in 2022.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in Central California, named the Madre Fire, has rapidly grown to over 70,800 acres, officially becoming the largest fire in the state so far this year. The blaze, which is currently 10% contained, originated in the Los Padres National Forest and has since spread toward state-managed lands, threatening communities in San Luis Obispo and Kern counties. Evacuation orders and warnings are in effect, and officials have deployed extensive air and ground resources to combat the fire. The U.S. Forest Service described its growth as "exponential," highlighting the danger posed by current weather and fuel conditions ahead of the holiday weekend.</p>

          <p>President Trump is facing criticism for using the term "shylocks" during a speech in Iowa, a word the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) identifies as a "centuries-old antisemitic trope." While discussing changes to the estate tax, the president referred to some lenders as "shylocks and bad people." When questioned by reporters, Mr. Trump claimed he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations, stating he understood it to mean a moneylender charging high rates. The ADL called the usage "very troubling and irresponsible," while Democratic Representative Dan Goldman described it as "blatant and vile antisemitism."</p>

One officer suffered a broken nose in the incident. The brothers, who both deny the allegations and claim self-defense, were at the airport to collect their mother.

          <p>A provision within the newly passed "big, beautiful bill" will create a new federal tax deduction for tipped workers, a policy President Trump has championed. The measure allows employees who rely on tips, such as restaurant servers and bartenders, to deduct a portion of their income from federal taxes, though they will still owe state, local, and payroll taxes. The specifics of the deduction, including income caps and deduction limits, differ between the House and Senate versions of the bill. Critics note that the tax break is temporary, expiring in 2028, and will not benefit the lowest-earning workers who have no federal tax liability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has floated an unconventional idea for celebrating the 250th anniversary of the United States next year: hosting a UFC championship fight on the White House grounds. During a speech in Iowa, Trump said he envisioned an octagon ring and a crowd of 20,00 to 25,000 people for the event on July 4, 2026. He mentioned that UFC CEO Dana White, a vocal supporter, would be involved in organizing the proposed fight. The White House has never hosted a professional sporting event of this nature, making the proposal a significant departure from traditional presidential celebrations.</p>

The program aimed to test the delivery of up to 100 tons of cargo anywhere on Earth within 90 minutes, a potential breakthrough for military logistics.

This move is part of an aggressive negotiating strategy as President Trump's self-imposed July 9 deadline for reaching new tariff deals with numerous countries approaches.
