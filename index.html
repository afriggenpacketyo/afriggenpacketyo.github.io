          <h2>General Motors to Report Earnings Amid Concerns Over US Auto Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 06:12:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors is scheduled to release its second-quarter earnings, with investors closely watching for the financial impact of President Trump's auto tariffs. Wall Street expects adjusted earnings of $2.44 per share on $46.4 billion in revenue, representing a significant decline from the previous year. The company has already lowered its full-year guidance, anticipating a potential $4 billion to $5 billion impact from the tariffs. The report will also be scrutinized for updates on GM's electric vehicle strategy, particularly after the recent elimination of federal EV tax credits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 06:06:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) has raised concerns that NHS England's plans for the upcoming resident doctors' strike could endanger patients. The union argues that the directive to minimize cancellations of routine procedures will stretch senior doctors, who are covering for their striking colleagues, too thinly. This approach contrasts with previous strikes where non-urgent care was widely rescheduled to ensure emergency services remained safely staffed. The dispute centers on pay, with the BMA demanding wage restoration to 2008 levels, while the government and the union continue last-minute talks to avert the walkout.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is reportedly considering its 'Anti-Coercion Instrument' (ACI) in response to a looming threat of 30% tariffs on EU imports by the U.S. This powerful tool, created in 2023 but never used, would allow the bloc to restrict U.S. access to its markets, public tenders, and impose limits on goods, services, and investment. The measure is being discussed as a potential last resort if trade negotiations fail before the August 1st deadline set by the Trump administration. While the EU hopes for a deal, the ACI represents a significant escalation, aiming to deter what it perceives as economic coercion.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-made F-7 BGI training aircraft crashed into a school in Dhaka, Bangladesh, raising the death toll to 31, including 25 students and a teacher. The pilot also died in the incident, which the military attributed to a technical malfunction moments after takeoff. The crash has sparked grief and anger, with hundreds of students protesting for accountability, compensation for victims, and a halt to training flights using what they call outdated aircraft. This tragic event has led to a national day of mourning as dozens of injured individuals remain hospitalized in critical condition.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has emerged as a major political force in Washington, reportedly eclipsing the influence of Apple's Tim Cook and Tesla's Elon Musk. His new prominence is tied to the critical role of Nvidia's chips in the AI revolution, giving him significant leverage in policy discussions, particularly concerning U.S.-China trade. Huang has successfully lobbied the Trump administration, aligning with key officials to argue against restrictive chip export policies, which recently resulted in the U.S. permitting the sale of H20 AI chips to China. This positions Huang as a key business envoy navigating complex geopolitical and technological landscapes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has strongly criticized Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, labeling him "the worst Republican Congressman" in a social media post. Trump accused the fiscally conservative lawmaker of being a guaranteed 'no' vote and an embarrassment to his state. The president announced he is actively seeking a challenger to endorse and campaign against Massie in the upcoming Republican primary. This public condemnation follows Massie's vote against the Trump-backed 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' escalating the ongoing friction between the two figures within the Republican party.</p>

          <p>A new research report suggests that a 'social populist' strategy could help Democrats win back a key demographic of working-class voters. The analysis indicates that while these voters are often socially moderate, they hold economically egalitarian views, supporting policies like a higher minimum wage, infrastructure spending, and protections for Social Security. The research identifies a specific subgroup, about 11% of working-class Trump voters, who hold these socially moderate and economically progressive views. The article argues that winning even a fraction of this group could be decisive in future elections, challenging common myths about their political inflexibility.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace could face sharp premium increases in 2026. A pandemic-era expansion of the premium tax credit, which made coverage more affordable, is set to expire at the end of 2025. President Trump's recently passed tax bill did not extend these enhanced subsidies, creating a potential 'subsidy cliff' where individuals earning just over the income threshold could lose the credit entirely. Financial experts advise affected enrollees to begin tax planning now to potentially lower their 2026 income and avoid a sudden, dramatic rise in healthcare costs. (not investment advice)</p>

Historically, private litigation has been responsible for the overwhelming majority of successful Voting Rights Act cases. This legal challenge, originating from a suggestion by Justice Neil Gorsuch, could effectively neutralize the landmark civil rights law, despite its text appearing to meet the Court's own recently established criteria for private enforcement.</p>

The analysis notes that over half of the Pentagon's budget from 2020-2024 went to private contractors, a figure that has climbed significantly. The author contends this spending enriches companies and subsidizes underperforming systems while promoting an arms race, rather than enhancing national security.

The authors contend that existing laws like HIPAA are insufficient, as they permit disclosures for legal proceedings.

          <p>A detailed report reveals the intense internal negotiations and dramatic last-minute deals required for House Republicans to pass President Trump's signature megabill. The process exposed deep divisions within the party, with leaders like Majority Whip Tom Emmer working for sleepless hours to secure votes. Ultimately, success hinged on a White House charm offensive and direct backroom deals with hard-line conservatives, who bypassed party leadership to negotiate concessions from the president. This dynamic, where holdouts leverage their votes for direct executive action, highlights a challenging power structure for House leaders and signals potential turmoil for future legislative battles.</p>

          <p>A new book, 'Together in Manzanar,' tells the true story of Elaine Buchman Yoneda, a Jewish American labor activist who faced an agonizing choice during World War II. When the U.S. government ordered the incarceration of people with Japanese ancestry, she chose to enter the Manzanar concentration camp with her half-Japanese toddler, Tommy, rather than be separated from him. The book explores the desolate and unfit conditions of the camp and the family's subsequent fight for reparations. The author connects this historical event to contemporary concerns about immigration policy and the dangers of fear-based narratives.</p>

          <p>A Montana man in addiction recovery has revealed he intentionally underreports his income to remain on Medicaid, fearing the loss of essential health coverage. After receiving a small raise, he earns slightly too much to qualify for the program but not enough to afford private insurance or his necessary medications. This dilemma, known as the 'benefit cliff,' highlights a systemic problem for low-income workers. His story provides a personal perspective on the debate around new federal rules that add work requirements and other hurdles to Medicaid, which proponents claim will reduce fraud but critics argue will harm hardworking people struggling to survive.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing a severe staffing crisis, forcing it to reassign employees from local field offices to handle long wait times on its national 800 number. While this has improved phone service, frontline workers and union representatives report that it is creating new backlogs and increasing stress at local offices, which handle vital claims processing. Experts describe the situation as 'rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic,' a consequence of a decades-long decline in staffing. With thousands of employees having recently left the agency, the SSA is struggling to serve a growing number of beneficiaries.</p>

          <p>Cities across the U.S. are celebrating the 35th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a landmark law that transformed public accessibility and civil rights for people with disabilities. The anniversary is being marked with events like parades and festivals, celebrating the progress made since 1990. However, the celebrations are tinged with anxiety for many in the disability community. Activists are expressing deep concern over pending Medicaid cuts and stricter eligibility requirements in a new federal bill, which they fear could roll back crucial support systems that enable them to live and work independently.</p>

          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico's recent threat to veto an EU sanctions package against Russia, only to reverse course at the last minute, is being analyzed as a political tactic borrowed from Hungarian leader Viktor Orban. Commentators suggest the maneuver was a 'show for the voters back home' to divert attention from domestic problems, such as a large budget deficit, a structural economic crisis, and corruption scandals. By posturing as a defender of national sovereignty against Brussels, Fico can claim victory while ultimately acceding to EU policy, a strategy that critics say alienates partners and isolates the country.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is legally challenging the Trump administration in federal court over the cancellation of $2.6 billion in research funding. The university argues the cuts are an illegal and politically motivated act of retaliation after it refused to comply with federal demands regarding admissions, student conduct, and other academic policies. The administration claims the cuts are justified because Harvard has failed to adequately combat antisemitism. A ruling in Harvard's favor could restore hundreds of critical research projects and set a precedent for other universities facing similar financial pressure from the government.</p>

Global donors have so far committed only half of the estimated $75 billion required over the next two years, making further financial support critical.
