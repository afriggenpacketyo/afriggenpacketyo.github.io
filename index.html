          <h2>Newark Airport Grapples with Staffing Shortages and Equipment Failures, Leading to Significant Flight Delays</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is facing a severe staffing shortage among air traffic controllers, with as few as one or two fully certified controllers on duty during shifts that require 14. This shortage, coupled with recent radar outages caused by outdated software and hardware, has resulted in extensive flight delays, impacting travelers significantly. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that the FAA is working to update infrastructure and reduce flights to alleviate the issues, but training new controllers takes years. United Airlines, which operates the majority of flights at Newark, assured customers that all flights remain safe despite the FAA-related challenges. The situation has prompted some travelers to consider using alternative airports in the New York area. </p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is launching an emergency task force, comprising experts from the FAA, Verizon, and L3Harris, to address ongoing telecommunications issues at Newark Liberty International Airport. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy attributed the recent disruptions to the previous administration's mishandling of air traffic control relocation and the aging telecommunications system. The FAA is also considering temporary flight reductions at Newark to alleviate delays, with discussions planned with airlines to propose flight cuts. United Airlines previously announced its own reductions. Duffy stated that the FAA is working to replace copper lines with fiber lines and is requesting an investigation into past decisions linked to the equipment failures. </p>

          <p>A Democratic National Committee panel has recommended redoing the election of David Hogg and Malcolm Kenyatta as party vice-chairs, citing violations of the party's charter during the initial vote in February. The resolution stems from a challenge by Kalyn Free, who lost to Hogg and alleges that the DNC improperly combined two questions, disadvantaging female candidates. This development occurs amidst separate controversy surrounding Hogg's efforts to primary some Democratic politicians, with his group Leaders We Deserve planning to spend $20 million. DNC Chair Ken Martin expressed disappointment over the procedural error and expects DNC members to resolve the matter fairly. Hogg argues the DNC is trying to remove him due to his work to reform the party. </p>

These changes aim to align North America with the rest of the world, where total ticket prices are already displayed upfront.

During his visits, Xi emphasized China's commitment to resisting external "unilateral bullying" and safeguarding the shared Asian home. For China's vision of lasting trust to materialize, it must prioritize openness, consistency, and multilateral dialogue in its interactions with ASEAN countries. </p>

The request follows an incident at the Bluebonnet Detention Facility where a group of migrants barricaded themselves, threatened hostages, and attempted to flood the unit. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the migrants pose a danger and should be deported, even while detained. The administration is invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely used wartime powers law, to deport the migrants, a move that has faced legal challenges and scrutiny from human rights organizations. </p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged by over 40% in the past year, reaching record highs due to factors such as unpredictable US trade policies, geopolitical instability, and fears of inflation. While gold is often seen as a safe haven asset, its price is not immune to fluctuations, and past surges have been followed by significant falls. Central banks are increasingly buying gold to diversify their reserves, partly due to fears of weaponization of the dollar system. Experts are divided on whether the upward trend will continue, with some forecasting further price increases and others warning of a potential market bubble. (not investment advice) </p>

GLP-1 drugs are effective at reducing visceral fat and improving metabolic health, making them most beneficial for individuals with excess visceral fat already suffering its consequences. Doctors need better ways to identify these individuals, as BMI is a poor measure, and must consider the long-term implications and unanswered questions surrounding GLP-1 use. </p>

          <p>Republicans on Capitol Hill have responded with jokes and avoidance to reports that President Donald Trump is considering accepting a luxury jet from the Qatari government for use as Air Force One. Senator Cynthia Lummis initially claimed she didn't know enough about the story to comment but laughed when told that Trump intended to use the gifted plane as Air Force One, stating it might make her reconsider the appropriateness of that. Senator Josh Hawley quipped that it would be better if the jet were made in the United States. House Speaker Mike Johnson declined to comment, citing a lack of information. </p>
