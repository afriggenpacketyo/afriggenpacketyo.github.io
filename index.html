        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the changing beauty standards for women in America, noting a shift from prioritizing thinness to embracing strength. It references three new books that examine this phenomenon: Casey Johnstonâ€™s memoir on weightlifting, Amy Laroccaâ€™s exploration of the wellness imperative, and Bonnie Tsuiâ€™s analysis of the cultural symbolism of muscles. The article highlights how the ideal woman has transformed from simply being skinny to being "well," relentlessly optimizing her health through various wellness practices. Despite this shift, the pressure to optimize remains, with women now focusing on achieving a muscular physique while still facing anxieties about body image. The author argues that while strength training can be empowering, it doesn't necessarily break the hold of societal pressures to optimize one's body. </p>

          <p>The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has fined DNA testing firm 23andMe Â£2.31 million following a 2023 data breach. The ICO stated that 23andMe failed to implement adequate security measures to protect sensitive user data, leading to the exposure of personal information, family histories, and health conditions. The breach, a "credential stuffing" attack, allowed hackers to access 14,000 accounts and download data relating to approximately 6.9 million linked individuals. While DNA records were not compromised, the stolen data included names, birth years, geographical information, profile images, race, ethnicity, health reports, and family trees of 155,592 UK residents. </p>

          <p>Downing Street has acknowledged a worsening situation regarding small boat crossings in the English Channel, ahead of a UK-France summit focused on border security. Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have agreed to collaborate closely to address the crossings, with migration set to be a key discussion point during Macron's upcoming state visit. Official figures indicate a significant increase in migrant crossings, with over 1,500 people arriving in small boats last week, pushing the year's total above 16,000, a 42% increase compared to the same period last year. Despite increased funding to France for border security, interception rates remain below 58%. </p>

          <p>Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley praised his officers for their quick actions in apprehending Vance Boelter, the suspect in the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers. An off-duty sergeant's awareness of the shooting at Sen. John Hoffman's home led to officers checking on Rep. Melissa Hortman's residence, where they found Boelter's car. Bruley believes that seizing Boelter's vehicle, which contained maps, names, and weaponry, likely prevented further attacks. Boelter is accused of killing Hortman and her husband and shooting Hoffman and his wife in separate incidents, allegedly impersonating a law enforcement officer. </p>

          <p>JetBlue Airways is implementing additional cost-cutting measures due to weaker-than-expected travel demand, making a break-even operating margin for 2025 unlikely. CEO Joanna Geraghty informed staff that the airline is relying on borrowed cash to maintain operations, prompting further reductions in off-peak flights and unprofitable routes. JetBlue will also postpone plans to retrofit older Airbus A320 jets and is evaluating hiring plans, potentially combining leadership roles and reducing travel spending. The airline hopes demand will rebound, but the recovery is not expected to fully offset losses incurred this year, extending the timeline for a return to profitability. </p>

          <p>Dame Louise Casey has advocated for a national inquiry into grooming gangs to serve as a "national reset" on the issue. This follows her report on group-based child sexual assault in England and Wales, prompting Sir Keir Starmer to announce the inquiry. Casey urged those giving evidence to be open to scrutiny and change, suggesting the inquiry could be completed within three years. She also addressed concerns about the ethnicity of perpetrators, emphasizing the need to "keep calm" and accurately interrogate data. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has committed to following the report's recommendations, including charging adults who engage in penetrative sex with a child under 16 with sexual assault. </p>

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Development Bank, proposed by China in 2010, is gaining momentum due to rising geopolitical tensions and Russia's strategic shift to Asia. China's Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang emphasized the bank proposal, along with initiatives for local currency settlement and digital finance, during a meeting with SCO finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Beijing.

          <p>President Trump has reversed his recent decision to pause Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids at farms and hotels, ordering the agency to resume operations in those sectors. The reversal comes after a brief reprieve secured by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins amid industry pressure, which was then overruled by immigration hardliners. The administration aims to increase daily arrests to meet a target of 3,000, and workplace raids are seen as a means to achieve this goal. The decision reflects internal divisions within the administration over immigration policy and the economic impact of deportations. </p>
