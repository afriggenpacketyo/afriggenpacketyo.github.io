        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares in German sportswear company Puma experienced a significant drop after it revised its full-year financial forecast, anticipating a notable decline in sales. The company attributed the negative outlook to several challenges, including the impact of U.S. trade tariffs, which are expected to negatively affect gross profit by approximately 80 million euros. In response, Puma plans to reduce imports from China and implement price increases later in the year. The firm's CEO acknowledged that internal shortcomings also contributed to the downturn, signaling a need for a broader brand reset to address performance issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A five-day strike by resident doctors has commenced in England, prompting Health Secretary Wes Streeting to assure the public that efforts are being made to maintain NHS services. Unlike previous walkouts that focused solely on emergency care, NHS England has instructed hospitals to continue non-urgent services where possible, with senior doctors providing cover. The British Medical Association (BMA) has warned this could stretch staff too thinly, reiterating that the strike is a last resort in their long-running pay dispute. The union argues that despite recent pay rises, doctors' real-term pay has fallen significantly since 2008.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is under increasing pressure to grant official recognition to a Palestinian state, a move amplified by France's recent commitment to do so. A report from the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, supported by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs, described statehood as an "inalienable right" that should not be conditional. While Starmer has called the right to statehood inalienable, his government's official position is to reserve recognition for when it can best support a long-term political solution. The debate intensifies amid warnings of mass starvation and a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Georges Abdallah, a Lebanese militant who became a symbol for the far-left Palestinian cause, has been freed by France after serving 41 years in prison. Abdallah was convicted in 1987 for his complicity in the murders of an American and an Israeli diplomat in Paris. Despite being eligible for parole since 1999, his release was repeatedly denied, allegedly due to pressure from the U.S. and Israel. A French court ultimately ruled that his continued detention was disproportionate, and he was immediately expelled to Lebanon upon his release, which was hailed as a victory by his supporters.</p>

          <p>NASA is currently grappling with a period of significant instability, marked by budget constraints, high-level staff departures, and growing employee discontent. A group of over 360 current and former employees has formally protested what they describe as "rapid and wasteful changes" that are undermining the agency's mission. The space agency has been without a permanent administrator for months and is facing potential budget trims in the coming years. These challenges have raised concerns about the future of key research projects and NASA's ability to maintain its role as a leader in space exploration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>First-hand accounts from Gaza reveal a desperate struggle for survival as a severe hunger crisis deepens across the territory. Displaced Palestinians describe their days as being consumed by the search for food, with basic items like bread becoming unaffordable luxuries. The scarcity has caused food prices to surge, and residents report significant weight loss and fainting from hunger. International aid organizations have sounded the alarm, stating that a large portion of the population is starving and that aid deliveries are falling far short of what is needed to prevent a full-blown humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

          <p>Former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker is making his return to the octagon nine months after suffering a gruesome jaw injury during a fight. The injury, caused by a face crank submission, resulted in his bottom teeth caving in and required surgery to remove several teeth and install dental implants. Whittaker, who is now ranked fifth in the division, says the experience was painful but that his life is much better after the corrective surgery. He is set to face Dutch middleweight Reinier de Ridder in Abu Dhabi, stating that his motivation is now driven by setting an example for his children.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize Palestine as a state, with the decision to be formalized at the UN General Assembly in September. The move makes France the largest Western power to take this step and adds significant diplomatic pressure on Israel amid the ongoing war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The Palestinian Authority welcomed the decision as a reflection of France's commitment to international law. In contrast, Israel's Prime Minister condemned the move, arguing it rewards terror, while the United States also stated its strong rejection of the plan.</p>

          <p>The chief executive of England's Football Association, Mark Bullingham, has stated that there is no need to expand the powers of the video assistant referee (VAR) system. This position comes amid reports that football's law-making body, IFAB, might consider proposals to use VAR for decisions on corner kicks and second yellow cards. Bullingham argued that the current model already causes enough interruptions to the flow of the game. As the FA holds a key vote on IFAB, its opposition makes any significant expansion of VAR's scope less likely in the near future.</p>

          <p>Ranchers in southern Mexico are struggling to contain an outbreak of the New World screwworm, a parasite whose flesh-eating larvae infect livestock. The rapid spread of the parasite in states like Chiapas has prompted the United States to suspend all cattle imports from Mexico over fears of it crossing the border. The outbreak has caused the price of veterinary medicines to soar, forcing some ranchers to use ineffective home remedies. While a U.S.-supported facility to produce sterile flies for eradication is being built, it will not be operational until next year, leaving the agricultural sector vulnerable.</p>
