          <p>PayPal is introducing a 3.7% annual yield on PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin holdings for users on PayPal and Venmo, starting this summer. This initiative aims to incentivize the use of PYUSD within the PayPal ecosystem, enabling users to transact, make international transfers, and purchase goods. This move positions PayPal as a major player in the stablecoin market, which is currently dominated by Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC, and seeks to promote the use of stablecoins for payments and commerce.

          <p>President Trump's hints at delaying 25% auto tariffs to encourage US vehicle production are complex, as relocating production lines takes years and is costly. An additional 25% auto parts tariff is scheduled to take effect by May 3, which would raise vehicle costs even if assembled in the US. Automakers are aiming to maximize production at existing facilities, as constructing new plants requires significant time for planning, construction, and establishing supply chains, potentially taking several years. </p>

          <p>Thomas Partey's future with Arsenal is uncertain as contract negotiations stall, but the arrival of sporting director Andrea Berta may influence the decision. Berta has a long-standing relationship with Partey from their time at Atletico Madrid, where Berta sanctioned Partey's move to Arsenal. Arsenal is also considering the potential arrival of Martin Zubimendi, which could affect Partey's role in the team. Partey's injury record and age are factors in the decision, with interest from Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, and Saudi Arabia.</p>

Reeves affirmed that the UK would not compromise on food standards, addressing a key sticking point in past negotiations.
