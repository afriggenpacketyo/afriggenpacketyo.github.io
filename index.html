          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 16:27:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent deadly flash floods in Texas and other states highlight significant gaps in the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) flood maps. These maps, crucial for insurance and building codes, often exclude risks from intense rainfall and smaller waterways, and can be outdated due to political pressure and slow update cycles. Advanced modeling and data available on real estate sites show a much higher risk for many properties than official maps indicate, suggesting a growing awareness gap that the federal government needs to address.</p>

          <p>A Republican congressman has described the handling of a controversy at San Jose State University as "highly disturbing." The issue involves a transgender volleyball player who was accused of conspiring to injure a teammate, with the conference allegedly using the same law firm for both the investigation and the athlete's legal defense. The lawmaker criticized institutions for failing to protect female athletes and respond adequately when safety risks materialize. The affected teammate has called for accountability, stating that Title IX was meant to protect women.</p>

          <p>Tesla is defending its Autopilot system in a Miami federal court in the company's first wrongful death trial to proceed. The lawsuit stems from a 2019 crash where a Model S using Autopilot struck a parked vehicle, killing a 22-year-old woman and severely injuring her boyfriend. The plaintiffs argue that defects in the Autopilot system failed to detect the obstacle, while Tesla maintains the crash was caused by a distracted driver who was speeding and overrode the car's systems.</p>

          <p>England fast bowler Jofra Archer made a successful and impactful return to Test cricket after being sidelined for 1,597 days due to multiple injuries. In the dramatic third Test victory against India, Archer took five wickets and demonstrated sustained pace, dismissing a key batsman on the final day to help secure the win. Reflecting on his long journey back, Archer acknowledged the difficulty and the doubts he faced, but his performance has been hailed as a hugely encouraging comeback for the England team.</p>

Proponents argue it will bolster investor trust and U.S. competitiveness, while some critics worry it could compromise crypto's decentralized nature and enable corruption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is asking a federal appeals court to overturn a judge's order that restricted immigration enforcement tactics in seven Southern California counties. A lower court had issued a temporary restraining order barring "roving patrols" and finding that agents could not use race or language as a pretext for enforcement. The Department of Justice argues the injunction inflicts "irreparable harm" by preventing the executive branch from enforcing immigration laws, escalating a fierce legal battle over the administration's aggressive sweeps.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's abrupt reversal on his promise to release a list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients, arguing that the move may have finally strained the credulity of his most ardent followers. The Epstein saga holds a central place in the MAGA worldview, and Trump's flimsy excuse for not releasing the files—claiming they are now Democratic disinformation—contradicts years of promises. The author suggests this particular reversal is uniquely damaging because the issue is more visceral and foundational to his base's conspiracy theories than typical policy matters.</p>
