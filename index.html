          <h2>Trump's Trade Tariffs Lead to Export Slump Across U.S. Ports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 09:54:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New trade data indicates that President Trump's tariffs have significantly impacted U.S. exports, with nearly all U.S. exports experiencing declines. The agricultural sector has been particularly hard hit, with key products like soybeans, corn, and beef struggling to reach global markets. Ports such as Portland, Oregon, and Tacoma, Washington, have seen substantial export decreases, raising concerns about a potential "crisis" for farmers. The decline in exports is also linked to a drop in containerships arriving in the U.S., as businesses cancel manufacturing orders in response to rising costs and trade disruptions.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed a minimum 20% reduction in the number of four-star generals and admirals across the military. The directive, outlined in a memo to senior Pentagon leadership, aims to streamline leadership and optimize the military's effectiveness by removing unnecessary bureaucratic layers. Hegseth emphasized the need to shift resources from bloated headquarters to warfighters, questioning the necessity of the current number of top military officers compared to previous eras. The cuts are expected to be carried out expeditiously, though a specific timeline was not provided in the memo.</p>

          <p>Labour MPs are reportedly expressing significant anger and frustration following the party's poor performance in recent local elections. A key point of contention is the means-testing of the winter fuel allowance, which many MPs believe harmed Labour's standing with voters. While government sources deny any plans to reverse the winter fuel policy, debate is also focusing on welfare reforms, particularly changes to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) eligibility. Some Labour MPs feel the party needs to better communicate its strategic direction to avoid internal disaffection and shore up support from progressive voters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study suggests that the Haenyeo, female divers from Jeju Island in South Korea, may have developed genetic adaptations due to their generations-long diving practices. Researchers found that the Haenyeo exhibit lower blood pressure and enhanced cold-water tolerance, potentially protecting pregnant divers from high blood pressure complications. These adaptations, along with a non-genetic adaptation of a slower heart rate, could offer insights for developing new medical treatments. The Haenyeo's evolution highlights how cultural practices can drive genetic changes in isolated populations, similar to observations made by Darwin in the Galapagos Islands.</p>

While some faced denazification processes, they often received commissions for public spaces and memorials, raising questions about how German society dealt with its Nazi past.

This change could disproportionately affect Republican-led states, as their Medicaid budgets tend to rely more heavily on the medical provider tax strategy.

          <p>Over two dozen pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested at the University of Washington after occupying an engineering building and setting dumpsters on fire. The protest group, Super UW, demanded that the university sever ties with Boeing, citing the aerospace company's military contracts with Israel. The university condemned the occupation and an unspecified "antisemitic statement" made by a suspended student group, while Super UW called for the building to be renamed after a teenage engineering student killed in Gaza. The incident signals a potential resurgence of pro-Palestinian activism on US university campuses.</p>

          <p>Experts predict savings account interest rates will remain steady in May 2025, as the Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut rates at its upcoming meeting. However, rates could fall later in the year if the Fed implements projected rate cuts, though the decrease is expected to be small. Some experts suggest that savings account rates could rise if tariffs increase, potentially leading to higher inflation. To maximize savings, it is recommended to choose high-yield savings accounts and consider short-term CDs. (not investment advice)</p>
