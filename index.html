          <p>A devastating fire engulfed a recently opened shopping mall in the Iraqi city of Kut, leading to the deaths of at least 61 people. Officials reported that most victims died from suffocation, with many found in the building's bathrooms, and a significant number of bodies were burned beyond recognition. The regional governor has declared the incident a "tragedy and a calamity," promising legal action against the mall's owner. An investigation into the cause, suspected to be an exploded air conditioner, is underway, highlighting ongoing concerns about safety standards in the country.</p>

          <p>Andre Correa do Lago, the president for the upcoming UN climate talks, discusses the difficulty of maintaining focus on climate change amid global conflicts and political shifts. He emphasizes that despite wars and trade disputes, the threat of climate change is progressively worsening, as evidenced by recent extreme weather events worldwide. The article highlights the pressure on Brazil to drive progress on transitioning from fossil fuels, even as the country's own oil exploration policies face scrutiny. Correa do Lago remains pragmatic, stressing the need for a new economic model that integrates climate action to achieve global goals.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking second-quarter profit, with a nearly 61% year-on-year increase fueled by sustained demand for artificial intelligence chips. The company's revenue, primarily driven by its high-performance computing division which serves clients like Nvidia and Apple, also surpassed market expectations. TSMC projects continued strong growth into 2025, with revenue expected to rise by about 30%. However, the company acknowledges potential risks from potential U.S. tariff policies and existing export controls affecting its business with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is displaying signs of a slowdown, according to the latest official statistics. The unemployment rate has climbed to a four-year high of 4.7%, while the annual rate of wage growth has decreased to 5%. These indicators, coupled with a continuous decline in job vacancies, suggest that businesses are reducing hiring, partly in response to a recent rise in national insurance contributions. Economists suggest this weakening labor market could increase the likelihood of the Bank of England implementing an interest rate cut to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

For the first time since 1896, no Welsh players will be featured in a Lions Test squad against a major southern hemisphere team. This decision comes despite Morgan's strong performances on the tour and underscores a period of decline for the national team, which recently ended an 18-match losing streak.

          <p>Elon Musk's xAI is facing increased opposition to its supercomputer facility in Memphis, as civil rights and environmental groups appeal a permit allowing the use of natural gas-burning turbines. The Southern Environmental Law Center, representing the NAACP and others, argues the Shelby County Health Department improperly issued the permit and ignored residents' complaints about pollution in nearby majority-Black communities. The groups contend the turbines, which emit pollutants like nitrogen oxides, were miscategorized to bypass stricter regulations under the Clean Air Act. In response, xAI called the appeal a "baseless, politically driven" action and maintained its compliance with all laws.</p>

          <p>The UK's new Labour government is facing criticism for what some MPs describe as a "petty and vindictive" move to sack four of its own parliamentarians. The MPs had the party whip removed, effectively expelling them from the parliamentary party, for repeatedly organizing against the government's position on welfare bills. Downing Street defended the decision as a necessary step to enforce discipline and authority within the party. However, some Labour figures argue the move shows weakness and will lower morale, contrasting with the prime minister's recent efforts to engage more closely with his MPs.</p>

          <p>The rise of AI-generated music, exemplified by the viral success of a synthetic psychedelic rock "band" called The Velvet Sundown, is causing significant concern within the music industry. While AI tools have been used in production for years, new platforms allow for the easy creation of entire songs, which are now flooding streaming services and generating revenue. This has prompted major record labels to sue AI companies for copyright infringement and has left human artists feeling discouraged. The article explores the industry's struggle to adapt, with debates raging over copyright, transparency, and the future of human creativity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated his ambition to sell more advanced semiconductors to China, following the recent reversal of a ban on its H20 AI chip. Speaking in Beijing, Huang argued that as technology evolves, it is sensible for the chips available to the Chinese market to improve over time as well. Nvidia has been navigating complex U.S. export controls that have restricted its access to the world's second-largest economy, forcing it to develop compliant, less-advanced chips. The comments come as the U.S. government appears to favor a strategy of keeping China reliant on American technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. air traffic controllers argue that a new push to modernize equipment fails to address deeper systemic problems plaguing the nation's air traffic system. While officials are focusing on technology upgrades and hiring, controllers point to critical issues like chronic staffing shortages, grueling six-day workweeks, stagnating pay, and low morale. According to the article, many controllers feel that the current response is demoralizing because it overlooks the immediate quality-of-life concerns that lead to fatigue and stress. The FAA has fewer than 11,000 certified controllers, over 3,000 short of its target, forcing mandatory overtime to keep the system running.</p>

In response, the 7-Eleven operator expressed disappointment and disputed the Canadian firm's statements.
