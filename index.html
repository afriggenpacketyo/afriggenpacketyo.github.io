          <p>Asia-Pacific markets declined, tracking Wall Street's downturn, after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that equity prices are "fairly highly valued" and the rate-cutting path remains uncertain. This assessment, combined with ongoing doubts about the sustainability of the artificial intelligence bull trend, fueled investor concerns across the region. Despite this, South Korean defense stocks defied the weakness, posting gains following President Trump's expressed support for Ukraine and NATO, with South Korea emerging as a key military supplier. Meanwhile, Hong Kong prepared for Super Typhoon Ragasa, and Australia's August CPI rose above economist estimates, presenting a complex economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article fact-checks several inaccurate claims made by President Donald Trump concerning autism, Tylenol use during pregnancy, and childhood vaccinations. Trump suggested a link between Tylenol and autism, contradicting extensive medical evidence, and falsely claimed Amish children do not get vaccines or autism, which studies have disproven, attributing lower rates to underreporting. The article also debunks his assertions about the quantity and size of childhood vaccines and the necessity of the Hepatitis B vaccine for newborns. Medical experts emphasize that no studies have shown a causal link between Tylenol or vaccines and autism, highlighting the critical role of vaccination for public health and disease prevention.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that Beijing's decennial parade transcends mere spectacle, holding profound significance for Hong Kong and Macau when examined through the perspectives of national destiny and institutional resilience. It argues that the event is a powerful declaration of deep national cohesion among the Chinese people, fostering an emotional release and resonance with the nation’s trajectory, rather than a shallow patriotic show. The author suggests that a Western-centric viewpoint often overlooks this deeper cultural and political importance, emphasizing the parade's role in unifying individuals and showcasing collective strength in a fragmented world.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Guardians player David Fry suffered a distressing injury when he was hit in the face by a 99-mph fastball during a bunt attempt in a game against the Detroit Tigers. The powerful impact left Fry bleeding from his nose and forced him off the field, while Tigers pitcher Tarik Skubal was visibly distraught by the incident. Despite the severity, the play was ruled a foul ball because it made contact with the bat first. The game resumed, and the Tigers' pitcher subsequently committed a wild pitch and a balk, allowing the Guardians to tie and then take a crucial lead in a game with significant playoff implications.</p>

          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel returned to "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after a week-long suspension by ABC, which followed comments he made criticizing President Donald Trump's MAGA movement in connection with conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing. The show's comeback sparked considerable public interest, drawing both protesters and supporters to the Hollywood studio where it is taped.

          <p>Chicago Cubs third baseman Matt Shaw publicly defended his decision to miss a crucial playoff-implication game to attend the funeral of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, expressing "no regrets" and attributing his choice to strong faith. Shaw, who had formed a bond with Kirk over their shared Christian beliefs, was personally invited by Kirk's widow. His absence from the game, which the Cubs lost, could not be filled as he was ineligible for the bereavement list. The decision drew varied public reactions, including criticism from a Mets announcer who found it "weird" to miss a game during a playoff race for non-family emergencies.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced a significant shift in his position on the war in Ukraine, stating that Kyiv can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" with support from Europe and NATO, citing Russia's economic troubles. This statement, made after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and shared on Truth Social, marks a departure from his previous warnings that Ukraine might need to cede territory. Zelenskyy welcomed the "big shift" as a positive signal, indicating a potential for more weapons and air defenses.

          <p>Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust has been forced to repay nearly £5 million after wrongly claiming its maternity services met safe care and staffing standards to qualify for the Maternity Incentive Scheme. An investigation by NHS Resolution, prompted by a damning Care Quality Commission report, found the care to be inadequate and posing "significant risk" to mothers and babies. Families affected by poor care are now demanding a full, independent inquiry into the trust's maternity services. Although the trust has since been allocated £2.1 million from a separate fund for improvements, the incident highlights systemic issues in self-reporting and accountability within the NHS.</p>

The investigation began when U.S. Customs and Border Protection detected Cesium-137 in an imported shipment from Indonesia.

          <p>A growing number of young adults in the UK, exemplified by Leoni Clancey, are finding independent living increasingly unattainable due to soaring housing and utility costs. Research from the Skipton Group reveals that nine out of ten young adults residing with their parents would face living costs consuming nearly half their income if they moved out. This financial burden is compelling many to return home after initial attempts at independence, contributing to a significant rise in adults living with parents since 2011. Industry experts and advocacy groups stress the urgent need for more affordable housing options and comprehensive support to address this pervasive generational challenge.</p>

          <p>The dismembered body parts of an unknown woman found in Oregon in April 1946 are now believed to be those of "Oak Grove Jane Doe," the state's oldest unidentified person case. The remains, initially discovered in burlap sacks along the Willamette River, were found under a headstone reading "Unknown Woman 1946" at a cemetery, thanks to the Oregon state police medical examiner’s Human Identification Program. Investigators determined she died from blunt force trauma to the head, and the case went cold in the 1950s after critical evidence went missing. Advanced forensic testing is now hoped to restore her identity after nearly 80 years.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, the most powerful tropical cyclone this year, has severely impacted Hong Kong with hurricane-force winds and torrential rain, leading authorities to issue the highest warning signal. In Taiwan, the typhoon's outer rim caused heavy downpours and an overflowing barrier lake, tragically resulting in 14 deaths. Hong Kong experienced deserted roads, surging waves, and widespread panic buying as residents braced for the storm, taping windows and seeking refuge in shelters. The typhoon is projected to maintain its intensity as it heads towards China's Guangdong province, where over 770,000 people have already been evacuated as a precautionary measure.</p>

          <p>Liverpool striker Hugo Ekitike was sent off during a Carabao Cup match against Southampton after receiving a second yellow card for removing his shirt during a goal celebration. His manager, Arne Slot, criticized the action as "stupid" and "not smart," especially given Ekitike had already been booked. The sending-off means Ekitike will be suspended for an upcoming Premier League game, a blow for Liverpool as he has been in excellent form since his £69m signing. Ekitike later apologized on social media, acknowledging his emotions got the better of him, and Slot expressed confidence that the young player would learn from the incident.</p>

As a professor emeritus at NYU School of Law and founder of its US-Asia Law Institute, Cohen profoundly influenced global discussions on China's legal system, trade, and human rights for over six decades. He was the first American to practice law in Communist China and was renowned for his groundbreaking writings on Chinese criminal procedure and international law. Cohen built a reputation as both an advocate for Chinese dissidents and a proponent of continued engagement with Beijing, leaving a towering impact on the field.</p>

          <p>Following Kamala Harris's loss in the last presidential election, spurious allegations of fraud, mirroring those after the 2020 election, are flourishing online, according to election experts. These claims, which often rely on elaborate but flawed statistical analyses and unsubstantiated narratives, suggest that fraud helped President Trump win. One popular theory, propagated by an anonymous Substack, alleges an NSA audit found Harris won, citing a former CIA officer whose claims lack evidence. Experts emphasize that state-level audits are public and reliable, debunking these theories as poorly constructed and often financially motivated, similar to previous "Big Lie" narratives.</p>

          <p>This analytical article questions the sincerity and implications of President Donald Trump's abrupt reversal on Ukraine policy, where he now suggests Kyiv can "win all of Ukraine back." This shift, made after meeting with Ukrainian and French leaders, contradicts his previous deference to Putin and warnings for Ukraine to cede territory. The article posits that Trump's change might stem from humiliation by Putin or be a tactic to disengage from the conflict, rather than a genuine commitment to strengthening Ukraine. It notes his statements lacked concrete action items for increased aid, suggesting a potential move towards normalizing relations with Russia while appearing tough.</p>

Inspired by a new mother whose baby was disturbed by blaring streaming ads, the legislation aims to prohibit streaming services like Hulu and Netflix from playing commercials louder than their programming. While the federal CALM Act already regulates broadcast and cable TV ads, it doesn't cover streaming. The streaming industry initially opposed the bill due to control issues but became neutral after an amendment removed the right for private parties to sue, relying instead on regulatory enforcement.</p>

These employees, who managed government workspaces, are being asked to return after a seven-month paid leave, during which the GSA faced understaffing and accrued high costs due to prematurely terminated or expired leases. Democrats criticize the "indiscriminate" approach, arguing it created costly confusion without delivering savings.
