          <p>Four U.S. Army soldiers remain missing after their armored recovery vehicle sank in a Lithuanian swamp during a training exercise.  Recovery efforts are hampered by the vehicle's weight and the challenging terrain.  The U.S. Army is committed to finding the soldiers, and Lithuanian and Polish forces are assisting in the rescue operation.  The proximity to Belarus, a Russian ally, adds a layer of geopolitical context, although the incident itself appears to be an accident.  Bias: Fox News's framing of the story might subtly emphasize the challenges faced by the military, potentially downplaying any potential systemic issues contributing to the accident.</p>
