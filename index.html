          <p>Diplomatic efforts to end the war in Gaza are intensifying as a U.S. special envoy meets with Qatar's prime minister in Spain. The discussion centers on a new joint Egyptian-Qatari proposal aimed at securing the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas in exchange for an end to the war and a full Israeli military withdrawal. This meeting occurs amid growing international condemnation of Israel's plan for a military takeover of Gaza City, with several nations and humanitarian groups warning of a worsening catastrophic situation for civilians. The fate of the approximately 50 hostages still in Gaza remains a critical and sensitive point in the negotiations.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that any peace negotiations conducted without Ukraine's participation will result in "dead solutions." His comments come in response to a planned bilateral summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss ending the war. Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and rejected any potential "swapping of territories" suggested by President Trump. European leaders have echoed this sentiment, issuing a joint statement that the path to peace cannot be decided without Ukraine's involvement.</p>

          <p>Authorities report that the gunman who attacked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta believed a COVID-19 vaccine had made him depressed and suicidal. The suspect, Patrick Joseph White, fired dozens of rounds into CDC buildings before killing DeKalb County police officer David Rose in a confrontation. White was later found dead, though it is unclear if he was killed by police or died by suicide. The incident has drawn attention to the rising hostility toward public health institutions and workers, fueled by vaccine misinformation.</p>

          <p>American fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following controversy over a sandal design created in collaboration with Adidas. Mexican officials from the state of Oaxaca complained that the "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe culturally appropriated a traditional huarache sandal unique to the region. The Mexican government is seeking compensation, highlighting a recurring issue of fashion brands using Indigenous designs without proper partnership or credit. Adidas has expressed a desire to meet with Oaxacan officials to discuss repairing the damage caused to the Indigenous communities.</p>

This surge followed CEO Tim Cook's visit to the White House, where he announced plans to invest $100 billion in American companies and components over the next four years. President Trump indicated that this commitment to U.S. manufacturing would exempt Apple from potential future tariffs on imported chips.

A 19-year-old was the intended target, while an 18-year-old woman and a 65-year-old man were also wounded. A 17-year-old suspect was quickly taken into custody, and a firearm was recovered from the scene of the crime.</p>

          <p>Legendary New York Yankees pitcher and Hall of Famer Mariano Rivera reportedly suffered a significant injury during the team's annual Old-Timers' Day game. The 55-year-old is believed to have injured his Achilles, an issue first revealed by former teammate Roger Clemens during a radio broadcast. The injury occurred after Rivera had a highlight moment, hitting a single off fellow Yankees icon Andy Pettite. The event was organized to commemorate the Yankees' 2000 World Series victory, a team on which all three players were key members.</p>

Bowman cited "signs of fragility in labor market conditions" and slowing economic growth as reasons to begin gradually moving policy toward a more neutral stance. She argued that inflation has moved considerably closer to the Fed's target and that a proactive rate cut would hedge against risks of further economic weakening. Her comments highlight a division within the Federal Reserve on the appropriate path for monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's justice secretary has announced a new plan that would see foreign nationals who receive a custodial sentence face immediate deportation. Under the proposal, criminals with fixed-term sentences would be removed from the UK right away and barred from re-entry, with their home country deciding if they serve any remaining prison time. The government argues this would save taxpayer money and protect the public, as foreign offenders constitute about 12% of the prison population. Critics, however, have questioned the plan's feasibility, warning that some countries may refuse to accept the deported individuals.</p>

In a joint statement, the nations accused Israel of violating international law and attempting to entrench its occupation of the territory. The plan, approved by Israel's Security Cabinet, has faced widespread international criticism and has even been questioned by Israel's own army chief. The strong, unified condemnation from the region signals deepening diplomatic tensions over the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>The Canyon Fire, a fast-moving wildfire near Los Angeles, has burned nearly 5,400 acres and forced the evacuation of thousands of residents. The blaze, fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions, spread rapidly since igniting on Thursday. A Kern County firefighter suffered serious injuries after his truck rolled over a ridge while battling the flames. While firefighters have made some progress, achieving 28% containment by Saturday morning, the fire remains active, and authorities are urging residents to remain on high alert as high temperatures persist in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump, framing himself as a "peacemaker-in-chief," is confronting immense challenges in his efforts to negotiate ends to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Despite some successes in brokering other international agreements, these two bloody conflicts have so far resisted his dealmaking efforts. His approach to Ukraine, which includes a direct summit with Vladimir Putin that excludes Kyiv, has caused alarm among allies. In Gaza, his administration's support for Israel is being strained by the worsening humanitarian crisis, highlighting the complex and volatile nature of these diplomatic undertakings.</p>

The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed that Prasad was resuming his position at the FDA's request.

          <p>The portrayal of Kashmir in India's Bollywood film industry has dramatically shifted over the decades, reflecting the region's changing political landscape. Initially depicted as a scenic, romantic paradise in the post-independence era, Kashmir's image in cinema transformed with the rise of armed insurgency in the late 1980s. Films began to frame the region as a conflict zone, often focusing on themes of patriotism and militancy. More recent films, such as "The Kashmir Files" and "Article 370," have been criticized for aligning with government narratives and potentially deepening sectarian divides.</p>

          <p>In excerpts from her upcoming memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has denied the existence of a conspiracy to ruin her predecessor and mentor, Alex Salmond. She accuses Salmond, who was cleared of sexual offense charges in 2020 but died last year, of being willing to destroy the Scottish National Party (SNP) rather than see it succeed without him. Sturgeon writes that Salmond wanted her to intervene in a government investigation into his "inappropriate" behavior towards women. Her refusal, she claims, led to the inevitable and "mortal political combat" between them.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's decision to temporarily halt exports of certain military equipment to Israel for use in Gaza has been met with significant criticism from within his own conservative political alliance. Some members of the CDU/CSU coalition argue the move breaks with Germany's long-standing policy of special responsibility toward Israel. However, the decision has also received support from other conservatives and the junior coalition partner, the Social Democrats. The move reflects growing international concern over Israel's military operations and the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip.</p>
