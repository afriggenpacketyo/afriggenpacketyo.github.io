          <p>House Republicans are set to vote on a comprehensive bill aiming to advance President Trump's domestic agenda. The legislation includes extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts, eliminating taxes on tips and overtime, increasing the child tax credit, and raising the standard deduction. It also addresses the state and local tax deduction (SALT) cap, Medicaid work requirements, and reforms to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

          <p>Emerging markets stocks are gaining traction as the 'sell U.S.' narrative strengthens, driven by Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Bank of America analysts suggest emerging markets are 'the next bull market,' citing a weaker U.S. dollar, peaking U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery. JPMorgan has also upgraded emerging market equities, pointing to easing U.S.-China trade tensions and attractive valuations. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has risen 8.55% year-to-date, contrasting with the S&P 500's 1% increase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 'unquestionably' violated a court order by attempting to deport eight migrants to third countries, specifically South Sudan, without due process. The would-be deportees, with criminal records including homicide and sexual assault, were placed on a flight that the judge ordered to retain 'custody and control' of the individuals. The judge ordered 'reasonable fear' interviews and allowed 15 days to challenge the potential third-party removal, criticizing the administration's actions as lacking meaningful opportunity for objection.

They argue that these practices breach EU consumer law, with passengers potentially paying up to â‚¬280 extra.

          <p>The UK is facing continued challenges related to immigration, despite an expected fall in net migration figures. The Labour government, elected on a manifesto promising to reduce migration, is attempting to soothe public concern with an overhaul of visa rules. The issue dates back to 1968, when attitudes to immigration and race began to heavily influence voting patterns, leading to a cultural fault line that divides British politics. While attitudes towards immigration are softening, concerns remain about the impact on public services. </p>

The meeting, intended to ease tensions, spiraled as Trump put Ramaphosa on the defensive, using a video and printouts to support his claims. Ramaphosa responded that the views expressed in the video were not government policy and emphasized that the government is against what the opposition leader was saying. Claims of genocide in South Africa have been dismissed by a South African judge as 'clearly imagined'.</p>

These waivers allow California to set stricter emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, but nonpartisan watchdogs disagree. Democrats contend that overruling the Senate Parliamentarian sets a dangerous precedent. California vows to sue the federal government if the waivers are revoked. </p>
