          <p>Freida Parton has publicly requested prayers for her sister, country music icon Dolly Parton, who recently postponed her Las Vegas residency due to unspecified health challenges. The 79-year-old singer had informed fans she needed to undergo "a few procedures" but did not disclose the nature of her condition. This follows a recent hospitalization for a kidney stone and the recent death of her husband, Carl Dean. Despite the concerns, Freida Parton expressed optimism, stating she believes her sister is strong and will be fine with the support of prayers from her global fanbase.</p>

          <p>The skull-and-straw-hat flag from the popular Japanese manga "One Piece" has been adopted as a symbol of resistance by youth-led protest movements around the world. The flag, representing freedom and rebellion against corrupt authority in the series, first gained prominence in Indonesia and was later seen during anti-government demonstrations in Nepal. Its use has now spread to countries like the Philippines, Kenya, and Madagascar, uniting Gen Z activists who resonate with the story's themes. This follows a trend of pop culture symbols being repurposed for real-world political expression.</p>

          <p>France is facing a deepening political crisis following the resignation of Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu after just 27 days, marking the fifth prime minister to depart in under two years. The instability stems from an inability to form a stable government and pass a budget, exacerbating concerns over the nation's fiscal health. France's budget deficit and public debt significantly exceed EU limits, and the ongoing political deadlock makes necessary fiscal consolidation appear highly unlikely. President Emmanuel Macron has given Lecornu 48 hours to find a solution, but the crisis threatens to trigger new elections.</p>

          <p>Japan's SoftBank Group has agreed to purchase the robotics unit of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion, a major move to strengthen its position in artificial intelligence. The acquisition is central to founder Masayoshi Son's vision of "Physical AI," which aims to integrate advanced artificial intelligence with robotics. This deal adds a world-class robotics technology portfolio to SoftBank's existing AI-related assets, which include chip designer Arm and a significant stake in OpenAI. For ABB, the sale provides immediate value to shareholders and finalizes the strategic separation of its robotics business. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined a compensation plan for millions of consumers affected by the car finance mis-selling scandal, with total payouts estimated at £8.2 billion. The scheme addresses unfair commission arrangements and inaccurate information provided in approximately 14 million motor finance agreements between 2007 and 2024, with the average payout expected to be around £700 per claim.

          <p>The espionage case against two men accused of spying for China has been dropped by the UK's Crown Prosecution Service. The Director of Public Prosecutions explained that the case could not proceed because the government was unable to provide evidence officially designating China as a "threat to national security" at the time of the alleged offenses. This designation is a crucial legal threshold required for a conviction under the Official Secrets Act, a precedent established in a separate case involving Russian spies. The collapse has prompted criticism and questions about the government's official stance on China's activities.</p>

          <p>American golfer Collin Morikawa has stated that some U.S. fans "probably crossed the line" with their verbal abuse directed at the European team during the recent Ryder Cup in New York. The tournament, which Europe won, was marred by hostile crowd behavior, with Rory McIlroy being a primary target and his wife being hit by a thrown cup. McIlroy himself had described some of the conduct as "unacceptable." Morikawa, who had previously encouraged fans to create "chaos," clarified that he did not intend for them to be rude and that a line needs to be drawn between energetic support and inappropriate behavior.</p>

The surge is also fueled by increased purchasing from retail investors, often through financial products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have seen record inflows this year.

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, marking the tenth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. The system is currently far from land but is tracking west-northwest and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane within a day or so. While a direct landfall is not currently anticipated, a tropical storm watch has been issued for several northern Leeward Islands, including Anguilla, St. Kitts, and Guadeloupe. The storm is forecast to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents and could bring up to four inches of rain to the islands by late this week.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has intensified into a Category 2 storm in the Pacific Ocean off the western coast of Mexico. The storm's outer bands are already affecting the Baja California Sur peninsula, with forecasters anticipating heavy rain and gusty winds into Wednesday. A tropical storm watch is in effect for the region from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro. Although Priscilla is expected to remain offshore and weaken, it is generating dangerous swells likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents. Moisture from the storm may also lead to a risk of flash flooding in the U.S. Desert Southwest.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has addressed his decision to initially hold back relief pitcher Roki Sasaki from a save situation in Game 2 of the National League Division Series. Roberts explained he was trying to manage the workload of the 23-year-old rookie, who has only recently transitioned to the bullpen after a shoulder injury. The initial plan to use another reliever almost backfired, forcing Sasaki to enter the game anyway to secure the final out. Moving forward, Roberts confirmed Sasaki is now the primary option for save situations, but the team will remain cautious about overusing him.</p>

          <p>Charlie Mackesy, the celebrated author and illustrator of "The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and the Horse," has revealed that his follow-up book was significantly delayed after his iPad containing many ideas and drawings was stolen. The device, which had not been backed up, was taken from his unlocked car, forcing him to recreate much of the work from memory. Mackesy also faced profound personal grief during the book's creation, including the loss of his mother and his dog, who inspired the Mole character. Despite these setbacks, he persevered to complete his new book, "Always Remember."</p>

          <p>For months, residents of a Portland, Oregon, neighborhood have been caught in nightly clashes between federal agents and protesters near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. The situation has intensified with President Trump's threat to deploy the National Guard, a move that has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge. Residents describe their street as a "war zone," with tear gas seeping into apartments and constant unrest, though they are divided on whether to blame protesters or the aggressive federal response. The conflict highlights deep divisions and the administration's contentious approach to local protests.</p>

          <p>MAGA influencer Benny Johnson is facing widespread mockery online for a video in which he praised DHS Secretary Kristi Noem for "staring down an army of Antifa" in Portland, Oregon. The video shows Noem on a rooftop looking down at what appears to be a small group of about a dozen people, including reporters and one protester in a chicken costume. Critics ridiculed Johnson's characterization of the small, peaceful gathering as an "army," highlighting the disconnect between the dramatic description and the reality of the scene. The incident occurred while Noem was in the region as part of federal immigration enforcement operations.</p>

His nomination was approved along with over 100 other Trump appointees in a single en bloc vote, a procedural change implemented by Senate Republicans to expedite confirmations. Walker, a Heisman Trophy winner, was a prominent supporter of Trump and ran for Senate with his backing, losing in a runoff.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles is appealing a federal judge's order that restricts the Los Angeles Police Department's use of less-lethal projectile launchers against journalists and peaceful protesters. The injunction was granted after multiple lawsuits alleged that the LAPD used excessive force and violated its own policies by firing crowd control munitions at non-violent individuals during protests. City attorneys argue the restrictions are overly broad and impractical, claiming it is not always possible for officers to distinguish journalists in chaotic situations. Civil rights lawyers counter that the appeal seeks permission to continue unlawful behavior.</p>
