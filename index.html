        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia has become the first country to officially recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, a move welcomed by the Taliban's foreign minister. The decision is seen by experts as a strategic maneuver by Moscow to establish economic ties and create a trade hub to Asia, potentially circumventing international sanctions. This recognition could also pressure Western nations and set a precedent for other authoritarian states to follow suit, though it raises significant concerns among human rights activists about the future for Afghan women and girls.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace's participation in the Europa League is uncertain, pending the outcome of an appeal by French club Lyon, which is also owned by John Textor's Eagle Football Holdings. Uefa rules prevent two clubs with the same influential owner from competing in the same tournament, creating a complex situation. The article details Textor's tangled business dealings, including his impending sale of his 43% stake in Palace to New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, and his rocky relationships with football authorities, leaving the London club in a state of limbo.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Critics and analysts are expressing concern over President Trump's significant expansion of executive power, citing actions like ordering military strikes without congressional approval and taking control of a state's National Guard. The article notes that while Trump's actions are unprecedented in scope, they build on a trend of growing presidential authority under previous administrations from both parties. However, the current political climate, with a highly partisan Congress, is seen as less effective at providing checks and balances, raising long-term questions about the limits of the Oval Office.</p>

          <p>Following a key progressive victory in New York's mayoral primary, political analysts are debating whether the Democratic party is experiencing its own version of the Tea Party movement. This potential shift is fueled by grassroots anger at the party's establishment leadership and a desire for more populist, left-leaning policies focused on economic issues. Unlike the original Tea Party, this burgeoning movement lacks a single, unified list of demands but is characterized by a strong desire for new leadership and a change in direction for the party.</p>

          <p>President Trump and the GOP are escalating their campaign against the counting of mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day, a practice they claim is unlawful despite lacking evidence of widespread fraud. This effort includes a section of Trump's executive order on elections and has led to new laws in several Republican-led states eliminating grace periods for ballot receipt. The push is tied to long-standing grievances about vote-counting delays and conspiracy theories, creating a new front in the legal and legislative battles over election administration ahead of future contests.</p>

          <p>The recent upset victory by Zohran Mamdani in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary is being hailed as a win for ranked-choice voting (RCV). The system allowed progressive groups to endorse a slate of candidates instead of consolidating behind one, preventing a "spoiler" effect and giving a long-shot candidate time to build momentum. Proponents argue RCV fosters more positive, coalition-building campaigns and empowers voters, as evidenced by high turnout and polling showing strong voter approval. This outcome demonstrates how electoral system changes can significantly alter campaign dynamics and political outcomes.</p>

          <p>A recent study from the Africa Centre for Strategic Studies has identified Tanzania as having a uniquely special military relationship with China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). According to the report, Tanzania's military structure, doctrine, and equipment are heavily influenced by the PLA, a connection not found in any other African nation. This deep-seated tie is characteristic of the close relationships China maintains with several African countries where liberation movement parties have held power since gaining independence, positioning Tanzania as a key strategic partner for Beijing on the continent.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Why American Evangelicals Have Remained Silent on the Dismantling of PEPFAR</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's effective shutdown of PEPFAR, a globally successful AIDS relief program credited with saving 26 million lives, has been met with conspicuous silence from the American evangelical community that once championed it. This article explores the complex reasons, including political fealty to Trump, a general distrust of government programs, and compassion fatigue among congregations focused on other issues. Critics within the faith argue that the silence represents a stark contradiction for a movement that defines itself as pro-life, prioritizing culture war issues over a catastrophic and preventable loss of human life.</p>

          <p>There is a long-standing and mutually influential relationship between the CIA and the entertainment industry, with talent and inspiration flowing in both directions. The agency has historically collaborated with Hollywood, from using a makeup artist for the "Argo" rescue mission to recruiting creatives for their problem-solving skills. In return, Hollywood gets access to shape more accurate, albeit dramatized, portrayals of espionage, which the CIA hopes will inspire a new generation of recruits with diverse, unconventional skills. This collaboration blends the worlds of spycraft and stagecraft to serve both national security and popular culture.</p>

          <p>A proposed $18-billion cut to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) budget has sent a wave of fear through the U.S. research community, threatening thousands of grants and the future of biomedical innovation. Scientists report that the funding crisis is already forcing them to halt projects, and many are considering leaving the country, risking a severe "brain drain." The cuts, justified by the White House as a move to restore accountability, are seen by researchers as a catastrophic blow to the next generation of scientists and America's status as a global leader in medical research.</p>

          <p>A group of whitewater boaters staged a unique protest by carrying a raft for 16 miles along a dewatered section of California's Kern River. Their marathon portage aimed to highlight how water diversions for a Southern California Edison hydropower plant leave the river impassable for recreation. As Edison seeks to renew its federal license for the plant, rafters and local businesses are demanding that more water be left in the river to support boating, fishing, and the local tourism economy. The protest underscores the growing conflict between clean energy generation and environmental and recreational water use.</p>

          <p>Big Bear Lake's celebrated bald eagle pair, Jackie and Shadow, have disappeared from their nest, with local naturalists believing the city's July 4th fireworks display is the cause. The eagles, who are monitored by a popular 24-hour webcam, were observed in their roost tree before the show but were seen flying away as the fireworks began. An advocacy group, Friends of Big Bear Valley, had previously warned against the show, fearing its impact on the birds.

          <p>This opinion article argues that California's aggressive environmental policies are creating an energy paradox, leading to higher costs and increased pollution through reliance on foreign oil. As the state shuts down its own cleaner refineries, it must import more fuel from places with lower environmental standards, with the associated shipping pollution often uncounted. The author contends these policies disproportionately harm working-class families who cannot afford electric vehicles and are hit hardest by the nation's highest gas prices. The piece calls for a more pragmatic energy transition grounded in economic reality.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists in China has created a faster and more energy-efficient data sorting system that could help overcome performance bottlenecks in AI, scientific computing, and hardware design. The innovative system uses memristors, a type of electronic component with memory capabilities, combined with a novel sorting algorithm to process data more efficiently. By building a hardware prototype, the researchers demonstrated significant speed and energy improvements over traditional methods for tasks like route finding, potentially helping to solve the long-standing Von Neumann bottleneck in computing architecture.</p>
