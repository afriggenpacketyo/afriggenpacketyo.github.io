          <p>Several officials from the first Trump administration, including former Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino, have alleged they were targeted by the FBI under the Biden administration. They claim to have received emails from Google, just weeks before Trump's second term, notifying them of past federal legal processes for their account data, which Google was previously barred from disclosing by a court order. Scavino described the situation as "LAWFARE at its finest," suggesting the investigations were politically motivated attempts to intimidate them. The officials shared their experiences on social media, linking the probes to investigations led by former special counsel Jack Smith.</p>

          <p>An investigation has reportedly uncovered more than 50 fraudulent signatures on New York City Mayor Eric Adams's petition to appear as an independent candidate on the November ballot. The report from Gothamist found that some signatories claimed their names were forged, including three individuals who are deceased, while others said they were deceived into signing. While the Adams campaign submitted nearly 50,000 signatures, far exceeding the 7,500 required, the findings add another layer of complexity to the contentious mayoral race. The campaign stated it expects contractors to follow the law and will conduct its own review of the submitted signatures.</p>

          <p>Slovenian NBA superstar Luka Doncic has signed a contract extension with the Los Angeles Lakers, ending speculation about his future with the team. The 26-year-old guard, who was acquired in a trade from the Dallas Mavericks in February, announced the deal himself, stating he is excited to work towards bringing more championships to the franchise. Lakers General Manager Rob Pelinka praised Doncic as a "transcendent" player and the future leader of the team in the post-LeBron James era. In a related announcement, Doncic also pledged a $5 million donation to support 77 young athletes globally in pursuing their dreams.</p>

          <p>U.S. financial markets experienced a turbulent week, ending a multi-session winning streak with significant losses on Friday. The downturn was triggered by a surprisingly weak July jobs report, which showed only 73,000 new positions and major downward revisions for previous months. This news, combined with President Trump's decision to fire the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner and impose new tariffs, created widespread investor uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady, despite the weakening economic signals, further contributed to market volatility, overshadowing strong earnings reports from some major tech companies.

          <p>Ukraine's military has claimed responsibility for a series of successful strikes on critical infrastructure deep inside Russian territory. The targets reportedly included a major oil refinery in Ryazan, which sparked a large fire, an oil storage facility in the Voronezh region, and a military airfield in Primorsko-Akhtarsk used for launching drones. Additionally, Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency stated its drones hit an electronics factory in Penza that supplies Russia's military. The report also noted that a fire near the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, allegedly caused by Ukrainian shelling, has been brought under control by Russian authorities.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's independent anti-corruption agencies, NABU and SAPO, announced the discovery of a significant graft scheme involving the procurement of military drones and jamming systems at inflated prices. According to a joint statement, a sitting lawmaker, local officials, and national guard personnel were caught accepting kickbacks of up to 30% of a contract's value. The investigation comes just days after the Ukrainian parliament restored the agencies' independence following public protests against a government attempt to curb their powers. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised the investigation, emphasizing his commitment to a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption.</p>

          <p>Organizations like Black People Will Swim are working to address the historical and systemic reasons behind racial disparities in swimming ability and drowning rates in the United States. The article explores how decades of segregation at public pools created barriers to access for Black Americans, contributing to a persistent stigma and lack of opportunity. Research from the CDC shows that Black children are significantly more likely to drown in pools than their white peers. By providing accessible lessons and creating more Black swim instructors, these programs aim to foster water safety and create a more equitable aquatic culture for future generations.</p>

          <p>Florida has quietly become a leader in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity than California last year for the first time. This growth is not driven by rooftop panels but by large-scale projects from utility companies like Florida Power & Light, which benefit from state rules that streamline the approval process for facilities under 75 megawatts. The shift is primarily motivated by economics, as solar has become cheaper than natural gas amid rising industrial demand. However, the industry faces future challenges from the federal rollback of solar tax credits and increasing strain on the state's power grid.</p>

However, operating earnings, which Buffett considers a more accurate measure of performance, saw only a slight decline to $11.16 billion, as most of Berkshire's businesses performed well. The company's massive cash reserve remained near a record high at $344.1 billion, reflecting Buffett's difficulty in finding attractively priced acquisition targets in the current market.

While Theo's early apathy served as a comedic foil to his father's moralizing, Warner's performance gave the character depth, especially after Theo's dyslexia diagnosis reframed his academic struggles.

          <p>A new memoir by a rural mail carrier in Virginia highlights the vital role postal workers play in providing order and predictability, especially in times of crisis. The book, reviewed in this article, explores the blue-collar experiences and Appalachian identity the author discovered while on his route. Mail delivery, whether to the most remote communities or to areas recovering from natural disasters, represents a consistent and reliable federal service that helps maintain a sense of normalcy. The piece reflects on the logistical feats and quiet heroism involved in ensuring that mail reaches its destination, connecting the country one delivery at a time.</p>

          <h2>Trump Cites Past Hostile Comments as Obstacle to Pardoning Sean 'Diddy' Combs</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that past hostile comments from Sean "Diddy" Combs make the prospect of a presidential pardon "more difficult." In a Newsmax interview, Trump acknowledged that he considers Combs "sort of half-innocent" following his conviction on two prostitution-related charges but acquittal on more serious counts. However, Trump referenced Combs's past statements, such as calling for Trump to be "banished" in 2020, as a complicating factor. The president admitted that while he tries not to let such things cloud his judgment, the personal hostility makes it harder to consider a pardon for the music mogul.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from RentCafe highlights the stark contrast in housing affordability across major U.S. cities, showing how much apartment space a monthly rent of $1,500 can secure. In Manhattan, that budget gets an average of just 216 square feet, while in Wichita, Kansas, it affords a spacious 1,329 square feet. The data shows that the least amount of space is found in expensive coastal markets like New York, Boston, and San Francisco, where housing demand far outstrips supply. Conversely, renters find their money stretches furthest in Midwestern and Southern cities such as Toledo, Oklahoma City, and Memphis, where land is more available.</p>

          <p>In his new HBO Max special, "Panicked," comedian Marc Maron continues to mine humor from a river of anxiety, tackling subjects ranging from his father's dementia to the rise of fascism. The special is the third in a loose trilogy where Maron confronts both catastrophic current events and personal difficulties with his signature cantankerous and ruminative style. This article reviews his performance, noting his controlled delivery and willingness to explore dark topics, including a lengthy bit about potential childhood sexual assault. Maron's comedy remains a vehicle for recursive self-reflection, using his distinctive voice to process a world that offers little solid footing.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Miami has found Tesla partly responsible for a 2019 fatal crash involving its Autopilot technology, ordering the company to pay more than $240 million in damages. The case involved a driver who, while distracted by his phone, crashed into a parked vehicle, killing a 22-year-old woman and injuring her boyfriend. The jury determined that Tesla's technology failed and that the company bore significant responsibility, rejecting the argument that the reckless driver was solely to blame. Lawyers for the victims also accused Tesla of hiding key data recorded moments before the accident, a claim the company attributed to an honest mistake.</p>

          <p>The cost of nursing home care in Germany has surged to an average of €3,248 per month, creating a severe financial burden for the nation's elderly. With the average monthly pension around €1,100, the gap between income and expenditure has become dramatic, forcing nearly one-third of residents to rely on welfare payments. Health care experts attribute the rising costs to long-overdue wage increases for nursing staff and a higher staff-to-resident ratio. German Health Minister Nina Warken has called for urgent reform of the country's long-term care insurance system, which is struggling to cope with an aging population and escalating expenses.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified document from special counsel John Durham's investigation has further weakened claims by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard of a "deep state" conspiracy to undermine Donald Trump. Gabbard has pursued the theory that Obama-era officials manufactured intelligence about Russian interference in the 2016 election. However, the Durham document concludes that key emails used to support this theory were not authentic but were likely composite forgeries created by Russian intelligence hackers. This finding complicates Gabbard's crusade, as it suggests the evidence she points to was itself a product of Russian disinformation, not a domestic plot.</p>

          <p>A new survey from Ally Bank reveals that nearly 60% of millennials and Gen Zers feel their social life is negatively impacting their ability to achieve their financial goals. American adults in this demographic spend an average of $250 per month on social activities, yet 42% report overspending their social budget multiple times a year. Experts suggest that while social connection is vital for well-being, many young adults fail to properly budget for these expenses. They recommend incorporating social spending into a formal budget, finding free or low-cost activities with friends, and addressing the underlying emotional drivers of overspending to regain financial control.</p>

          <p>While major financial institutions like BlackRock and JP Morgan are increasingly embracing cryptocurrency through products like Bitcoin ETFs and tokenized funds, the real transformation in finance remains untapped. This article argues that the true potential lies in integrating with the principles of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), which offers more advanced functions like on-chain lending, borrowing, and asset management. For traditional finance to truly evolve, it must move beyond simply tokenizing existing assets and begin building compliant, user-friendly bridges to the more complex and innovative DeFi ecosystem, particularly in asset management and treasury markets.
