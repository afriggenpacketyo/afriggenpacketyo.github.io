        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's export growth slowed for the second consecutive month due to the impact of U.S. tariffs, according to recent government data. The growth rate of 2% was the slowest since October of the previous year, with exports of transport equipment to the U.S. declining by 4.1%. Economists anticipate that net exports will continue to hinder GDP growth in the second quarter, potentially delaying the central bank's interest rate hike. Despite ongoing trade talks with the U.S., a return to pre-Trump trade terms is unlikely, posing challenges for Japanese manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Immigration lawyers have filed an emergency motion alleging that the U.S. government deported migrants from Asian countries like Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan, a nation plagued by conflict and instability.

A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to maintain custody of the migrants to ensure their return if the deportation is deemed unlawful.

The only concrete deal discussed was a prisoner exchange, falling short of Russia's broader hopes for normalized relations, including sanctions removal and the return of American companies. Putin's strategy reflects a belief that time is on his side, supported by stable oil prices and a growing military recruitment.</p>

Flights will be capped at 28 departures and 28 arrivals per hour until June 15, with slightly higher limits through October 25. United Airlines, which operates a majority of flights at Newark, supports the restrictions, and the FAA hopes to relieve the substantial inconvenience to travelers.

          <p>A new test developed by researchers at the University of Nottingham and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust can diagnose brain tumour types in hours instead of weeks. The "ultra-rapid" method of genetic testing has been used in 50 operations with a 100% success rate in diagnosing the exact tumour type. Faster diagnosis allows surgeons to perform more radical surgery during the initial procedure and enables patients to receive radiation treatment or chemotherapy more quickly. The test, which uses software called ROBIN, has attracted interest from across the UK.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has initiated a criminal investigation into Andrew Cuomo, a leading candidate in the New York City mayoral race, regarding his testimony to Congress about decisions made during the COVID-19 pandemic. This follows the DOJ's recent dismissal of charges against current Mayor Eric Adams. The investigation is viewed by some as politically motivated, raising concerns about the Trump administration using the Justice Department for political purposes. The investigation stems from a referral by House Republicans.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to pressure them to support a budget package that includes his legislative priorities. The bill faces opposition from both conservative and moderate factions within the party. Conservatives seek deeper spending cuts and changes to Medicaid, while moderates oppose changes to the state and local tax deduction. Trump urged Republicans to support the bill and addressed concerns about Medicaid and the SALT deduction, but the bill's future remains uncertain.</p>

          <h2>NYT: Industry-Funded Red Meat Studies More Likely to Report Favorable Results</h2>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that red meat studies funded by the red meat industry were more likely to report favorable results compared to independently funded studies. These studies often neglected to compare red meat to healthier alternatives like whole grains or plant-based proteins. Experts express concern that industry-linked research may shape public understanding of nutrition and health, particularly amid proposed cuts to federal nutrition research funding. The new findings highlight how financial interests can shape how people understand whatâ€™s good for them.</p>

          <h2>US-China Tariff Truce Offers Hope for Resolution on Fentanyl and Other Issues</h2>

          <p>The recent tariff truce between the US and China has provided a glimmer of hope for resolving issues such as fentanyl production and trade imbalances. While the truce signals a willingness to avoid complete economic decoupling, the remaining tariffs continue to affect bilateral trade. There is cautious optimism that further reductions may occur after the 90-day period. This negotiation demonstrates that neither side is ready to cut off all economic ties completely.</p>
