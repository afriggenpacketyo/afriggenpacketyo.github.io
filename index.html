          <p>Japan has returned the remains of ten Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to Australia, marking the first repatriation of its kind. The remains, taken during the 19th and 20th centuries for research, were held by three Japanese institutions. This repatriation is part of a global movement to return indigenous remains taken abroad, with Australia having worked to retrieve over 1,785 sets of remains from overseas in the last 30 years. The return allows for pathways to healing for generations of the Kaurna people, whose ancestors' remains were collected without consent. </p>

          <p>Multiple B-2 stealth bombers have been deployed to Guam as tensions escalate between Iran and the West over Iran's nuclear program. The bombers, currently stationed at Andersen Air Force Base, have no further orders beyond their deployment, but the move coincides with President Trump weighing options regarding Iran. In addition to the bombers, refueling tankers were also deployed, prompting speculation about a potential strike on Iran's underground uranium enrichment facility in Fordrow. The B-2 is the only U.S. Air Force bomber capable of carrying the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) on bombing missions.</p>

This follows an incident where activists broke into RAF Brize Norton and sprayed planes with red paint, leading to a security review at military bases. The group claims responsibility for targeting arms companies to disrupt the supply chain to what they call genocide, while Israel denies allegations of genocide. The government defends the potential ban under the Terrorism Act 2000, citing the group's activities have gone beyond protest to blackmail.</p>

          <p>A British tourist, Donna Jobling, is hospitalized in Crete after contracting Legionnaires' disease while on an all-inclusive holiday with easyJet Holidays. She developed a chest infection that led to acute respiratory failure and pneumonia, and has been in intensive care since June 11. EasyJet Holidays has moved other customers out of the hotel as a precaution, and the Greek health ministry has issued a statement to hoteliers in Crete to raise awareness about Legionella.

          <p>A tornado in North Dakota has claimed the lives of three people, while severe storms have caused extensive damage across northern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin. The storm system brought tornadic activity, large hail, and strong wind gusts, with winds reaching over 100 mph in Bemidji, Minnesota. Thousands of residents are without power, and Itasca State Park in Minnesota has been closed due to the storm's impact. These storms occur amidst dangerous heat conditions, with nearly 150 million Americans under heat warnings and advisories.</p>

          <p>The Russian government is showing signs of nervousness as the country faces economic challenges, despite claims of economic growth. Russia's Minister for Economic Development warned that the country's economy was teetering "on the brink of recession," while the Russian Central Bank Governor noted that many unused resources have been exhausted. The St Petersburg International Economic Forum, once a showcase for the Russian economy, has lost some of its shine due to international sanctions over the war in Ukraine. President Putin has prioritized winning the war against Ukraine over the state of the economy.</p>

The loss is expected to be costly to Republicans, who have been aiming to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term and add new ones while cutting federal spending.
