          <p>Following a deadly attack on tourists in Kashmir's Pahalgam, India has banned imports from Pakistan, citing national security concerns. In response, Pakistan conducted a training launch of a surface-to-surface missile. Tensions are escalating between the two countries, with reports of gunfire along the Line of Control and the suspension of the Indus Water Treaty by India. Pakistan has warned that suspending the water treaty would be considered an act of war, further heightening the risk of military conflict in the disputed Kashmir region.</p>

          <p>The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) is taking legal action against Ofsted, the education watchdog in England, over proposed changes to school inspections. NAHT criticizes the new school report cards as "another crude grading system" after Ofsted eliminated one or two-word judgements. This follows concerns raised by Ruth Perry's sister and other education professionals, who warn that the changes will negatively impact the wellbeing of education staff. Ofsted defends its proposals, stating that supporting mental health is an important part of the changes, and calls the union's legal claims "untenable."</p>

They were eventually rescued by local fishermen and transported to a hospital. The pilot believes that petrol leaking from the plane kept the predators at bay while awaiting rescue, they subsisted on cassava flour brought by one of the passengers.</p>

The new government has ceased funding and launched an anti-corruption initiative targeting the project.

While some express a desire for an end to the war, there is a widespread fear that recognizing Russian control would legitimize territorial concessions and endanger the local population under Russian legislation.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent minerals deal with the United States, analysts believe it will take years before Ukraine can rival China as a key source of critical minerals. Most of Ukraine's mineral reserves are located in Russian-occupied territories, and the country lacks the processing capacity to compete with China's dominance in rare earth refining. This leaves American companies struggling to diversify their supply chains as Beijing restricts its mineral exports amid ongoing trade disputes. The deal aims to set up a fund to receive royalties from natural resource projects in Ukraine, but analysts suggest that the scale of Ukraine's potential production is not comparable to China's established industry.</p>

          <p>A UK government impact assessment estimates that assisted dying, if legalized in England and Wales, could result in over 4,000 deaths in the tenth year after implementation. The report also examines the potential financial implications, projecting NHS savings ranging from Â£5.84m to Â£59.6m annually after ten years, while staffing and training costs could exceed Â£10m a year. Proponents argue that assisted dying would provide compassionate end-of-life care, while opponents raise concerns about the risk to vulnerable individuals and the potential for financial incentives within the NHS.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's promise of a "golden age" for the U.S. economy is off to a turbulent start, with the first quarter showing a contraction in GDP. The article notes that while Trump blames the previous administration for any negative economic indicators, he takes credit for positive ones. It suggests that Trump's tariffs and trade policies have contributed to economic uncertainty and confusion, impacting consumer spending and business investment. The piece questions whether these policies will lead to a recession and highlights concerns among rural and lower-income voters regarding Trump's handling of the economy.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amid economic challenges like inflation and housing affordability, compounded by an uncertain global political landscape. While both Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton acknowledge these difficulties, voters express concern over the rising cost of living. The election also reflects a shift away from major parties, with increasing support for independent candidates and minor parties. The campaign has seen debates over economic policies and cultural issues, with some comparisons drawn between Dutton's rhetoric and that of President Trump.</p>

          <p>Over 80 people have died in recent violence in Druze-majority areas of Syria, triggered by a controversial audio clip and escalating into armed clashes. The new Syrian government, led by the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, is negotiating with the Druze community about integration into the transitional government and military. Israel has bombed areas near Damascus, claiming to protect the Druze community, but experts argue this interference exacerbates the situation. The article highlights the complex dynamics, including internal divisions within the Druze community and external interference, destabilizing Syria's already precarious political transition.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from the blood of Tim Friede, a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. The antibodies in Friede's blood have shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snake species in animal tests. The current antivenom therapies have to match the specific species of venomous snake anyone has been bitten by. Friede's 18-year mission could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites - which kill up to 140,000 people a year and leave three times as many needing amputations or facing permanent disability.</p>
