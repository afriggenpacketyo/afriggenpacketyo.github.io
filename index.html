          <p>Alaska Airlines and its subsidiary, Horizon Air, initiated a temporary, system-wide ground stop for all flights on Sunday evening due to a significant IT outage. The airline issued an apology to customers for the inconvenience, warning of residual operational impacts throughout the night. The Federal Aviation Administration acknowledged the carrier's request for the ground stop. The specific cause of the computer system failure and the full extent of its impact on airport operations were not immediately detailed by the airline.</p>

          <p>Owen Farrell is set to captain the British and Irish Lions for their upcoming match in Melbourne, marking his first start of the tour. The team lineup for this game does not include any players from the first-Test victory against Australia, instead featuring a mix of other squad members, including nine Scots. This match serves as an opportunity for players on the fringe of the Test team to make their case for selection in the upcoming second Test. The opposing team is a special XV celebrating First Nations and Pacific Islands heritage.</p>

          <p>The family of former England cricket star Graham Thorpe, who died by suicide last year at age 55, is organizing 'A Day for Thorpey' to celebrate his life and raise mental health awareness. The event will take place on what would have been his 56th birthday during the fifth England-India Test at The Oval, his long-time home ground. The family is partnering with the charity Mind to sell headbands, a nod to Thorpe's signature on-field look, to fund mental health initiatives. They hope to reduce the stigma surrounding suicide and encourage people to seek help early.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts are increasingly viewing the Singapore dollar (SGD) as a "quasi safe-haven" currency, particularly within Asia, due to Singapore's strong institutional framework and stable policymaking. While it exhibits defensive qualities during financial stress, its global status is not yet comparable to traditional safe havens like the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, or Swiss franc. Hurdles to achieving this status include the relatively small size of the SGD market and the managed nature of its monetary policy, which limits liquidity. Experts suggest it could become the "Swiss franc of Asia" over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Armed Bedouin clans have withdrawn from the Druze-majority city of Sweida in southern Syria after a week of deadly clashes that displaced over 128,000 people. The withdrawal follows a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, allowing humanitarian aid convoys to enter the city, which faces shortages of essential supplies. The conflict, which involved sectarian violence and targeted attacks, was sparked by kidnappings and threatened to destabilize the region further. Despite the ceasefire, tensions persist, with some Bedouin fighters remaining on the city's outskirts and demanding accountability from Druze leaders.</p>

          <p>Two apartment blocks in Kirkby, Merseyside, are being closed due to severe fire safety deficiencies, forcing all residents to leave their homes. Leaseholders report spending years and significant funds on repairs and escalating service charges while the buildings deteriorated under a series of management companies. The situation is described as a failure of the "broken leasehold system," with an estimated £1 million of tenant and taxpayer money spent on failed attempts to make the buildings safe.

          <p>A 158-year-old Northamptonshire transport company, KNP, was forced to cease operations and lay off 700 employees after a devastating ransomware attack.

          <p>A 61-year-old man, Keith McAllister, has died after a tragic accident involving an MRI machine at a clinic in New York. McAllister entered the MRI room while his wife was undergoing a scan and was wearing a 9kg (20 lbs) metal weight-training chain around his neck. The machine's powerful magnetic field immediately pulled him in by the chain, causing a "medical episode" that included a series of heart attacks. His wife, who had called out for his help, witnessed the event. MRI accidents are rare but can be fatal due to the immense force exerted by the magnets on metallic objects.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest pilot operating a Delta Connection flight had to perform an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a potential mid-air collision with a B-52 bomber near Minot, North Dakota. The regional jet was on its final approach when the military aircraft, which was conducting a flyover for the state fair, appeared in its flight path. In an apology to passengers after landing safely, the pilot expressed surprise at the lack of a warning from air traffic control or the nearby Air Force base. Both SkyWest and the U.S. Air Force have stated they are investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>A significant contrast is emerging between the U.S. and China regarding their approaches to green energy amidst growing global demand, partly driven by the needs of AI data centers. While China is forging ahead with its renewable energy goals and investments, the Trump administration is moving to cancel tax credits for wind and solar, labeling them as "unreliable." This divergence in energy policy is a key element of the broader technological and economic rivalry between the two nations. China's strategy appears aimed at securing a global tech lead by heavily investing in the energy infrastructure required to power it.</p>

She explained this was due to Trump providing a venue for the UFC in its early days when others would not.

          <p>President Trump has threatened to obstruct a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the NFL team reverts to its former name, the "Redskins." In a social media post, Trump claimed there is a "big clamoring" for the name change and that he might put a restriction on the stadium project if the team does not comply. The team dropped the controversial name in 2020 after years of criticism that it was a racist slur against Indigenous people. It remains unclear what authority Trump could use to intervene in the project, which involves redeveloping a federally owned site.</p>

          <p>Canada is experiencing a significant measles outbreak in 2025, with over 3,800 confirmed infections, making it a top-10 country for outbreaks globally and surpassing U.S. case numbers. The provinces of Ontario and Alberta are the hardest-hit, with the virus spreading rapidly in communities with historically low vaccination rates, including some Mennonite populations. Health experts attribute the surge to rising vaccine hesitancy and the spread of misinformation following the COVID-19 pandemic. They warn that the only way to stop the outbreak of the highly contagious virus is to increase immunization rates significantly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to concerns about an upcoming tariff deadline, market analyst Jim Cramer argues that numerous positive factors are currently supporting the stock market. He points to a strong earnings season, pro-business tax relief and deductions in the "big beautiful bill," and massive investment in data centers and the electrical grid. Other tailwinds include a potential U.S. energy renaissance, a resurgent IPO market, and increased M&A activity. Cramer suggests these elements create a pro-growth environment that could lead to economic expansion, even if President Trump's actions on trade create volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is reviving its Pensions Commission to address a looming retirement savings crisis, warning that future pensioners could be worse off than today's. New analysis from the Department for Work and Pensions reveals that nearly half of working-age adults, particularly the self-employed and low earners, are not saving into a private pension. This shortfall is projected to leave those retiring in 2050 with 8% less income annually compared to current retirees. The relaunched commission will aim to build a national consensus on how to boost private pension savings and tackle existing gaps.</p>

          <p>Xiang Jingen, the founder and CEO of Chinese quantum computing firm SpinQ, believes the technology is on the verge of a significant breakthrough. He predicts that quantum computing will cross a "usefulness" threshold within the next five years, transitioning from a niche technology to one with broader practical applications. Founded in 2018, Shenzhen-based SpinQ develops both small-scale quantum computers for educational purposes and more powerful industrial-grade systems. Xiang compares the current state of quantum technology to the pivotal era of semiconductors in the 1950s, just before the advent of integrated circuits transformed computing.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the use of detention facilities. This shift corresponds with a perception that the program is targeting more than just dangerous criminals. The poll also reveals that a large majority of Americans, including those outside Trump's political base, want the administration to focus more on lowering prices rather than on tariffs or spending cuts. While the president's base remains strongly supportive, his overall approval has slipped, reflecting growing doubt among the broader public.</p>
