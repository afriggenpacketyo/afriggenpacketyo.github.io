          <p>AI data center provider CoreWeave saw its stock fall 20% following the announcement of a second-quarter adjusted loss of 27 cents per share, which was wider than analyst expectations. The results arrive just before the expiration of a post-IPO lock-up period, which could introduce more volatility as insiders become eligible to sell shares. Despite the loss and some concerns over delayed capital expenditures, the company reported a significant revenue increase driven by high AI demand and raised its full-year revenue guidance. The company's finance chief noted that demand for its services, used by clients like Microsoft and Nvidia, continues to outpace supply. (not investment advice)</p>

The patient, who is currently in intensive care, may have been exposed while water skiing at the Lake of the Ozarks. This type of infection, primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), is extremely rare, with only 167 cases reported in the U.S. since 1962.

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining about 2%, in contrast to a decline in some major technology stocks. This market rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. Lower borrowing costs are particularly beneficial for smaller companies that rely on debt for financing operations and expansion. Despite the daily gain, small-cap stocks have lagged behind the broader market since the AI boom began in late 2022. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's criticism of Goldman Sachs for predicting higher consumer inflation due to tariffs, many Wall Street economists share the same outlook. Experts from firms like JPMorgan Chase and UBS anticipate that as pre-tariff inventories are depleted, consumers will increasingly bear the cost of the duties. While runaway inflation isn't expected, a steady increase could push the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure into the mid-3% range. This trend is unlikely to deter the Fed from cutting interest rates, as a weakening labor market is also a major factor in their policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A European Commission plan to impose penalties on Israel regarding the humanitarian situation in Gaza has been stalled due to a lack of consensus among EU member states, with Germany among the holdouts. The proposal, which would restrict Israeli startups from accessing EU research funds, was initiated in response to what the EU calls violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Gaza. The deadlock highlights the bloc's long-standing internal divisions on its relationship with Israel. Human rights organizations have criticized the EU's inaction, calling the failure to agree on even this minor step a "disgrace."</p>

          <p>In a satirical piece, The Atlantic examines the claims of rampant crime in Washington D.C. from the perspective of a Trump administration insider like Stephen Miller. The article ironically identifies the "criminals" not as street offenders but as figures within the administration itself, alluding to actions such as defying court orders, storing classified documents improperly, and the events of January 6. It uses sarcasm to critique the administration's own alleged lawlessness while it calls for a National Guard deployment to tackle crime. The piece concludes by feigning realization that the Guard is being deployed for other reasons.</p>

In a 2-1 decision, the court found that the grant recipients challenging the funding freeze did not meet the legal requirements for a preliminary injunction. The initial freeze was ordered by President Trump in January, affecting nearly $4 billion for global health programs and over $6 billion for HIV/AIDS initiatives.

          <p>After leaving Texas for over a week to deny Republicans a quorum, members of the Texas House Democratic Caucus are now planning their return. They consider their effort a success, as it effectively killed the special session aimed at passing new congressional maps that would have heavily favored Republicans. In response, the governor has announced a second special session will begin immediately with the same agenda. The standoff highlights the intense partisan battle over redistricting, with both sides accusing the other of gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he will host this year's Kennedy Center Honors, a break from the tradition of presidents attending as guests. He also stated he was heavily involved in the selection process, nominating loyalists like Sylvester Stallone and the rock band Kiss while rejecting artists he deemed "too woke" or liberal. This move is part of a broader push by Trump to assert authority over U.S. cultural institutions since returning to the White House. During his first term, Trump avoided the awards after several artists said they would boycott the event in protest.</p>

          <p>This opinion article from The Guardian frames President Trump's decision to federalize the D.C. police and deploy the National Guard as a dangerous authoritarian move. The author argues the action is not about crime, which is down, but is a tactic to distract from other issues and energize his base with nativist and racist dog whistles about "Democrat-run cities." The piece suggests this is part of a broader agenda to create a personalized state where the monopoly on violence rests with Trump. It calls on the media and political actors to connect these actions as a consistent attack on democracy.</p>

          <p>Police are investigating an armed robbery of a Brinks truck in Elkins Park, a Philadelphia suburb, where two assailants stole between $700,000 and $800,000. The robbers, one armed with an AR-15-style pistol, ambushed the vehicle outside an H Mart before fleeing and abandoning their getaway car. This incident is the latest in a string of similar armored car heists in the Philadelphia area this summer, and authorities are investigating potential connections. The FBI recently announced charges against three individuals in a related $2 million Brinks robbery from June.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record-breaking volume of containers in July, driven by shippers front-loading cargo to get ahead of threatened Trump administration tariffs on Chinese goods. The port handled over one million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), the highest in its 117-year history, with imports also setting a new record. However, this early peak season has shown signs of slowing, and freight-forwarding experts note that the surge was not as strong as in typical years.

          <p>Florida's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has unanimously approved the state's first black bear hunt in a decade, a decision condemned by wildlife advocacy groups. The limited hunt, scheduled for December, will permit the killing of 187 bears using methods including baiting, archery, and eventually, dog packs. Officials justified the hunt by citing a rising bear population and increased human encounters, but critics argue the decision is based on flawed data and constitutes "legalized animal cruelty." The state's last hunt in 2015 was a debacle, halted early after far exceeding its quota.</p>

          <p>Several prominent fast-casual restaurant chains, including Cava and Chipotle, are experiencing a consumer slowdown after a period of strong growth, leading to significant drops in their stock prices. Executives attribute the downturn to a "cautious" consumer environment, with diners cutting back on spending amid economic uncertainty and low consumer sentiment. Chains that once reported double-digit growth are now seeing sales slow or shrink, prompting them to introduce promotions and operational changes. While some executives see signs of improvement, the sector is clearly feeling the impact of shifting consumer behavior.</p>
