          <h2>House Republicans Face Democratic Hurdles in Effort to Pass Spending Cuts</h2>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing a $9 billion spending cut package requested by the Trump administration, targeting foreign aid and public media. However, the process is complicated by Democrats who are demanding a vote on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The debate has created a tense political standoff as a crucial deadline approaches, after which the funds must be spent as originally allocated. The controversy highlights deep divisions within Washington, intertwining fiscal policy with the ongoing pressure for transparency in the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has admitted that European nations have historically been "free-riders" on United States defense spending. In an interview, Merz stated that Europe understands the need to increase its own defense contributions and is now taking significant steps to do so. This shift in stance comes amid Russia's war in Ukraine and ongoing trade discussions with the Trump administration. The Chancellor emphasized a strengthening triangular alliance between Germany, the UK, and France to bolster European security and economic growth.</p>

The "Good Trouble Lives On" day of action, held on the fifth anniversary of Lewis's death, was organized by numerous advocacy groups. Protesters voiced opposition to administration policies on civil rights, immigration, and social programs. The events aimed to channel Lewis's call for "good trouble" into collective action for justice and voting rights.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein, following mounting political pressure. This move coincided with a Wall Street Journal report alleging Trump contributed a "bawdy" letter with a drawing of a naked woman to a birthday album for Epstein in 2003. Trump has vehemently denied the report, calling it a "hoax" and threatening to sue the newspaper. The dual developments have intensified the controversy surrounding the Epstein case and the administration's handling of related files.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party has once again suspended Diane Abbott, the country's longest-serving Black MP, after she stated in an interview that she did not regret comments made in 2023 that led to her initial suspension. Last year, she wrote a letter appearing to equate the prejudice faced by Jewish people with that of redheads, for which she was suspended before being reinstated. Her recent lack of regret for the original remarks prompted the new disciplinary action. The move underscores Labour leader Keir Starmer's strict stance on antisemitism within the party.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced it will end "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" in May 2026, bringing the long-running late-night franchise to a close. The network described the move as a "purely a financial decision," citing the challenging advertising revenue landscape that has impacted the television industry. Colbert, who has hosted the top-rated late-night show for a decade, announced the news to a surprised audience. The cancellation highlights a dramatic shift in media consumption, as younger audiences increasingly turn to short-form content on digital platforms rather than traditional broadcast television.</p>

          <p>A settlement has been reached in a class-action lawsuit brought by investors against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders. The lawsuit alleged that officials failed to protect user data, leading to the Cambridge Analytica scandal and subsequent financial damages, including a $5.1 billion FTC fine. Shareholders were seeking to have Zuckerberg and others reimburse the company for these costs. Details of the settlement, which was announced in a Delaware court just before Zuckerberg was expected to testify, were not immediately made public.</p>

          <p>In a powerful first-person account, an international health worker details the horrific suffering of children and the immense bravery of Palestinian medical staff in Gaza. The article describes treating children with devastating injuries from airstrikes while facing critical shortages of fuel, surgical supplies, and nutrition due to the blockade. The author rejects being called a hero, instead bestowing that title on the local doctors and nurses who continue to work despite losing their own homes and families. It is a harrowing call for a ceasefire and an end to the weaponization of aid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of beef in the United States has reached record highs, with ground beef and steaks seeing significant year-over-year increases. Experts attribute the surge to a decades-long decline in the U.S. cattle herd, which is now at its smallest size since 1951. Factors contributing to the tight supply include persistent drought, high feed costs, and ranchers selling cattle to capitalize on high prices rather than breeding them. Strong consumer demand, combined with these supply pressures, suggests that relief for shoppers is unlikely in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings receiver and former USC star Jordan Addison has resolved his 2024 DUI case by pleading no contest to a lesser charge of "wet reckless driving." Addison, who was arrested after being found asleep in his Rolls-Royce blocking traffic, will avoid jail time and instead serve 12 months of probation and pay a fine. The original misdemeanor drunk-driving charges were dismissed as part of the plea deal. The NFL has stated that the matter remains under review, and Addison could still face a suspension under the league's substance abuse policy.</p>

          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. Slovakia had been holding up the unanimous approval of the measures due to concerns about a separate EU plan to phase out Russian gas imports. Fico stated that Slovakia received guarantees from the EU regarding future gas prices and supply, making it "counterproductive" to continue the blockade. The new sanctions target Russia's energy and banking sectors, aiming to further isolate Moscow for its ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>In a significant departure from previous stances, the U.S. Department of Justice has recommended a sentence of just one day in prison for Brett Hankison, a former police officer convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights. Hankison blindly fired 10 shots into Taylor's apartment building during the fatal 2020 raid. The sentencing memo, which also calls for credit for time served, means Hankison would face no additional jail time if the judge agrees. The recommendation is seen as a major reversal in the federal approach to police accountability in this high-profile case.</p>

The U.S. lawmaker urged Panama to ensure that control of these strategic assets does not fall to entities beholden to the Chinese Communist Party.
