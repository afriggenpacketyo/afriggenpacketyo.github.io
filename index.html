          <p>Wildfires sparked by lightning have forced evacuations in and around Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona. The Dragon Bravo Fire inside the park and the larger White Sage Fire to the north remain uncontained, burning thousands of acres. Park officials have ordered all North Rim residents to evacuate immediately, and about 500 visitors were previously moved to safety. Strong winds, low humidity, and critically dry conditions are challenging firefighters, reflecting a heightened risk of wildfires across the western U.S. due to recent hot, dry weather.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's third heatwave of the year is expanding, with Scotland and Northern Ireland expected to experience their warmest days of the year. Temperatures are projected to reach up to 31C in Scotland, while England and Wales will see widespread highs in the low 30s. Amber heat health alerts remain in effect for southern and central England, indicating a risk to the entire population. The extreme heat has prompted warnings about wildfire risks and potential travel disruptions, and has also impacted events like the Wimbledon tennis tournament.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant move amid the escalating AI talent war, Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other key R&D staff. The deal, valued at $2.4 billion, involves licensing fees and compensation, but is not a full acquisition of the company. Windsurf, which specializes in AI tools for writing code, will continue to operate independently. This strategic hiring highlights the intense competition for top AI expertise among tech giants like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, who are increasingly absorbing talent from innovative startups.

          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian footwear makers after facing criticism for a sandal design that closely resembled traditional Kolhapuri chappals. The move came after a social media outcry and calls from the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents Kolhapuri artisans, for Prada to acknowledge the design's Indian origins. The company has initiated talks with the chamber to explore collaboration opportunities, a step seen as a positive model for respectful engagement between global fashion houses and traditional craft communities.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing federal immigration agents from conducting "detentive stops" in several Southern California counties without reasonable suspicion. The ruling stems from a lawsuit by the ACLU and immigrant rights groups, which alleged that agents were unconstitutionally targeting individuals based on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The judge cited a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims, ordering that these factors alone cannot be the basis for a stop while the case proceeds.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the fatal Air India Flight 171 crash has revealed a critical and puzzling event just seconds after takeoff. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he activated the fuel "cut-off" switches, a procedure normally done after landing, to which the other pilot denied doing so. This action starved the engines of fuel, leading to a total power loss from which the aircraft could not recover in its short 40 seconds of flight. Investigators are now focused on why this happened, as the switches have safety features to prevent accidental activation.</p>

          <p>A plan by the Czech Railway Authority to dismantle and replace the iconic 123-year-old Vysehrad railway bridge in Prague is facing strong opposition. While the authority argues a new, wider bridge is necessary to handle projected increases in rail traffic, preservationists and architects contend the historic steel structure can and should be repaired. An international coalition of experts, backed by a public petition and UNESCO, has proposed restoring the bridge in place, arguing that only a small fraction of the steel needs replacement. The debate highlights a classic conflict between modernization and the preservation of cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has laid off 1,353 employees as part of a sweeping reorganization plan by the Trump administration aimed at reducing its workforce. The cuts, which include both civil service and foreign service staff, are part of a broader plan to eliminate redundant offices and refocus the department's mission. The layoffs have hit several key bureaus, including those focused on refugee resettlement, human rights, and foreign assistance, such as the office coordinating Afghan relocation efforts. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the cuts will undermine U.S. diplomacy and national security.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened its new Wonsan Kalma beach resort, a large-scale development modeled after tourist destinations like Spain's Benidorm, with the first group of Russian tourists arriving this week. The project, championed by leader Kim Jong Un, is intended to boost the country's sanctioned economy and strengthen ties with Russia. However, the resort's construction is shadowed by concerns over human rights abuses, with reports from the UN and defectors suggesting the use of forced labor from "shock brigades" who worked under brutal conditions with inadequate compensation to complete the project rapidly.</p>

          <p>An intense and unusually early marine heatwave has gripped the western Mediterranean Sea, with surface temperatures surpassing 30°C, several degrees above normal for the time of year. Scientists are expressing grave concern over the potential for devastating consequences for marine life, as many species struggle to cope with such prolonged and extreme warmth. The heat can lead to mass mortality events for foundational species like seagrasses and seaweeds, with cascading effects on fish stocks and the overall ecosystem. This event underscores the vulnerability of the Mediterranean as a rapidly warming "climate change hotspot."</p>

          <p>Recent economic data and a stark report from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) suggest the UK government is facing difficult fiscal choices, likely leading to significant tax rises in the autumn. The OBR warned that Britain's public finances are on an unsustainable path, with debt levels potentially soaring, and criticized a pattern of policy U-turns. With borrowing costs rising and global economic uncertainty mounting, the chancellor may need to implement tax increases of £10bn to £20bn to stabilize the public finances and meet self-imposed borrowing limits.

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final presents a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova. Swiatek, the world number one, has historically had an uneasy relationship with grass but has found formidable form, adjusting her baseline position to better utilize her powerful forehand. Anisimova, returning to prominence after a break for mental health, plays an aggressive, high-risk game and enters as the underdog, which may allow her to play more freely. The outcome will likely depend on who better manages the pressure of the occasion in their first-ever tour-level meeting.</p>

In a recent speech, he invoked the legacy of wartime leader John Curtin, emphasizing the need for Australia to think and act for itself based on strategic reality rather than tradition. This approach seeks to assert Australian sovereignty while balancing its security and economic interests in an uncertain Asia-Pacific region.</p>

President Trump's threat was explicitly linked to what he called a "witch hunt" trial against his political ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Lula stated that if negotiations fail, Brazil will enact its reciprocity law, escalating the risk of a trade war. The move represents a direct use of U.S. trade policy to interfere in the domestic legal affairs of another sovereign nation. (not investment advice)</p>

This move is part of a broader escalation of trade pressure, with the administration sending similar letters to dozens of other countries.
