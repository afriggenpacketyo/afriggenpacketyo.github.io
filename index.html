          <p>OpenAI has been awarded a $200 million contract to provide the U.S. Defense Department with artificial intelligence tools, marking the first contract between OpenAI and the department. The one-year contract aims to develop prototype AI capabilities for critical national security challenges in both warfighting and enterprise domains. This development follows OpenAI's previous announcement of collaboration with defense technology startup Anduril for deploying advanced AI systems. CEO Sam Altman has expressed OpenAI's commitment to engaging in national security areas, emphasizing the company's pride in contributing to these efforts. The contract is with OpenAI Public Sector LLC, with work primarily based in the National Capital Region. Optimism surrounding AI and national security is cautiously balanced with considerations of ethical implications.</p>

          <p>A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by faculty groups against the Trump administration regarding cuts to Columbia University's federal funding, which totaled $400 million, due to alleged antisemitism during pro-Palestinian protests. The judge, a Trump appointee, ruled that the faculty unions lacked the standing to sue and did not demonstrate a violation of law. The ruling supports the government's prerogative to withhold funding based on its assessment of antisemitism on campus. The American Association of University Professors has vowed to appeal the decision, viewing it as part of a broader authoritarian agenda affecting higher education and civil liberties.</p>

The park anticipates high demand, as reservations are already filling up quickly for the summer season. Visitors can still access the park using day passes if campgrounds are unavailable.

The investigation follows the approval of a 17% increase in State Farm's home insurance premiums and previous recoveries of $40 million for fire survivors after inquiries into consumer complaints.</p>

The ABA argues that the administration is coercing lawyers to abandon clients and causes it dislikes, violating the First Amendment. The White House calls the lawsuit frivolous, while the ABA claims a chilling effect has made it difficult to find firms willing to represent it in pro bono cases.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in research grants at the National Institutes of Health was illegal. The judge stated that the cuts, which targeted research with a perceived connection to diversity, equity, and inclusion, constituted unlawful racial discrimination and discrimination against the LGBTQ community. The judge ordered the reinstatement of grants previously awarded to organizations and states that filed the lawsuit. The ruling follows concerns raised by NIH employees about the cutting of over 2,100 research grants since Donald Trump took office.</p>

          <p>Senator Tim Kaine has introduced a war powers resolution to restrict President Trump's ability to take military action against Iran without congressional authorization. The resolution seeks to reassert Congress's constitutional authority over decisions of war and peace. Kaine expresses concern that escalating hostilities between Israel and Iran could draw the U.S. into another prolonged conflict. The measure faces challenges in the GOP-controlled Congress, where Republicans have generally been hesitant to challenge Trump's authority.</p>
