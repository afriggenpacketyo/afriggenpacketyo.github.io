          <p>The Wales women's national football team bus was involved in a crash in Switzerland while en route to a training session. The Football Association of Wales confirmed all players and staff on board were uninjured, though the driver of the other vehicle required medical attention. As a result, the team's scheduled training at the arena was cancelled, with head coach Rhian Wilkinson and captain Angharad James not being on the bus at the time. The team is reassessing its preparations for their upcoming Euro 2025 qualifier against France.</p>

The fifth seed defeated Karen Khachanov in a challenging quarterfinal match. After comfortably winning the first two sets, Fritz experienced a significant downturn in the third, which he lost 6-1.

          <p>An Australian jury has found Erin Patterson guilty of murdering three family members and attempting to murder a fourth by serving them a meal containing toxic death cap mushrooms. Prosecutors successfully argued she intentionally poisoned her relatives in 2023. Patterson's defense, which claimed she may have accidentally foraged the deadly fungi, was rejected by the jury. The article explains that death cap mushrooms contain a heat-stable toxin and are not native to Australia, growing only near specific introduced trees.</p>

          <p>India has suspended its participation in the 64-year-old Indus Waters Treaty, a critical water-sharing agreement with Pakistan, escalating regional tensions. The move, a retaliation for a militant attack India blames on Pakistan, puts Pakistan's water supply in a precarious position, as the Indus Basin irrigates most of its arid land. While experts believe immediate military conflict is unlikely, the suspension creates deep uncertainty and could be used by India to renegotiate the treaty's terms.

The 6-3 order lifted an injunction that had prevented the Trump administration from deporting individuals to third countries without due process, in this case to war-torn South Sudan. The article criticizes the Court for failing to provide any legal reasoning for its decision, effectively rewarding the administration's defiance of lower court orders.
