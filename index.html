          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sought to alleviate U.S. fears that the company's advanced chips could be utilized by China's military, stating that Beijing cannot rely on American technology that could be restricted at any time. In a recent interview, Huang argued that U.S. export controls are counterproductive, hindering the goal of making American technology a global standard, as half of the world's AI developers are in China. These comments come as Huang prepares for another trip to China and navigates the complex relationship between Washington's security policies and the company's significant market interests in the region.</p>

          <p>A rapidly expanding wildfire in the North Rim of the Grand Canyon has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and between 50 to 80 other structures. The Dragon Bravo Fire grew to 5,000 acres, fueled by strong winds, and also damaged a water treatment facility, causing a chlorine gas leak that forced firefighter evacuations. While all guests and employees were safely evacuated with no reported injuries, the loss of the iconic 1937 lodge represents a significant blow to the national park's heritage. Meanwhile, smoke from separate Canadian wildfires is causing poor air quality across the U.S. Midwest.</p>

          <h2>Hungary's Oldest Library Battles Beetle Infestation to Save 100,000 Historic Books</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 01:24:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Restoration experts at the 1,000-year-old Pannonhalma Archabbey in Hungary are undertaking a massive effort to save approximately 100,000 books from a severe drugstore beetle infestation. The insects, which feed on the starch-based adhesives in old bindings, have burrowed into a significant portion of the library's collection. To eradicate the pests, the books are being placed in a nitrogen-only environment for six weeks to suffocate the beetles. Officials at the UNESCO World Heritage site believe that rising temperatures due to climate change may have contributed to the unprecedented scale of the infestation by accelerating the beetles' life cycle.</p>

          <p>The biennial Talisman Sabre military exercise has begun in Australia, featuring over 35,000 personnel from 19 nations in the largest iteration of the drills to date. Originally a joint U.S.-Australia exercise, it now includes participants from across Europe and Asia, with some activities extending to Papua New Guinea for the first time. Australian officials anticipate that Chinese surveillance ships will monitor the exercises, a practice observed since 2017, but stated they will adjust their operations accordingly. The drills showcase Australia's defense alliances amid complex regional dynamics, occurring as the Australian Prime Minister visits China.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers are making substantial inroads in Norway, capturing approximately 10% of the market and posing a strong challenge to established brands like Tesla. This growth is notable as Norway, a global leader in EV adoption, does not impose tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, unlike the U.S. and EU. Consumers in Norway are increasingly receptive to Chinese brands such as BYD, XPeng, and MG, recognizing their competitive pricing and advanced technology. The Norwegian market is seen as a key entry point and testing ground for these brands to expand their presence across the European continent.</p>

          <p>An undercover investigation by BBC Panorama has exposed questionable sales tactics at two of the UK's largest estate agencies, Connells and Purplebricks. At a Connells branch, an agent appeared to sideline a cash buyer in favor of one who agreed to use the company's in-house mortgage services, a practice that boosts company profits but may disadvantage sellers. The investigation at Purplebricks revealed that staff were allegedly incentivized to secure price reductions on properties that were potentially overvalued to attract sellers. Both companies stated they are committed to fair practices and have policies against such behavior.</p>

          <p>A Nigerian woman living in the UK has been arrested on suspicion of trafficking after arriving from Nigeria with a baby she falsely claimed was her own. The woman, who had previously faked a pregnancy, was stopped at Gatwick Airport, and subsequent DNA tests proved she and her husband had no genetic link to the infant. An investigation for the Family Court uncovered forged medical documents and evidence suggesting the baby may have been purchased from a so-called "baby factory."

          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June compared to the previous year, exceeding economists' forecasts and buoyed by strong shipments to non-U.S. markets.

Imports also saw their first year-over-year increase of 2025, climbing 1.1%, signaling a potential shift from previously sluggish domestic demand.

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting by 0.5% in the first quarter.

Economists suggest the positive performance was partly due to businesses front-loading exports ahead of potential tariff changes.

          <h2>Australian Prime Minister Promotes Green Steel Cooperation with China</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a visit to Shanghai, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese advocated for closer cooperation with China on producing green steel, a method that uses renewable energy to reduce carbon emissions. While China is the largest consumer of Australian iron ore, the global shift toward decarbonization threatens this trade, as green steel production requires higher-grade ore found elsewhere. Albanese framed the partnership as an opportunity for mutual economic benefit and offered to help China address its steel overcapacity, which has caused trade friction with other nations. Australian mining companies are already piloting green iron projects.</p>

          <p>President Trump is urging Republican senators to support a bill that would rescind $1.1 billion in federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports outlets like NPR and PBS. While the move targets what the president deems biased national media, over 70% of the funding goes to local stations, many of which are in rural areas. For nearly half of these rural stations, federal grants constitute a quarter or more of their revenue. Some Republican senators from rural states, like Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have expressed opposition, warning that the cuts could eliminate vital local news and emergency information services.</p>

This grassroots resistance has emerged as arrests of undocumented immigrants have surged, with nearly 2,800 arrests in June alone. The article profiles the fear within the community and the determination of volunteers to protect their neighbors from what they describe as a war on immigrants.</p>

Ho also highlights a major demographic shift, describing how tourism has evolved from being predominantly Western-led to a "rainbow tourism" of people from all over the world.

While most modern weather data is automated, the observatory maintains its tradition of human observation, providing an invaluable historical record of climate patterns.

Macron emphasized that in the current geopolitical climate, being powerful is essential to being free. The proposed budget increase must still be approved by the French government.</p>
