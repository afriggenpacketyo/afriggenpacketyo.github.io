          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant downturn following the announcement of new U.S. tariffs by the Trump administration, sparking broad risk-off sentiment among investors. Major digital assets like Ether and XRP saw notable declines, triggering hundreds of millions in liquidations and causing crypto-linked stocks such as Coinbase to suffer even deeper losses. While institutional demand provided some support for Bitcoin, the new macro uncertainty casts a shadow over the market's recent gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new application named Balance is using artificial intelligence to help parents monitor their children's digital habits and mental health. The tool analyzes a child's language patterns, online tone, and activity levels to detect anomalies that could signal stress or mood shifts, aiming to foster family dialogue. While some parents find it useful for opening communication, critics point to the imperfections of AI and advocate for broader regulatory changes from lawmakers and tech companies.</p>

          <p>Authorities have revealed that Cristen Brink, one of the victims in the Devil's Den State Park killings, was fatally stabbed after she had guided her two young daughters to safety and then returned to help her husband. A 28-year-old former schoolteacher has been charged with two counts of capital murder for the attack, which police believe was random. The suspect's DNA was positively matched to evidence at the scene, and he has reportedly made an admission to the crime.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the effectiveness of popular portable neck cooling fans for combating extreme heat. While these gadgets can create a sensation of coolness by blowing air across the sensitive skin of the neck and face, experts caution that they do little to actually lower a person's core body temperature. In conditions of high humidity, their ability to aid the body's natural evaporative cooling process is limited, potentially giving users a false sense of security against heat-related illnesses.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reforming its primary civil service internship program to exclusively accept university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This policy aims to make the civil service more representative of the country and harness a broader range of talent. Those who successfully complete the internship will be fast-tracked in the selection process for the Fast Stream graduate program, a move the Conservative opposition has criticized as social engineering.</p>

          <p>In a move that has shocked the nation, Switzerland has been hit with a punitive 39% U.S. tariff rate, the highest imposed on any European country. Swiss leaders had previously expressed confidence in securing a much lower 10% rate, but last-minute negotiations with President Trump failed to produce an agreement. The high tariff, which the White House links to the U.S. trade deficit with Switzerland, poses a significant threat to key Swiss industries like pharmaceuticals and watchmaking.</p>

Such discoveries are relatively common in Lima, a capital city built upon hundreds of ancient archaeological sites, highlighting the rich history just beneath the modern surface.</p>

          <p>This article provides five essential guidelines for individuals considering adding an annuity to their retirement savings, particularly in the current climate of economic uncertainty. Important rules include keeping total annual fees below 1%, not committing funds unless you can wait at least a decade, and ensuring guaranteed income covers essential living expenses. It also advises limiting total annuity allocation to 25% of a portfolio and using the 4% withdrawal rule as a benchmark. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beginning August 1, interest will once again start to accrue for the approximately 8 million borrowers enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE repayment plan, who had been in zero-interest forbearance due to ongoing court challenges. According to one analysis, this change could increase monthly costs by an average of $300 for a typical borrower. The Department of Education described the move as a measure of "fiscal responsibility" as a new Trump-era repayment plan is developed. (not investment advice)</p>
