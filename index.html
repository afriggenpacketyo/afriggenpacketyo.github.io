          <p>Protests against immigration enforcement raids, initially sparked in Los Angeles, have expanded to cities across the U.S., prompting varied responses from law enforcement and officials. In Los Angeles, the Trump administration mobilized National Guard troops and Marines, leading to clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. Other cities, including Austin, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, have also seen demonstrations, with activists planning further events. The administration maintains it will continue its program of raids and deportations despite the widespread opposition, but the situation remains tense as local and federal authorities grapple with managing the protests and addressing concerns about immigration policies. The scale and intensity of the protests highlight deep divisions over immigration enforcement strategies. Optimism around this topic is low given the circumstances.</p>

          <p>Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly investing heavily in AI, with Meta nearing a $14 billion stake in Scale AI and aiming to recruit its CEO, Alexandr Wang, to bolster Meta's AI capabilities. Zuckerberg is frustrated with Meta's current standing in AI, especially after the underwhelming launch of the company's latest Llama AI models, and hopes Wang can improve Meta's execution in this area. By taking a stake in Scale AI instead of acquiring it outright, Meta is avoiding antitrust concerns, while gaining access to Wang's expertise and potentially insights into competitors like OpenAI. The move signals a significant shift in Meta's AI strategy, prioritizing product-oriented efforts to enhance its Llama family of AI models and compete more effectively in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. This may be a positive move for Meta as they try to improve their AI.</p>

          <p>Democratic Representative LaMonica McIver of New Jersey has been indicted on federal assault charges stemming from a clash outside a Newark ICE detention center. The charges include assaulting federal law enforcement officers during an incident last month, following an oversight visit to the Delaney Hall detention center. Tensions escalated during the visit, leading to a scuffle between law enforcement, lawmakers, and protesters, resulting in the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, whose charges have since been dropped. McIver's indictment adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing debate over immigration enforcement and congressional oversight of detention facilities. This event is not optimistic, considering the charges.</p>

          <p>Sting, the musician, has voiced strong criticism of successive governments for neglecting the North East of England, citing discouraging statistics for child poverty in the area. He is donating an undisclosed amount to the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead, aiming to give back to the culture that shaped him. Sting emphasized the historical contribution of the North East to national life, both industrial and cultural, and expressed disappointment in the empty promises of 'levelling up'. The government has responded by saying they are investing Â£140m in the seven most deprived towns in the North East as part of a wider Â£1.5bn investment across the country. This is a good move for the North East.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer discussed the need to cover stocks popular among younger investors, focusing on cryptocurrency, nuclear energy, and quantum computing sectors. He noted that younger investors are interested in companies like Hut 8, Riot Platforms, and CleanSpark in the crypto space, and Oklo, Cameco, and BWX Technologies in the nuclear sector. While acknowledging the speculative nature of some of these investments, particularly in quantum computing, Cramer emphasized the importance of shedding light on companies with significant trading activity. Cramer suggested that even though some of these stocks may not be immediately "investible," they warrant attention due to their popularity among a new generation of investors.

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has affirmed its independence after President Trump announced the firing of National Portrait Gallery head Kim Sajet, citing concerns about bias. The institution emphasized that personnel decisions are made by the Secretary with oversight from the Board of Regents, which includes Vice President JD Vance and Chief Justice John Roberts. The Smithsonian also addressed concerns about biased content, directing museum directors to ensure unbiased content and report back on progress. Trump signed an executive order placing Vance in charge of supervising efforts to remove "improper ideology" from the institution. The Smithsonian wants to remain unbiased.</p>

          <p>In the Sean "Diddy" Combs sexual assault trial, a former girlfriend testified that Combs considered himself the "Michael Jordan of sex parties." The witness, identified as "Jane," alleged she was coerced into participating in degrading sexual acts with male prostitutes for Combs' gratification. Defense attorneys challenged Jane's claims, highlighting affectionate messages and lavish gifts she received from Combs. The testimony provided conflicting accounts of her relationship with Combs, as prosecutors argue Combs used his wealth and influence to pressure women into sex and silence them, while the defense seeks to undermine claims of coercion.
