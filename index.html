Wise was on trial for allegedly encouraging rioters to attack police and entering the Capitol building, with video evidence showing him yelling "Kill 'em!" at officers.

Critics, including nurses and healthcare advocates, argue the bill is cruel and will harm vulnerable populations, including the 15 million Californians on Medi-Cal. Rep.

          <p>The House Judiciary Committee has issued subpoenas to Brown University and the University of Pennsylvania, escalating its antitrust probe into Ivy League institutions. The investigation is examining whether the universities engaged in illegal price-fixing by collectively raising tuition rates. It also questions if they used applicants' financial data to limit aid packages, a practice the committee likens to price discrimination. The committee stated that the universities' initial responses to document requests were "inadequate" and the information is needed to inform potential legislative reforms.</p>

          <p>A coalition of twenty states, led by California, is suing the Trump administration for illegally sharing sensitive Medicaid recipient data with the Department of Homeland Security. The lawsuit alleges that the transfer of personal health information, including names, addresses, and immigration status, violates federal privacy laws like HIPAA. The states argue this action creates a "culture of fear" that could deter people from seeking necessary medical care. The data was reportedly shared to aid in the administration's mass deportation campaign, a move HHS defended as legal.</p>

Reservoir levels in England are at their lowest for this time of year in over 30 years, impacting farmers, wildlife, and water supplies.

          <p>Real Madrid's decision to pay an Â£8.4m fee to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold a month before his Liverpool contract expired is already proving to be a sound investment. The early signing allowed him to play in the Club World Cup, where his assist in a key match helped the team advance. That single goal secured an extra Â£10m in prize money for the club, more than covering the initial transfer fee. The England right-back is adapting to his new team and a wing-back role under coach Xabi Alonso, growing in confidence with each game.</p>

          <h2>US Halts Some Pledged Weapons Shipments to Ukraine Citing Low American Stockpiles</h2>

          <p>The United States is pausing some weapons shipments to Ukraine that were previously promised, following a Pentagon review that raised concerns about declining U.S. military stockpiles. The White House stated the decision was made to "put America's interests first" and reflects the new administration's priorities. This move represents a setback for Ukraine as it faces escalating Russian attacks and a significant shift from the previous administration's robust military support. The Defense Department did not specify which weapons were being held back.</p>
