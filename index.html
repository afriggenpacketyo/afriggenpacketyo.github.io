            <p>In Guinea-Bissau, women protesters attacked a Chinese-run zircon mining site, alleging environmental damage to their farms. The protesters set fire to equipment, prompting the arrest of several women and a village leader. The interior minister expressed irritation over the destruction of property, while witnesses reported the involvement of hundreds of women in the protest. The Chinese companies have been working at the site since 2022 and the protesters claim their complaints have gone unheeded by the authorities.</p>

He will receive life in prison without parole under the plea deal, which was influenced by the wishes of a majority of the victims' relatives. Crusius has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms at the federal level for hate crimes and weapons charges.</p>

He offered to repatriate 252 Venezuelans in exchange for the release of 252 political prisoners.

            <p>China has cautioned nations against appeasing the United States in trade negotiations concerning President Donald Trump's tariffs. This warning follows reports that Washington plans to pressure countries into restricting trade with Beijing in exchange for exemptions from U.S. import taxes. A Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson stated that "appeasement cannot bring peace" and that China would take countermeasures if its interests are compromised. The Trump administration has initiated tariff talks with several trading partners, including Japan and South Korea.</p>

            <p>Canadian Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, once favored to become Canada's next prime minister, is facing challenges due to President Donald Trump's economic attacks on Canada. Poilievre, who has adopted Trump-like rhetoric and slogans, is seeing his poll numbers decline as Trump's actions have fueled nationalism in Canada. The election, initially expected to focus on Justin Trudeau's unpopularity, is now centered on who is best suited to deal with Trump. Trump has criticized Poilievre, despite the Conservative leader's attempts to align with some of Trump's policies.</p>

            <p>Ukraine's military reported Russian drone attacks across several regions shortly after the expiration of a 30-hour "Easter truce" declared by Moscow. Air raid alerts were issued for multiple regions, including Kyiv, and explosions were reported in Mykolaiv. Both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire. The BBC has not independently verified these claims, but the attacks suggest a rapid escalation of conflict following the brief truce period.

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared details about an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen in March in a second group chat using the messaging app Signal that included his wife, his brother and his personal lawyer. Those details shared in the second chat included the flight schedules for the F/A-18 Hornets involved in the pending attack on Houthi positions, according to the officials. The sharing of the details reportedly occurred around the same time in mid-March when key members of President Donald Trump's National Security Council, including Hegseth, inadvertently shared details about the March 15 missile strike in Yemen with the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic.</p>

The show's focus on undiluted pain and unrelenting cheerlessness, instead of a careful observation of animosity, has resulted in a more circular and suffocating storytelling experience.</p>
