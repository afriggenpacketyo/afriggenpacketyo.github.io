She was found on the riverbank and airlifted to a hospital in serious condition but passed away Saturday evening. The Foreign Office has confirmed the death and is in contact with local authorities. French prosecutors have opened an "involuntary manslaughter" investigation to determine the circumstances of the fatal incident.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly called for the Washington Commanders NFL team to "IMMEDIATELY" change its name back to the Redskins, a name dropped in 2020 due to its perception as a slur against Native Americans. He also urged the Cleveland Guardians baseball team to revert to being the Indians, claiming that Native American people want this to happen. Trump's statement argues the changes were made for political correctness and that the original names represented strength. The Commanders franchise has not commented on the renewed call for a name change.</p>

          <p>A protest outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, which is being used to house asylum seekers, descended into disorder with bottles and smoke flares thrown at police vehicles. The unrest follows the recent arrest of an asylum seeker on suspicion of sexual assault in the town. In response to the disorder, Essex Police implemented a Section 60AA order, allowing them to require the removal of face coverings. The force has stated it will deal robustly with any criminal behavior while respecting the right to peaceful protest.</p>

          <p>Palestinian health officials report that at least 94 Palestinians were killed by Israeli military fire on Sunday while attempting to access food aid in Gaza, marking one of the deadliest such incidents in months. The most severe event occurred in northern Gaza, where dozens were killed trying to get flour from UN trucks. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated its troops fired warning shots to remove an "immediate threat" and that their initial review does not align with the reported number of casualties.

          <p>Following a viral incident at a previous show, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin humorously warned concertgoers in Wisconsin that they might appear on the venue's large screens. This comes after Astronomer CEO Andy Byron resigned when a video showed him and a female colleague in an intimate moment during the "Jumbotron Song" segment of a concert. The original incident sparked widespread online discussion and memes, leading to significant professional consequences for the individuals involved. Coldplay has not directly addressed the fallout but has adjusted its on-stage banter.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign, even as exit polls project his ruling coalition is set to lose its majority in the upper house of parliament. The election was marked by public frustration over rising prices and the threat of U.S. tariffs. A loss of the majority in the upper house would weaken the coalition's legislative power, as it already lost its majority in the more powerful lower house last year. Analysts note the result reflects voter dissatisfaction with Ishiba's leadership and could destabilize the government during critical trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the AFC/M23 rebellion have signed a declaration of principles aimed at a peaceful resolution to their conflict, committing to a permanent ceasefire. However, experts and analysts remain skeptical, pointing to the challenge of implementation and immediate disagreements over key terms, such as the withdrawal of rebels from occupied zones. The deal, mediated in Qatar, sets a timeline for direct negotiations in August, but lacks enforcement penalties and has not yet addressed mechanisms for justice, raising doubts about its long-term success.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary, Steve Reed, has pledged to halve the number of sewage discharges by water companies by the year 2030, setting a clear target in response to public anger over water pollution. This announcement follows new data showing that serious pollution incidents in England rose by 60% in 2024 to a record high. Reed stated that the water sector is "broken" and that its regulator, Ofwat, is "clearly failing." The government plans a record £104 billion investment in the sector, which will be funded in part by increased consumer water bills.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance is reportedly planning to spend a family holiday in the Cotswolds region of England next month. The trip follows previous controversial remarks Vance made about the UK and Europe, including lashing out at European governments for what he described as suppressing free speech and failing to control migration. He also specifically criticized the Scottish government's policies regarding safe access zones around abortion clinics. The planned holiday comes as tourist traffic from the UK to the U.S. has reportedly declined.</p>
