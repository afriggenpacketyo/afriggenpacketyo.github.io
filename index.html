Additionally, South Korea will purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy products and has agreed to open its markets further to American goods, including vehicles and agricultural products.

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a second-quarter operating profit that was less than half of the previous year's figure, falling short of market expectations. The significant decline was primarily driven by a sharp downturn in its chip business, which saw profits plunge due to inventory adjustments and other costs. In contrast, the company's mobile division performed better, with robust sales of its Galaxy S25 and A series smartphones, and a major chip supply deal with Tesla is expected to provide a future boost.

          <p>A group of twelve Democratic members of Congress has sued the Trump administration, alleging that the Department of Homeland Security is illegally obstructing their constitutional oversight duties. The lawsuit claims that lawmakers have been systematically blocked or delayed from visiting and inspecting ICE detention centers, in violation of federal law. The administration has responded by instituting a new policy requiring one week's notice for such visits, citing the president's authority to oversee the executive branch and prevent interference. This legal action escalates an ongoing conflict over transparency and conditions at immigration facilities.</p>

          <p>Steve Ricchetti, a former top counselor to President Joe Biden, underwent a voluntary, eight-hour closed-door interview with the House Oversight Committee. The interview is part of a Republican-led investigation into whether White House aides concealed signs of the former president's mental decline. A source familiar with the meeting described Ricchetti as "combative and defensive," asserting that Biden was fully capable of performing his duties while acknowledging that his age was a political challenge the campaign had to manage. The lengthy session reflects the partisan nature of the ongoing probe.</p>

It outlines the key ingredients for tsunami generation, such as an underwater earthquake of at least magnitude 6.5 and significant vertical movement of the seafloor. The text describes how these waves travel at high speeds in deep water and become dangerous as they approach shallow coastlines. Experts stress the importance of immediately heading to higher ground upon receiving a warning, as the waves are powerful and often arrive in a series.</p>

          <p>A scientific expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered surprisingly abundant communities of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the northwest Pacific Ocean. Researchers observed and filmed extensive fields of clams, tube worms, and bacterial mats, challenging long-held beliefs about the scarcity of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are not fueled by sunlight but by chemicals like hydrogen sulfide and methane seeping from the Earth's crust, suggesting that such chemosynthetic communities may be more widespread in the deep ocean than previously thought.</p>

The recognition is contingent on the Palestinian Authority implementing significant reforms, including holding general elections in 2026 without the participation of Hamas. Israel's Foreign Ministry strongly condemned the decision, labeling it a "reward for Hamas" that undermines efforts to secure a ceasefire and the release of hostages. The move signals a coordinated shift in policy among key Western nations.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor has reinstated its full-year financial guidance after suspending it earlier due to tariff uncertainty, now projecting a net impact of $2 billion from the trade levies. The automaker reported second-quarter revenue that beat expectations but also posted a net loss of $36 million, largely due to special charges related to a major vehicle recall. The updated guidance forecasts adjusted earnings between $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion, which is lower than its pre-tariff estimate, reflecting the ongoing costs of trade disputes.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to explain its failure to comply with a previous court order to restore operations at Voice of America (VOA), the U.S. government-funded international news outlet. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth accused the administration of providing "cagey answers" and suggested it may be deliberately trying to "run out the clock" on the fiscal year to avoid spending the $260 million appropriated by Congress for the agency. The administration must respond by August 13, escalating a conflict over the agency's leadership and mission.</p>

The original criminal charge against Baldwin was dismissed last year after prosecutors were found to have withheld evidence. The judge dismissed this subsequent civil suit due to a lack of significant legal action in the case for over six months, though Baldwin's attorneys have a 30-day window to file a motion to keep the case active.</p>

          <p>This article explores a growing trend in television where audiences are increasingly drawn to anxiety-inducing shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt" over more traditional "comfort TV." These series often employ hyperrealistic, high-pressure narratives that unfold in real-time, creating a visceral sense of tension for the viewer. Experts suggest this style of storytelling resonates because it mirrors the stresses of modern work and life, providing a form of catharsis and reflecting a cultural desire for programming that feels authentic and grounded in reality.</p>

Her statement reflects deep concerns from hostage families that the policy could inadvertently disincentivize Hamas from agreeing to a ceasefire and releasing the remaining captives, thereby prolonging the conflict and their suffering.</p>
