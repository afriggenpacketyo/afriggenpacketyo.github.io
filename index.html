          <p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare announced it will now, by default, block AI crawlers from scraping data from websites using its services. This move aims to give content creators more control over their intellectual property and potentially create new revenue streams through a "pay per crawl" model. The decision could significantly impact AI companies like OpenAI and Google, which rely on vast amounts of web data to train their large language models. This policy shift addresses growing concerns that AI models are profiting from online content without compensating the original publishers, thereby disrupting the internet's traditional ad-based revenue system.</p>

          <p>Stocks for clean energy companies experienced a significant surge following the removal of a punitive tax on solar and wind projects from the Senate's version of a major Republican spending bill. The proposed tax, which targeted projects using components from foreign entities like China, would have imposed a multi-billion dollar burden on the industry. While the removal was a relief for investors, industry groups like the Solar Energy Industries Association remain critical of the overall bill. They caution that it still phases out key investment tax credits, undermining long-term growth and America's progress in renewable energy manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated he would not rule out a potential interest rate cut at the central bank's upcoming meeting in July, depending on how economic data evolves. Speaking at a European Central Bank forum, Powell emphasized the Fed's focus on its dual mandate of controlling inflation and maximizing employment, deflecting questions about political pressure from President Trump. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde expressed solidarity, stating she and other central bankers would act exactly as Powell has. The remarks come as the Fed has held rates steady for six months, with a majority of its board members still projecting two rate cuts by the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>President Trump's major tax and spending bill passed the Senate by a narrow 51-50 margin, requiring a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance after three Republican senators voted against it.

Collins expressed deep concerns over proposed Medicaid cuts that would affect nearly a third of her constituents in Maine. Tillis also argued against the Medicaid provisions, while Paul, a fiscal conservative, opposed the bill for not including significant reductions to the debt ceiling.

          <p>Athletic apparel brand Lululemon has filed a lawsuit against wholesale retailer Costco, accusing it of selling copies of its patented designs under the Kirkland Signature brand. The lawsuit claims Costco is illegally profiting from Lululemon's reputation and innovation by offering lower-priced "dupes" of its popular products. Lululemon, which generated over $10 billion in revenue last year, stated it takes the protection of its intellectual property very seriously. The legal action highlights the growing trend of fast-fashion and private-label brands replicating designs from established luxury companies, often promoted on social media with hashtags like #LululemonDupes.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to create a "temporary pass" for certain undocumented agricultural and hospitality workers has generated significant debate among conservatives. The plan would grant legal status and tax-paying ability, but not citizenship, to long-term workers, with farmers taking responsibility for them. While the White House frames it as a prioritization of enforcement on violent criminals, some critics, like the Center for Immigration Studies, call it a selective enforcement of the law that rewards unscrupulous employers. The controversy reveals a rift between those focused on deporting all undocumented immigrants and those concerned about the economic impact on key industries like farming.</p>

Despite this historic feat and hitting 37 aces, Mpetshi Perricard ultimately lost the epic five-set match to the fifth seed, Taylor Fritz. Ironically, the record-setting 153 mph serve was returned by Fritz, and Mpetshi Perricard lost the point, underscoring that sheer power does not always guarantee victory in the sport's highest echelons.</p>

Apple claims Liu concealed his new job at Snap, a maker of smart glasses, to maintain access to sensitive files.

The push includes forming a "Meta Superintelligence Labs" unit, co-led by recently acquihired Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, to develop next-generation models.

          <p>The Republican-led spending bill passed by the Senate includes a new temporary tax deduction aimed at providing relief for seniors, framed as a "senior bonus." The proposal would offer a deduction of up to $6,000 for eligible taxpayers aged 65 and over, phasing out for those with higher incomes. This approach differs from President Trump's campaign promise to eliminate all taxes on Social Security benefits, a change prohibited under the budget reconciliation process used to pass the bill. While the White House touts the measure as a tax cut, critics note it would also accelerate the insolvency dates for Social Security and Medicare trust funds. (not investment advice)</p>

Historically, successful third parties have acted as "spoilers," influencing major party platforms by drawing away votes rather than winning seats themselves.

His admission provides context for the Fed's recent wait-and-see approach despite public pressure from the White House to lower borrowing costs.

Other smart uses include funding strategic home renovations that boost resale value, investing in a diversified portfolio, starting or expanding a small business, or financing education to increase long-term earning potential.

          <p>British number one Jack Draper secured a confident start to his Wimbledon campaign, advancing to the second round after his opponent, Sebastian Baez, retired due to injury. Draper, seeded fourth, was leading comfortably with a score of 6-2, 6-2, 2-1 when the Argentine clay-court specialist withdrew. The injury occurred after Baez slipped on the Court One baseline during the second set. As the host nation's leading hope, particularly following Andy Murray's retirement, the 23-year-old Draper's performance was a commanding display. He is set to face veteran Marin Cilic, the 2017 runner-up, in his next match.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cited a single 2017 study to justify cutting over a billion dollars in U.S. funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. However, vaccine experts interviewed by NPR raise serious questions about the study's validity, noting it relies on data from the early 1980s in Guinea-Bissau, when infant mortality was extremely high. They also point out that the vaccine in question is an outdated formula, and the study's own authors published a more recent paper with contradictory findings. Global health officials warn that defunding Gavi, which vaccinates millions of children in low-income countries, could have devastating and deadly consequences.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Swaggart, a pioneering televangelist whose global ministry was famously rocked by a sex scandal, has died at the age of 90. At his peak in the 1980s, his televised sermons reached millions and his ministry brought in over $140 million annually. His career was permanently damaged in 1988 after he was photographed with a sex worker, leading to a tearful, nationally broadcast apology where he admitted to sinning against his followers. Despite being defrocked and facing another scandal three years later, Swaggart continued to preach and run his ministry, including the SonLife Broadcasting Network, from his base in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.</p>

Key provisions include over $75 billion for border security and immigrant detention, new work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps, and an increase in the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap.

          <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island has issued a preliminary injunction, halting the Trump administration's plan for mass layoffs and a major restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The judge ruled that the states challenging the plan were likely to succeed in their claim that the action was "arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to law." The lawsuit, brought by 19 Democratic attorneys general, argued the reorganization would cause "devastating consequences" and interrupt critical public health services nationwide. The order blocks HHS from finalizing the announced layoffs of over 10,000 employees and proceeding with plans to consolidate numerous health agencies.</p>

The Senate and House versions differ on the deduction cap and income eligibility, and the tax break is set to expire in 2028. Critics argue the policy is a poor way to help low-wage workers, as over a third of tipped employees earn too little to owe federal income tax anyway. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the process can take several years and will negatively impact one's credit score.

          <p>A growing trend of high-profile politicians from both parties using defamation lawsuits as a political weapon is raising alarms among legal and First Amendment experts. While President Trump has been notably litigious, California Governor Gavin Newsom's recent suit against Fox News signals a potential bipartisan escalation of the tactic. Experts worry this trend has a chilling effect on speech and journalism, putting news organizations on high alert. The use of lawsuits by sitting officials who hold regulatory power over media companies is seen as particularly pernicious, as it can pressure outlets into settlements to avoid jeopardizing unrelated business matters, such as pending mergers.</p>

          <p>A new vote count has officially confirmed Zohran Mamdani as the winner of New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, cementing his stunning victory over former governor Andrew Cuomo. The final ranked-choice voting tabulation showed the 33-year-old democratic socialist winning by a decisive 12-point margin. Mamdani's energetic, populist campaign focused on the cost of living and is seen by some as a new blueprint for progressive Democrats. He will now face incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa in the November general election, while Cuomo considers a potential independent run.</p>
