          <p>Two men, Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, have been named as the victims of the terrorist attack at a Manchester synagogue. The incident occurred on Yom Kippur when an attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, used a car to ram into people before carrying out a stabbing spree. Greater Manchester Police confirmed that one of the victims was tragically killed by police gunfire aimed at the assailant, who was also shot dead at the scene. The attack has left the community in shock, with three other individuals remaining hospitalized with serious injuries.</p>

          <p>Jihad Al-Shamie, the 35-year-old British citizen of Syrian descent who carried out the Manchester synagogue attack, was not previously known to counter-terrorism authorities. Neighbors in Prestwich described him as a quiet weightlifting enthusiast who kept to himself, alternating between Western and traditional Syrian clothing. His family released a statement condemning the attack, expressing their profound shock and distancing themselves from his actions. Al-Shamie, who entered the UK as a child and became a citizen in 2006, lived a seemingly ordinary life, leaving authorities and his community struggling to understand his motivations for the deadly assault.</p>

          <p>Former New South Wales police officer Beau Lamarra-Condon has pleaded not guilty to the murders of his ex-boyfriend, Jesse Baird, and Baird's partner, Luke Davies. In a court appearance, Lamarra-Condon claimed prosecutors had rejected his offer to plead guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter for Baird's death. He is accused of using his service pistol in the February 2024 killings, which police allege followed months of predatory behavior. Lamarra-Condon also made allegations of police misconduct and corruption, stating he wants the public to know the "actual truth" as his trial is set for September of the following year.</p>

          <p>Balin Miller, a 23-year-old accomplished climber from Alaska, died after falling from El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. The incident reportedly occurred while he was livestreaming on TikTok after completing a solo climb of the challenging "Sea of Dreams" route. His brother suggested he may have rappelled off the end of his rope while retrieving his final piece of gear. Miller was celebrated in the climbing community, particularly for his solo ascent of Mount McKinley's Slovak Direct.

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues for IRS Reform, Citing Disproportionate Audits on Small Businesses</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) disproportionately targets small businesses and middle-class families, creating an unfair system that stifles economic growth. The author contends that while the agency claims to focus on the wealthy, over 90% of its audits are directed at those earning under $400,000, as it is easier than confronting large corporations with extensive legal resources. The piece calls for reforms, including transparent metrics for audit selections, improved taxpayer services, and an independent appeals process. It suggests that the current approach discourages entrepreneurship and creates a chilling effect on business expansion and job creation.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests President Trump is adopting a strategy similar to Richard Nixon's by pressuring the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates for short-term political advantage ahead of midterm elections. This approach aims to stimulate the economy and stock market to secure a favorable Congress, despite the long-term risks of high inflation, as seen in the 1970s. While the US economy currently appears solid, Trump's actions, including potential changes to the Fed's leadership, could destabilize financial markets and undermine the central bank's independence. The article posits that the potential for long-term economic damage may not deter a political strategy focused on immediate electoral success. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Republican-sponsored bill, the Stop Illegal Entry Act, proposes mandatory minimum prison sentences for migrants who re-enter the U.S. illegally and commit other crimes. The legislation would impose a five-year minimum for those committing a crime punishable by over one year in prison, and a ten-year minimum for crimes punishable by up to two years. Criminal justice reform groups criticize the bill as a draconian measure that would lead to mass incarceration, overwhelm federal courts, and cost taxpayers billions. Critics argue that such severe penalties are unlikely to deter migration, which is often driven by urgent needs like fleeing violence or reuniting with family.</p>

          <p>A growing number of recent college graduates are struggling to find full-time employment, challenging the long-held belief that a bachelor's degree guarantees access to white-collar jobs. Federal data indicates that the unemployment rate for new workforce entrants has reached a nine-year high, with the gap between graduates and those with only a high school diploma narrowing significantly. This trend is attributed to a "low-hiring" environment, increased competition from a larger pool of graduates, and concerns over automation and AI impacting entry-level roles. The situation has led to widespread discouragement among young adults, altering their career expectations and financial outlook.</p>

The Ministry of Transport reported year-on-year increases across various travel modes, including a 20.5% rise in waterway passengers and a 3.2% increase in air travelers.

The exemption is a significant relief for the booming vinyl industry, which has seen a resurgence driven by artists like Taylor Swift and younger consumers.

          <p>This commentary argues that the international call to boycott the Israeli film industry is a counterproductive strategy for achieving political change. The author highlights that Israeli cinema, though often state-funded, is a crucial medium for internal critique, frequently exploring contentious issues like the occupation and militarism. Using the award-winning film "The Sea" as an example, the article contends that boycotts harm artists who challenge the status quo from within. Instead of isolating these critical voices, the international film community should engage with and support them, as their stories have the potential to change Israeli public opinion more effectively than external pressure.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of the TrumpRx website and a deal with Pfizer to lower Medicaid drug prices is unlikely to provide significant savings for most consumers, according to analysis. The TrumpRx platform, which offers cash-price discounts, primarily benefits the uninsured, who may find better deals on existing sites like GoodRx. For the insured, using their plan remains more advantageous for meeting deductibles. Furthermore, the details of the Pfizer deal are confidential and voluntary, making it unclear if it will generate substantial savings for Medicaid, which already receives significant discounts, or have any direct effect on patients' out-of-pocket costs.</p>

While Aston Martin is not widely expected to be a top contender for pole position, the team is hopeful for a strong performance on the low-speed Marina Bay street circuit, which suits their car's high-downforce design.

          <h2>New UK Data Reveals Significant and Lasting 'Motherhood Penalty' on Women's Earnings</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data from the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) reveals that mothers face a substantial and prolonged reduction in their earnings after having children. Five years after the birth of their first child, a mother's monthly earnings are, on average, over £1,000 lower than before they had children, a phenomenon known as the "motherhood penalty." Campaign groups attribute this gap to a combination of unaffordable childcare, an unbalanced parental leave system, and maternity discrimination. The findings highlight how the gender pay gap is deeply intertwined with motherhood, as women's career and earning trajectories are significantly impacted by starting a family.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is beginning its new term with a docket featuring major social and political cases, including challenges to state bans on "conversion therapy" and laws targeting transgender athletes. A significant portion of the term will also be dedicated to legal battles over President Trump's executive actions, such as his sweeping tariffs, his authority to fire officials at independent agencies without cause, and his efforts to end birthright citizenship. With a 6-3 conservative majority, the court's decisions in these cases will have profound implications for the separation of powers and the scope of presidential authority in shaping national policy.</p>

          <p>Kim Aris, the son of Myanmar's detained former leader Aung San Suu Kyi, has publicly appealed to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help secure his mother's release from prison. Aris, who has historically avoided media attention, stepped forward due to growing concerns over his mother's deteriorating health and poor prison conditions following the 2021 military coup. He urged President Xi to exert more pressure on the military junta to free his mother and other political prisoners. His appeal highlights a shift in strategy, turning to a key regional power for diplomatic intervention in Myanmar's ongoing political crisis.</p>

          <p>Electronic shelf labels are increasingly replacing paper price tags in major U.S. grocery chains like Walmart, Kroger, and Whole Foods, allowing for rapid, app-based price updates. This technology streamlines operations and can help reduce food waste by enabling quick markdowns on perishable items. However, some lawmakers have raised concerns that these digital tags could facilitate "dynamic pricing," where stores might surge prices during peak demand, weather events, or other factors to maximize profits. While grocery retailers deny any plans for surge pricing, the debate over the technology's potential impact on consumers and market fairness continues to grow.</p>

          <p>A viral food trend known as "Dubai chocolate" has become ubiquitous in stores and on social media, prompting questions about its sudden popularity. The confection, a chocolate bar filled with pistachio cream, tahini, and crispy knafeh pastry, was created in 2021 by a Dubai-based chocolatier but exploded in 2023 after being featured in a viral TikTok video. Its appeal stems from its visually striking, gooey interior, which is ideal for social media content, and its expensive ingredients that lend it an air of luxury. The trend is not a government-backed promotion but a classic example of a product achieving global fame through influencer marketing and online virality.</p>

          <p>Conservationists at the Fort Worth Zoo are undertaking an ambitious mission to save the endangered Houston toad from extinction through a sophisticated assisted reproduction program. Scientists are using techniques like hormone injections and genetic matchmaking to breed thousands of toads in captivity, which are then released into protected habitats. The species, once common in southeast Texas, has declined by over 90% due to habitat loss and the introduction of non-native species. The recovery effort also involves collaborating with private landowners to restore the toad's natural ecosystem, highlighting a hopeful but complex strategy to bring a species back from the brink.</p>

          <p>Talks among the seven states dependent on the dwindling Colorado River have reached an impasse, with environmental groups criticizing the lack of transparency surrounding the negotiations. With the river's flow reduced by 20% and reservoirs at critically low levels, states are failing to agree on how to implement necessary water cuts before current rules expire in 2026. The primary conflict is between the lower basin states (California, Arizona, Nevada) and the upper basin states (Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico) over the allocation of reductions. Critics argue that the secretive, backroom nature of the talks prevents public input and accountability, delaying urgently needed action.</p>
