        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced that maintenance grants will be reintroduced for some university students in England by 2029, a decade after they were abolished. The grants, which do not need to be repaid, will be targeted at tens of thousands of students from lower-income households who are enrolled in courses deemed essential to the national industrial strategy. The policy will be funded by a new levy on international student fees. While the move has been welcomed by student groups as a step toward addressing the rising cost of living, some critics have raised concerns about taxing international students to fund domestic ones.</p>

          <p>Eli Sharabi, who was held hostage by Hamas for 491 days, has shared the harrowing details of his captivity in the tunnels beneath Gaza and the profound loss he discovered upon his release. He endured beatings and inhumane conditions, sustained by the belief that his wife and two daughters were alive and campaigning for his freedom. Upon his release, he learned the devastating truth that they, along with his brother, were killed during the October 7th attack. Despite the immense tragedy, Sharabi, who details his ordeal in his book "Hostage," expresses a powerful message of optimism and a determination to rebuild his life.</p>

          <p>Luxury brand Coach is opening a series of coffee shops attached to its retail stores as a strategy to enhance customer experience and strengthen its connection with younger shoppers, particularly Gen Z. These cafes offer specialty drinks and branded pastries, providing a more accessible entry point to the Coach brand than its high-end leather goods. The company plans to open 12 to 15 new locations globally each year, building on the success of initial test locations that have reportedly driven significant increases in foot traffic and overall store sales. This move is part of Coach's broader effort to become a $10 billion brand.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has announced his intention to impose significant tariffs on any country that does not manufacture its furniture within the United States, specifically targeting China. In a social media post, he vowed to implement the policy to revitalize the American furniture industry in states like North Carolina, which he claims has been lost to foreign competition. This follows previous suggestions that such duties could reach as high as 100% or even 200%. China is currently the world's largest producer and exporter of furniture, accounting for over a quarter of the global market share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to U.S. Vice-President JD Vance, the Trump administration is considering a request from Ukraine for long-range Tomahawk missiles, which could potentially strike targets deep within Russia. This development signals a potential shift in U.S. policy, as Kyiv has long argued that such capabilities are necessary to disrupt Russia's military industry and pressure Moscow into peace negotiations. The Kremlin has downplayed the potential impact of such weapons. The consideration comes as President Trump's tone on the conflict has changed, recently suggesting that Ukraine could win back all its territory, a departure from his previous skepticism.</p>

Adams, who was running as an independent following a dismissed federal indictment, warned against the "divisive agendas" of unnamed rivals in his announcement.

          <p>This article examines the stark contrast between two speeches at the memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk: one from his widow, Erika Kirk, who offered forgiveness to his killer based on her Christian faith, and another from Donald Trump, who stated he hates his opponents. The piece analyzes this divergence as emblematic of a broader trend within a segment of American Christianity that appears to embrace the MAGA movement's ethos of vengeance over traditional teachings of love and mercy. It suggests that for some, political identity and culture-war grievances have become more central than the transformative principles of their faith.</p>

          <p>For the first time in nearly two decades, enrollment in Medicare Advantage is expected to fall, with projections showing a drop to 34 million in 2026 from nearly 35 million this year. Health insurers are scaling back unprofitable plans and exiting some markets due to shrinking profits caused by rising medical costs and new government reimbursement regulations. Consequently, seniors may face higher premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums for 2026 plans. Analysts also note a significant increase in insurers eliminating broker commissions for less profitable plans, potentially making it harder for beneficiaries to find and enroll in them.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the housing market shifts, experts suggest that this fall could present a unique opportunity for homebuyers, though potential drawbacks exist. Advantages include less competition compared to the peak spring and summer seasons and the possibility of lenders offering year-end incentives. However, the trade-off is often a lower inventory of homes for sale. While mortgage rates have recently declined following a Federal Reserve rate cut, there is a chance they could drop further, meaning buyers who act now might miss out on even lower rates later, though waiting also carries risks.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young Americans are choosing careers in skilled trades like plumbing and electrical work over traditional four-year college degrees. This shift is driven by concerns over high tuition costs, student loan debt, and the increasing threat of artificial intelligence automating white-collar, entry-level jobs. According to a recent survey, 77% of Gen Z members consider it important that their future job is difficult to automate. As a result, professions that require hands-on skills are losing their former stigma and are now seen as providing greater job security and viable paths to entrepreneurship.</p>

          <p>International sanctions on Iran have been automatically reinstated after the UK, France, and Germany triggered the "snapback" mechanism of the 2015 nuclear deal. The European powers cited Iran's non-compliance, including excessive uranium enrichment, as the reason for the move, which restores a full embargo on weapons, oil exports, and international banking. This development is expected to severely impact Iran's economy, likely causing its currency to collapse and exacerbating inflation and unemployment.
