          <p>Country music star Carrie Underwood is increasingly embracing a traditional, self-sufficient lifestyle on her farm near Nashville, Tennessee. Along with her husband and two sons, she practices homesteading by growing her own produce, raising livestock, and engaging in activities like canning and crocheting. Underwood has shared her goal of eventually no longer needing to buy food from stores, highlighting how her family's meals are often sourced directly from their garden or from hunting. This shift reflects a desire for a simpler life with a focus on sustainability and eliminating food waste.</p>

          <p>A BBC News investigation has exposed a massive, fraudulent music festival called Monmouth Rising, orchestrated by convicted fraudster James Kenny. The event promised a star-studded lineup including The Killers and was billed as the world's first hydrogen-powered festival, but it was built on a foundation of lies. Kenny deceived employees, suppliers, and even government bodies with forged documents and false claims of major investors and artist bookings. The scheme unraveled when payments failed to materialize, leaving many unpaid and revealing the entire festival to be a complete fabrication.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing changes to licensing rules to shield pubs and music venues from noise complaints, aiming to revitalize struggling town centers. The reforms would require developers building near existing venues to install soundproofing and would fast-track permissions for new businesses in designated areas. This initiative seeks to promote outdoor dining and reverse the decline in the pub industry, which has seen numerous closures due to economic pressures and legal battles over noise. While the government touts the changes as cutting red tape, the opposition criticizes the hypocrisy, blaming Labour's tax policies for the industry's struggles.</p>

However, the initiative faces significant hurdles, including the need for an estimated $4 billion in funding and infrastructural challenges like an unstable power supply.

          <p>A 42-year-old man has been taken into custody after stabbing eleven people in what authorities are describing as a random attack at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan. The incident occurred on a Saturday afternoon near the store's checkout area, leaving six victims in critical condition and five in serious condition. A sheriff's deputy arrived within three minutes of the 911 call, and citizen involvement was credited with helping to apprehend the suspect. Governor Gretchen Whitmer condemned the "brutal act of violence," and the FBI is assisting the local sheriff's office in the investigation.</p>

          <p>Fan Chunli, a 50-year-old woman from rural China, has become a stand-up comedy sensation by telling jokes about her abusive ex-husband and patriarchal norms. Her performances, which blend humor with poignant social commentary, have resonated deeply with audiences but have also drawn the ire of some government officials. An official warning was issued by one provincial government against jokes that "provoke" gender conflict, reflecting the Communist Party's sensitivity towards feminist discourse. Fan's rise highlights both the power of comedy as an outlet for grievances and the tight constraints on social expression in modern China.</p>

          <p>Four people, including a husband and wife, have been arrested in Fort White, Florida, on charges of aggravated child abuse involving nine children. The suspects are accused of horrific acts, including keeping some of the children in plywood cages built under bunk beds and spraying them with vinegar as punishment. Prosecutors allege the adopted children in the home were treated unfairly, beaten with canes, and given unprescribed medication. The investigation began after a church member raised concerns, leading to the removal of all children from the home.</p>

          <p>A senior Chinese official's recent call to "confidently and clearly explain" the history of ancient kingdoms in northeastern China has raised concerns about reigniting historical disputes with South Korea. The party chief of Jilin province referred to the ancient kingdoms of Fuyu, Gaogouli, and Bohai, which are known in Korea as Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae and are considered central to Korean history. This issue of historical interpretation has long been a sensitive point in China-South Korea relations. The official's remarks risk reviving tensions over the historical narrative and sovereignty of these ancient states.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Citizens Complain Online as Government Censors Coverage of Deadly Mass Attacks</h2>

          <p>China's government is increasingly suppressing information about mass attacks, such as recent incidents where drivers have struck pedestrians, leading to public pushback online. After a car hit people near a Beijing school, authorities released a vague statement and scrubbed photos from the internet, prompting calls for "the truth" on social media. This censorship, which has intensified since a particularly deadly attack in November, is seen as a way to prevent copycat crimes and allow local officials to hide failures. However, the lack of transparency is frustrating some citizens who are demanding basic information about these events.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival, civilian-led government, a move that significantly deepens the country's crisis and raises fears of a permanent partition. The new administration, with RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo as president, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government. This development stokes fears of escalating the 27-month civil war that has already displaced millions and pushed the population to the brink of famine. The UN has warned that this action risks further fragmenting Sudan and undermining diplomatic peace efforts.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced that he had spoken with the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia, who he said agreed to an immediate ceasefire following recent deadly border clashes. Both nations thanked Trump for his efforts, with Cambodia accepting the ceasefire proposal and Thailand emphasizing the need for dialogue first. Despite the diplomatic intervention, shelling reportedly continued along the border overnight. The conflict, which has killed over 30 people and displaced thousands, stems from a long-standing territorial dispute, and it remains unclear if this high-profile mediation will lead to a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Turkey has set a new national heat record, with meteorologists registering a temperature of 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 Fahrenheit) in the southeastern town of Silopi. This record comes as a severe heatwave grips much of the eastern Mediterranean, with temperatures in Turkey up to 12 degrees higher than seasonal averages. The extreme heat, combined with dry conditions and strong winds, has fueled dozens of disastrous wildfires across the country, resulting in evacuations and multiple fatalities. The situation highlights the severe impacts of extreme weather events affecting the region.</p>
