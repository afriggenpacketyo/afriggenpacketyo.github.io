          <p>UK government borrowing hit £20.2 billion in September, the highest for that month in five years, according to the Office for National Statistics. This increase, driven by rising debt interest payments and public spending, poses a significant challenge for Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the upcoming Budget. Analysts project the government will need to raise substantial funds, primarily through higher household taxes, to meet its financial rules. Public sector debt now stands at 95.3% of GDP, a level not seen since the early 1960s, intensifying pressure on fiscal policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A potential tragedy was averted at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport when authorities arrested Billy Cagle, 49, for allegedly threatening a mass shooting. Cagle's family alerted police after he streamed his intentions on social media, leading to his apprehension inside a terminal. Officers later found an AR-15 assault rifle with ammunition in his truck. Officials noted Cagle, a felon with mental health challenges, was charged with terroristic threats and attempted aggravated assault, highlighting effective community and law enforcement collaboration in preventing violence.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi has been elected Japan's first female Prime Minister, securing a majority in parliament as leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The 64-year-old conservative faces significant domestic challenges, including rising cost-of-living and public dissatisfaction, as well as complex international relations with South Korea and China. Her victory, achieved after a last-minute deal with an opposition party, comes during an uncertain economic period and aims to rebuild public trust in the LDP. Her appointment is a historic milestone for Japan, though some question her conservative stance on women's issues.</p>

          <p>Myanmar's military has raided KK Park, a notorious cyberscam center near the Thai border, detaining over 2,000 individuals and seizing dozens of unlicensed Starlink satellite internet terminals. The operation, part of a broader crackdown on online fraud, targeted a hub infamous for holding foreign workers captive and forcing them into criminal activities. While the military attributes the center's operation to an ethnic minority militia, the group denies involvement. This move highlights efforts to combat widespread online scams originating from the region.</p>

          <p>Australia's cricket captain, Alyssa Healy, will miss the Women's World Cup match against England due to a minor calf strain sustained in training. This injury, though minor, casts uncertainty on her further participation in the 50-over tournament. Healy has been a pivotal player, scoring 142 runs against India and an unbeaten 113 against Bangladesh, helping the defending champions secure a semi-final spot with two games remaining. Beth Mooney will step in as wicketkeeper, and Tahlia McGrath is set to captain the side. The team hopes for her swift recovery to bolster their chances in the crucial knockout stages.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly advancing in artificial intelligence, aiming to become the world's leading AI power by 2030, with projected spending nearing $100 billion in 2025. Despite U.S. export controls on advanced chips, Chinese firms like DeepSeek and Alibaba are developing powerful, cost-efficient AI models and expanding data centers globally. This progress, fueled by a large user base and intense domestic competition, has prompted warnings from industry leaders about U.S. complacency. China is also exporting AI infrastructure and governance frameworks, seeking to shape global standards.</p>

          <p>Demolition work has commenced on parts of the White House's East Wing to construct a new ballroom, a project former President Donald Trump insists will be paid for by himself and donors. Despite lacking federal agency approval, construction equipment was seen tearing down the facade. Trump stated the $250 million ballroom, designed to be separate from the existing landmark, will offer views of the Washington Monument and accommodate up to 999 people. This initiative follows previous changes Trump made to the White House during his presidency, drawing criticism from some who deem it an "utter desecration."</p>

Wallace emphasized that Giuffre sought accountability for all men involved in her trafficking. While Andrew's move is seen as a symbolic step, calls for formal removal of titles persist, underscoring the ongoing impact of these allegations on the royal family.</p>

          <p>Australian scientists have discovered two new deep-sea species: a semi-transparent, almond-sized crab and a tiny, glowing lantern shark. These discoveries were made during a 2022 research voyage in the Gascoyne Marine Park off Western Australia, a region rich in biodiversity yet largely unexplored. The bioluminescent West Australian Lantern Shark was found over 600m deep, while the porcelain crab, a filter feeder, was located at 122m. These findings are part of approximately 20 new species unearthed so far, with hundreds more awaiting description, highlighting the vast unknown life in Earth's oceans.</p>

          <p>Exporters at China's Canton Fair are observing a growing trend in yuan-denominated trade settlements, particularly with customers from Southeast Asia and Central Asian nations. Companies report that yuan-settled orders now account for 10-20% of their total exports, a significant increase from last year's single digits. This shift is driven by Chinese suppliers building data center projects overseas and developing countries' need for power infrastructure, encouraging new clients to consider using the yuan. The trend suggests a warming sentiment towards the Chinese currency in international transactions. (not investment advice)</p>
