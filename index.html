          <p>San-ikukai Hospital in Tokyo reported the first use of its "baby hatch" since opening on March 31st, providing a safe avenue for distressed parents to anonymously leave infants they cannot raise. This is the second such facility in Japan, following Jikei Hospital in Kumamoto Prefecture. The Tokyo hospital aims to be the "last line of defense" for vulnerable babies, addressing rising cases of unplanned pregnancies and infant abandonment. The hospital also offers a "confidential birth" system and ensures staff attend to babies within one minute of being left at the hatch before notifying a child welfare center.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her first major speech since the 2024 election, criticizing President Trump's administration and its policies. Speaking at an Emerge America event in San Francisco, Harris specifically targeted Trump's tariffs, calling them "reckless" and warning they could lead to a recession. She argued that the tariffs would hurt workers and families by raising the cost of everyday essentials and devastate retirement accounts and small businesses. Harris also touched on Trump's immigration policies, expressing concern over the detention and deportation of American citizens without due process, emphasizing the need for courage and resistance in the face of fear.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has revised its economic and inflation projections downward for the current fiscal year, citing concerns over the impact of U.S. tariffs on the Japanese economy. The central bank now expects the economy to grow by 0.5 percent, down from its previous forecast of 1.1 percent, and core consumer prices are projected to rise by 2.2 percent, compared to an earlier forecast of 2.4 percent. Despite these revisions, the BOJ maintained its benchmark interest rate, leaving it unchanged at around 0.5 percent. The bank cited the uncertainty surrounding trade policies and their potential effects on overseas economic activity and prices as reasons for the cautious outlook.</p>

          <p>European auto giants, including Stellantis, Mercedes, and Volvo Cars, are suspending or cutting their full-year financial guidance due to uncertainties related to President Trump's trade tariffs.

Volkswagen and Porsche also acknowledged the impact of trade restrictions and political uncertainty on their financial outlook. While some analysts noted that Trump's move to ease car tariffs provided partial relief, they emphasized that long-term capital allocation decisions would remain on hold until there is greater certainty regarding the permanence and magnitude of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>The trial of Erin Patterson, accused of poisoning her family with a mushroom lunch, began with testimony from her estranged husband, Simon Patterson. He stated it was "very rare" for her to host social gatherings at home and that he declined an invitation to the fatal meal. Three relatives died after the lunch, and Patterson has pleaded not guilty, claiming she "panicked" after unintentionally serving poison. The prosecution alleges Patterson invited the group to lunch under the pretense of having cancer.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed optimism about reaching a trade deal with China, despite his own trade envoy, Jamieson Greer, stating that no official trade negotiations were underway. Trump reiterated his view that the U.S. had been "ripped off" by China, while Greer emphasized the need for a fair trade relationship. Trump's remarks to "Cuomo Town Hall: The First 100 Days" came shortly after Greer's contradictory statement on Fox News.</p>

          <p>A poll by the Asian American Foundation revealed that one in four non-Asian Americans consider Chinese-Americans a potential threat, particularly related to national security. Additionally, four in ten fear that Asian-Americans have greater allegiance to their countries of origin than to the United States. The survey results highlight concerns about the ability of Asian-Americans to assimilate amid rising social tensions and plummeting US-China relations. The foundation's chief executive, Norman Chen, emphasized the troubling disconnect between how Asian-Americans are perceived and their actual experiences.</p>

          <p>This NPR article explores the perspectives of individuals who fled authoritarian regimes and their observations on the Trump administration's tactics. Many of these immigrants expressed concern that some of the administration's actions reminded them of the oppressive regimes they escaped. The article highlights examples such as government agents aggressively questioning people at border crossings, withholding federal contracts from universities, and attacking news organizations. Some immigrants, however, argue that Trump is the victim and that former President Biden's actions are more reminiscent of authoritarian leaders.</p>

          <p>India's forthcoming trade deal with the United States and its intensifying conflict with Pakistan could complicate a recovery in ties between New Delhi and Beijing, potentially impacting China's broader efforts to engage with the developing world. While China-India relations had been improving, these looming issues could add complexity, according to analysts. President Trump has announced a tariff rate on Indian imports, prompting India to move quickly on an economic deal with Washington, which Trump has said is "coming along great."</p>

          <p>A California Assembly committee scaled back a controversial provision in a bill aimed at ending solar credits for rooftop solar system owners, now applying only to those who sell their homes. Assembly Bill 942, introduced by Lisa Calderon, originally targeted long-standing programs providing energy credits to solar panel owners installed before April 15, 2025. While the committee removed the provision limiting benefits to 10 years, the bill still faces opposition from rooftop solar owners, schools, and environmental groups, who argue it undermines investments in green energy and could reduce home values.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris criticized President Trump's tariff policies as "reckless" in her first major speech since he took office, warning they could lead to a recession. Speaking at an Emerge America event in San Francisco, Harris said the tariffs would increase everyday costs and impact retirement accounts and small businesses. She also warned of a potential constitutional crisis if the government's checks and balances system collapses. Harris praised those standing up to the Trump administration and hinted at a possible future in politics.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) held its policy rate at 0.5% for a second consecutive meeting, citing concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs weighing on the country's economic outlook. While Japan has seen inflation above the BOJ's 2% target, the central bank highlighted that it will continue to raise its policy rate "if our economic and price forecasts are realised." The BOJ also flagged that Japan's growth is likely to moderate due to a slowdown in other economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits.</p>
