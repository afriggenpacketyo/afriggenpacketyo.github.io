          <p>Thousands participated in 'No Kings' protests across major US cities and globally, including New York City, Washington D.C., and London, on Saturday, demonstrating against what they perceive as authoritarian policies of the Trump administration. Despite some initial fears, rallies remained largely peaceful with minimal arrests reported, though some incidents of detention occurred in Portland and near Chicago. Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, criticized the demonstrations as a distraction from the government shutdown, while Democratic leaders and organizers emphasized the protests as a patriotic stand for democracy. The movement highlights widespread discontent over various administration actions.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's President William Lai announced a 'T-Dome' missile shield initiative during his Double Tenth Day address, aiming to create a multilayered air defense network to protect critical infrastructure and population centers from potential attacks by Beijing. The plan, which reportedly draws inspiration from Israel's Iron Dome, surprised Taiwan's defense establishment as it was not mentioned in the latest National Defence Report nor allocated funds in the upcoming government budget. Lai pledged to accelerate the T-Dome's development through increased defense spending and the integration of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence. The ambitious proposal signals Taiwan's commitment to bolstering its self-defense capabilities.</p>

Takaichi, who recently became LDP leader, saw her previous bid derailed after the LDP's junior partner, Komeito, left the coalition. Ishin lawmakers are expected to vote for Takaichi in the upcoming parliamentary election for prime minister.

          <p>Millions of people gathered across the US and in cities worldwide on Saturday for 'No Kings' protests, expressing strong opposition to President Trump's policies and perceived authoritarian actions. Demonstrations, characterized by signs, marching bands, and inflatable costumes, occurred in over 2,700 locations, drawing larger crowds than previous events. Organizers emphasized a 'fierce love for our country' and a commitment to nonviolent resistance against what they see as attacks on media, political opponents, and civil liberties. While largely peaceful, some confrontations with federal agents were reported in Portland, highlighting the ongoing tensions between the administration and its critics.</p>

          <p>New reports allege Prince Andrew sought personal information on Virginia Giuffre, his sexual assault accuser, through a police protection officer in 2011, shortly before a photo of them was published. This comes after Andrew agreed to relinquish his remaining titles and honors, including the Duke of York, following pressure over his links to Jeffrey Epstein. Giuffre's brother has called for King Charles to strip Andrew of his 'prince' title, arguing for greater accountability for survivors. Prince William is reportedly dissatisfied with Andrew's decision and advocates for a more stringent approach, including a ban from future royal events.</p>

          <p>USC's College Football Playoff hopes are in jeopardy after a 34-24 rain-soaked loss to Notre Dame, potentially marking the end of their century-long rivalry. Costly turnovers, including two interceptions and a fumbled trick play by quarterback Jayden Maiava, plagued the Trojans in the second half. Notre Dame's rushing attack dominated, accumulating 306 yards and three touchdowns, while USC struggled without its top two running backs. Despite a late 59-yard touchdown pass, a subsequent 100-yard kickoff return by Notre Dame sealed USC's fate, leaving the team to reflect on missed opportunities and a crushing defeat.</p>

This closure, which impacted approximately 80,000 daily drivers, contradicted earlier Marine Corps assurances that the highway would remain open. Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the event as an 'absurd show of force' by the Trump administration, prioritizing ego over public safety.

          <p>A recent Emerson College poll indicates a tight hypothetical 2028 presidential election race between Vice President JD Vance and California Governor Gavin Newsom. Vance garnered 46% support, while Newsom received 45%, with 10% undecided, showing little change since August. Both are considered frontrunners as President Trump is ineligible for a third term. The poll also found voters evenly split on the upcoming midterm elections, with 44% favoring Democrats and 43% Republicans. The findings suggest a polarized electorate, with economic concerns potentially outweighing 'threats to democracy' as a dominant factor for voters.</p>

While China faces significant bottlenecks in lithography due to US export controls restricting access to top DUV and EUV systems, SMEE has excelled in back-end processes.

          <p>A BBC Scotland investigation, utilizing secret filming, helped expose a £28 million timeshare fraud that defrauded over 3,500 elderly victims. The company, Sell My Timeshare (SMT), promised to release owners from contracts but instead pressured them into buying useless 'Monster Rewards' credits. Fourteen individuals have been convicted, including company head Mark Rowe who received a seven-and-a-half-year sentence. The article details how the fraudsters funded lavish lifestyles while victims lost significant savings. This long-awaited legal outcome brings some closure to those affected, with prosecutors now pursuing the recovery of assets gained through the crimes.</p>

          <p>A 17-mile stretch of Interstate 5 in Southern California was periodically closed on Saturday for a military live-fire exercise at Camp Pendleton, causing significant anger and gridlock. Local officials, including San Clemente City Councilmember Mark Enmeier, reported a complete lack of coordination regarding the closure, which they believe was intentionally timed with widespread protests. The closure led to hours of traffic delays and detours, causing financial strain for local businesses. Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the White House for prioritizing a 'show of force' over public safety, exacerbating tensions between state and federal authorities over the event.</p>

          <p>The reality show 'The Celebrity Traitors' has highlighted numerous pre-existing connections among its cast, adding a new layer of drama to the psychological challenge. Many contestants, including Jonathan Ross and Alan Carr, knew each other through interviews, shared film projects, or the comedy circuit, making the game of deception more personal. For instance, Alan Carr 'murdered' close friend Paloma Faith, causing on-screen and off-screen reactions. The article details various links, from shared record labels to past collaborations, suggesting that familiarity can both aid in alliances and intensify the emotional stakes of the game, particularly for 'outsider' contestants with fewer connections.</p>

          <p>Betfred co-founder Fred Done has warned that all 1,287 Betfred shops in the UK, employing 7,500 people, could close if Chancellor Rachel Reeves raises taxes on gambling firms. Done stated that even a 5% increase to 35% or 40% would eliminate profit, making the business unsustainable. This echoes similar warnings from other gambling brands like William Hill, which anticipates closing 200 outlets. The industry argues that higher taxes could push gamblers towards unregulated offshore markets. Done emphasizes that increased costs from National Insurance and minimum wage have already added £20 million to the company's expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew's decision to relinquish his remaining titles and honors, including the Duke of York, is a significant symbolic move by Buckingham Palace to address ongoing scandals linked to Jeffrey Epstein. However, analysis suggests this intervention may have limited impact on his daily life, as he retains his 'prince' title and residence at Royal Lodge. The move, driven by King Charles and Prince William, aims to halt negative headlines, but the impending publication of Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir is expected to reignite scrutiny. Despite the public sanction, questions about Andrew's past associations and lack of remorse are likely to persist, maintaining pressure on the Royal Family.</p>
