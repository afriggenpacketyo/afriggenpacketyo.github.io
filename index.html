        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent geopolitical tensions, such as the conflict between Iran and Israel, have underscored the vulnerability of global energy supplies dependent on fossil fuels. Experts argue that transitioning to homegrown renewable energy sources is crucial for energy security, as it reduces reliance on volatile international markets and politically unstable regions. While challenges like intermittency and the need for critical minerals exist, solutions such as grid infrastructure investment and energy storage are being developed. The shift towards renewables is increasingly seen not just as a climate necessity but as a strategic move to ensure stable, affordable power.</p>

          <p>Miao Hua, a senior general who previously led the People's Liberation Army's ideological work, has been officially removed from China's powerful Central Military Commission. This action follows his expulsion from the National People's Congress two months prior and the removal of his photo from the defense ministry's website in May. The announcement confirms Miao's involvement in a wide-ranging anti-corruption investigation that has targeted numerous high-level military officials. The move signals a continuation of the sweeping crackdown within China's military establishment.</p>

          <p>The UK government has significantly altered its plan to reform the welfare system, rowing back more than half of the originally projected Â£5 billion in annual savings. The changes, particularly to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip), will now primarily affect new claimants starting from November 2026, sparing hundreds of thousands of current recipients. This U-turn raises questions about the government's fiscal strategy, as the lost savings, estimated to be between Â£2.5-3 billion, will need to be covered by other means to meet borrowing rules. The final financial impact will be clarified by the Office for Budget Responsibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan experienced a massive surge in private-sector rice imports in May, with the volume reaching 3.5 times the total for the entire 2024 fiscal year. This dramatic increase, led by imports from the United States, is a direct response to soaring domestic rice prices, which have driven demand for cheaper alternatives. Although these imports are subject to a high tariff of 341 yen per kilogram, they have become economically viable due to the domestic supply shortage. An expert suggests that while government intervention might temporarily ease prices, imports could rise again if new harvest prices remain high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a massive recall of over 1.2 million power banks due to fire risks from defective battery cells, Chinese electronics company Anker Innovations has announced a new strategic partnership.

This move is a significant shift in Anker's supply chain, aimed at restoring consumer confidence in the safety and quality of its products.

Fines can range from several hundred dollars to nearly $1,000 per day for ignoring a removal order.

          <p>Health policy experts are warning that millions of Americans could lose their health insurance if a Republican-led budget bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is passed. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that up to 10.9 million people could become uninsured by 2034 under the House version of the bill, primarily through rollbacks of the Affordable Care Act and changes to Medicaid. The legislation's focus on extending tax cuts for the wealthy while reducing health coverage has drawn significant criticism. The situation highlights the precarious nature of health insurance for many low- and middle-income Americans, particularly in states that have not expanded Medicaid.</p>

          <p>Following recent technical outages and staffing shortages in the U.S. aviation system, the long-standing debate over privatizing air traffic control (ATC) has re-emerged. Proponents point to countries like Canada, which privatized its system in 1996, as a model for improving efficiency and technological investment by moving away from slow government procurement processes. However, opponents express concerns that privatization in the vast and complex U.S. airspace could disadvantage smaller airports and note that international examples show mixed results. For now, the Trump administration and many industry groups are focusing on a multi-billion dollar investment to modernize the existing FAA-run system.</p>

          <p>The European Commission is growing increasingly frustrated with China's trade practices, using a "stinking fish" analogy to describe the situation to member state diplomats. The metaphor refers to the EU's view that China introduces punitive measures, such as tariffs on brandy, and then expects to be rewarded for removing them. This sentiment reflects deep-seated tensions as the EU demands that Beijing remove retaliatory tariffs and end probes into EU products. The "stinking fish" term is reportedly gaining traction in Brussels, symbolizing the testy state of EU-China trade relations.</p>

          <p>A recent report reveals that in 2024, approximately 826,000 working people in Germany required supplementary state benefits, an increase of 30,000 from the previous year. This has sparked a debate about the adequacy of the country's minimum wage and the principle of "performance-related pay." Critics argue the minimum wage is too low to cover the rising cost of living, while economists point to the high prevalence of part-time work, often due to childcare shortages, as a primary cause. The figures challenge the notion that employment alone is sufficient to escape poverty for a significant portion of the population.</p>

This steep decline is attributed to new 25% U.S. tariffs on cars and parts, which prompted some UK automakers to halt shipments. While the industry also faces disruption from the transition to electric vehicle production, there is some optimism as the U.S. tariffs are expected to be reduced soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time in its history, Wimbledon will feature three British players aged 17 or younger in the women's singles main draw. Teenagers Mika Stojsavljevic, Hannah Klugman, and Mimi Xu have all received wildcards, a testament to their impressive recent performances in junior tennis. Stojsavljevic, 16, is the reigning US Open girls' champion, while Klugman, also 16, recently reached the French Open girls' final. Their inclusion highlights a promising new generation of British talent, creating a sense of excitement and peer-driven motivation as they prepare for their senior debuts at the prestigious tournament.</p>
