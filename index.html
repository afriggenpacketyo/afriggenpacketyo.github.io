          <p>Former President Donald Trump has reiterated his intent to impose a 100% tariff on films produced outside the United States, asserting that the American film industry has been "stolen" by other countries. He claims this measure would address the industry's decline, particularly impacting California. This threat follows previous announcements of tariffs on various imports, raising questions about its implementation on streaming services and the definition of an "American-made" movie. Analysts express concerns that such tariffs could increase production costs, potentially harming consumer demand for content and affecting both US and international economies.</p>

          <p>Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill was carted off the field and rushed to a local hospital after suffering a severe knee injury during a game against the New York Jets. His left leg buckled awkwardly while making a catch near the sideline, immediately raising concerns among medical staff. The injury is significant enough that it could potentially end his 2025 season, a major blow for the Dolphins. Despite the visible seriousness of the incident, Hill was seen smiling in disbelief as he acknowledged cheering fans while being taken off the field, demonstrating a moment of personal resilience amidst the setback.</p>

          <p>Zhimin Qian, a Chinese national, has been convicted in the UK for her central role in a massive £5.5 billion ($7.4 billion) bitcoin scam, considered the world's largest cryptocurrency seizure. Between 2014 and 2017, Qian orchestrated a scheme that defrauded over 128,000 victims in China, converting the stolen funds into bitcoin assets. Her guilty plea concludes a seven-year international investigation into a complex money laundering operation. Authorities are now working to ensure the stolen funds are returned to the victims, many of whom have already received compensation through a Chinese scheme.</p>

          <p>Zijin Gold, the international unit of China's largest mined gold producer, saw its shares surge over 60% during its Hong Kong trading debut. The company had raised nearly HKD$25 billion (approximately $3.2 billion) with its initial public offering, making it the world's second-largest IPO this year. This successful listing occurs amidst record-high spot gold prices, driven by strong safe-haven demand and global economic uncertainty. The IPO signals a resurgence in Hong Kong's market and strengthens Zijin Mining's focus on its global gold operations, expanding its presence in the gold value chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) remained in contraction for the sixth consecutive month in September, registering 49.8. This figure, though slightly up from August, fell short of economists' projections, signaling persistent external challenges and weak domestic demand. The prolonged contraction in factory activity fuels calls for increased government support to stabilize the economy and stimulate growth. While industrial profits saw a significant year-on-year surge in August, the overall manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors continue to face headwinds, indicating a complex economic landscape.

          <p>An opinion article suggests that Hong Kong could serve as China's primary hub for engagement with the United Nations, bolstering Beijing's global governance vision. The article highlights Hong Kong's unique attributes, including its official use of English, common law system, and low corporate taxes, as ideal for facilitating international interactions. Positioning the UN's Asia headquarters in Hong Kong could enhance the organization's reforms and leverage the city's robust legal traditions. This strategic move would reinforce Hong Kong's international role and support China's significant financial contributions to the UN.</p>

          <p>The United States government is on the brink of a shutdown as President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders in Congress concluded a meeting without a funding agreement. Both sides appear entrenched in their positions, with Republicans favoring a short-term extension of current spending and Democrats demanding an end to administration-led spending cuts and renewed healthcare subsidies. The impending shutdown, potentially the longest in US history, highlights a deep partisan divide and a test of political wills. White House budget officials have indicated plans to use a shutdown to implement permanent federal spending reductions, raising concerns about long-term government function.</p>

          <p>Afghanistan is currently experiencing a total internet blackout, with telecommunications severed by the Taliban government across the country. This drastic action follows weeks of gradual cuts to fiber-optic internet connections, which the Taliban justifies as measures to prevent "immorality." International news agencies have lost contact with their Kabul offices, and mobile internet and satellite TV are severely disrupted, isolating the nation. Business leaders had previously warned of severe economic repercussions from such a ban, while critics lament the country's deepening isolation, comparing its digital connectivity to that of North Korea.</p>

The proposed job cuts, which would affect the vast majority of USAGM staff, were seen as significantly undermining the agency's statutory mission.

While promising significant capacity relief and advanced digital features, the airport faces major challenges, particularly regarding its distance from the city and inadequate last-mile connectivity.

          <p>A new Pentagon policy is causing a standoff between journalists and the Trump administration, as it seeks to limit media access and potentially restrict reporting. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's team claims the changes protect national security, but press organizations view them as an attempt to control information and prevent critical stories. The policy requires journalists to sign an acknowledgment of rules that could penalize them for seeking unapproved information, raising serious concerns about press freedom. This situation exacerbates an already tense relationship, with critics arguing it undermines the public's right to government transparency.</p>

          <p>This commentary article argues that Donald Trump's "campaign of vengeance," aimed at retaliating against perceived past injustices, is proving shortsighted and counterproductive. Trump's efforts to silence critics, such as Jimmy Kimmel, have inadvertently boosted their popularity and ratings. Similarly, his prosecution of former FBI Director James Comey is seen as legally flimsy and undermined by his public demands for conviction, risking an appearance of prosecutorial misconduct. The article suggests that Trump's attempts to wield state power for intimidation and propaganda are encountering significant resistance, highlighting the limits of presidential authority and potentially galvanizing his opponents.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes an impending government shutdown will not significantly impact the stock market, citing historical trends where markets have often performed well during such periods. He distinguishes a shutdown from a debt ceiling default, noting the U.S. can still pay bondholders. Cramer's primary concern is that a shutdown could delay the release of crucial economic data, potentially complicating the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. While acknowledging the severe impact on furloughed federal workers and potential GDP reduction, he suggests that delayed data collection, though inconvenient, is not a reason for major market concern.

Instead of focusing on quantity, the MIIT emphasizes optimizing industrial structure and achieving a 5% average annual growth in value-added output.
