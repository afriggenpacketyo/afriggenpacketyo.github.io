          <p>Attorneys for Sean "Diddy" Combs are petitioning a federal judge for a sentence of no more than 14 months, which would result in his immediate release. They argue that his conviction on two prostitution-related charges, combined with the destruction of his career and harrowing prison conditions, constitutes sufficient punishment. The defense highlights that Combs was acquitted of more severe racketeering and sex trafficking charges, portraying him as a humbled man changed by his incarceration and sobriety. Prosecutors, however, are expected to recommend a substantially longer prison term at the upcoming October sentencing.</p>

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has revised its forecast, predicting the UK will experience the highest inflation in the G7 this year at 3.5%. This updated projection is higher than the previous estimate and suggests inflation will remain elevated into 2026. The report also anticipates a slowdown in UK economic growth next year, attributing it to a tighter fiscal policy and increased trade costs. The forecast places additional pressure on the government as it prepares for the upcoming November Budget. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping has made a historic visit to Urumqi to attend the 70th-anniversary celebration of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, the first time a Chinese president has done so. The visit underscores Beijing's focus on reinforcing a unified national identity and integrating ethnic minority groups under Xi's concept of a "sense of community for the Chinese nation." This high-profile attendance signals a continued emphasis on stability and control in the region, which is home to a significant population of predominantly Muslim Uygurs. The event highlights the government's ongoing "sinicization" policy.</p>

          <p>Following childbirth, many new parents experience a significant drop in their sex drive, a topic recently highlighted by reality TV star Holly Hagan-Blyth. Experts explain that this change is due to a combination of physical healing, drastic hormonal shifts, and the psychological adjustment to parenthood for both partners. Relationship therapists emphasize the importance of open communication to alleviate pressure and misunderstanding between couples during this period. The article notes that addressing these challenges openly can help couples navigate the transition and maintain intimacy in their relationship.</p>

          <p>An advice column explores the complex ethical questions surrounding polygenic testing for IVF embryos, a technology that screens for traits like intelligence, height, and risks for diseases such as cancer and depression. The article weighs the parental desire to ensure a child's health and happiness against concerns of creating a genetic caste system and the psychological pressure on children to meet pre-selected expectations. It cautions that the science behind these tests can be misleading and that focusing solely on biological optimization overlooks other values like diversity and acceptance. The piece suggests a "good enough" approach, balancing technological capabilities with moral responsibilities.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has announced that its factory production will remain suspended until at least October 1st due to an ongoing IT system shutdown caused by a major cyberattack in late August. The stoppage is costing the company an estimated £50 million per week and is raising serious concerns about the financial viability of smaller firms within its supply chain. Government ministers are meeting with JLR and its suppliers to discuss support measures, as fears grow that some businesses could collapse without intervention. The disruption highlights the significant vulnerability of modern manufacturing to digital threats.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists searching for the lost tomb of Queen Cleopatra have discovered a submerged ancient port near the Taposiris Magna Temple, about 30 miles west of Alexandria, Egypt. The Egyptian-Dominican mission used advanced sonar technology to map the seabed, revealing an ancient shoreline and harbor that was once connected to the temple by a tunnel. The discovery of anchors and pottery from the Ptolemaic period provides new evidence that the site was a significant maritime hub. Lead archaeologist Dr. Kathleen Martinez remains convinced the temple complex is the true resting place of Cleopatra.</p>

          <p>A commentary article argues that ESPN is undergoing a significant decline in quality, moving away from its tradition of adversarial sports journalism toward a model dominated by social media influencers and cozy relationships with sports leagues. The network's recent hiring of personalities from TikTok and other platforms is seen as a symptom of a broader strategy that prioritizes shallow, shareable content over critical reporting. This shift, combined with the departure of respected journalists and a new equity deal with the NFL, suggests ESPN is abandoning its role as a news organization in favor of becoming a public relations arm for the sports industry.</p>

While acknowledging that mental health struggles can be hidden, Harrold suggests that his observations and archival footage from the time do not align with the prince's account.

Baby name experts note that while the practice has historical roots, social media has amplified both the trend and the vitriol against it.

Proponents say this method is more environmentally friendly than conventional mining, as it can clean contaminated land with near-zero carbon emissions. While the technology shows promise, especially for communities on land unsuitable for agriculture, its scalability remains a major challenge, and it is unlikely to replace industrial mining operations entirely.</p>

          <p>Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has described a recent incident involving multiple large drones at Copenhagen Airport as "the most serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure to date." The drones forced the airport to halt all take-offs and landings for several hours on Monday, causing significant disruption and flight diversions. Police believe a "capable operator" was behind the incident, which occurred on the same evening a similar drone disruption was reported at Oslo Airport. The event has heightened security concerns in the region amid a recent increase in suspected sabotage activities.</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic shift, France and the United Kingdom have officially recognized a Palestinian state, a move intended to preserve the viability of a two-state solution amid the ongoing Gaza crisis. French President Emmanuel Macron announced the decision at the United Nations, framing it as a necessary step to ensure justice for the Palestinian people. The move, coordinated with other allies like Canada and Australia, creates a deep divide with the United States and Israel, which both oppose the recognition. Israeli officials have reacted furiously, viewing it as a reward for Hamas following its 2023 attack.</p>

Altman added that streamlining the process for the "smartest people" to enter the country and outlining financial incentives seems positive.

However, the organization warns of significant risks ahead, including high policy uncertainty and the impact of increased U.S. tariffs, which have reached their highest effective rate since 1933. The OECD also revised its U.S. growth forecast upward to 1.8% for 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission's lawsuit against Amazon is heading to trial, with the government alleging the company used manipulative design tactics, or "dark patterns," to trick millions of consumers into signing up for its Prime subscription service. The FTC claims Amazon was aware that its enrollment process was confusing and deliberately made cancellation difficult, a process employees internally nicknamed the "Iliad Flow." Amazon denies any wrongdoing, arguing its practices are standard for the industry and that customers are drawn by the program's benefits. A jury will decide the outcome of this major consumer-protection case.</p>

In a letter, the senators noted that 15 people have died in detention since President Trump took office, with 10 of those deaths occurring in the first half of this year, the highest rate on record. They expressed concern over conditions in these rapidly expanding facilities and criticized Immigration and Customs Enforcement for failing to meet its own standards for timely reporting of detainee deaths.
