          <p>European defense company shares experienced a significant rally, with firms like Sweden's Saab and Germany's Hensoldt seeing gains of up to 5%. This market movement followed U.S. President Donald Trump's unexpected shift in stance, where he expressed that Ukraine could win back all its territory from Russia with European and NATO support. The broader European Stoxx 600 index, however, trended lower, influenced by comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about inflated asset prices. The surge in defense equities highlights the market's sensitivity to geopolitical statements and shifts in military support expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Home Secretary has initiated an urgent review into the significant costs of using taxis to transport asylum seekers to appointments. This action follows a BBC investigation which uncovered instances of long-distance journeys costing hundreds of pounds, such as a 250-mile trip to a doctor's appointment reportedly costing £600. While asylum seekers receive weekly bus passes, taxis are used for other necessary travel, but the Home Office does not track the total expenditure. The investigation also highlighted poor living conditions and safety hazards in hotels housing asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that Ukraine has the potential to "win all of Ukraine back in its original form." This declaration, made on his Truth Social platform after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, marks a departure from his previous suggestions that Kyiv might need to cede territory for peace. Trump attributed his changed view to a new understanding of the military situation and Russia's economic troubles, labeling Russia a "paper tiger." Zelensky praised the "big shift" in Trump's position, viewing it as a positive signal of U.S. support.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised a "productive meeting" with U.S. President Donald Trump, after which Trump publicly stated that Ukraine could win back all its occupied territory. Zelenskyy described the pivot as a "big shift," noting that the U.S. president now seems well-informed about the battlefield situation. The change in rhetoric was met with cautious optimism by some Ukrainian politicians, who emphasized that concrete actions must follow the words.

          <p>Pop star Dua Lipa has denied reports that she dismissed agent David Levy due to his involvement in a letter opposing the performance of pro-Palestinian Irish band Kneecap at Glastonbury. Both Lipa and her agency, WME, clarified that Levy had not worked directly with her since 2019, calling the story "categorically false." While condemning Levy's actions to silence the band, Lipa criticized the media for crafting a "deliberately inflammatory" narrative to create online division. She concluded her statement by reaffirming her support for Palestine while decrying the exploitation of the conflict for media clicks.</p>

          <p>Beijing has issued a warning to Japan regarding a private visit by former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, urging Tokyo not to provide a platform for "Taiwan independence" sentiments. Tsai, who led the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, visited Japan as a tourist and reportedly had no scheduled meetings with Japanese government officials. During her presidency from 2016 to 2024, relations between Taiwan and mainland China grew increasingly tense. The visit occurs under Japan's visa-free policy for Taiwanese tourists, but China remains highly sensitive to any perceived international validation of Taiwanese sovereignty.</p>

          <p>UK energy regulator Ofgem has announced that all suppliers in England, Scotland, and Wales must offer a tariff with a lower standing charge by the end of January. This move addresses consumer complaints about the fixed daily fees, which are paid regardless of energy consumption. However, these new tariffs will likely feature higher per-unit energy costs, meaning overall bills are unlikely to decrease for most households. Charities have criticized the plan, stating that while it offers more choice, it fails to tackle the fundamental problem of high energy prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered almost £500 million in the past year by using a new artificial intelligence tool designed to detect fraud. A significant portion of the reclaimed funds, £186 million, was linked to fraudulent claims made during the Covid-19 pandemic, with the rest coming from areas like illegal council tax claims. The tool, named the Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator, scans new policies for potential weaknesses before they can be exploited. The UK now plans to license this technology to other countries, including the US and Australia, despite ongoing criticism from civil liberties groups about the government's use of AI.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has addressed concerns about the company's massive infrastructure expansion, a planned $850 billion buildout in partnership with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank. Standing at a future data center site in Texas, Altman acknowledged public worry over the scale but insisted the investment is necessary to meet the soaring demand for AI, highlighting ChatGPT's tenfold usage increase. He framed the buildout as essential for delivering advanced AI capabilities, stating that the biggest bottleneck for the technology is not capital but electricity. Critics have raised concerns about a potential bubble and a circular financing model among the partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani pitched a season-high six shutout innings in a dominant performance against the Arizona Diamondbacks. However, his efforts were wasted as the team's bullpen collapsed in the late innings, leading to a 5-4 walk-off loss for Los Angeles. The game highlighted two key narratives for the Dodgers heading into the postseason: Ohtani's increasing strength as he recovers from surgery, and the persistent unreliability of their relief pitching. The loss further shrinks the Dodgers' division lead and intensifies questions about how the team will manage its pitching staff in the playoffs.</p>

          <p>The chief executive of Aricell, a South Korean lithium battery manufacturer, has been sentenced to 15 years in prison following a deadly fire at one of its plants last year. The blaze in Hwaseong city killed 23 workers and injured eight others. A court determined the fire was an "anticipated disaster," finding that CEO Park Soon-kwan and other executives failed to implement proper safety measures or adequately train workers. The sentence is the longest ever imposed under South Korea's industrial safety law, which holds business owners accountable for fatal workplace incidents.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa has caused widespread devastation in East Asia, killing at least 14 people and leaving over 150 missing in eastern Taiwan after triggering a lake to burst its banks. The resulting flood of mud and water inundated the township of Guangfu, where military personnel are assisting in rescue efforts. The powerful storm then struck Hong Kong with hurricane-force winds, causing injuries, toppling trees, and forcing the suspension of flights and services. The typhoon is now forecast to make landfall in southern China, where over a million people have been relocated in preparation.</p>

          <p>In his first show since being suspended by ABC, Jimmy Kimmel delivered a monologue framing the controversy as a threat to free speech, calling government efforts to silence comedians "anti-American." The suspension came after pressure from Trump administration officials over his comments on the shooting of a right-wing activist. Kimmel explained his intent was not to make light of the tragedy but also criticized the president for celebrating Americans losing their jobs over jokes. The incident has ignited a national debate, with two major broadcast groups still refusing to air his show.</p>

          <p>Australia's national broadcaster, the ABC, has been ordered to pay A$150,000 in penalties for the unlawful dismissal of presenter Antoinette Lattouf. A court found she was taken off the air due to her political views after sharing a Human Rights Watch post about the war in Gaza, following lobbying from pro-Israel groups. The judge called the penalty "substantial" and necessary to ensure the ABC learns from its actions, stating it had "abjectly surrendered" its employee's rights. The case has sparked public outrage and raised serious questions about the broadcaster's independence and support for its diverse staff.</p>
