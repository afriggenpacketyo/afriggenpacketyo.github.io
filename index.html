          <p>A senior Russian lawmaker has stated that the messaging app WhatsApp, owned by Meta, should prepare to exit the Russian market, labeling it a national security threat. This comes as Russia promotes its own state-backed messaging service, MAX, and follows President Putin's directive to restrict software from "unfriendly countries." The government has already banned other Meta platforms like Facebook and Instagram, and critics fear the new state app could be used for user surveillance. This move is part of Russia's broader strategy to establish "digital sovereignty" and reduce reliance on Western technology.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East L.A. has resulted in the deaths of three deputies from the Arson Explosives Detail. The blast occurred Friday morning while the deputies were reportedly working to render safe a grenade that had been recovered the previous day. Sheriff Robert Luna described the incident as the department's largest single loss of life since 1857, calling the fallen deputies "elite" experts with a combined 74 years of service. Federal and local agencies are investigating the tragic event.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a majority of Americans, about two-thirds, favor the U.S. returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The poll also found that the 1969 Apollo 11 mission is still widely viewed as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride. Furthermore, many believe the space program provides technological benefits for everyone, underscoring a broad and enduring public enthusiasm for space exploration.</p>

          <p>Chinese companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba are disrupting the global AI landscape by releasing powerful, open-source large language models. Unlike the closed, proprietary systems from U.S. giants like OpenAI and Google, these free-to-use models encourage worldwide collaboration and have quickly gained support from the global developer community. This open-source movement is seen as a serious strategic challenge to U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence. It fosters a wave of new applications in China and presents a viable alternative for developers who have been excluded from accessing leading American AI.</p>

          <p>A California state audit has found that Cal/OSHA, the agency responsible for workplace safety, is suffering from "critical weakness" due to severe understaffing. With a vacancy rate as high as 32% last year, the agency has struggled to conduct proper inspections and address hazards, sometimes closing cases without a site visit. The audit noted that when inspections did occur, documentation was often poor, and fines were sometimes improperly reduced. Labor advocates argue this chronic understaffing endangers California's 19 million workers, especially as new risks emerge from climate change-related conditions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has initiated a $10 billion lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, News Corp, and The Wall Street Journal, alleging defamation. The suit stems from an article claiming Trump sent a "bawdy" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which the president vehemently denies as fake. The legal action names the parent companies and the reporters involved, accusing them of malicious and false reporting intended to link Trump to the disgraced financier. A spokesperson for the Journal's publisher expressed confidence in their reporting and stated they will vigorously defend against the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>The "California Forever" project, backed by Silicon Valley billionaires, has proposed creating a large-scale manufacturing hub called the "Solano Foundry" within its planned new city. The 2,100-acre site aims to attract companies in defense, aerospace, robotics, and other advanced industries, with the goal of bringing research and production back to the state. Project leaders hope to create tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs and revitalize American industry, echoing President Trump's policy goals. However, the ambitious project to build a new city on thousands of acres of farmland remains controversial among some Solano County residents.</p>

          <p>The family of Cornelius Taylor, a homeless man killed when a bulldozer crushed his tent during an encampment clearing, is suing the city of Atlanta. The lawsuit alleges that city employees acted negligently by failing to check tents for occupants before using heavy machinery to clear the area in preparation for a holiday event. Taylor's death, which the family's lawyers call "tragic and preventable," sparked outrage and led to a temporary halt in the city's controversial encampment sweeps. The family is seeking justice and calling for more humane treatment of the city's homeless population.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has changed its support protocols to prevent engineers based in China from providing technical assistance for its U.S. Department of Defense cloud contracts. The move comes in response to a report that raised national security concerns about the practice. Previously, Chinese engineers' work was overseen by U.S.-based "digital escorts," an arrangement critics warned could leave sensitive systems vulnerable to cyberattacks. The Defense Secretary called the old system "unacceptable" and announced a review, while Microsoft affirmed its commitment to providing secure services to the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors have filed murder charges against Brycson Gaddis, 20, for allegedly beating his ex-girlfriend's 5-year-old son, Elyjiah Hearn, to death and leaving his body in a dumpster.

The article also details how Gaddis had been in police custody for previous violent crimes but was released, and a warrant for his arrest was active for months before the slaying.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pest control experts and entomologists in the UK are reporting a major surge in wasp populations this summer, likely due to a very warm and dry spring creating ideal breeding conditions. While many people dislike wasps, experts emphasize their crucial role as apex predators in the ecosystem, controlling pests in gardens and agricultural landscapes. To coexist peacefully, people are advised to avoid agitating the insects and can distract them by placing something sweet away from picnic areas. Despite their nuisance, the thriving common wasp population is a positive sign for insect health amid wider global declines.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes why the Jeffrey Epstein case remains a potent issue for many of Donald Trump's supporters, who view it as a symbol of "deep state" corruption. It explores how conspiracy theories have framed Epstein as a key figure in a corrupt global elite, fueling demands for full disclosure of government files. The piece notes the political challenge for Trump, who has both fueled and tried to quell these theories, especially as his administration's handling of the files has drawn criticism from his own base. The narrative highlights the deep-seated distrust in institutions that animates this segment of the electorate.</p>

          <p>A new comedic stage play in Liverpool, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," reimagines the life of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a fantasy epic. The show, written by a co-creator of the sitcom "Motherland," spoofs their story through the lens of "The Lord of the Rings," inspired by an old tabloid myth about Coleen's engagement ring. The writer and cast insist the play is an affectionate homage to the couple, celebrating their resilience as "strong characters" who have endured intense public scrutiny. The production is a typical offering for the Royal Court theatre.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland is expanding its RSV vaccination program to include premature babies, who are highly vulnerable to the respiratory virus. Starting this autumn, eligible infants will be offered a single long-acting injection of Nirsevimab, which provides about 80% protection against the virus. RSV is a leading cause of hospitalization in young children, and this new program aims to protect infants born too early to benefit from the maternal vaccine offered during pregnancy. Health officials highlighted the move as a crucial step to protect vulnerable children and reduce pressure on the health service.</p>

          <p>The announcement that "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" will end in 2026 has intensified questions about the viability of the traditional late-night talk show format. While CBS cited financial pressures, the move has raised concerns about political influence, given Colbert's frequent criticism of Donald Trump and the timing relative to a controversial settlement by parent company Paramount. The article explores the challenges facing the genre, including declining ad revenue, audience fragmentation to streaming and social media, and a polarized political climate. This cancellation is seen as a major sign of a potential sea change for a long-standing television institution.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered a specific interaction between a gut bacteria molecule and a common gene variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The study found that in people with a certain variant of the OTUD3 gene, the immune system overreacts to a molecule produced by gut bacteria, leading to chronic inflammation. This finding helps explain why the disease varies so much between patients and why treatments can be inconsistent. The research opens the door for more precise, personalized therapies, offering new hope for managing the condition.</p>

For his station in Idaho, the cuts represent 20% of the budget, threatening services that provide essential news and emergency information to low-population regions. While stations are exploring collaborations, the loss of this public-private funding model raises fears of creating more "news deserts" across the country. (not investment advice)</p>
