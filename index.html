          <p>President Trump has expressed increasing frustration with Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine, labeling them as "crazy" and warning that Putin is "playing with fire." Despite previously stating his good relationship with Putin would lead to peace, Trump now acknowledges Putin's clear intent to undermine Ukraine's sovereignty. Trump deflected when questioned about potential consequences for Russia's intensified attacks, only stating that his words speak loudly. While he mentioned considering new sanctions, he has yet to implement them, prioritizing a potential deal. Trump also indicated he would meet with Putin and Zelenskyy if necessary, promising to determine Putin's sincerity within two weeks.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he is considering pardoning individuals charged in the 2020 plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, describing the case as a "railroad job." He noted that he watched the trial and believed some defendants said "stupid things." The Justice Department's new pardon attorney will also review the case. Six people were charged with conspiring to kidnap Whitmer, with two convicted at trial, two pleading guilty, and two acquitted. Trump previously clashed with Whitmer in 2020 over COVID-19 policies, and has drawn scrutiny for pardoning those convicted in the January 6 Capitol riot.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security agents are conducting unannounced "wellness checks" on migrant children across the U.S., sparking fear and criticism. The Trump administration claims these checks ensure children are enrolled in school and properly cared for, but critics argue they are a pretext for immigration enforcement. These checks, carried out by Homeland Security Investigations with assistance from the FBI and DEA, have led to the detention of some caregivers. Advocates worry about potential family separations and the involvement of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which has hired detention and deportation specialists. This has stirred anxiety among immigrants and alarmed educators, advocates, and lawyers, who see the visits as a tactic to accelerate deportations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump suggested redirecting $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools, but experts say this faces significant obstacles. Federal grants are competitively awarded to research universities like Harvard for specific purposes, such as scientific research, requiring specialized faculty and facilities. Trade schools typically offer vocational training and do not conduct the same type of research. While trade schools can apply for similar grants, Harvard's existing funds cannot simply be transferred; the administration would need to prove Harvard's grants were improperly awarded. Experts suggest alternative ways to support trade schools, such as funding apprenticeships and student financial aid.</p>

Trump praised Bove as smart, tough, and respected, stating he will end the "Weaponization of Justice" and restore the Rule of Law. Bove's nomination is controversial as it comes amidst Trump's attacks on "activist" judges. If confirmed, Bove would serve a lifetime appointment on the federal bench, filling one of two vacancies on the court.</p>

          <p>A temporary pause on new student visa interview appointments by the US State Department, directed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, could have major economic consequences. This action, amidst tensions with higher education institutions like Harvard University, requires diplomatic missions to halt interviews for new student and exchange visa applications. International students contribute significantly to the US economy, injecting $43.8 billion in 2023-24. Experts warn that this pause creates uncertainty for students, potentially undermining America's standing as a top destination for global talent.

          <p>President Trump is expanding his use of pardon power, granting clemency to individuals aligned with him politically and those he believes were unfairly targeted by the justice system. Recent pardons include reality TV hosts convicted of fraud and a sheriff who accepted bribes, building on a pattern of pardoning those convicted of fraud, public corruption, and January 6-related crimes. Critics argue that these actions undermine efforts to hold officials accountable and reflect a de-emphasis on public corruption cases. Some pardoned individuals or their attorneys appealed to Trump by claiming political persecution, highlighting the politicization of the pardon process.</p>

Trump specifically cited the European Union, which he recently targeted with a 50% tariff before delaying it, as an example.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to stop recommending routine Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women has sparked outrage. Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, claims the Covid shot has been removed from the CDC's recommended immunization schedule for these groups without providing scientific evidence. Health experts warn this could have devastating consequences, particularly for pregnant women and their babies, who are at higher risk of severe complications. Concerns are also raised about potential access issues, as the CDC's recommendation guides insurance plans on which vaccines to cover at no cost to patients.</p>

          <p>The reality comedy "Duck Dynasty" is being revived on A&E, reflecting a shift back to conservative identity politics. The show, which originally aired during the Obama era, focused on the Robertson family and their traditionalist, Christian lifestyle. It became a precursor to the culture wars, with a controversy over Phil Robertson's comments on homosexuality and race. The revival comes as the family navigates celebrity, generational change, and the business of being the Robertsons, in an environment where MAGA-coded media is more prevalent.</p>

However, the decision set a precedent by acknowledging the legal foundation for corporate climate liability. This ruling is expected to encourage more climate lawsuits against fossil fuel companies, pushing for a move away from fossil fuels globally.</p>
