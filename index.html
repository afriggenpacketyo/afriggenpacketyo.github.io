          <h2>Chinese Premier Calls for Stricter Price Controls to Combat Deflationary Pressures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 02:33:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for enhanced price regulation, particularly in the electric vehicle sector, to address intense price wars contributing to deflation. During a high-level meeting, he emphasized the need for better cost oversight, price monitoring, and for automakers to focus on innovation rather than destructive competition. The move comes as industrial profits have fallen and producer prices have slipped, indicating strain on businesses. While the government aims to curb excess supply without harming economic growth, some economists are skeptical that these measures will lead to significant reform, viewing them as a short-term campaign.

          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed a $9 billion spending rescission bill championed by President Trump, targeting funds previously approved for foreign aid and public broadcasting. The legislation, framed by Republicans as a measure to eliminate wasteful government spending, passed despite opposition from all Democrats and two Republican senators. The original proposal was slightly reduced by about $400 million to protect funding for an international HIV/AIDS prevention program. The bill now moves to the House, which had passed a slightly larger version and must approve the Senate's changes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent statistics from the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) indicate a continued weakening of the country's job market. The annual rate of wage growth slowed to 5% in the three months to May, down from the previous period's 5.2%. Concurrently, the number of available job vacancies has fallen for three consecutive years, now standing at 727,000. The ONS noted that survey data suggests some companies are opting not to recruit new employees or replace those who have left their positions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a nearly 61% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter net profit, surpassing market expectations. The surge is largely attributed to sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from clients like Nvidia and Apple. The world's largest contract chip manufacturer reported that its most advanced chips, 7-nanometer or smaller, constituted 74% of its total revenue. Despite the strong performance, the company faces potential headwinds from U.S. trade policies and potential order reductions from smartphone and PC clients due to macroeconomic conditions.

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a €2 trillion, seven-year budget for the European Union, featuring a significant increase in defense and space investment. The plan allocates €131 billion for these sectors, a fivefold increase, reflecting growing geopolitical concerns and what President Ursula von der Leyen has called Europe's "era of rearmament." The budget, which amounts to 1.26% of the EU's GNI, also earmarks 35% for climate projects and triples migration management funding. The proposal requires unanimous approval from member states, with some, like the Netherlands, already criticizing the overall size as "too high."</p>

          <p>Shares of Japanese retail giant Seven & i Holdings fell over 7% after Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard withdrew its $47 billion takeover bid. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i's leadership as the reason for terminating the offer. In response, the 7-Eleven operator expressed disappointment and disagreed with what it called "inaccurate statements" from the Canadian firm. Analysts suggested that the deal was always unlikely to succeed due to Seven & i's status as a core company to Japan's national interests and a general sense of Japanese protectionism.

Originally from Mexico City, she describes how the current political climate has forced her to be perpetually vigilant, altering how she interacts with her community and customers. After temporarily stopping work out of fear, she has returned to selling fruit to support her family, which includes four U.S.-born children. Her story reflects the broader anxiety within the immigrant community, where many, despite being hardworking and non-criminal, face the daily threat of deportation and family separation.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports contracted by 0.5% in June year-over-year, marking the second straight month of decline and raising fears of a potential recession. The drop was contrary to economists' expectations of a slight rise and comes as trade talks with the United States remain stalled. Shipments to the U.S. fell sharply by 11.4%, impacted by a 25% "reciprocal tariff" imposed by the Trump administration. The automotive sector, a cornerstone of Japan's economy, has been hit particularly hard, with automakers apparently absorbing most of the tariff costs to maintain market share, severely squeezing their profit margins.

          <p>Data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) indicates that a small fraction of individuals deported under the Trump administration had convictions for the most serious violent crimes. Of the approximately 70,583 convicted criminals deported between January and June, only 0.58% had homicide convictions, while most documented infractions were for traffic or immigration offenses. This data, obtained by CBS News, contrasts with the administration's public messaging, which has consistently focused on deporting the "worst of the worst" offenders. The figures show that assault convictions accounted for about 15.2% of criminal deportees, while sex offenses made up 1.8%.</p>

A research note from Wolfe Research warns that such an action would likely trigger an equity selloff and a spike in long-term yields, calling the scenario "a mess." The legality of the move is also in question, with experts believing it would ultimately be challenged and decided in the courts, possibly reaching the Supreme Court. Despite Trump's public denial of an immediate plan to fire Powell, his history of criticizing the Fed chair for not cutting interest rates keeps the possibility a major concern for markets.
