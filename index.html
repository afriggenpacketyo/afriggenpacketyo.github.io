The victory, which took place in Las Vegas and was broadcast globally on Netflix, has cemented Crawford's legacy and established him as the new face of boxing. Following the fight, Crawford asserted he is the greatest of his era, while Alvarez acknowledged his opponent's comprehensive skill set.

          <p>As President Trump undertakes a state visit to the United Kingdom, the trip casts a spotlight on his mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who emigrated from the Isle of Lewis in Scotland. MacLeod, a native Gaelic speaker, was one of ten siblings who left poverty for opportunities in America, a path modern immigration critics might label "chain migration." Her story represents a classic "rags to riches" American dream, moving from a modest Scottish village to marrying a New York real estate developer. Despite Trump's own policies on immigration, his family history is deeply rooted in the very migration patterns his administration has sought to curtail.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's government-run tech incubator, Cyberport, is testing graphics processing units (GPUs) from four different mainland Chinese chipmakers for its new Artificial Intelligence Supercomputing Centre. The move is a strategic effort to decrease reliance on American firm Nvidia amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and technology restrictions. Cyberport's CEO, Rocky Cheng Chung-ngam, stated that relying solely on Nvidia is no longer a viable option. While the center's current 3,000 petaflops of computing power use Nvidia chips, future procurements will likely include Chinese-made GPUs, with cost being a key factor in the final selection.</p>

          <p>China is significantly expanding its influence in Central Asia's critical minerals sector, effectively leaving the United States behind in the race for these vital resources. Through state-owned enterprises, Beijing has secured agreements in countries like Uzbekistan for geological exploration and the development of mining complexes for copper and other rare earths. This strategic push is part of a broader effort to secure supply chains for key industries and sideline other international players, including the U.S. and European nations. China's region-wide approach allows it to adapt to the specific needs of each Central Asian country, solidifying its dominance over these strategic assets.</p>

While a major breakthrough is considered unlikely, discussions may lead to another extension of the deadline for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations.

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein who took her own life, has stated that Lord Mandelson should never have been appointed as the UK's ambassador to the United States. In an interview, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, called the appointment evidence of deep-seated corruption within political systems. The criticism follows Mandelson's recent dismissal by the Prime Minister after emails revealed the extent of his relationship with Epstein, including urging the disgraced financier to seek early release. The family emphasized that his firing is insufficient and that more individuals connected to Epstein must be held accountable.</p>

          <p>A thriving parallel economy exists within the global prison system, involving governments, private corporations, organized crime, and the inmates themselves. Governments spend billions annually on incarceration, with private companies increasingly profiting from services like facility management, food, and telecommunications, often at inflated prices. Inside, crime syndicates run lucrative contraband and extortion operations, while inmates engage in an informal marketplace where items like instant noodles become currency and low-wage labor is common. This complex system often undermines rehabilitation efforts and perpetuates cycles of debt and violence, raising questions about who truly benefits from punishment.</p>

Laboratory tests on human eggs also showed that THC exposure led to more errors in chromosome distribution and defects in the egg cell's structure, which are crucial for a successful pregnancy.

          <p>Eighty years after the end of Nazi rule, the racist ideology of the 1935 Nuremberg Laws still echoes in modern Germany, particularly in far-right rhetoric that questions who is truly "German." These laws arbitrarily stripped Jewish citizens and other groups of their rights, creating a distinction between "Reich citizens" and second-class "state citizens." Historians and activists see parallels in the contemporary discourse of groups like the AfD, which distinguishes between "real Germans" and "passport Germans."

Despite promises to swiftly end the wars, his actions have arguably worsened them by appeasing and encouraging aggressors like Russia's Vladimir Putin and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu. The author contends that when faced with determined opponents, Trump's leadership falters, and his weakness is exploited, as seen in recent Russian drone incursions into Poland and the Israeli strike in Qatar. The piece calls for other democracies, particularly in Europe, to step up and act decisively without waiting for ineffective U.S. leadership.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing a significant royal "charm offensive" for President Donald Trump's state visit, leveraging his known admiration for the monarchy as a diplomatic tool. The visit will feature extensive pomp and pageantry, including a lavish banquet at Windsor Castle hosted by King Charles III, in an effort to create a positive atmosphere for discussing sensitive topics like Ukraine and trade. While the King and President hold contrasting views on many issues, the UK government hopes the carefully orchestrated royal experience can influence the unpredictable U.S. leader. The visit's schedule is tightly controlled, focusing on closed events to avoid potential public protests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The tradition of hen and stag parties has evolved from a simple night out into elaborate, multi-day destination events that can cost attendees over £1,000. Many young adults feel immense social pressure to attend these celebrations to avoid upsetting friends, even when the cost is a significant financial burden. The expenses often escalate beyond initial estimates for flights and accommodation, with added costs for matching outfits, activities, and gifts. This trend highlights a growing tension between celebrating friends' life milestones and managing personal finances, forcing many to make difficult choices between their budget and their social obligations.</p>

          <h2>Investigation into Honeymooner George Smith's 2005 Cruise Disappearance Remains Unresolved</h2>

          <p>The 2005 disappearance of George Smith from his honeymoon cruise remains a mystery, despite a lengthy FBI investigation that was officially closed in 2015. Smith went missing from the Royal Caribbean's "Brilliance of the Seas," with a significant bloodstain found on a lifeboat canopy below his balcony. Suspicion initially fell on his widow before shifting to a group of young men last seen with him, whose accounts contained inconsistencies and were undermined by questionable alibis. Despite compelling clues, including a provocative video made by the men and failed polygraph tests, the case lacks sufficient evidence for prosecution, leaving Smith's family without answers or justice.</p>

          <p>China has established the continued, non-discriminatory operation of TikTok in the United States as a key condition for making progress in upcoming trade talks in Spain. A commentary in the Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, stated that Washington must provide fair conditions for Chinese enterprises. The piece warned that if the U.S. continues to harm the legitimate interests of Chinese companies, Beijing will take necessary measures to protect them. This stance firmly positions the fate of the popular short-video app at the center of high-stakes economic negotiations between the two global powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the S&P 500 Index repeatedly reaching new records and Wall Street strategists raising their price targets, the current market rally is fraught with significant risks. Key concerns that could trigger a hard landing include a potential downturn in the artificial intelligence boom, negative impacts from the ongoing trade war, and the strain of swelling government debt loads. A weakening U.S. labor market also poses a threat to the optimistic consensus. While many investors and analysts acknowledge these issues, the prevailing sentiment remains bullish, with expectations that upcoming Federal Reserve rate cuts could further fuel the market's upward momentum.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers overcame an early three-run deficit to defeat the San Francisco Giants 13-7, thanks to a powerful offensive resurgence. After struggling in high-leverage situations recently, the Dodgers' bats came alive in a six-run fifth inning, turning the game around. Teoscar Hernández led the charge with a clutch, two-run double that gave the Dodgers the lead, part of a rally where eleven batters came to the plate. The win was a crucial display of resilience for a team that had been battling inconsistency, helping them maintain their 2.5-game lead in the National League West standings.</p>

          <p>Tensions have flared between Egypt and Ethiopia following the inauguration of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, a $5 billion project on the Nile River. Egypt has condemned the dam's launch as an "unlawful unilateral act," fearing it will threaten its vital water supply, and has protested to the UN Security Council. As the diplomatic row intensifies, some observers suggest China, which maintains strong ties with both nations and backed the project, is well-positioned to mediate the dispute. However, Beijing has so far remained neutral, and experts believe it is unlikely to intervene directly in the escalating conflict between the two regional powers.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a bar in Madrid's Puente de Vallecas district has resulted in the death of one person and injuries to at least 25 others. The blast, which occurred on Saturday afternoon, is suspected to have been caused by a gas leak, though the exact cause is still under investigation. Firefighters rescued four people from the rubble, but a man's body was discovered later during the search operation. The building has been deemed unstable, forcing the evacuation and temporary rehousing of residents from the nine apartments located above the heavily damaged bar.</p>
