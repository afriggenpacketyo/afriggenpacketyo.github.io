          <p>President Trump has announced that the U.S. will double tariffs on steel imports, raising them to 50%. This announcement was made at U.S. Steel's Irvin Works in Pennsylvania, where investors and union members were awaiting details on the deal between U.S. Steel and Nippon. Trump described the deal as a "partnership," stating that U.S. Steel's headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh, with Nippon investing $14 billion over 14 months. Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick mentioned that the U.S. government will have a "golden share" to decide on board seats and ensure production levels are maintained. (not investment advice)</p>

Americans cooled off on spending, with overall consumer spending rising only 0.2% in April, down from 0.7% in March, possibly reflecting caution due to higher goods prices.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s report on the causes of chronic disease in children cited over 500 studies, but several of those studies didn't exist, according to NOTUS. An author of one of the studies said she did not author the report listed in the MAHA report, while some studies were also misinterpreted. The White House stated the report would be updated to address the formatting issues. Multiple current and former federal health officials have raised issues with the report, which they say misstated facts and left out well-documented drivers of chronic disease.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that he fired Kim Sajet, the director of the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, citing issues related to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (D.E.I.). Sajet, who had served as the director for more than 12 years, had been working to incorporate more contemporary artists into the gallery's collection. The decision reflects Trump's ongoing focus on cultural and institutional changes within the federal government.</p>

Investors have learned to buy the dip, profiting from the inevitable rally, as Trump often lowers or delays tariffs. The president reacted angrily when asked about the expression, demonstrating the traders' accuracy. While Trump remains committed to tariffs, his administration has frequently adjusted measures on China, Mexico, Canada, and the European Union, often due to market turmoil or lack of clarity on details.
