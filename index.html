          <p>Billy Wilder's 1950 noir masterpiece "Sunset Boulevard" is being celebrated on its 75th anniversary with a restored 4K release. The article explores the film's enduring legacy, featuring interviews with 97-year-old co-star Nancy Olson, who reflects on the production and her work with Gloria Swanson and William Holden. It also discusses the film's adaptation into a successful stage musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber, including the recent Tony-winning revival starring Nicole Scherzinger.

          <p>This article details the year-and-a-half-long process that Senate Republicans undertook to craft and pass President Trump's $3.3 trillion legislative package. The effort, which began with policy retreats well before the 2024 election, involved intense internal negotiations to unify the party on priorities like tax cut extensions and border security. The passage was dramatic, overcoming resistance from fiscal hawks who wanted deeper spending cuts and other members concerned about changes to Medicaid. The final bill ultimately passed with only three Republican senators voting against it, showcasing the party's dealmaking to deliver on a key Trump promise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British actor Ray Brooks, known for a diverse career spanning five decades, has died at the age of 86 after a short illness. He was beloved as the narrator of the classic 1970s children's show "Mr Benn" and gained critical acclaim for his role in the groundbreaking 1966 drama "Cathy Come Home." Brooks also starred in popular primetime shows like "Big Deal" and held the rare distinction of appearing in both "Coronation Street" and "EastEnders." His family noted that he was most frequently remembered for "Mr Benn," whose 13 episodes were repeated for over two decades.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article recounts the history of the first lighthouse fully funded and constructed by the U.S. government, the Cape Henry Lighthouse in Virginia. The contract for its construction was signed on March 31, 1791, by Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, and it was completed the following year. For nearly 90 years, the original stone tower guided ships with its fish-oil-fueled lamps before being replaced by a taller iron structure. The piece also notes the evolution of lighthouses, their automation since 1998, and the technological advancements that have largely replaced the traditional lighthouse keeper.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has characterized the upcoming summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin as a crucial moment to gauge Russia's seriousness about ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking to ABC News, Rutte emphasized that the meeting will be about "testing Putin" and reinforcing the principle that Ukraine must remain a sovereign nation that determines its own future. He expressed his belief that President Trump shares these goals and wants to end the significant loss of life.

          <p>Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is actively campaigning against the proliferation of internet fraud, motivated by scammers using his image to promote Bitcoin theft on YouTube. Wozniak has filed a five-year-long lawsuit against YouTube, arguing the platform does not do enough to protect consumers from such fraudulent content. His legal battle is complicated by Section 230, a federal law that shields online platforms from liability for third-party content. Wozniak expresses dismay at how the internet, once a tool for democratization, has been exploited by companies and bad actors, leading to widespread scams and privacy issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to meet with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, a summit aimed at fulfilling his campaign promise to end the war in Ukraine, despite international condemnation of the Russian leader. The meeting was orchestrated through back-channel discussions led by real-estate executive Steve Witkoff, who secured Putin's willingness to negotiate after months of stalled progress. European allies and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has not been invited at Putin's request, express deep concern that Trump may concede Ukrainian territory to Russia. The article details the complex dynamics, including Trump's personal frustration with Putin and the high-stakes gamble of negotiating without guaranteed outcomes.</p>

          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," delves into the historical fear of female power through the story of five sisters in 18th-century England who are accused of being witches. The narrative, told from the perspectives of outsiders, explores why the sisters' strangeness and transgression of social norms lead the community to believe they can transform into dogs. The book directly engages with the subtext of witch stories, where femininity itself is perceived as a threat. While the novel's themes can sometimes feel familiar, its lush, violent prose and satirical take on cultural anxieties offer a fresh perspective on persecution and womanhood.</p>

          <p>Nineteen states are offering sales tax holidays in 2025, providing a temporary break on state and sometimes local taxes for certain purchases. These events are politically popular and often timed for back-to-school shopping or disaster preparedness, with eligible items typically including clothing, school supplies, and computers under a certain price limit. While some tax experts argue that these holidays primarily benefit wealthier consumers who can time their purchases, many families on tighter budgets plan around them to save money. Shoppers can maximize savings by combining the tax holiday with store promotions and credit card rewards.</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence industry is generating personal wealth at a historic pace, creating dozens of new paper billionaires this year alone. Blockbuster fundraising rounds for startups like Anthropic and OpenAI have pushed valuations to record levels, with now nearly 500 private AI "unicorns" valued at a combined $2.7 trillion. This wealth creation, concentrated largely in Silicon Valley, is outpacing previous tech waves and fueling a resurgence in the Bay Area's economy and high-end real estate market. Experts note that while much of this wealth is currently illiquid, it represents a massive future opportunity for the wealth management industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a constant stream of negative news, significant global progress is often overlooked due to a psychological phenomenon known as negativity bias. Humans are evolutionarily hardwired to focus on threats, which in the modern world can lead to a skewed, pessimistic view of reality. This article argues for the importance of realistic optimism, highlighting underreported positive trends such as falling murder rates in the U.S. and fewer global deaths from extreme weather. Focusing on what is fixable, rather than only what is broken, can foster resilience and inspire the action needed to solve major problems.</p>

          <p>A schoolboy out for a run on a beach in Sanday, one of Scotland's Orkney Islands, discovered the hull of a 275-year-old ship that was washed ashore by a storm. The local community rallied to preserve the 12-ton wreck, which researchers have now identified as the whaling ship Earl of Chatham. Originally built in 1749 as the HMS Hind for the British Royal Navy, the vessel was active during the American Revolution before being sold for whaling. The ship ultimately sank in the North Sea in 1788, with all 56 crew members surviving the wreck.</p>

          <p>A piece of a meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been analyzed by scientists and found to be approximately 4.56 billion years old. This makes the rock about 20 million years older than planet Earth itself. The object was part of a larger fireball that exploded across the sky in June, generating hundreds of sightings. Researchers identified the fragment as a chondrite, the most common type of stony meteorite, which allowed them to determine its ancient origins. The discovery marks the 27th meteorite recovered from Georgia.</p>

Many young people have fled, leaving behind an older population facing rising food prices, destroyed infrastructure, and a lack of essential services like reliable electricity and medical care. The occupying authorities are exerting immense pressure on remaining residents to accept Russian citizenship by denying social benefits and medical treatment to those without Russian passports.

          <p>The 2022 death of Alexandra Pennig, a 32-year-old Minnesota nurse, was initially reported as a suicide by her colleague Matthew Ecker, who was with her at the time. However, detectives grew suspicious of his account, and a crucial piece of evidence—a small metal part of the bathroom door lock—was found under Pennig's body. This discovery proved the door was broken open before she was shot, contradicting Ecker's story that he forced it open after hearing the gunshot. This led to Ecker's arrest, and he was ultimately convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 30 years in prison.</p>

The airline eventually arranged another flight just for the two of them, but the women remain outraged by the communication failure.

          <p>President Trump's recently signed $3.4 trillion tax and spending bill has become a central issue for both Republicans and Democrats as they head into the August recess. Democrats are campaigning against the legislation, focusing on its cuts to Medicaid and the expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies, which they argue will harm working families. Conversely, Republicans are promoting the bill's tax relief for tips and overtime, along with its funding for mass deportations, as fulfilling key campaign promises. With control of the House at stake in the 2026 midterms, both parties are using the recess to shape public opinion on the bill's impact. (not investment advice)</p>

The tower, known as "el refugio" (the shelter), has been restored to its original style and now features interactive displays and a video wall with over 350 personal testimonies. The project aims to preserve the human tales of survival, hope, and the challenges faced by the exiles who shaped modern Miami.</p>

          <p>A "no tax on tips" provision included in President Trump's new legislative bill is causing confusion among service industry workers. The measure provides a deduction of up to $25,000 on tip income, but key details about which occupations and types of gratuities qualify remain unclear. Workers are still liable for state and payroll taxes on tips, and questions persist over how employers will report this income to the IRS.

          <p>This article recommends Michael Young's 1958 satirical novel, "The Rise of the Meritocracy," a book that originally popularized the term but intended it as a pejorative. The story imagines a dystopian future where society is rigidly stratified by educational achievement rather than by traditional social class. This new elite governs until a populist revolt challenges their authority. The reviewer notes that Young, a sociologist who helped shape Britain's welfare state, crafted the novel as a warning against a society where intelligence and achievement become the sole determinants of worth and power.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed NASA to develop and place a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor on the moon by the end of the decade, a critical step toward establishing a permanent human settlement. Nuclear power is considered essential for a lunar base, as it can provide consistent energy during the 14-day lunar nights, unlike solar power. The push is also framed as a matter of national security, aiming to counter a planned joint Chinese-Russian lunar base that will feature a more powerful reactor. This renewed focus on the moon could enable ambitious research, such as building large radio telescopes on the lunar far side.</p>

          <p>For individuals concerned about animal welfare but unable to commit to a strict vegetarian or vegan diet, there are practical ways to significantly reduce animal suffering. This article suggests a "reducetarian" approach, focusing on making more ethical choices when consuming animal products. Key recommendations include opting for pasture-raised meat and wild-caught fish over products from factory farms, where animals endure extreme suffering. Another strategy is to eat larger animals like cows instead of chickens, as it takes far fewer lives to produce the same amount of food, though climate impact should also be considered.</p>

Tarpley, who developed an eating disorder after her mother's death, discusses how this mindset shift helped her live a full life.
