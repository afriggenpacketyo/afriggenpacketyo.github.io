            <p>Shakeil Thibou, a 20-year-old from Kensington, has been convicted of the murder of Cher Maximen at the 2024 Notting Hill Carnival. Maximen was stabbed with a zombie knife in front of her three-year-old daughter during a fight between a group of men on family day. The jury at the Old Bailey reached a majority verdict of 10 to two after a four-week trial. Thibou was also convicted of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent to another carnival-goer and possessing an offensive weapon. This verdict brings some closure to a tragic event that occurred during what is traditionally a celebration of community and culture.</p>

            <p>The bond market experienced unusual volatility as prices tumbled and yields spiked, with the 10-year Treasury yield briefly exceeding 4.5%. This movement is concerning Wall Street, as bonds are typically considered a safe haven during economic uncertainty. The sell-off is attributed to factors like hedge fund margin calls and speculation about foreign holders, possibly China and Japan, dumping U.S. government bonds amidst escalating trade tensions initiated by President Trump's tariffs. This bond market behavior is exacerbating recession fears and adding to the financial market turmoil. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Druze militias in Syria are preparing for potential conflict due to their distrust of the new Syrian government, particularly the influence of Islamist militant groups. The Druze, a religious minority, maintain control of their region and are wary of the government's pledge to disband all militias. Despite ongoing talks, the Druze insist on maintaining their militias to protect their community. The situation is further complicated by sectarian violence and the Druze's historical ties to Israel.</p>

            <p>The Atlantic argues that the current economic slowdown and financial disruption in the United States are self-inflicted due to President Trump's tariff policies. These policies are raising consumer costs, destabilizing markets, and eroding investor confidence. The article suggests the U.S. is headed for stagflation and that the only solution is to reverse the tariffs and restore predictable policymaking. The author expresses little hope for a change in course, criticizing the administration's disregard for economic realities and its reliance on misguided strategies.</p>

The ACLU is representing two Venezuelan migrants who argue that the AEA is being improperly invoked to target a criminal organization rather than a state actor. They also contend that the act is being used outside of a war or invasion, potentially violating the due process rights of those targeted for deportation.</p>
