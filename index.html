          <p>President Trump announced a forthcoming trade deal with a "big, and highly respected, country" but did not disclose the country's name. Reports from the New York Times and Politico suggested the agreement may be with the UK. The announcement is scheduled to take place at 10:00 AM in Washington DC. The deal would be the first of its kind since Trump imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners, so the nature of the deal may be something of a framework rather than a detailed and comprehensive agreement.</p>

Find Inc.'s AI-based platform is being used by around 30 organizations at approximately 2,300 stations, including Haneda airport and the Tokyo police force. Keio Corp., a railway operator, has seen its return rate of lost possessions increase from less than 10% to 30% since adopting the system. The AI system analyzes photos of lost items and matches them with inquiries made through messaging apps in multiple languages, significantly reducing search times and improving the recovery rate of lost items.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military reported that North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles into its eastern waters. The missiles, launched from near Monsanto, flew approximately 800 kilometers before landing in the sea. South Korea is coordinating closely with the United States and Japan to analyze the launches. Experts suggest the launch may be a test of missiles intended for export, potentially to Russia for use in the war against Ukraine, as North Korea's ballistic missile program is banned by UN Security Council resolutions.</p>

          <p>Tarek Bazrouk, a 20-year-old New York resident, has been charged with federal hate crimes for three separate assaults on Jewish protesters in Manhattan. According to prosecutors, Bazrouk allegedly kicked and punched protesters wearing religious attire or carrying Israeli flags at demonstrations over the war in Gaza. The incidents occurred over a nine-month period, and a search of his cellphone revealed pro-Hamas propaganda and messages where he identified himself as a "Jew hater." The charges come amid increased scrutiny of pro-Palestinian demonstrations and accusations of antisemitism.</p>

          <p>A Sacramento family, led by Tou Sue Vang, ran an illegal business buying and selling stolen catalytic converters, generating over $38 million in profit.

Catalytic converter theft is a widespread issue due to the high value of the precious metals they contain, with the converters being sold to DG Auto in New Jersey, which then sold them to a metal refinery for over $600 million.</p>

The company also claims that developers are already exploiting the order to reduce consumer choice.

          <p>Coal miners in West Virginia have lost access to free black lung screenings due to budget cuts mandated by President Trump at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The cuts have eliminated over 200 jobs at the NIOSH facility in Morgantown, West Virginia, affecting mine safety and research on cancer-causing chemicals. The loss of screenings raises concerns about the health and safety of younger coal miners, with fears that black lung cases will increase. The Trump administration claims the cuts are aimed at eliminating wasteful bureaucracy.</p>
