          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch experienced a slowdown in sales growth for its namesake brand in Q2, with a 5% decline. However, the success of its teen-focused Hollister brand, which saw 19% growth, salvaged the quarter, leading to an overall 7% sales increase. The company exceeded Wall Street expectations and raised its full-year revenue outlook, despite facing higher tariff costs. CEO Fran Horowitz anticipates the Abercrombie brand will return to growth by year-end, supported by new categories and partnerships like the NFL. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has reportedly suspended over 20 employees who signed an open letter criticizing President Trump's alleged cuts and interference within the agency. The letter warned of potential national catastrophes due to reduced funding and workforce, referencing Hurricane Katrina. FEMA defended its reforms, calling the critics "bureaucrats" resistant to change. The suspensions, which are administrative leave with pay, follow renewed scrutiny of disaster readiness after recent Texas flooding.</p>

          <p>Fire crews battling a vast moorland blaze on Langdale Moor in North Yorkshire have encountered significant challenges due to exploding World War Two bombs and tank shells. The fire, covering approximately 10 square miles, has burned down into peat, igniting previously hidden explosives, with over 18 explosions reported. Chief Fire Officer Jonathan Dyson described a "very defensive fire-fighting strategy" and requested national assistance as the blaze doubled in size due to wind and temperature changes, devastating local farmland.</p>

          <p>A multi-agency review into a 2024 school stabbing in Ammanford, Wales, which saw a 13-year-old girl attack two teachers and a pupil, found she had a fascination with weapons and war. The girl, who was later sentenced to 15 years, had previously been found with a knife and a BB gun, and shown unusual interests in war memorabilia and Hitler. The report identified missed opportunities for intervention, suggesting "targeted help" could have been beneficial if information had been fully shared and assessed by various agencies.</p>

He reiterated that passengers who adhere to the size limits (which will slightly increase in September due to new EU rules) will face no issues and contribute to faster boarding and fewer delays.</p>

          <p>Claiming Social Security benefits at age 62, the earliest eligibility age, comes with significant financial risks despite its appeal. This article highlights three key downsides: a permanent reduction in monthly benefits (approximately 70% of the full amount), missing out on delayed retirement credits that increase benefits by 8% annually until age 70, and potentially reducing survivor benefits for a spouse. The article suggests alternatives like tapping retirement savings, considering annuities, exploring home equity options, or working part-time to delay claiming and maximize long-term financial security.

The firm stated it has already been unable to launch several medicines in the UK that are available in other European countries, attributing this to outdated assessment methods for drug value.</p>

          <p>Scientists have unearthed a bizarre new armored dinosaur species, Spicomellus afer, in Morocco, dating back 165 million years. Dubbed the "punk rocker" of its time, this ankylosaur is astonishing experts with its metre-long spikes fused directly onto its bones, a feature unseen in any other animal. This discovery challenges existing theories on ankylosaur evolution, suggesting these creatures may have initially developed elaborate armor for display during the Jurassic period, only later co-opting these structures for defense against large predators in the Cretaceous.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has once again blocked the Trump administration from deporting Kilmar Ábrego García, ruling he cannot be removed until at least early October. US District Judge Paula Xinis scheduled an evidentiary hearing for October 6, intending to have administration officials testify about their deportation efforts. Ábrego's lawyers informed the court he plans to seek asylum in the United States. This marks the latest development in a case where Ábrego was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March, returned to the US in June to face criminal charges, and then targeted for deportation to Uganda.</p>
