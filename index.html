          <h2>GOP Bill Proposes Selling USPS Electric Vehicle Fleet</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 19:18:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Republican bill includes a provision that would force the USPS to sell its new electric vehicles, a move framed as cutting costs and focusing on mail delivery rather than environmental initiatives. USPS officials argue that selling the EVs would cost more than replacing them, as the vehicles are specially designed and electrical infrastructure is already in place. Furthermore, the agency says the provision would cripple their ability to modernize an aging fleet, reducing fuel and maintenance costs while better serving the public. The bill is under consideration using budget reconciliation rules, but the Senate parliamentarian has found some provisions to violate the Byrd Rule, which may hinder its passage. Optimism remains that the provision will be stricken, as it would be difficult to get the necessary votes in the Senate to keep it in the bill.</p>

          <p>The Natural History Museum in London is set to display a newly discovered dinosaur species, Enigmacursor mollyborthwickae, a labrador-sized dinosaur that lived approximately 150 million years ago. Initially misclassified as a Nanosaurus, scientists now recognize it as a distinct species due to unique features in its leg bones. This discovery promises to shed light on the evolutionary history of early small dinosaurs and how they evolved into larger, more specialized animals. The fossilized remains are the most complete of any in the world for early small dinosaurs, making this discovery an important contribution to understanding dinosaur diversity in the Late Jurassic period.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles County official, Cynthia Gonzalez, is reportedly under FBI investigation for allegedly sharing a video on social media that appeared to encourage gang members to defend their territory from ICE agents. Gonzalez purportedly urged members of the 18th Street and Florencia 13 gangs to organize and resist ICE operations, even telling gang leaders to get their members in order. The FBI has neither confirmed nor denied the investigation but condemned any call for gang violence. The incident occurred amidst recent anti-ICE protests in LA, which are estimated to have cost taxpayers $32 million, with nearly a dozen deputies injured.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer reports that AI stocks are recovering as fears surrounding Chinese startup DeepSeek's potential to surpass leading tech companies subside. He notes that semiconductor stocks, including Nvidia and AMD, have shown significant gains, signaling renewed investor confidence in the AI sector. The initial panic in January, triggered by DeepSeek's release of an advanced AI model, caused a sharp decline in AI stock values. However, the subsequent recovery suggests that concerns about DeepSeek's dominance were short-lived, refuting the notion that China has overtaken the U.S. in the AI race (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Republicans are pushing to pass a large bill by July 4th, aiming to prevent a major tax hike and implement Trump's agenda, but face internal disagreements and procedural challenges. The bill includes making existing tax rates permanent, adding new tax breaks, funding border security, and cutting federal programs like Medicaid and SNAP. The Senate parliamentarian has questioned some provisions, and Democrats are opposed, leading to potential revisions. The bill's cost is estimated to add trillions to the national debt, with Republicans proposing strategies to offset the costs, including cuts to various government programs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores how voters and politicians now treat scandal as just another factor in a cost-benefit analysis, rather than a simple disqualifier. This shift is illustrated by the comeback of politicians like Andrew Cuomo, who has received endorsements from those who previously condemned him for sexual harassment, and Donald Trump. Several factors contribute to this trend, including a change in how the public views sex scandals, the sheer number of accusations against certain politicians, and the polarized political landscape. While scandals can still hurt a flawed politician, voters are increasingly willing to overlook them if they believe the candidate is more electable or if they find their rival's worldview unacceptable.</p>

          <p>On the same day that President Trump ordered strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, a U.S. intelligence agency assessed that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon within three to eight months, though there was no indication that it had made a decision to do so. The intelligence summary found that Iranian officials had discussed moving highly enriched uranium to avoid destruction. The U.S. airstrikes targeted uranium enrichment and research sites, following days of Israeli actions, although a ceasefire was announced. While Iran has long denied intentions to build nuclear weapons, it insists its uranium enrichment program is for peaceful purposes.</p>

The club claims they have sufficient financial resources for the upcoming season, citing capital injections and the sale of Crystal Palace shares. If the relegation stands, Reims would replace Lyon in the top flight, and Lyon's higher league finish could impact Crystal Palace's Europa League spot due to UEFA's multi-club ownership rules.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes President Trump's announcement of a cease-fire between Israel and Iran, suggesting that it may be premature and mask underlying risks. The author argues that the absence of a diplomatic agreement with Iran on its nuclear program could lead to Iran ending cooperation with the IAEA and covertly pursuing nuclear weapons. The author draws parallels to North Korea's withdrawal from the NPT and subsequent nuclear development. Despite the initial appearance of success, the author suggests that Trump's actions could ultimately lead to the very outcome he seeks to prevent: an Iranian nuclear weapon.</p>

          <p>Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer has dismissed all active gang injunctions, affecting 317 people, citing a narrowed legal definition of gang activity in California. The decision comes after mounting legal pressure from the Peace & Justice Law Center, which argued the injunctions were racially biased. The injunctions, some in effect since 2006, had restricted suspected gang members from certain activities and associations. Civil rights groups have long challenged gang injunctions as overly broad and draconian, especially as gang violence has declined.</p>
