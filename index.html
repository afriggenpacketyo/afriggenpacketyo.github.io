            <p>First responders and survivors of the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks are experiencing significant anxiety and disruption due to ongoing cuts and restructuring within the federal health department. The World Trade Center Health Program, which provides free healthcare, has faced service cuts and restorations, leaving many unsure if their cancer treatments, mental health services, and basic check-ups will be covered. Attorney Michael Barasch describes the situation as "bureaucratic cruelty", as the cuts have affected the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand criticized the Trump administration for using the nation’s heroes as political pawns.</p>

            <p>Grandparents, particularly grandmothers, are increasingly playing a significant role in childcare, evolving from disciplinarians or playmates to co-parents. Economic, cultural, and workplace shifts have created a greater need for grandparents' involvement, with many providing regular childcare to support working parents. This trend reflects a shift in expectations, with grandparents often delaying retirement and providing financial support to their grandchildren. While active grandparenting can offer benefits for both children and older adults, it can also lead to exhaustion and strain, highlighting the need for a stronger social safety net to support families.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>President Trump's tariff policies are expected to disproportionately affect low-income Americans by raising prices on everyday goods. Tariffs act as a consumption tax, increasing costs for essential items and impacting lower-income households more significantly than wealthier ones. According to Yale University's Budget Lab, the bottom 10 percent of households by income could spend 4 percent of their disposable income on tariffs, while the top 10 percent would only pay 1.6 percent. Economists also warn of a potential recession due to the tariffs, which would further exacerbate economic challenges for low-income families.</p>

Aid organizations report that their workers have been killed, and health infrastructure has been targeted, preventing access to healthcare for internally displaced people.

            <p>While Donald Trump's tariff policies have drawn widespread criticism, the underlying issues of globalization and its impact on working-class individuals remain relevant. The shift of manufacturing jobs overseas has led to wage stagnation and economic disappointment for many voters, creating fertile ground for populist movements. Addressing the shortcomings of globalization requires international collaboration and a focus on tackling climate change, war, and poverty. Although Trump's approach is flawed, acknowledging the economic anxieties of those left behind by globalization is crucial for creating more inclusive policies.</p>

The movement is marked by a lack of a hopeful vision for the future, embracing destruction and dominance over dehumanized others.

Small business owners are also concerned about the impact of tariffs on their businesses, particularly those that rely on imported goods.

            <p>The Trump administration is considering pathways to deport US citizens, according to White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, raising concerns about due process and the rule of law. This consideration follows a pattern of the administration dispensing with due process rights in deporting immigrants, targeting them for protected speech, and deporting them to foreign prisons. Legal experts argue that deporting citizens would be illegal, but the administration has increasingly disregarded legal norms in its pursuit of anti-immigrant policies, enabled by a compliant Supreme Court.</p>

            <p>President Trump paused higher trade tariffs for most countries, excluding China, after facing significant economic and political pressure. This decision marked a dramatic climbdown from his previous stance, where he vowed that his policies would never change. The move followed market instability, international condemnation, and concerns from Republicans and business leaders. While the White House attempted to spin the retreat as a masterstroke, the episode damaged America's standing as a reliable ally and raised questions about Trump's economic leadership.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has quietly exempted smartphones from the 125% tariff on goods entering the country from China, a significant retreat in the ongoing trade war. The move avoids a potential "sticker shock" for American consumers and prevents a public repricing of iPhones. Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, is a key player here and is in a position to broker any peace in the US-China trade war. The previous 20% tariffs on China related to the opioid fentanyl, remain in place.</p>

            <p>This article explores which character from Homer's 'Iliad' best embodies Donald Trump, ultimately concluding it's King Agamemnon. Agamemnon, like Trump, is portrayed as a brute who never learns, using intimidation instead of persuasion, and immune to shame. The author argues Agamemnon, similar to Trump, leads his countrymen on a grievance-fueled crusade, causing unnecessary pain and hardship even to those on whose behalf it was fought. The article suggests that Trump's actions mirror Agamemnon's leadership, prioritizing self-interest and leaving chaos in his wake.</p>

            <p>California farmers are bracing for economic upheaval as President Trump's tariffs on key trading partners, like China and Canada, threaten their export markets. The state's agricultural industry, a major exporter of almonds, pistachios, and citrus, faces potential retaliatory tariffs that could significantly impact sales and prices. Farmers express concern over the uncertainty and potential for long-lasting damage to their businesses. While the White House has hinted at a relief plan, California's diverse agricultural sector may not benefit from the same subsidies as other states.</p>
