          <h2>Trump's Reliance on SpaceX Complicates Potential Rift with Musk</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 15:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's criticism of Elon Musk and threats to cancel SpaceX contracts highlight a complex relationship, given the US military and NASA's dependence on SpaceX for space launches and satellite technology. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket dominates satellite launches, and the military relies on Starlink for mobile internet. NASA's Artemis program and lunar space station plans also heavily depend on SpaceX's Starship launch vehicle, making it difficult to sever ties even if Trump desires. Canceling contracts could trigger the Defense Production Act to take control of SpaceX. Optimism for future collaboration remains uncertain amid the ongoing feud.</p>

Opposition parties have been demanding a clear timeline for a democratic transition and have warned of potential instability if the vote is not held by December.

          <p>Despite Elon Musk stepping down from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and his recent conflict with President Trump, the anti-bureaucracy initiative is expected to continue. This initiative, aimed at reducing government spending and bureaucracy, reflects a broader political ideology that views a permanent ruling class of managers and bureaucrats as having usurped democracy. This anti-managerialism has become a central principle of the new right, seeking to roll back bureaucratic control across various sectors. Understanding this movement is crucial for comprehending the Trump administration's efforts to transform institutional landscapes, despite facing resistance.</p>

          <p>Sean Byrne's "Dangerous Animals" draws from serial-killer thrillers and shark survival stories but lacks the narrative twists and thematic depth of his previous work. The film stars Hassie Harrison as a surfer kidnapped by a boat captain who films his victims being devoured by sharks. Despite a juicy setup, the movie is straightforward and underwhelming, with underdeveloped characters and predictable plot twists.
