          <p>The United States has officially designated the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist group in Pakistan, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Washington holds the group responsible for numerous deadly attacks in the Balochistan province, including a recent train hijacking that killed 31 people. The designation, welcomed by Pakistan, tightens scrutiny on the group's supporters and coincides with a visit from Pakistan's army chief and a new trade agreement expected to facilitate US investment in Balochistan's natural resources, which the BLA has historically opposed.</p>

          <p>Iran is navigating the complex geopolitical fallout from a US-brokered peace declaration between its neighbors, Armenia and Azerbaijan. A key provision of the deal is the creation of the "Trump Route," a transit corridor through Armenia that grants the US development rights and offers a new trade connection for Azerbaijan to Europe. This development is a strategic blow to Tehran, which fears diminishing regional influence and growing US presence. Iranian officials have expressed conflicting reactions, highlighting an internal debate over how to respond to the shifting alliances on its border.</p>

          <p>The first 100 days of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's term have been characterized by surprising policy shifts and a strong emphasis on foreign affairs. Key decisions included halting certain weapon supplies to Israel and lifting Germany's strict debt rules to fund massive investments, breaking a campaign promise. While Merz has been active on the international stage, his government faces domestic challenges, including tightening immigration controls and a significant coalition crisis over the appointment of constitutional court judges, casting a shadow over his initial record.</p>

          <p>The latest Consumer Price Index report shows that US prices rose 2.7% in July compared to the previous year, a figure consistent with the month prior. This data arrives amidst significant economic turbulence stemming from President Trump's international trade policies and a recent downward revision of job growth figures. The combination of steady inflation and a weaker labor market creates a complex situation for the Federal Reserve, which is facing political pressure to adjust interest rates while navigating the uncertain impact of tariffs on consumer costs.

          <p>Tom Brady recently shared his thoughts on former coach Bill Belichick's move to college football as the new head coach for the North Carolina Tar Heels. Brady lauded Belichick's unparalleled work ethic and preparation, asserting that any player under his guidance will be exceptionally well-prepared for a professional career in the NFL. However, Brady also hypothesized that Belichick might face a learning curve in coaching younger, less-developed 17 or 18-year-old athletes, which presents a different challenge than coaching experienced NFL players.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis explores the potential motivations behind the Trump administration's decision to grant China a 90-day tariff truce while imposing steeper penalties on other nations like India. The article suggests that China's strategic leverage, particularly its dominance in rare earth minerals essential for US industries, played a key role. Additionally, the move avoids a tariff spike during the crucial holiday retail season and allows more time for broader trade negotiations, reflecting a complex geopolitical calculation by the White House to manage economic pressures.

          <p>While headline inflation remained steady in July, the "core" inflation rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.1% over the past year, marking its largest increase in six months. This acceleration suggests that the rising costs of goods, potentially driven by tariffs, are no longer being offset by moderating prices in the services sector.

          <p>As the new head of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, Kari Lake has moved to dismantle Voice of America (VOA) and is attempting to deport its foreign journalists who are in the country on J-1 visas. Lake has publicly described these journalists, recruited by the US government to counter foreign propaganda, as national security threats and spies. This action has created a crisis for the VOA employees, many of whom face likely persecution or imprisonment if they are forced to return to their home countries after working for the United States.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te is facing a significant drop in public support, according to three recent polls, marking the steepest decline since he took office. His approval ratings have fallen into the low 30s, while disapproval has risen to the mid-50s. This erosion of public trust, which extends even to his political stronghold of Tainan, signals potential difficulties for his ruling party in the upcoming local elections and the 2028 presidential race. The polls reflect widespread pessimism about the direction of his administration.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace has issued a strongly worded statement after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld UEFA's decision to demote the club from the Europa League. The club was penalized for breaching multi-club ownership rules related to its former owner's stake in French club Lyon. In its statement, Palace declared that "sporting merit is rendered meaningless" and that it was "almost impossible to receive a fair hearing," suggesting that certain organizations hold unfair power and influence within European football's governing structures.</p>

          <p>The abrupt closure of private broadcaster News 24 in Tirana, Albania, has triggered protests from journalists, politicians, and activists concerned about press freedom. Police surrounded the station's headquarters and ordered staff to evacuate, taking the 24-hour news channel off the air. The government claims the action was based on a court ruling regarding an expired lease for the state-owned property. However, media organizations and opposition leaders have condemned the move as a politically motivated attack aimed at silencing critical journalism in the EU candidate country.</p>
