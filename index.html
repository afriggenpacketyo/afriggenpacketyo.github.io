          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves expressed her understanding of President Trump's trade concerns ahead of meeting with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant to advocate for a UK-US trade deal. Reeves indicated the UK might lower tariffs on US car imports as part of a broader agreement and acknowledged similarities in how both governments came to power amid voter frustration. While focused on US trade talks, Reeves emphasized the importance of closer trade ties with the EU, highlighting ongoing efforts to reset the relationship and rebuild connections with European finance ministers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the U.S. government to take steps toward mining the ocean floor, despite opposition from most other nations who consider international waters off-limits. This executive order circumvents a decades-old treaty and instructs NOAA to expedite permits for companies to mine in both international and U.S. waters. The move positions the U.S. as a global leader in seabed mineral exploration but risks provoking international outcry due to its disregard for established norms regarding international waters.</p>

          <p>Just Stop Oil (JSO) is ending its campaign of civil disobedience, citing tough new policing powers that make it almost impossible to operate. While JSO claims victory due to government policy aligning with their demands, members admit that new laws have significantly hampered their activities. The shift raises concerns about whether this marks the end of disruptive climate protest or the emergence of more radical, underground action, and prompts reflection on the climate movement's strategy.</p>
