          <p>President Trump held a black-tie dinner for top investors in his cryptocurrency meme coin, $TRUMP, an event criticized as a pay-for-play scheme. Two hundred and twenty crypto traders, many from overseas, invested millions to attend the gala at Trump's golf club, where they expected to hear Trump discuss the future of crypto. Critics argue that Trump is improperly profiting from his position, while supporters see it as an opportunity to engage with the president. The event occurs amid congressional debates over cryptocurrency regulation, with some Democrats citing potential conflicts of interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has halted Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, citing a failure to comply with reporting requirements and alleging a hostile learning environment for Jewish students. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated the university can no longer enroll foreign students, and current students must transfer or lose their legal status. Harvard called the action unlawful and vowed to fight it, emphasizing the importance of international students to the university's mission. The decision impacts roughly 6,800 international students, a significant portion of Harvard's student body, and could have major financial implications for the institution.</p>

Trump's announcement of an expedited path for white South Africans to resettle in the United States as "refugees" has been met with anger, given the history of apartheid. Many jokes stem from the idea that Afrikaners are used to a life of privilege made possible by Black workers. Despite President Ramaphosa's attempts to focus on trade, Trump continued to make false claims about violence against white farmers.</p>

          <p>Corey O'Connor won the Democratic primary for mayor of Pittsburgh, representing a shift from progressive policies. O'Connor's victory rekindles memories of his father, Bob, who also served as mayor.

O'Connor's ascent represents a notable turn for the city and the party, four years after Ed Gainey rode a wave of pandemic-fueled progressivism to defeat two-time incumbent Bill Peduto in the Democratic primary.</p>
