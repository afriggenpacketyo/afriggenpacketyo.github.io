          <p>Australia has declared its intention to officially recognize a Palestinian state in September at the UN General Assembly, a move that aligns with recent positions taken by the UK, France, and Canada. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated the decision aims to support a two-state solution as the best path to peace in the Middle East. The recognition is contingent on commitments from the Palestinian Authority that Hamas will have no role in a future state. This development comes amid ongoing conflict and a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Israel opposing the move, claiming it "rewards terrorism."</p>

          <p>Tech giants Nvidia and AMD have agreed to an unprecedented deal to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from specific chip sales in China. This arrangement is part of a deal to secure export licenses for advanced artificial intelligence chips, such as Nvidia's H20, which were previously restricted due to national security concerns. While the move signals easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, some analysts question how a payment resolves the underlying security issues. The agreement places significant financial pressure on the companies but allows them to compete in the vast Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A top Russian official has confirmed that the country continued to research and develop intermediate- and shorter-range missile systems even while a deployment moratorium was in effect. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov stated that the moratorium only applied to deployment, not R&D, and that Russia now possesses a "substantial arsenal" of these weapons. This admission follows Russia's recent withdrawal from the unilateral moratorium, a move it framed as a response to actions by the U.S. and its allies. The original 1987 treaty, designed to ease Cold War tensions, unraveled after the U.S. withdrew in 2019, citing Russian violations.</p>

          <p>Two blind women traveling from New Orleans to Orlando claim they were the only passengers on their Southwest Airlines flight after a gate change for a rebooked flight was not communicated to them. Following a nearly five-hour delay, they boarded their originally scheduled plane to find it empty, stating they were told the airline "forgot about" them. The women are calling for improved communication for passengers with disabilities, as required by the Air Carrier Access Act. Southwest Airlines disputed the claim that they were forgotten, stating the women remained on their originally scheduled flight, and offered them a $100 travel voucher for the delay.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office is expanding its policy to deport foreign criminals before their appeals are heard, adding 15 new countries, including India and Canada, to the scheme. This "deport now, appeal later" initiative allows the government to expel foreign nationals whose human rights claims have been refused, with appeals conducted via video link from their home countries. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the measure aims to prevent offenders from exploiting the immigration system and to fast-track removals. The move is part of a broader government strategy to toughen its stance on foreign criminals and increase public safety.</p>

This development comes as Vice President JD Vance dismissed reports of a meeting at his home concerning Jeffrey Epstein, clarifying that a White House meeting on a different topic occurred. Vance also downplayed speculation about a 2028 presidential ticket with Marco Rubio, stating their current focus is on governing, not future political campaigns.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks clinched a thrilling 94-91 victory against the Seattle Storm, thanks to a game-winning layup by Dearica Hamby with just 5.6 seconds remaining.

          <p>The UK government is preparing a significant overhaul of road safety laws for England and Wales, which could see motorists over 70 banned for failing compulsory triennial eye tests. The new strategy, expected in the autumn, also proposes lowering the drink-drive limit to match Scotland's stricter standard and introducing penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. These potential changes follow a coroner's report that labeled the UK's driver licensing system the "laxest in Europe" regarding eyesight checks.

          <p>While mature black holes are known for letting nothing escape, newly formed black holes exhibit a unique phenomenon described as a form of "music." During their formation, such as from a star's collapse, the resulting distortion in space-time quickly settles into a stable, mathematically perfect shape. This process generates vibrations, or gravitational waves, that ring out as the black hole stabilizes. These "good vibrations" offer a way to study these enigmatic objects in their infancy. Scientists anticipate that future observations will allow them to experience this strange, pure cosmic music, providing new insights into the fundamental laws of physics.</p>

          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (US$501) annually for each child under three years old. While the amount is uniform, its impact is expected to vary significantly across different economic regions. In poorer provinces like Gansu, the subsidy represents a substantial portion of the average resident's income (over 13.5%), whereas in affluent cities like Shanghai, it accounts for just 4.1%. This structure means the policy is likely to provide a more significant boost to consumption and potentially birth rates in less affluent, rural areas, where the financial support will be felt more acutely.

          <p>The United Kingdom's seas have experienced their warmest start to the year on record, a trend linked to climate change that is causing dramatic shifts in marine life. The unusually high water temperatures have led to sightings of species not typically widespread in UK waters, such as octopus, bluefin tuna, and mauve stinger jellyfish. Scientists view these arrivals as indicators of an ecosystem in flux. While these new species are thriving, the heat is negatively impacting native cold-water species like cod, pushing them to their limits and forcing them to move north. These marine heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense, posing long-term challenges.</p>

This declaration comes ahead of a planned one-on-one meeting between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a ceasefire. The White House has indicated it is open to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy joining the summit, but the meeting currently remains bilateral at Putin's request. The European statement stressed that Ukraine's internationally recognized borders must not be changed by force, underscoring their commitment to a just and lasting peace for Kyiv.</p>

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose secured his first PGA Tour victory in over two years, winning the St. Jude Championship in a dramatic three-hole playoff against American JJ Spaun. After both players finished at 16-under-par, they went to a sudden-death playoff where they matched each other on the first two holes. Rose ultimately clinched the title with a birdie on the third playoff hole. The victory was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who had entered the final round with the lead but finished one stroke behind, tied for third. For Rose, the win marked his 12th PGA Tour title.</p>

          <p>The UK government has introduced new measures to help newly qualified nurses and midwives in England find employment, addressing a situation where there are significantly more graduates than available vacancies. The plan aims to cut red tape, allowing NHS trusts to hire more easily, including recruiting based on anticipated future needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies. The Royal College of Nursing welcomed the initiative but stated the true test will be whether graduates can actually secure jobs. While the move is intended to support the healthcare workforce, questions remain about how it will be funded, as NHS trust budgets are already under severe pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified the gunman who opened fire on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta as Patrick Joseph White, a 30-year-old man who reportedly blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for personal health issues. The attack resulted in the death of DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose. White, who was armed with five guns, was later found dead inside a nearby building. A union representing CDC workers stated the incident was not random and called on federal officials to condemn vaccine misinformation, which they argue puts scientists at risk. The shooting has left staff traumatized and raised security concerns at the facility.</p>

          <p>Trey Lance is making a strong case in the competition for the Los Angeles Chargers' backup quarterback position, seemingly closing the gap with Taylor Heinicke. In a 27-13 preseason victory over the New Orleans Saints, Lance showcased his dual-threat ability, rushing for 48 yards and a touchdown while completing seven passes. His performance, which demonstrated growing confidence and playmaking ability, earned praise from coach Jim Harbaugh. In contrast, Heinicke, the presumed backup, appeared rusty in his first preseason action, completing only one of five passes. Lance's continued development is a key storyline for the Chargers as they evaluate their roster depth.</p>

          <p>A man was arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border after U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents discovered an endangered spider monkey hidden in a backpack inside his car. The man, Juan Manuel Valdez, admitted to purchasing the monkey in Mexico and gave conflicting stories, first claiming it was for his children and later that he intended to sell it to a friend. He lacked the required permits for importing the animal. The incident highlights the serious issue of illegal wildlife trafficking, which threatens endangered species, undermines conservation efforts, and can introduce diseases. Spider monkeys are critically endangered due to habitat loss and the exotic pet trade.</p>

          <p>A 2022 study conducted on mice has suggested a potential link between damaging the internal nasal tissue and an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's-like symptoms. Researchers found that when the nasal epithelium is damaged, certain bacteria, like Chlamydia pneumoniae, have a clearer path to the brain via the olfactory nerve. In response to this bacterial presence, the mouse brains deposited more amyloid-beta protein, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. While the findings are yet to be confirmed in humans, they offer a new avenue for understanding the environmental triggers of the disease and suggest that damaging the protective lining of the nose is best avoided.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has demanded that homeless people in Washington D.C. must "move out, IMMEDIATELY," vowing to provide them with shelter "FAR from the Capital." This directive is part of a broader plan to address what he describes as out-of-control crime and a lack of cleanliness in the city. The announcement follows an order making it easier to arrest homeless individuals and the deployment of federal agents to the capital. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has pushed back, stating that the city is not experiencing a crime spike and criticizing the White House's rhetoric. The move signals a contentious federal intervention into local city management.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are strongly defending their colleagues who fled Texas to block a Republican-led redistricting effort, which they have labeled as "cheating." The proposed new congressional maps could give the GOP a significant advantage in future elections. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker accused Texas Governor Greg Abbott of "whittling away" at democracy to appease Donald Trump. In response, Abbott has threatened to have the fleeing lawmakers arrested upon their return to Texas and has vowed to call continuous special legislative sessions until the matter is resolved. The standoff highlights the intense partisan battle over redistricting and its potential impact on control of the U.S. House.</p>

          <p>A 60-foot passenger vessel named Discovery ran aground in powerful surf near Honolulu's Kewalo Basin Harbor. Video captured the boat being tossed by large waves, nearly flipping on its side before coming to rest in shallow water. The two crew members aboard were not injured. The boat's operator reported that two large waves hit the stern, disrupting its course and causing a loss of propulsion. The Coast Guard confirmed that the vessel's fuel and oil were removed to prevent pollution, and a salvage company planned to tow it away at high tide. The incident is currently under investigation by authorities.</p>
