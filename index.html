        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that many tariffs imposed by President Trump exceed his authority under federal emergency laws. The decision deals a significant blow to his trade strategy but does not immediately block the tariffs, sending the case back to a lower court to reevaluate the injunction. The ruling pertains to broad tariffs on numerous countries and specific duties on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. The Trump administration has vowed to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, arguing it undermines presidential power in foreign policy.</p>

          <p>A 78-year-old retired education professor, who has authored over 175 books, attributes his sharp memory to five daily practices. He emphasizes regular social interaction, lifelong learning by reading outside his expertise, and maintaining a personal organizational system. Additionally, he stresses the importance of daily physical activity, such as swimming and walking, to increase blood flow to the brain. A healthy diet, adequate hydration, and at least seven hours of sleep each night complete his regimen for cognitive health.</p>

          <p>Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan Maclean, three brothers from Scotland, have set a new world record by rowing unsupported across the Pacific Ocean in 139 days. They completed the 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia, becoming the first team to row the full distance non-stop. The trio overcame severe weather and personal challenges, including one brother being swept overboard, while raising over £700,000 for clean water projects. Their journey broke the previous record of 160 days set by a solo rower in 2014.</p>

          <p>Photographer Zed Nelson's new book, "The Anthropocene Illusion," examines how humanity's separation from the natural world leads to the creation of artificial, curated experiences of nature. Nelson traveled to 14 countries over six years, capturing images of contrived scenarios like staged safaris in Kenya and elephants chained in Sri Lankan infinity pools for tourist photos. The project critiques how zoos, theme parks, and even national parks present a managed version of the wild, creating an illusion that distracts from ongoing environmental destruction. Nelson's work serves as a commentary on the loss of authentic connection to the natural world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The tradition of a single wedding dress is evolving, with many modern brides now buying multiple outfits for a series of events spanning months. Influenced by social media and increasingly extravagant wedding seasons, brides are purchasing an average of 12 looks for occasions like bachelorette parties, bridal showers, and rehearsal dinners. This trend has prompted retailers like David's Bridal to create dedicated collections of "Little White Dresses" and accessories.

          <p>As Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) marks ten years in power, his leadership has brought profound changes to the kingdom, fundamentally rewiring its society and economy. Key reforms include significantly advancing women's rights, such as allowing them to drive and increasing their workforce participation to 36%, and sidelining the religious police to open up social spaces. Economically, his Vision 2030 plan aims to diversify away from oil through massive investments in technology and mega-projects like NEOM. While these rapid changes have been accompanied by tight political control and suppression of dissent, they represent a historic transformation of the conservative nation.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the 21-month conflict in Gaza, arguing that Palestinian voices who warned of a genocide from the beginning were systematically dismissed by Western institutions and media. The author contends that Palestinian humanity is deliberately undermined, making their suffering easier to ignore until it reaches a stage, like famine, that Western audiences can process without confronting their own complicity. The piece criticizes the media's framing of the conflict, which often strips Palestinians of their right to narrate their own experience without apology. It calls for an end to this dehumanization and for concrete actions like sanctions and an arms embargo against Israel.</p>

The event is being analyzed through various lenses, with some conservatives hoping marriage will "deradicalize" Swift, while figures like JD Vance have floated conspiracy theories about the NFL being rigged in Kelce's favor. The author notes the tendency to project ideologies onto the couple, from feminist praise for Kelce's support of Swift's success to criticism of his past comments. The article also critiques Swift for not using her immense influence to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, arguing her silence is a deliberate choice.</p>

He noted that public trust in government plummeted during the Vietnam and Watergate eras and has remained low ever since. Balz's observations highlight a long-term decline in civility and faith in political institutions over the course of his extensive career.</p>

          <p>Pastor Kelvis Reid survived a major cardiac arrest caused by AL amyloidosis, a rare disease that made his heart "hard as cement." After his family's CPR training saved him, he spent weeks unconscious on life support before doctors stabilized his condition enough for a high-risk transplant. Reid successfully underwent both a heart and a kidney transplant on the same weekend and has since made a remarkable recovery. Eighteen months later, he has returned to his pulpit and even participated in a 5K run with the hospital staff who cared for him, inspiring his community with his story of resilience and faith.</p>

          <p>The perception of Indian food in the United States is undergoing a significant transformation, moving beyond "cheap food and curry houses" to sophisticated, upscale dining. Restaurateurs like Vikas Khanna, whose restaurant Junoon earned a Michelin star, are leading a new wave of establishments that explore the depth and regional diversity of Indian cuisine. This trend is fueled by younger consumers' growing interest in global flavors and an increasingly affluent Indian American population. As a result, investor interest is growing, with private equity firms now backing popular Indian restaurant chains looking to expand in the U.S. market.</p>

          <p>U.S. law enforcement agencies are increasingly alarmed by the growing interest among far-right extremist groups in using commercially available or homemade drones for domestic attacks. Drawing inspiration from their use in modern warfare and by criminal cartels, these groups discuss drones as a key weapon for a future insurgency against the U.S. government. The FBI has expressed major concerns about accelerationist neo-Nazi sects, which have a history of targeting critical infrastructure, potentially using drones for reconnaissance or to deliver explosives. This trend represents a significant and evolving threat to domestic security.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's executive order directing federal officials to prosecute flag-burners is likely to be legally ineffective and could even aid defendants in court, according to legal analysis. The Supreme Court has twice ruled, in 1989 and 1990, that flag-burning is a form of protected speech under the First Amendment. While the order correctly notes that flag-burners can be charged under content-neutral public burning laws, the order itself provides evidence of a discriminatory motive. This could allow defendants to argue "selective prosecution," claiming they were targeted for the political message of their act, which is unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the University of California system should legally challenge the Trump administration's freezing of hundreds of millions in research funds rather than negotiate a settlement. The author, a co-counsel in a similar successful lawsuit brought by researchers, contends the administration's actions are an illegal form of extortion, using antisemitism as a pretext to advance an ideological agenda. Capitulating, the author warns, would set a dangerous precedent, betray the university's values, and throw vulnerable groups like transgender students under the bus. The column urges the university to fight in court for its principles and its community.</p>

          <p>Reflecting on a recent deadly shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, this opinion article laments the repetitive cycle of tragedy, grief, and inaction that follows such events in America. The principal of the school, Matthew DeBoer, is quoted invoking an African proverb: "When you pray, move your feet," calling for concrete action to prevent future violence. The piece underscores the profound heartbreak of children having to flee for their lives in places that should be safe. It concludes that hope must be found not just in prayer, but in the "prayer of the feet" — tangible efforts to create change.</p>

          <p>An investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and The Guardian has revealed links between several major sportswear brands, including Nike, Li-Ning, Anta, and 361 Degrees, and forced labor programs involving ethnic minorities from China's Xinjiang region. These brands, which have lucrative sponsorship deals with prominent NBA players, have been connected to factories participating in the Chinese government's labor transfer scheme. The report highlights the NBA's complex financial relationship with China and raises ethical questions for the league and its star players who promote these brands. The revelations follow criticism from former player Enes Kanter Freedom, whose career ended after he spoke out on the issue.</p>

          <p>Two major new studies have found that beta-blockers, a standard treatment for heart attack patients for decades, offer no benefit to the majority of patients and may increase risks for certain women. The research revealed that for patients with normal heart function after a heart attack, the drug did not reduce the risk of future cardiac events. Furthermore, women with preserved heart function who took beta-blockers had a significantly higher risk of another heart attack, hospitalization for heart failure, and death compared to those not on the drug. These findings are expected to reshape international clinical guidelines for post-heart attack care.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his new book "Breakneck," author Dan Wang posits that a key difference between China and the U.S. is that China is an "engineering state" while America is a "lawyerly society." He argues that China's leadership, often composed of trained engineers, approaches societal problems as technical challenges to be solved, resulting in rapid, large-scale infrastructure projects like high-speed rail and massive bridges. In contrast, America's legalistic culture, while protecting pluralism, often leads to procedural gridlock and paralysis, slowing down construction and development. This framework helps explain why a poor Chinese province can have better infrastructure than America's wealthiest states.</p>

          <p>Major coffee chains such as Costa Coffee are facing challenges as consumer tastes, particularly among younger generations, evolve. The rise of trendy alternatives like matcha, offered by newer chains like Blank Street Coffee, is capturing the "matcha generation" that seeks novel and aesthetically pleasing drinks as an affordable luxury. Compounded by the cost of living crisis and the popularity of home coffee machines, legacy brands are struggling to compete. Analysts suggest that chains that fail to innovate and respond to these shifting consumer behaviors, which favor artisanal experiences and unique offerings, risk becoming irrelevant in a crowded market.</p>

          <p>This article defends the efficacy of direct cash transfers as a primary tool for poverty reduction, pushing back against recent interpretations of new pilot programs that showed lackluster results on secondary metrics like health and employment. The author argues that decades of research have consistently shown that giving people money successfully lifts them out of poverty, even if the effects are muted during periods of high inflation and widespread government stimulus. While acknowledging that cash transfers cannot solve supply-side problems like the high cost of housing and childcare, the piece concludes they remain a superior, simpler, and more effective anti-poverty policy than more complicated interventions.</p>
