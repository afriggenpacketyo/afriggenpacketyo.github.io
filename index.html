The technology giant also issued an optimistic forecast for the upcoming fiscal year, projecting revenue to land between $59 billion and $60 billion. Despite operating within a complex global economic environment, Cisco reported particularly strong performance in its core networking division. Furthermore, the company noted substantial growth in its AI infrastructure orders, which have already totaled over $2 billion for the fiscal year, reinforcing management's confidence that artificial intelligence is a durable, long-term trend.

          <p>A man in Washington, D.C. now faces federal charges for assaulting a Customs and Border Protection officer, an act he allegedly committed by throwing a sandwich at him during a protest. The incident occurred in the midst of a heated verbal confrontation where the man reportedly shouted profanities at the officer. This event unfolds against a backdrop of heightened local tensions surrounding an increased federal law enforcement presence in the city. The deployment was initiated by President Trump to address public safety, though local officials and police statistics suggest that violent crime has actually been on the decline.</p>

Cudi testified in support of his ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, regarding allegations that Diddy had set his car on fire years ago. He explained that his ultimate motivation was to support Ventura, whom he knew had been "living a nightmare" and that he wanted to see her thrive. Combs was ultimately found not guilty of sex trafficking and racketeering but was convicted on charges of transportation to engage in prostitution and now awaits sentencing.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to cancel billions of dollars in congressionally approved foreign aid can proceed, dealing a blow to humanitarian groups. The court's 2-1 decision focused on procedural grounds, stating that the plaintiffs, a group of nonprofits, were not eligible to bring the lawsuit in the first place. This ruling allows the administration to withhold critical funding for global health initiatives, including HIV/AIDS prevention, which advocates warn could have a severe humanitarian impact. The decision also strengthens the administration's ability to impound funds appropriated by Congress, raising concerns about the separation of powers.</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old New York man has been arrested and federally charged with cyberstalking for allegedly leaving a series of threatening voicemails for the widow of Brian Thompson. Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was fatally shot on a Manhattan sidewalk in December. The suspect, Shane Daley, reportedly left profanity-laced messages calling the late CEO a "f------ capitalist pig" and stating he deserved to die for profiting from the healthcare system. Investigators traced the calls to Daley's personal phone number, and he was released with conditions including GPS monitoring while awaiting further legal proceedings.</p>

This marks a dramatic financial turnaround from a decade ago when the team, then based in St. Louis, was ranked last in the league with a valuation of just $930 million. The incredible surge in value is largely attributed to the team's strategic move back to Los Angeles and the construction of the multi-billion dollar, state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium in Inglewood.

The Mendenhall River crested at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record and causing authorities to issue evacuation warnings for low-lying areas. The flooding is an annual event caused by the climate-change-driven retreat of a smaller glacier, which leaves a basin that fills with meltwater and eventually bursts. This year, officials closed the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area and delayed the start of public school, though newly installed temporary barriers helped prevent widespread home damage.</p>

A new study led by the University of Adelaide used ancient DNA and computer models to reconstruct reindeer population changes over the last 21,000 years. The findings show that while the species has survived past warming periods, the losses expected from current, rapid climate change are likely to be far more severe.

          <p>U.S. men's national team stars Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah, along with Pulisic's father, have strongly criticized former USMNT players who now work as media pundits. In a new docuseries, Weah described the commentators as "evil" and suggested they are merely "chasing checks" by harshly bashing the current team's performance and commitment. Pulisic expressed that he felt disrespected by the critiques, particularly those concerning his decision to skip the Gold Cup due to fatigue. His father, Mark Pulisic, attributed the negative commentary to jealousy, urging the pundits to examine their own past performances before judging.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave dropped sharply by 20% after the company reported a quarterly financial loss that was significantly wider than analysts had anticipated. The poor results were released just before the expiration of the post-IPO lock-up period, which could introduce more stock volatility as company insiders become eligible to sell their shares. Despite the reported loss, CoreWeave's revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, surpassing forecasts and reflecting the surging demand for AI services. The company also raised its full-year revenue guidance, but some analysts expressed concern over a delay in capital expenditures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Missouri health officials have confirmed a rare and dangerous infection from the Naegleria fowleri amoeba, which is commonly known as the brain-eating amoeba. The unidentified patient is currently being treated in an intensive care unit, and the infection is possibly linked to water skiing in the Lake of the Ozarks just days before the illness began. This type of infection, called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), is extremely rare but is almost always fatal. It occurs when contaminated freshwater is forced up the nose, allowing the organism to travel to the brain, a risk associated with some recreational water activities.</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining approximately 2%, even as some of the market's largest technology companies saw declines. This market rotation appears to be driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates at its September policy meeting. Lower interest rates are particularly beneficial for smaller companies, as they reduce borrowing costs and can potentially stimulate broader consumer spending. Despite the strong daily performance, small-cap stocks have still significantly underperformed their large-cap counterparts since the AI-driven market boom began in late 2022.

          <h2>Economists Expect Higher Consumer Inflation from Tariffs Despite Trump's Criticism of Goldman Sachs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While President Trump has publicly lambasted Goldman Sachs for predicting higher consumer inflation as a result of tariffs, many economists across Wall Street share the same outlook. The general consensus is that as pre-tariff inventories are sold off and higher duty rates take full effect, companies will increasingly pass these additional costs on to consumers. Economists predict this could add as much as 1.5% to the inflation rate and subtract 1% from GDP growth. This economic debate highlights the significant uncertainty surrounding the administration's trade policies and their ultimate impact on the finances of American households.

          <p>This personal essay reflects on the emotional experience of a pet owner whose dog, Odie, required urgent emergency surgery after swallowing an object that caused a gastric obstruction. The author, who is an oncologist, praises the entire veterinary staff for their professionalism, clear communication, and deep compassion regarding both the complex medical options and the significant financial costs involved. The article highlights how the staff skillfully treated both the anxious owner and the sick pet with tailored empathy, a quality the author feels is sometimes lacking in human medicine. The experience reinforces the view that veterinarians are unsung heroes of healthcare.</p>

          <p>Funke, the acclaimed Beverly Hills pasta restaurant from celebrity chef Evan Funke, has been forced to temporarily close its doors after a fire occurred on Tuesday evening.

The Beverly Hills Fire Department is currently investigating the cause of the fire. The restaurant, known for its exquisite handmade pasta and regional Italian cuisine, is contacting guests with existing reservations to offer alternatives at Funke's other local establishments.</p>

          <p>Climate scientists are organizing a coordinated public response to a recent Department of Energy report that cast doubt on the established scientific consensus regarding the climate crisis. This effort is part of a broader pushback to uphold science as the Trump administration attempts to undo the "endangerment finding," the legal foundation for most U.S. climate regulations. The National Academies of Sciences has also launched a fast-track review of evidence on the health impacts of greenhouse gases. These actions come as the administration has been accused of deleting climate data from government websites and promoting misinformation to undermine environmental policies.</p>

Jones, now 82, stated that he was "saved by a fabulous treatment" which involved an experimental trial drug known as PD-1 inhibitor therapy, a treatment that helps the body's own immune system attack cancer cells. Over the following decade, he underwent multiple surgeries on his lungs and lymph nodes as part of his comprehensive treatment. He now reports that he is free of tumors, sharing his personal story of survival.</p>
