          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a conservative backed by President Trump, narrowly won Poland's presidential election against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski. The outcome suggests Poland is expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader. Nawrocki, a 42-year-old amateur boxer and historian, was tapped by the Law and Justice party as part of its push for a fresh start. His win could complicate Prime Minister Donald Tusk‚Äôs efforts to advance his liberal agenda, and his election has sparked varied reactions from international leaders, including congratulations from EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and lauding from Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to remodel flight paths, potentially leading to quicker flights and fewer delays. The initial focus will be on modernizing airspace around London, with changes expected to take years to implement. The plans also aim to reduce aviation's climate change impacts and facilitate new technologies like flying taxis. However, some community groups warn that new flight paths could affect previously undisturbed areas, and environmental groups stress the importance of prioritizing environmental concerns during the redesign.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have engineered a new type of rice, dubbed 'tea rice,' that contains catechin, an antioxidant found in green tea. This innovation aims to provide the health benefits of tea without the caffeine-related side effects. Catechins are known for their antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and cardioprotective properties, potentially aiding in blood pressure regulation and weight loss. The researchers hope this development will offer a new way to consume beneficial micronutrients, enhancing the nutritional value of a staple food.</p>

          <p>The GOP's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is moving to the Senate, where it faces significant challenges from Republican spending hawks concerned about the bill's impact on the national debt. The bill, which includes tax cuts, increased border and military spending, and Medicaid cuts, is projected to increase the deficit by trillions of dollars. Concerns over the deficit and Medicaid changes could lead to substantial modifications in the Senate, with some Republicans threatening to block the bill in its current form. The bill also faces potential challenges under the Byrd Rule, which could strip out non-budgetary measures.</p>

          <p>The rapid clean-up of fire debris in Los Angeles after January's wildfires is raising concerns about potential health hazards. While officials are ahead of schedule, some experts question whether the soil is safe, citing the presence of lingering toxins even after federal crews have removed debris. Concerns center around benzenes from exploded propane tanks and high levels of lead, prompting calls for comprehensive soil testing, which FEMA is no longer requiring. Thousands of survivors are in limbo, with some giving up and planning to leave their neighborhoods due to safety concerns.</p>
