          <p>General Asim Munir, Pakistan's army chief, has arrived in Washington for a visit expected to last until June 18, which includes attending the US Army’s 250th anniversary celebrations. The visit, reportedly at the invitation of the Trump administration, will likely involve high-level meetings at the State Department and the Pentagon. Analysts suggest that Munir's acceptance of the invitation indicates Pakistan’s desire to recalibrate its relationship with the US amid increasing US-India strategic alignment and growing American concerns over China’s global influence. Discussions are expected to cover topics such as cryptocurrency, China's influence, and critical minerals, reflecting the complex geopolitical landscape and economic interests at play.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office reveals that President Trump's megabill would disproportionately benefit wealthy households while reducing resources for the poorest. According to the CBO, households in the top 10% would see gains of approximately $12,000 per year, whereas the poorest US households would experience a reduction of about $1,600 annually. The analysis arrives amid debates over the mobilization of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth scheduled to testify before the House Armed Services Committee. Preparations are underway in Washington for a large-scale military parade commemorating the Army's 250th birthday.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles. Padilla interrupted Noem's update on immigration operations and protests, attempting to ask questions before being escorted out. Noem described the "burdensome leadership" of California's governor and the mayor of Los Angeles prior to Padilla's interruption. Padilla stated he was waiting for a scheduled briefing when he went to listen to Noem's speech, seeking information about DHS's immigration enforcement actions around the L.A. area and the state; he reported being forced to the ground and handcuffed, but not detained or arrested.</p>

          <p>A federal judge stated that an order regarding California's challenge to the Trump administration's deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles is forthcoming. California Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed an emergency request to block the expansion of what they called the "unnecessary" and "unlawful militarization." The request seeks to prevent the use of federalized National Guard and active duty Marines beyond protecting federal buildings and property. The federal government argues that the president complied with Title 10 of the U.S. Code, while California contends that the National Guard was not lawfully federalized.</p>

Hospital executives explained that continuing the center's operations would jeopardize the hospital’s ability to care for other children, referencing warnings from federal agencies about potential prosecutions for doctors providing care opposed by the administration.

          <h2>Immigration Raids in Los Angeles Signal Wider Enforcement Strategy</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is expanding its immigration enforcement strategy, targeting anyone deportable and conducting raids in previously off-limits locations. Chief advisor on border policy Tom Homan stated that the administration is not happy with the current deportation numbers and aims to find more people. The administration is also appealing to the public to report undocumented individuals and has mobilized military troops in Los Angeles without local consent. Critics argue these actions are retribution against California for its immigrant-protective policies and a distraction from the president’s tax-and-spending bill.</p>

          <p>An Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff in western India, resulting in the deaths of all but one person on board. The flight, bound for London, marked the first crash of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the deadliest plane crash in years. Investigators will examine the black boxes, maintenance records, pilot maneuvers, and weather conditions to determine the cause of the crash. Concerns about Dreamliner manufacturing and quality have surfaced, but experts suggest it is too early to attribute the crash to those issues.</p>
