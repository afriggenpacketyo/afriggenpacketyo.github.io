            <p>An Israeli air strike struck Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City, resulting in significant damage to the intensive care and surgery departments and forcing the evacuation of patients and staff. The IDF stated the hospital contained a Hamas command center, taking steps to mitigate harm, including advanced warnings and precise munitions. The Hamas-run health ministry condemned the attack, citing the complete destruction of the building. This incident follows a previous attack on the same hospital in October 2023, which resulted in numerous casualties. Optimism score: 10</p>

            <p>President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies are causing confusion and anxiety among US consumers, with some engaging in panic buying while others feel paralyzed by the uncertainty. The tariffs, including a 10% tax on most imports and a 145% duty on goods from China, are expected to lead to higher prices for clothing, electronics, and toys. Yale's Budget Lab estimates a roughly $4,700 increase in costs for the typical US family. The situation is further complicated by businesses introducing tariff surcharges and canceling shipments from China, raising concerns about potential shortages. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>After a brief period of corporate pseudo-benevolence, a new era of workplace austerity is emerging, characterized by increased surveillance and inflexible practices. Some companies are using AI to monitor employee emails and scan for anti-Trump sentiment or DEI buzzwords, while others are implementing stricter policies and expecting total loyalty. However, Gen Z workers are pushing back, prioritizing work-life balance and seeking companies that offer secure contracts and ample benefits. Despite the rise of punitive surveillance culture, the long-term effectiveness of these practices is questionable, as they often lead to less productive and unhappy employees.</p>

            <p>PGA Tour Enterprises is considering a bid to acquire partial ownership of the United States' Ryder Cup operations from the PGA of America, potentially costing hundreds of millions of dollars. This move reflects the PGA Tour's long-standing desire to control key elements in golf, including the majors and the Ryder Cup. The Strategic Sports Group has invested $1.5 billion into PGA Tour Enterprises, though plans for the Public Investment Fund to match that investment have been delayed. Meanwhile, the unification of golf remains uncertain, despite Yasir Al-Rumayyan's presence at Augusta National.</p>

            <p>High heels are experiencing a resurgence in popularity, taking on new meanings in today's socio-political climate. While some embrace heels as a marker of retrogressive femininity, others wear them as a form of protest, reflecting anxiety and disconnect from the current world. The return of heels is also linked to a broader trend of brash, moneyed glamour, with designers showcasing bold and extravagant styles. The article explores the complex politics of heels, which span gender, wealth, identity, and power, and their reappearance as a cultural phenomenon during times of political unrest.</p>

            <p>Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is backing a recall campaign to unseat opposition lawmakers, aiming to regain control of the legislature. The DPP seeks to reclaim a working majority by ousting at least six district-based KMT legislators, as the opposition currently holds a fragile but effective majority. The campaign is fueled by legislative gridlock, with the DPP accusing the opposition of paralyzing the constitutional court and threatening the island's security. However, analysts warn that the campaign risks deepening partisan divisions and political instability.</p>

            <p>Following President Trump's imposition of tariffs on British goods, questions are arising in Britain about the wisdom of aligning closely with the US. The article argues that Trump's actions, coupled with the economic consequences of Brexit, necessitate a closer relationship with the EU. It suggests that the UK government should reconsider its red lines regarding rejoining the customs union and single market. Nobel laureate Paul Krugman's analysis indicates that EU tariffs on US goods are minimal compared to the new US tariffs, further highlighting the need for Britain to reassess its trade strategy.</p>

            <p>A study suggests the United States has a unique opportunity to become a key partner for Indonesia in emerging technology and digital infrastructure, despite Jakarta's close ties with China. The Centre for a New American Security report argues that Indonesia is a key front in the US-China rivalry to shape digital infrastructure and ecosystems. The report emphasizes that Indonesia's policy of strategic autonomy is increasingly conflicting with its deepening ties with China, especially in sensitive technologies. China has been actively cultivating Indonesia, becoming its largest foreign investor and positioning itself as the preferred tech partner.</p>
