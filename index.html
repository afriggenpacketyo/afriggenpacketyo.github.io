          <p>In a brutal incident near Burundi's economic capital, six individuals accused of witchcraft were killed by a youth militia associated with the ruling party. Two of the victims were burned alive, while others were beaten or stoned to death. The violence was reportedly triggered by accusations from the Imbonerakure, a group described as a militia by the UN. A local official condemned the killings as "unspeakable barbarity," and authorities have since arrested twelve suspects in connection with the mob justice. This event highlights the persistent and dangerous role of witchcraft beliefs in the region, where unexplained deaths are often blamed on sorcery.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals struggling with significant credit card debt amid high interest rates, debt settlement may be a viable solution. The article outlines seven key signs that this financial strategy could be appropriate, such as when minimum payments consume over 20% of take-home pay or when payments fail to reduce the principal balance. Other indicators include considering loans from retirement accounts, having maxed-out credit utilization across multiple cards, or accumulating debt due to unforeseen circumstances like job loss or medical bills. While debt settlement can negatively impact credit scores temporarily, it offers a potentially faster path to financial relief than traditional repayment plans. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid recent air traffic control (ATC) outages and a surge in summer travel, airlines are highlighting the extensive training pilots undergo to handle such disruptions. Pilots are trained from early in their careers to manage communication loss by switching to backup and emergency frequencies, using text-based messaging systems, and utilizing specific transponder codes to signal an issue. Modern aircraft are also equipped with onboard collision avoidance systems (TCAS) that autonomously command evasive maneuvers if planes get too close. While ATC outages can cause significant delays by forcing controllers to limit traffic, officials and pilots assert that multiple layers of redundancy ensure passenger safety remains paramount.</p>

          <p>Following months of criticism, including from Donald Trump himself, the Colorado state Capitol has replaced a portrait of the former president that he claimed was a purposeful distortion. The original painting by a Colorado artist, which had been on display since 2019, was removed in April. A new, more traditional portrait donated by the White House and painted by an Arizona artist was installed last week. The advisory committee overseeing the Capitol's art displays approved the new painting as a temporary display, with Trump praising the new artwork on social media. The episode highlights the political tensions surrounding artistic representations of public figures.</p>

          <p>The United States and Vietnam have finalized a trade agreement that imposes a 20% tariff on many Vietnamese exports to the U.S., a rate lower than the 46% initially proposed by Donald Trump. The deal also includes a 40% tariff on goods trans-shipped through Vietnam from other countries to circumvent trade barriers. In return, the agreement reportedly grants U.S. exporters tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets, including for large-engine vehicles. This pact is one of several being negotiated by the Trump administration as it seeks to restructure global trade relationships, with this framework emerging just before a July 9 deadline for other potential tariff hikes.

The verdict followed a seven-week trial featuring graphic testimony from former girlfriends, including singer Cassie Ventura. Upon hearing the verdict, Combs and his family reacted with cheers and applause, while prosecutors stated they would seek a lengthy prison sentence for the convictions.

These alterations have drawn criticism from both moderate and conservative House Republicans.

Conversely, the research indicated that estrogen-only therapy, typically given to women who have had a hysterectomy, actually reduces the risk. This evolving science refines understanding from a controversial early 2000s study, suggesting that the type and timing of hormone replacement therapy are crucial factors. Healthcare professionals emphasize that while hormone therapy is effective for many menopausal symptoms, women should consult their doctors to weigh the personalized risks and benefits.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam that will impose a 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods imported into the U.S. and a 40% tariff on products transshipped through the country to avoid other duties. In exchange, the deal reportedly provides U.S. products with tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets. The announcement comes less than a week before a pause on many of Trump's proposed reciprocal tariffs is set to expire. This move will likely increase costs for U.S. importers and potentially consumers, highlighting the administration's ongoing protectionist trade strategy aimed at reshaping global economic relationships.

          <p>The major spending bill championed by President Donald Trump contains sweeping cuts to Medicaid that could leave millions of Americans without health insurance and jeopardize rural hospitals. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Senate-passed version of the bill would cut over $1 trillion from the program over the next decade, resulting in an estimated 11.8 million people losing coverage. A significant portion of these cuts stems from a new national work requirement for beneficiaries and restrictions on how states fund their Medicaid programs. Healthcare advocates warn these changes will disproportionately harm vulnerable populations and could force the closure of essential rural health facilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's sweeping spending bill would allocate approximately $170 billion to immigration and border operations, a move critics say will supercharge his administration's deportation campaign. The legislation, which has passed the Senate, includes $45 billion for new detention centers, enabling the daily detention of at least 116,000 people, and $46.6 billion for border wall construction. It also imposes new fees on asylum applications and other immigration services, creating what experts call a "wealth test" for vulnerable populations.

          <p>The U.S. is facing a degradation of its hurricane forecasting abilities just as the storm season intensifies, due to budget cuts and the loss of critical data. The Department of Defense is ceasing the distribution of imagery from a key satellite sensor, SSMIS, which provides high-resolution, 3D views of storms through clouds and is vital for detecting rapid intensification. This loss is compounded by staffing shortages at the National Weather Service, leading to fewer weather balloon launches, and proposed 2026 budget cuts that would eliminate entire research offices at NOAA. Scientists warn that these combined factors severely undermine the nation's ability to accurately predict and prepare for dangerous storms.</p>

          <p>Microsoft is cutting 9,000 jobs, representing just under 4% of its global workforce, in its latest effort to streamline operations. This move follows a previous round of over 6,000 layoffs in May and June aimed at reducing managerial layers within the organization. The company stated the organizational changes are necessary to position itself for success in a dynamic market. Despite being one of the world's most profitable companies with a market capitalization of $3.7 trillion, Microsoft is continuing to trim its staff as it encourages employees to leverage new technologies to enhance productivity and focus on more meaningful work.</p>

          <p>Shares of the trading app Robinhood surged to a new record high, surpassing the $100 mark and gaining over 30% since being passed over for inclusion in the S&P 500. The rally follows the company's ambitious announcement of a major crypto expansion in Europe, where it plans to offer thousands of tokenized stocks, ETFs, and private equities on its own blockchain. This strategic move aims to merge traditional financial services with crypto technology, allowing European users to gain exposure to top tech names like OpenAI and SpaceX through tokenized shares. The company's revenue has also shown strong year-over-year growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 11:46:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowner's insurance premiums are increasing in every U.S. state, with an average projected rise of 8% this year. The trend is driven by an increase in severe natural disasters, such as wildfires and floods, as well as rising home values and replacement costs. States like Louisiana and California are seeing projected increases of 28% and 21%, respectively, but even inland states like Iowa and Minnesota are facing double-digit hikes. Experts note that national insurance companies are balancing their risk portfolios, causing a ripple effect where disasters in one state can influence premium increases and policy non-renewals in others.

          <p>In his daily market analysis, Jim Cramer noted that a weaker-than-expected private payrolls report from ADP could strengthen the case for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in July. However, he cautioned investors to await the official government jobs report for a clearer picture of the economy. The discussion also highlighted the strong performance of Capital One, which was on track for its tenth consecutive winning session. Cramer expressed his belief that the bank's acquisition of Discover Financial positions it to become a major competitor to American Express, with significant potential for profit growth.
