          <p>Tens of thousands of demonstrators, led by students, rallied in Belgrade to demand early parliamentary elections. The protests, ongoing for months, were initially sparked by a deadly rail station collapse blamed on government negligence. Protesters have now issued an ultimatum to President Aleksandar Vucic, threatening a campaign of civil disobedience if snap elections are not called before the scheduled 2027 date. Vucic has rejected the demands, blaming foreign influence for the unrest, while authorities have arrested several individuals accused of plotting to overthrow the government, heightening political tensions across the nation.</p>

          <p>The much-anticipated mystery band at the Glastonbury Festival was revealed to be the iconic Britpop group Pulp, delighting a massive crowd. Frontman Jarvis Cocker led the band through a nostalgic set that included classics like "Sorted for E's & Wizz" and "Common People," marking the 30th anniversary of their historic 1995 headline performance. Despite attempts to keep their appearance a secret, the performance was widely rumored and served as a celebratory moment for fans.

          <p>Belfast rap group Kneecap performed a defiant and highly-charged set at Glastonbury, drawing a massive crowd that prompted organizers to fence off the field. The performance came after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called their appearance inappropriate, a response to a band member facing a terrorism charge, which he denies. On stage, the group addressed the legal case, criticized UK arms sales to Israel, and led chants for a free Palestine, thanking Glastonbury organizers for resisting pressure to cancel their show. Their set mixed hedonistic electro-rap with pointed political commentary, reflecting a tense intersection of music and activism.</p>

          <p>Nasser Medical Complex, one of the last major functioning hospitals in southern Gaza, is on the verge of collapse due to intense nearby fighting and a severe lack of medical supplies. Doctors report treating not only war injuries but also chronic malnutrition, which complicates healing and increases infection risks, with children being particularly vulnerable. Despite a recent aid delivery from the WHO, officials call it a "drop in the ocean" as the region's health system has been decimated, with most facilities non-operational. Staff at Nasser are holding on by a thread, warning its failure would leave the entire southern region without hospital care.</p>

          <p>International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi stated that recent military strikes have caused "very serious" damage to Iran's key nuclear facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. In an interview, Grossi expressed significant concern over the unknown whereabouts of Iran's highly enriched uranium, which he presumes was moved as a protective measure before the attacks. He stressed the urgent need for diplomacy and for IAEA inspectors to regain access to verify the remaining material and activities. Grossi emphasized that a military campaign cannot definitively solve the issue and that a verifiable, diplomatic agreement is the only long-lasting solution.</p>

          <p>Indian billionaire Sunjay Kapur, 53, died suddenly in England after reportedly swallowing a bee during a polo match, which may have triggered a fatal heart attack. While the exact cause is unconfirmed by official sources, medical experts note that such an event is possible, though exceedingly rare. A sting in the throat can cause anaphylaxis, leading to a cardiac event known as Kounis syndrome, even in individuals without pre-existing heart conditions. Cardiologists emphasized that this is not a common risk for the general public and fatal reactions typically occur in those with known venom hypersensitivity or underlying cardiac issues.</p>

          <p>Recent reports indicate a rise in ICE arrests and deportations involving U.S. military veterans and their relatives under the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement. One notable case involves Jermaine Thomas, the son of a deceased veteran, who was deported to Jamaica despite having never lived there and holding no citizenship. Other cases include the arrests of a Marine veteran's undocumented father and another Marine's wife. This trend aligns with a push for increased daily arrests by ICE, which has seen a significant increase in the detention of individuals with no criminal record, sparking criticism and feelings of betrayal among service members' families.</p>

          <p>Recent anti-government protests in Kenya, which left 19 dead and hundreds injured, have intensified concerns over press freedom and human rights in the country. The government attempted to ban live media coverage of the demonstrations, an order that was quickly revoked by judges but seen as a politically motivated move to suppress dissent. Journalists and activists report being targeted by security forces, who allegedly used live ammunition on protesters. The unrest, largely driven by dissatisfied youth from "Generation Z," reflects deep-seated frustration with the economic situation and a government that is increasingly viewed as intolerant of criticism.</p>

          <p>Republican leaders are leveraging the primary victory of Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race as a key line of attack.

In response, some Democrats have defended Mamdani and condemned what they describe as racist and Islamophobic attacks against him, highlighting a contentious new flashpoint in the national political discourse.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report suggests that Yelp's introduction of a "Black-owned" business tag, intended to support these establishments, has coincided with a decline in their average ratings in the Detroit area. Researchers found that reviews mentioning Black ownership tended to have lower star ratings compared to those that did not. The study posits that the increased visibility may have led to more "cross-cultural" interactions with Yelp's predominantly white user base, resulting in reviews citing issues like slow or rude service. This highlights how well-intentioned digital interventions can have unintended negative consequences within complex social and economic dynamics.</p>

          <p>Indian opener Smriti Mandhana scored a brilliant maiden T20 international century, leading her team to a commanding 97-run victory over England at Trent Bridge. Mandhana's explosive 112 from 62 balls propelled India to a formidable total of 210-5, the second-highest score England has ever conceded in the format. England's chase faltered early, and they were ultimately bowled out for 113, with captain Nat Sciver-Brunt's 66 being the only significant resistance. The comprehensive defeat serves as a stark reality check for England at the start of the five-match series against a powerful Indian side.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying a government ban in what organizers called the largest such event in Hungary's history. The march served as a powerful rebuke to Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n's government, which passed a law in March outlawing events that "promote" homosexuality to minors. The ban is part of a broader crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights and democratic freedoms under OrbÃ¡n's rule. The massive turnout, supported by the city's mayor and international officials, symbolized a growing resistance against the government's increasingly repressive policies ahead of next year's elections.</p>

          <p>Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, now Red Bull's head of global soccer, has harshly criticized the newly expanded 32-team FIFA Club World Cup, calling it "the worst idea ever implemented in football." Klopp voiced "serious fears" about player welfare, arguing that the congested fixture calendar leaves elite players with no time for physical or mental recovery. He warned that the relentless schedule could lead to unprecedented injuries and ultimately devalue the sport by preventing players from delivering top performances. His comments add to a growing chorus of criticism from players and unions about the increasing demands of the global football calendar.</p>

          <p>Thousands of nationalist protesters gathered in Bangkok to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra over her handling of an escalating border dispute with Cambodia. The dissatisfaction stems from a leaked phone call in which the prime minister was accused of being overly deferential to Cambodia's former leader, Hun Sen, following a deadly border skirmish near the historic Preah Vihear temple. Protesters chanted for her to step down, accusing her of mishandling a sensitive national sovereignty issue.

The DA has threatened to block departmental budgets, escalating the public feud between the two ideologically opposed coalition partners.

          <p>An automotive market analysis highlights several vehicle models whose trade-in values are so low that owners may be better off selling privately or not selling at all. Cars like the Jaguar I-PACE, Maserati Levante, and Nissan Leaf suffer from severe depreciation, losing up to 74% of their value in five years. Factors contributing to the low values include rapid EV technology advancements, high maintenance costs, oversupply, and poor brand reliability. For these models, dealer offers are often shockingly low, making alternative options like private sales or tax-deductible donations potentially more financially sensible for owners.
