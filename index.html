          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made an unannounced trip to the southern border amidst scrutiny in Washington. This comes after reports that Hegseth accused top-ranking military officers of leaking information to the news media and threatened to polygraph them. Additionally, it was reported that Hegseth used an unsecured commercial line for the Signal app on a personal computer in his office. A Pentagon spokesman has dismissed these reports as "fake news," adding to the controversy surrounding the Secretary of Defense.</p>

          <p>China is considering lifting sanctions on Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in what observers view as a charm offensive to improve relations with the EU amidst global trade uncertainty. The sanctions, imposed in 2021 after the EU sanctioned Chinese officials over human rights abuses in Xinjiang, have strained EU-China relations. While lifting sanctions could ease travel for MEPs and signal a change in political tone, it is unlikely to revive a frozen EU-China investment deal, as the EU maintains its Xinjiang sanctions due to ongoing human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>A recent New York Times/Siena College poll reveals that voters believe President Trump is exceeding his authority in expanding executive power. The poll also indicates deep doubts about key aspects of his agenda, with voters describing the early months of his administration as "chaotic" and "scary." Trump's approval rating sits at 42 percent, reflecting historically low confidence in his handling of critical issues like the economy and immigration, despite his previous strength in these areas.</p>

          <p>Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, is suing President Trump over sweeping tariffs, arguing they will devastate his toy business and the U.S. economy. Woldenberg states the company's import duties are set to increase dramatically, while sales are expected to drop significantly due to the tariffs' economic impact. The lawsuit alleges Trump overstepped his authority in imposing the duties, traditionally a power held by Congress. Woldenberg is struggling to shift manufacturing out of China, where 60% of his products are produced, facing tariffs of 145%.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a $5,000 "baby bonus" to address the declining U.S. birth rate, which has implications for the nation's long-term economic outlook. A declining birth rate can lead to a shrinking labor force and financial strain on supporting an aging population. Other countries have tried similar incentives with limited success, and some experts suggest addressing long-standing economic issues like affordable day care and paid parental leave could be more effective.

          <p>Luigi Mangione's case, where Attorney General Pam Bondi directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty, marks a shift in the politics of capital punishment in the U.S. Bondi's decision, prior to Mangione's indictment, is seen as unusual and potentially politically motivated, tying the case to President Trump's agenda to combat violent crime. The case highlights the fluctuating approaches to the federal death penalty over the past half-century, influenced by the political leanings of the Supreme Court, Congress, and the presidency.</p>

          <p>Federal judges are reportedly worried that President Trump could direct the U.S. Marshals Service to withdraw protection from them.

          <p>India and Pakistan exchanged fire along their heavily patrolled border in Kashmir, escalating tensions following a terror attack that killed 26 people on the Indian side of the region. While the exchange was brief and reportedly resulted in no casualties, it further strains relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. India has taken punitive measures against Pakistan, citing "cross-border linkages" to the terror attack.</p>
