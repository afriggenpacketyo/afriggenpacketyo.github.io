          <p>Constitutional lawyer Enrique Anaya, a vocal critic of El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, has been arrested on charges of money laundering, sparking concerns among human rights organizations that the move is intended to silence dissent. Anaya, who has previously described Bukele as a dictator, was arrested at his home in Santa Tecla. This arrest follows the detention of another lawyer, Ruth Lopez, who is accused of embezzling state funds. Bukele has accused his critics of leftist political activism, warning that corrupt opposition members are not untouchable. </p>

          <p>Following violent clashes between protesters and authorities over immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, hundreds of California National Guard troops have arrived in the city. President Donald Trump authorized the deployment of 2,000 National Guardsmen to address what he described as lawlessness stemming from the protests. However, California Governor Gavin Newsom stated that only about 300 troops are on the ground, asserting that local authorities do not need federal assistance. The protests erupted after ICE agents rounded up over 40 people allegedly violating immigration laws, leading to demonstrations and clashes with law enforcement. </p>

          <p>Ezra Klein, in a New York Times opinion piece, discusses the contrasting reactions to his book "Abundance," which he co-authored with Derek Thompson. The book has sparked debate within the Democratic Party, with some viewing it as a potential savior and others as a threat to anti-corporate populist ideals. Klein argues that the book focuses on addressing societal needs and removing obstacles to progress, a perspective that has drawn criticism from those prioritizing the issue of concentrated power. The debate highlights the ongoing reimagining of the Democratic Party after its 2024 election loss and the struggle to incorporate diverse critiques into its renewal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests has drawn criticism and raised concerns about states' rights. Despite the LAPD reporting that the protests were largely peaceful, the Trump administration cited targeting and injuries of immigration agents as justification for federal intervention. Over California Governor Gavin Newsom's objections, Trump federalized 2,000 National Guard soldiers, with the potential for active duty Marines to also be deployed. This move has been interpreted by some as an overreach of executive power and a politically motivated action targeting a Democratic city in a Democratic state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most frequent sources of conflict in relationships, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. A sour tone or contemptuous attitude is a major predictor of divorce, while arguments about family often stem from feeling unsupported. Uneven distribution of household labor, including the 'invisible load,' can also lead to disputes. Ineffective communication, marked by defensiveness or stonewalling, exacerbates conflicts, but strategies like the 'five second rule' can help de-escalate tensions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests marks a significant shift in the use of executive power. Unlike his more restrained approach during racial justice protests in his first term, Trump quickly federalized the California National Guard, despite local officials stating they did not need federal assistance. This action has been criticized by Democratic officials as an infringement on states' rights and a political ploy to make a spectacle of Los Angeles. The administration's actions raise concerns about the proportionality of its response and its willingness to defer to local law enforcement authorities.</p>

          <p>President Trump deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles amid protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, a move critics view as an authoritarian flex. This action is seen as a way for Trump to redirect anger and fear towards an "enemy within," diverting attention from policy failures and his feud with Elon Musk. Experts note the deployment is the first time in 60 years a president has activated a state's national guard without a request from its governor. The decision is criticized for potentially escalating tensions and infringing on states' rights.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing unrest as activists plan a "mass mobilization" in response to recent ICE operations. President Trump has deployed National Guard troops to the area following clashes between authorities and demonstrators. Protests initially erupted after ICE officers executed search warrants at multiple locations, including a clothing warehouse in the Fashion District. Advocates for immigrants' rights have reported detentions outside Home Depot and Dale's Donuts stores. The Department of Homeland Security stated that the ICE operations resulted in the arrests of 118 immigrants this week.</p>

          <p>Despite Germany's 2-0 defeat to France in the Nations League third-placed playoff, goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen was a standout performer, making several crucial saves.

          <p>Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle urged police to "do their bit" to "embrace change" amid funding negotiations. Kyle stated that every sector is facing pressure and that the government has already provided additional funding to the police. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp expressed concern about potential police cuts and urged the government to protect their budget. The discussion comes as the Chancellor prepares to outline departmental spending for the next three to four years.</p>
