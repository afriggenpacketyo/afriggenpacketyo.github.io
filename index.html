        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The energy regulator Ofgem announced that energy bills in England, Scotland, and Wales will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year. This translates to a Â£129 reduction for a typical household's annual bill, bringing it down to Â£1,720. While charities welcome the decrease, they emphasize that many households still struggle with energy costs, collectively owing suppliers around Â£4 billion. The price cap does not apply to Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A man in Norway woke up to find a large container ship had run aground and crashed into his front garden. The 135-meter Cypriot-flagged cargo ship, the NCL Salten, missed Johan Helberg's house by only a few meters. The ship, carrying 16 people, went off course while traveling through the Trondheim Fjord. No injuries were reported, and Norwegian police are investigating the cause of the incident. The head of NCL said it was a "serious incident" and they are awaiting the conclusion of the investigation by the relevant authorities.</p>

          <p>Pop Mart has temporarily stopped selling Labubu dolls in its 16 UK stores until June due to customer fights over the popular toys. The soft toys gained popularity on TikTok after being worn by celebrities. Fans expressed anger online, blaming Pop Mart for limited stock and resellers for inflating prices. The company is working on a fairer system for when the toys return to shelves, with some retail experts warning the stock stop will only heighten demand. The scarcity of the dolls has created a fan frenzy, with prices ranging from Â£13.50 to Â£50, and rare editions selling for hundreds of pounds on resale sites.</p>

          <p>Massive floods in eastern Australia, caused by incessant rain, have resulted in four deaths and widespread devastation, with one person still missing. Parts of New South Wales have been particularly affected, receiving more than six months' worth of rain in three days.

Approximately 50,000 people remain isolated as waters begin to recede, and workers are deployed for rescue, recovery, and cleanup operations.

          <p>Questions are being raised about why President Joe Biden was not tested for prostate cancer for over a decade, leading to a late and aggressive diagnosis. Aides claim doctors stopped PSA testing in 2014 following US regulations for men over 70, but some experts argue that presidents receive more rigorous medical care. New, more accurate tests are available, and treatments are less invasive than before. Biden's history of covering up health problems has led to media scrutiny, with some Democrats blaming his lack of transparency for previous political losses.</p>

          <p>Liverpool head coach Arne Slot emphasized that excuses are for teams that don't win the league, expressing his pride in leading the club to its 20th top-flight title in his first year. He highlighted the team's ability to secure the title without significant squad strengthening, making it even more special. Slot drew comparisons to his time at Feyenoord, where he won the Eredivisie in 2023 despite a team overhaul. His comments come after other managers cited injuries and other factors as impacting their title bids.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the rise of the "DEI hire" taunt, which is a modern iteration of the age-old grievance that someone has a job that could have been yours. It creates a climate where prejudice can be said with confidence, feeding the nagging voice of doubt inside confident people. The author argues that Britain is not America yet, but only if we make the effort to keep it that way. Social media has turned snarky whispers into a public barrage of abuse, chipping away at confidence.</p>

          <p>President Trump's meeting with South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa was marked by racist claims and misinformation, overshadowing serious bilateral issues. Trump focused on a false narrative of white South Africans facing genocide, using misleading video footage. This damaged potential discussions on trade and South Africa's genocide case against Israel. While Ramaphosa sought to address economic issues, Trump's theatrics served to appease his base, undermining America's role as a reliable partner. The incident underscores Trump's preference for spectacle over diplomacy, potentially weakening U.S. influence on the global stage.</p>
