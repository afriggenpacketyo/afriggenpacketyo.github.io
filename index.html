          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) claims $160 billion in savings, but an analysis suggests its actions may cost taxpayers $135 billion this fiscal year. The Partnership for Public Service estimates costs related to employee leave, re-hiring, and lost productivity. The IRS's planned workforce cuts could lead to significant revenue loss, but DOGE maintains that its cuts will result in long-term savings. Musk plans to reduce his DOGE involvement, citing impacts on Tesla. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The CBS newsmagazine "60 Minutes" faces an unprecedented crisis following the departure of its executive producer, Bill Owens, who cited corporate interference. This interference stems from Paramount Global's merger with Skydance Media, which requires regulatory clearance from the Trump administration, along with Trump's lawsuit against CBS over a 2024 interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Concerns arise that the company might settle the lawsuit by placating Trump, potentially undermining the program's journalistic integrity. The program's future hinges on whether it can maintain its independence amidst corporate pressure.</p>

          <p>An interview with Sophie Gilbert explores how pornography has molded American culture, influencing perceptions of power, relationships, and societal norms. Gilbert argues that the mainstreaming of certain types of porn has normalized cruelty and dehumanization, particularly towards women. She discusses the rise of social media sex-worker stars and the problematic use of "empowerment" to sell products that exploit women. Gilbert suggests that stories asserting people's humanity and complexity can serve as an antidote to a porn-addled culture.</p>
