          <p>Oracle's stock value increased by 3% following the confirmation of a significant cloud infrastructure deal with Meta, the parent company of Facebook. The agreement is part of a larger trend of tech giants investing heavily in AI infrastructure, with Oracle securing $65 billion in new cloud commitments in just 30 days from four customers. This deal underscores Oracle's growing competitiveness against rivals like Amazon and Google in the cloud computing sector. The company also projected substantial future revenue growth, forecasting $225 billion in revenue by fiscal year 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block a new rule imposing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visas. The Chamber argues the fee is unlawful and will make it prohibitively expensive for businesses, especially startups and smaller companies, to hire skilled foreign workers. The H-1B program is crucial for the technology sector, which relies on talent from countries like India and China to fill specialized roles. This legal challenge opposes the administration's broader push to limit immigration and compel companies to prioritize domestic hiring.</p>

        </div>

          <p>A new report from the U.S. PIRG Education Fund reveals that Americans are receiving approximately 2.5 billion robocalls per month, the highest volume in six years. The surge is attributed to the increased use of AI by scammers and insufficient adoption of anti-robocall technology by phone companies. Scams have grown more sophisticated, often impersonating government agencies or banks to steal personal information. Despite congressional action, less than half of phone companies have fully implemented mandated robocall-fighting software, leaving consumers vulnerable to financial loss and constant nuisance.</p>

          <p>Indianapolis Colts linebacker Zaire Franklin publicly supported Detroit Lions safety Brian Branch, who was suspended for one game following a post-game fight with Chiefs receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster. Franklin stated that Smith-Schuster deserved the confrontation, criticizing his on-field behavior as sneaky and disingenuous. In contrast, Lions head coach Dan Campbell condemned Branch's actions as "inexcusable" and apologized to the Chiefs. Branch himself called his actions "childish" but expressed frustration with what he perceived as unpenalized provocations during the game, highlighting conflicting views on sportsmanship within the league.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S. regional banks and investment firm Jefferies experienced a significant drop following disclosures of problematic loans, intensifying investor anxiety. Zions Bancorporation reported a substantial charge-off, and Western Alliance alleged fraud by a borrower, fueling fears about lending practices. These incidents, coupled with recent bankruptcies in the auto-parts sector, have heightened concerns about potential systemic risks within the opaque private credit market. The sell-off reflects a "sell first, ask questions later" mentality among investors concerned about the financial sector's stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States military flew three B-52 long-range bombers near the coast of Venezuela as part of the Trump administration's ongoing pressure campaign against President Nicolás Maduro's government. The mission is the latest in a series of heightened military activities in the Caribbean, which includes the deployment of warships and thousands of U.S. forces. Tensions have escalated as the U.S. accuses Maduro of narco-terrorism, recently authorizing covert CIA operations and considering strikes on drug traffickers. This show of force aims to deter illicit activities and further isolate the Maduro regime.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has accused the United States of deliberately causing panic by distorting Beijing's new controls on rare earth mineral exports. Despite the sharp rhetoric, a spokesperson indicated that China remains open to trade talks to resolve the dispute, which threatens to escalate trade tensions. The U.S., heavily dependent on China for these critical minerals, has condemned the export controls as an attempt to dominate global technology supply chains. In response, the Trump administration is actively working to establish a domestic rare earth supply chain independent of Beijing.</p>

The decision reflects heightened tensions surrounding the conflict in Gaza and aims to prevent potential protests or violence.

          <p>The Department of Justice has charged two real estate executives in separate cases with misappropriating millions of dollars from California's Homekey initiative, a program designed to combat homelessness. One executive is accused of using fake bank statements and a double-escrow scheme to fraudulently sell a property to a nonprofit for more than double its recent purchase price. In the second case, the CFO of an affordable housing developer allegedly embezzled grant funds for luxury personal expenses.

          <p>An analysis by S&P Global predicts that President Trump's tariffs will impose costs of over $1.2 trillion on global businesses in 2025. The report suggests this figure is a conservative estimate and concludes that consumers will ultimately bear the majority of the burden, absorbing about two-thirds of the total cost. The analysis contradicts administration claims that foreign exporters would primarily pay for the levies. These costs stem from direct tariffs, trade barriers, and compounded logistical delays, representing a significant transfer of wealth from corporate profits to governments and other sectors.
