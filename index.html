          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already convicted of murdering her two children, is on trial in Arizona for conspiring to kill her fourth husband. Daybell maintains her brother acted in self-defense when he shot Charles Vallow in 2019, while prosecutors argue it was a plot to obtain his $1 million life insurance policy and be with Chad Daybell. The prosecution presented evidence of Daybell's "twisted religious beliefs" and text messages suggesting premeditation. Daybell, representing herself, claims the shooting was a "tragic family event" and that the investigation was flawed. The jury is currently deliberating the verdict.</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized tariff levels on solar cells and panels imported from Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. This decision concludes a year-long trade case initiated by American manufacturers who allege that their Southeast Asian counterparts are unfairly undercutting the market with artificially low-priced goods. The Commerce Department has calculated dumping duties ranging from 6.1% to 271.28% and anti-subsidy countervailing duties between 14.64% and 3,403.96%, depending on the company and country. The case was brought by companies seeking to protect their investments in U.S. solar manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Dropshipping businesses that rely on trade between China and the U.S. are facing pressure due to President Trump's tariffs. The current 145% cumulative tariff on Chinese goods is impacting profit margins and causing delays at the border. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, which allowed shipments valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. duty-free, is also negatively affecting these businesses. Some dropshippers are shifting their focus to the European market to mitigate the impact. (not investment advice)</p>
