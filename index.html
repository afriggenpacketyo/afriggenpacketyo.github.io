          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is suing the Trump administration, adding to the ongoing tensions surrounding immigration raids in Los Angeles. Border czar Tom Homan denied claims that he intended to arrest Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Newsom, clarifying that his earlier comments were taken out of context. Homan stated that while peaceful protest is protected, actions such as assaulting ICE officers or destroying property would not be tolerated. President Trump echoed this sentiment, warning that California officials obstructing law and order would face charges, highlighting the administration's stance on immigration enforcement.</p>

This policy change led to significant criticism and complaints from Labour MPs and the public. The government has since reversed course in three stages, expanding eligibility for the payment. Some suggest the initial decision reflected genuine concerns about the state of public finances, while others believe the issue could have been handled more effectively from the outset.</p>

          <p>A charity ship rescued 54 migrants from an abandoned oil platform in the Mediterranean, where they had been stranded for three days after their boat shipwrecked, and where one woman gave birth. The migrants, who departed from Libya, were rescued by the Astral, operated by Open Arms, which later encountered another 109 migrants, including children. The second group was provided with life jackets before being rescued by the Louise Michel, another charity ship. The Italian island of Lampedusa has been a frequent destination for migrants crossing the Mediterranean, though tragedies have occurred.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented policies that depict transgender individuals negatively, portraying them as deluded or dishonest. These actions go beyond campaign rhetoric, with executive orders and statements that impact trans people's rights and status. Laura Loomer, a Trump confidante, has called for the firing of transgender government employees, reflecting a broader animosity towards gender nonconformity. While Trump's initial campaign showed some tolerance, his administration has normalized gratuitous rudeness toward transgender Americans, creating a polarized environment rather than seeking compromise.</p>
