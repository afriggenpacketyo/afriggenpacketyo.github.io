          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced declines on Tuesday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index leading losses. Investors reacted to President Donald Trump's escalating rhetoric regarding tariffs, including a potential 200% levy on China for rare-earth magnets and threats against countries with digital taxes. The market also assessed the implications of Trump's decision to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, adding to economic uncertainty and impacting investor confidence across the region.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK food price inflation has surged to an 18-month high of 4.2% in August, primarily due to significant increases in the cost of chocolate, butter, and eggs. This rise is attributed to high demand, tightening supply, increased labor costs, and poor cocoa harvests impacted by climate change and crop disease. Retail experts warn that households may need to reassess budgets as rising food prices contribute to overall inflation. The article emphasizes the direct impact on consumers and businesses like chocolateries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysts are urging China to adopt a pragmatic approach as South Korea and Japan strengthen their cooperation, a move seen as addressing the "China challenge." South Korean President Lee Jae-Myung's foreign policy prioritizes shared international challenges, making Japan his first foreign visit since 1965. From Beijing's perspective, there is little reason for high expectations from the Lee administration, suggesting a need for a realistic view of Seoul's new diplomatic direction.

          <p>Australia has expelled Iran's ambassador and three other officials, giving them seven days to leave, following allegations that the Iranian government directed antisemitic attacks in Sydney and Melbourne. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated that intelligence services linked Iran to an arson attack on a Sydney cafe and a Melbourne synagogue, describing these as "dangerous acts of aggression." Australia has also withdrawn its own diplomats from Tehran and plans to designate Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. Iran has "absolutely rejected" the allegations, calling the decision domestically driven.</p>

          <p>UK Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips has admitted that the main domestic abuse screening tool, the Dash questionnaire, "doesn't work" effectively to identify victims at the highest risk of further harm. Used by police, social services, and healthcare workers since 2009, studies show it often misclassifies high-risk cases as standard or medium. Phillips is reviewing the entire victim support system, acknowledging that the tool's limitations have led to preventable tragedies.

          <p>California Republicans have filed an emergency petition with the state Supreme Court to block a November special election on Governor Gavin Newsom's redistricting plan. The measure, Proposition 50, aims to redraw congressional maps to favor Democrats, which opponents argue violates the state constitution and undermines the independent redistricting commission. Republicans contend the plan bypasses public review, challenges mid-decade map redrawing, and violates the single-subject rule for ballot questions.

          <p>Chinese scientists claim a significant breakthrough in "invisibility technology" for airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, making their radar signals exceptionally resistant to interception and geolocation. This innovation utilizes frequency diverse array (FDA) technology, which assigns minutely varied frequencies to each antenna, creating a chaotic signal that obscures its directional origin. Engineers describe this as a "paradigm shift" from traditional phased array radars.
