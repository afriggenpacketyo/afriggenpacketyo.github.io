          <p>Despite a recent large prisoner exchange, Russia has launched a significant barrage of drones and missiles across Ukraine, resulting in at least 12 deaths, including children, and numerous injuries. Ukrainian officials report that most regions were affected, with strikes hitting residential buildings and enterprises. Russia claims the attacks targeted Ukraine's military-industrial complex. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is urging allies to increase pressure on Moscow to engage in a ceasefire, stating that silence encourages further aggression. The scale of the attacks is notable, marking the fourth consecutive night of bombardments. The tone of the article is somber, reflecting the tragic loss of life and the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Venezuelans are participating in elections for lawmakers and governors, with the main opposition urging a boycott due to increased government repression and concerns about the legitimacy of the process. The vote is the first major electoral event since last year's presidential election, which was marred by allegations of fraud. Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado has called the elections a "parody" designed to legitimize President Maduro's rule. In the lead-up to the vote, dozens of people, including an opposition leader, were detained, accused of plotting to disrupt the election.</p>

          <p>Rachel Feintzeig reflects on her obsession with the HBO series "The Last of Us," a show about a zombie apocalypse caused by a fungus. She argues that engaging with such terrifying fictional scenarios provides a distraction from the real-world anxieties of 2025. Feintzeig finds that immersing herself in a fictional disaster allows her to momentarily escape from the pressures and worries of everyday life. She recounts how horror movies helped her cope with grief after a miscarriage, offering a perspective shift by focusing on someone else's misfortune.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This news analysis discusses how the Trump administration has normalized the monetization of the presidency to an unprecedented degree, surpassing previous administrations in both scale and scope. The Trump family has reportedly collected hundreds of millions in fees from various ventures, including cryptocurrency, real estate deals, and exclusive club memberships. Critics argue that these activities represent a blatant use of government office for personal gain, eroding ethical boundaries and dismantling accountability measures. While concerns have been raised, the lack of official investigations and the normalization of such practices have limited public outrage.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder sparked a massive social movement, the Black Lives Matter movement is facing a significant backlash, with a shift towards policies that champion white grievance. The Justice Department has reduced oversight of police forces accused of racial bias, and President Trump has implemented policies targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. While some progress has been made in police reform, the overall trend indicates a retrenchment of old power structures. Some activists express concern that these setbacks could erase the gains made in recent years.</p>

          <p>This commentary reflects on the impact of the "Defund the Police" movement since George Floyd's murder, arguing that it was not a failure despite some setbacks. It highlights the shift in public opinion, increased investments in community safety, and the introduction of radical budget and policy proposals. The authors emphasize that the movement sparked global protests and forced the conversation about community safety into the mainstream. They argue that while fascism is tightening its grip, the movement's power is evident in the efforts to erase its wins and history, urging continued unity and resistance.</p>

After a stint with a drone unit, Russian officials return to work, and promotions, garlanded as war veterans. Analysts describe the unit as a "sinecure for officials" and a "V.I.P. unit," as officials assigned to the unit usually stay for a short period and get photo ops with automatic rifles before returning to their jobs in Russia with a heroâ€™s welcome. One official was spotted by Putin and offered a job after his service, and another is running for Parliament this month.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has committed to improving the treatment and working conditions of Self-Defense Forces (SDF) personnel, acknowledging the increasingly challenging security environment. The pledge follows the enactment of a revised law that includes enhanced allowances for SDF members, addressing a shortage of recruits. This effort to boost morale comes amid recent scandals that have damaged public trust in the SDF, even as the government seeks to strengthen the nation's defense capabilities. Ishiba emphasized the government's commitment to safeguarding Japan's independence and peace in the face of regional challenges.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under the Labour government, with the first nationalized service departing on time. The government calls the move a "new dawn for rail" and focuses on improving services and investing in infrastructure, although it refrains from promising lower fares. The trains are now the responsibility of the Department for Transport Operator and will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR). Unions have expressed concerns about outsourcing staffing, while the opposition Conservatives urge Labour to deliver on its promises.</p>

          <p>Europe's electric vehicle (EV) sector is facing a dilemma as it considers the potential benefits and risks of Chinese investment. French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed Chinese entrepreneur Wen Han's plan to build an EV factory in France, but the European Union is currently engaged in a trade dispute with China over EVs. The debate centers on whether Chinese investment will create jobs and boost the industry or undermine local manufacturers. Han is confident that his company's investment will be a job creator and plans to expand operations to the United States.</p>
