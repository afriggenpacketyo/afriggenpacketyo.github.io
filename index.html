          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 09:36:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major financial institutions Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have partnered to launch tokenized money market funds, allowing institutional clients to invest in these assets via a blockchain platform. This innovation aims to bring the benefits of digital assets, such as faster settlement and 24/7 trading, to the $7.1 trillion money market industry. Unlike stablecoins, these tokenized funds offer a yield, making them an attractive option for cash management for entities like hedge funds and corporations. The move is seen as a foundational step toward a more efficient digital financial ecosystem where such assets could also be used as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A powerful 1975 photograph by Stanley Forman captured the tragic collapse of a fire escape in Boston, which resulted in the death of a 19-year-old woman. The haunting image, which earned a Pulitzer Prize, showed the woman and her 2-year-old goddaughter falling, with the child surviving by landing on the victim's body. The photo's widespread publication created a public outcry that directly led to significant changes in city regulations. Boston implemented a new code requiring all fire escapes to be certified as safe every five years, a measure that had a ripple effect on fire safety standards nationwide.</p>

          <h2>UK Supreme Court Overturns Convictions of Two Traders in Libor-Rigging Scandal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 09:30:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has quashed the convictions of former traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were jailed for manipulating the Libor and Euribor interest rate benchmarks. The court ruled that the directions given to the juries in their original trials were incorrect, making the convictions unsafe. The case centered on accusations that they conspired to influence rates for bank profit, a practice they argued was common and known to superiors. This ruling comes after a decade-long legal battle and follows a US court decision that found similar conduct was not a crime, raising questions about other convictions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has reopened the case of Choi Mal-ja, who was convicted of grievous bodily harm in 1964 for biting off her attacker's tongue during a sexual assault. At the time, the 19-year-old was given a suspended prison sentence while her attacker received a lighter penalty for lesser charges. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now 80, successfully petitioned for a retrial to clear her name after 61 years of living with a criminal record. The case is a landmark moment for women's rights in South Korea, with prosecutors now asking the court to acquit her.</p>

Zelenskyy defended the move, citing slow investigations and potential Russian influence within the agencies. However, critics, including protesters and EU officials, view it as a major setback for Ukraine's democracy and its aspirations for EU membership, fearing it undermines the fight against systemic corruption.</p>

Woodward, a former Lions coach, called the decision a sign of a losing mindset.

          <p>An analysis suggests that President Trump's public pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates could paradoxically have the opposite effect. While Trump desires lower borrowing costs, his threats to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell and force rate cuts are creating market uncertainty. This political interference could undermine the Fed's credibility, leading investors to demand higher returns on U.S. government bonds to compensate for increased inflation risk. Since long-term rates for mortgages and other loans are pegged to these bonds, any move that spooks investors could ultimately drive up borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.

This unique form of symbiosis challenges traditional understandings of evolution, which typically focus on random mutation rather than the wholesale transfer of genetic skills between species.

          <p>This opinion article argues that China is positioning itself as a global leader by dominating the clean energy sector, but must ensure its leadership benefits the world. China has become the largest producer of solar panels and electric vehicles, drastically driving down costs and underwriting a global green revolution. The author notes that this dominance in the renewable energy supply chain makes it difficult for other nations to compete. The piece concludes that for its leadership to be truly effective and globally accepted, China must align its industrial might with international cooperation and sustainable global governance.

          <p>The BBC has announced it will broadcast the new series of "MasterChef" that was filmed before its long-time presenters, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were dismissed following misconduct allegations. The decision was made after consulting with the contestants, with the BBC stating the focus should be on their culinary journey. An investigation upheld over 40 complaints against Wallace and substantiated a claim of racist language against Torode. While the new series will air, potentially with re-edits to reduce the presenters' prominence, the BBC has not yet decided on the fate of unaired celebrity specials.</p>

          <p>A debate has emerged among fans and pundits about whether England manager Sarina Wiegman should start substitutes Michelle Agyemang and Chloe Kelly in the Euro 2025 final. The pair have been instrumental as "finishers," scoring crucial late goals in both the quarter-final and semi-final matches to secure England's victories. Some argue for their inclusion from the start to bring fresh energy, especially after consecutive extra-time games. Others contend that Wiegman should stick with her proven formula, where the duo provides a game-changing impact from the bench, a strategy that has been highly successful.</p>

          <p>Ari Aster's latest film, "Eddington," is reviewed as a dark and surreal neo-Western that channels the anxieties of the early COVID-19 pandemic. The movie follows a small-town New Mexico sheriff, played by Joaquin Phoenix, whose paranoia and desire for control escalate into extreme violence. The article compares the protagonist to "Taxi Driver's" Travis Bickle, exploring how the film immerses the audience in the chaotic perspective of a man who sees himself as a vigilante hero. "Eddington" is described as a challenging and lacerating comedy that satirizes the conspiracy theories and political polarization that defined the lockdown era.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals that the federally-funded cleanup effort after Hurricane Helene in North Carolina created a secondary disaster in some areas. Contractors, paid by the volume of debris removed, allegedly cleared far more than necessary, destroying healthy forests and vital wildlife habitats. State biologists and environmental experts claim the Army Corps of Engineers, which oversaw the work, failed to coordinate with state agencies to protect endangered species like freshwater mussels and hellbender salamanders. The incentive structure for contractors is cited as the primary cause for the excessive and destructive clearing, which in some cases did more ecological harm than the storm itself.</p>

This defeat, combined with a previous loss in the lower house, has weakened his position, though a newly announced trade deal with the U.S. may offer some political relief. While Ishiba has denied reports that he plans to step down, his potential departure could trigger a leadership contest within the Liberal Democratic Party.

Obama's statement called the allegations "ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction," and an "outrageous" claim that merited a response despite a general policy of not dignifying White House misinformation.
