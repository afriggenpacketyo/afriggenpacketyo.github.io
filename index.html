            <p>Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland traveled to El Salvador to visit Kilmar Ábrego García, a constituent who was erroneously deported and incarcerated there. Van Hollen aims to assess Ábrego García’s condition and convey it to his family, emphasizing the constitutional crisis arising from the Trump administration's refusal to comply with court orders for his return. Despite requests, the Salvadoran government has not responded to Van Hollen's request to visit the prison, where human rights groups have raised concerns about abuses and squalid conditions. The senator hopes to discuss Ábrego García's situation and secure his release, highlighting that the administration admitted in court that he was erroneously abducted from the United States.</p>

            <p>Design software company Figma has confidentially filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, sixteen months after terminating its $20 billion acquisition deal with Adobe due to regulatory hurdles in the U.K. The company, which provides collaborative design tools for website and app prototypes, was valued at $12.5 billion in a 2024 tender offer. The IPO market has been largely dormant since late 2021, with several tech companies delaying or withdrawing their IPO plans due to market instability and regulatory concerns. Figma, founded in 2012, is backed by prominent investors and reported approximately $600 million in annual revenue as of early last year. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Authorities released an investigative report detailing the final days of Gene Hackman's wife, Betsy Arakawa, who died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Records showed Arakawa researched flu-like symptoms and breathing techniques before her death. Gene Hackman is believed to have died about a week later of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer's disease. The couple's bodies were found in their Santa Fe, New Mexico, home after maintenance workers alerted police, who found no signs of forced entry. An environmental assessment revealed rodent feces in outbuildings on the property, linking Arakawa's death to the rare rodent-borne disease.</p>

            <p>Former President Joe Biden delivered his first public remarks since leaving office, focusing on the importance of preserving Social Security. Biden criticized the current administration's policies, particularly tax cuts and staffing reductions at the Social Security Administration, without directly naming President Trump. He defended Social Security as a "sacred promise" and mocked claims of widespread fraud. Biden's appearance comes as Democrats seek to reorganize after recent election losses, while Trump continues to criticize his predecessor. Biden also assailed Elon Musk for calling Social Security a 'Ponzi scheme'.</p>

            <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Columbia University student and Palestinian activist, was detained by immigration agents during what he believed would be his citizenship interview. Mahdawi expressed fears that the interview was a "honey trap" prior to his detention. Authorities cited a law allowing deportation of foreign nationals posing "serious adverse foreign policy consequences" as justification. Mahdawi's activism includes co-founding Columbia's Palestinian Student Union and participating in protests against Israel's war in Gaza. A federal judge has temporarily blocked his deportation while the case is reviewed, with Mahdawi's legal team arguing he is being punished for protected speech.</p>

            <p>A study indicates that the use of disposable e-cigarettes or vapes in the UK is decreasing in anticipation of the government's ban on their sale, scheduled for June 1, 2025. Researchers believe vape users are transitioning to refillable and rechargeable vapes. The percentage of individuals aged 16-24 who primarily use disposable vapes has nearly halved in the past year, dropping from 63% to 35%. Overall vaping use among adults over 16 has plateaued after several years of growth. The ban aims to reduce littering and tackle rising rates of youth vaping.</p>

Despite the U.S. Chips and Science Act, companies encounter obstacles such as high costs, skilled labor shortages, and construction delays. Taiwan and other Asian regions possess a significant advantage in producing advanced chips at scale due to decades of experience and investment. Trump's immigration policies may further hinder the U.S. effort by limiting the influx of skilled talent.

            <p>Nvidia projects a $5.5 billion charge related to exporting H20 graphics processing units to China and other destinations, following U.S. government restrictions on chip exports. The restrictions aim to prevent the use of AI chips for military purposes. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged that revenue from China has decreased due to export controls. The company is now focusing on selling its current generation of AI chips, called Blackwell. Shares of Nvidia and other AI chipmakers declined following the disclosure, reflecting concerns about the impact of export restrictions on growth. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A study revealed that zoo animals, particularly primates, displayed altered behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic closures. Bonobos and gorillas spent less time alone when visitors returned, while chimpanzees ate more and engaged with their enclosures more frequently. Olive baboons showed reduced sexual and dominance behaviors when visitors were present. The study suggests that visitor interactions can have both positive and negative impacts on zoo animal welfare, highlighting the need for tailored environments that allow animals to adapt. Researchers plan to continue studying the effects of visitor numbers on animal behavior across various species.</p>

            <p>The Trump White House has altered the composition of the press pool, reducing guaranteed access for wire services such as the Associated Press (AP), Bloomberg, and Reuters. This change comes after a court order mandated the restoration of Oval Office access to the AP. The new press pool makeup expands access for other media outlets while diminishing the presence of wire services, which provide news to smaller newspapers, radio, and television stations. The administration claims the new policy is more reflective of modern media habits.</p>

            <p>President Trump has expressed interest in sending US citizens convicted of violent crimes to foreign prisons, but legal experts question the constitutionality of such a plan. They argue that it would violate numerous constitutional provisions and the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. Trump officials have not provided clear legal grounds for the proposal, and experts suggest that any effort to deport American citizens to foreign prisons would be unlawful. The debate arises amid ongoing legal battles concerning Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador.</p>

            <p>The White House is evaluating trade deals drafted by more than 15 countries, with potential announcements expected soon, according to press secretary Karoline Leavitt. This follows Vice President JD Vance's optimistic outlook for a "great agreement" with the UK, citing President Trump's affinity for the country. While Trump recently delayed imposing tariffs on the entire world, the trade war with China continues. The UK government hopes for an exemption from Trump's tariffs, and Vance believes the reciprocal relationship between the US and UK gives Britain a more advantageous position in trade negotiations.</p>

The U.S. appeals court ruled that Michel J Messier lacked standing to challenge the team’s trademark. Messier argued his family held intellectual property rights due to their alleged royal lineage. The court dismissed the appeal, stating that Messier failed to allege any commercial interest or damage from the Saints' use of the symbol.</p>

The suit argues the censorship is endangering children by preventing them from learning critical information. The legal action targets Hegseth and the head of the Pentagon school system, Beth Schiavino-Narvaez.</p>
