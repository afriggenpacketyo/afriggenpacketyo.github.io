          <p>This NPR article delves into the effects of President Trump's immigration policies in Los Angeles, where the White House believes their approach is being validated. While polls indicate increased trust in the Republican Party to handle immigration, the article highlights the human cost of these policies. California Governor Gavin Newsom pointed out incidents of U.S. citizens being arrested and families being separated during workplace raids. The article explores the administration's focus on criminals versus the broader impact on communities. The current political climate is discussed, weighing the perceived benefits against the impact on individuals and families affected by immigration enforcement. </p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant surge, rising by over 4%, due to escalating tensions between the United States and Iran. President Trump expressed diminished confidence in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran, contributing to market anxieties. The U.S. is reportedly preparing to evacuate non-essential personnel from its embassy in Baghdad, further signaling heightened concerns. Iran's defense minister issued a warning, stating that U.S. bases in the region are within reach of their military.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has named eight new members to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a crucial government panel advising the CDC, after dismissing the previous 17 members. Some of Kennedy's picks are known vaccine critics, including Dr. Robert Malone, raising concerns among public health experts. The ACIP reviews vaccine data and makes recommendations that determine vaccine eligibility and insurance coverage. Critics like Georgetown University's Lawrence Gostin have called this a "national tragedy," while others, such as Dr. Paul Offit, anticipate less informed recommendations from the new committee. The future impact on vaccine policy and availability in the U.S. remains uncertain. </p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ruled that social media companies can be held accountable for certain types of content posted by users on their platforms. This decision could lead to potential fines for companies that fail to remove illegal posts in Brazil. A slim majority of the court's judges supported the ruling, though they did not agree on specific types of content that would be deemed illegal. The ruling's implications for freedom of speech and content moderation policies in Brazil are yet to be fully determined. This development is likely to influence how social media platforms operate and regulate user-generated content in the country. </p>

          <p>A third night of violence has broken out in Northern Ireland, with a leisure centre in Larne being attacked by masked individuals. The unrest, which began after a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault in Ballymena, has resulted in injuries to 32 police officers and several arrests. The Larne Leisure Centre, which was providing emergency shelter for families displaced by the disturbances, sustained fire and smoke damage. Police have deployed water cannons and dogs in Ballymena, where smoke bombs and other projectiles were thrown at officers. The violence is being condemned by local officials, who describe it as racist and thuggery targeting ethnic minorities and police officers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the government cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons cited by the Trump administration. The ruling focuses on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that Khalil's presence would compromise U.S. foreign policy interests. Judge Farbiarz stated that detaining Khalil for this reason is likely unconstitutional and that his career and speech are being harmed. The ruling does not prevent the administration from pursuing deportation for other reasons, such as alleged omissions on his green card application. Critics argue that the Trump administration is punishing students for First Amendment-protected speech. </p>

Multiple incidents have been reported, including the detention of a fourth-grader and random street arrests, leading to accusations of indiscriminate targeting.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the Trump administration might extend the 90-day tariff pause beyond July 9 for trading partners engaged in "good faith" trade negotiations. Bessent mentioned the U.S. is working towards deals with its 18 top trading partners and is likely to extend the pause for those negotiating constructively. This contrasts with previous indications that an agreement's "terms" were needed before extending the pause. Bessent's remarks suggest a potential shift in the administration's approach, possibly showing more flexibility as the deadline approaches.

          <p>Consumers are experiencing relief as egg prices fell to $4.55 in May, an 11% decrease from $5.12 in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This drop is attributed to the receding effects of the avian flu outbreak and a seasonal decrease in egg demand during the summer. While prices have decreased for two consecutive months, they remain higher compared to the previous year. Experts note that the containment of avian flu has significantly contributed to the price reduction, although the outbreak is not entirely resolved. Despite the recent decline, egg prices are still substantially higher than they were 12 months prior. </p>

The administration argues Trump has no obligation to consult with or notify Newsom before federalizing the National Guard. Trump's lawyers stated that the relief requested by California would judicially countermand the Commander in Chief's military directives. The case centers on whether immigration protests constitute a "rebellion" under 10 U.S.C. § 12406, allowing Trump to deploy the National Guard. </p>

          <p>Khaby Lame, the popular TikTok star, has left the United States after being detained by immigration officials for allegedly overstaying his visa. Lame's departure is part of President Trump's immigration crackdown, which includes increased deportations and protests against ICE. He was detained in Las Vegas and subsequently released, voluntarily departing the country. A voluntary departure allows individuals facing removal to avoid a deportation order on their record. Lame, an Italian citizen, is known for his silent videos and has amassed a large following on TikTok. </p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the bodies of two hostages, Yair Yaakov and another whose name is withheld, were recovered from Gaza by the army and Shin Bet security agency. The bodies were found in the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza. Yair Yaakov, 59, was kidnapped and killed by militants from the Palestinian group Islamic Jihad. Netanyahu expressed condolences to the families and vowed to continue efforts to bring all hostages home. Israeli forces have now retrieved five hostage bodies this month, with 53 hostages still held by Hamas, at least 20 of whom are believed to be alive. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is initiating the process to repeal environmental regulations on coal and natural-gas power plants, aiming to stimulate the fossil fuel industry. This includes repealing rules regulating carbon emissions and tightening regulations on mercury and other toxins. The administration argues that U.S. power plants contribute a small part to global emissions and eliminating climate pollution would have little health impact. Environmental groups are expected to sue to block the rule changes, arguing they violate environmental laws. Scientists warn that human-driven climate change is worsening, and the Trump administration's actions could exacerbate the problem. </p>

          <p>The increasing number of deportations is raising concerns among Cuban-Americans in Miami, a key voting bloc for President Trump. While many Cuban-Americans supported Trump's policies, some are now uncomfortable with the administration's crackdown on immigrants without criminal records. The deportation of individuals to countries run by authoritarian regimes, such as Cuba and Venezuela, has sparked criticism. Some Cuban-American elected officials have begun expressing concerns about the administration's actions, particularly regarding deportations to countries with authoritarian regimes. Despite these concerns, some believe the immigration crackdown was overdue and that Trump is fulfilling his mandate to protect the borders. </p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's declaration that the trade war with China is "done," logistics and retail industry executives warn that the supply chain damage, impact on U.S. consumers, and broader economic consequences will persist. While Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated tariffs on Chinese goods would remain at 55% without further increases, the high tariff rate continues to pose challenges for businesses. Many companies lack the pricing power to absorb the tariffs or offset their impact, ultimately leading to higher costs for consumers. The uncertainty surrounding tariff policies is also weighing on EU exports to the U.S., as businesses adopt a "wait and see" strategy. The trucking industry, in particular, faces challenges due to lower freight volumes and decreased demand. (not investment advice)</p>

Environmental groups have criticized the proposal, arguing it is bad for public health and the climate.
