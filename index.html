          <p>A critical US atmospheric data collection program, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), is set to be discontinued, raising alarms among scientists. Researchers warn this move could set hurricane forecasting back by decades, as the DMSP satellites provide unique data for seeing inside developing storms and monitoring polar sea ice. The abrupt decision, announced by NOAA, has left forecasters with little time to prepare during what is expected to be an active hurricane season. Some scientists within the government attribute this action to broader cuts under the Trump administration, calling it a reckless move that jeopardizes public safety.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying legal threats from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government.

Attendees, including EU officials and MEPs showing solidarity, risked fines and potential prison sentences for organizers. Participants expressed their desire for a diverse and tolerant country, marching for fundamental rights and the freedom to love in the face of mounting pressure from the nationalist conservative government.</p>

          <p>Republican Congressman Don Bacon, a vocal critic of Donald Trump representing a swing district in Nebraska, has announced he will not seek re-election in 2026. Bacon, a retired Air Force brigadier general, has recently opposed several Trump administration policies and figures, reflecting the moderate leanings of his Omaha-based district. His decision has prompted optimism among Democrats, who see an opportunity to flip the seat as they aim to regain a House majority. Bacon's departure is viewed by some as a sign of the internal divisions and challenges facing the Republican party.</p>

Donald Trump labeled Mamdani a "Communist Lunatic," framing his rise as a new "red scare."

The article emphasizes that no house is perfect and that this framework helps buyers manage expectations and make informed decisions. It also introduces a complementary "L.O.V.E.

          <p>Panelists on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" have raised concerns about the potential politicization of national intelligence under Director Tulsi Gabbard. The discussion highlighted how Gabbard, initially part of the Trump administration's non-interventionist wing, has appeared to align intelligence statements with the president's political preferences following U.S. strikes on Iran. Experts on the panel warned that such a practice is dangerous and undermines the principle of objective intelligence analysis, which Gabbard had pledged to uphold.

          <p>Americans may see relief at the pump this summer, as petroleum analysts predict the lowest gas prices in years. Experts suggest the national average could fall below $3 per gallon by September, making it the most affordable summer for fuel since 2021. This downward trend is attributed to factors like the de-escalation of conflict in the Middle East, increased production from refineries, and a typical softening of consumer demand after early summer travel peaks. Despite a recent spike, the overall forecast points toward a sustained, slow decline in prices throughout the season. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A series of powerful Israeli military strikes against Iran and its proxies, including Hamas and Hezbollah, have significantly reasserted Israel's military dominance and reshaped the political landscape of the Middle East. This analysis argues that the conflicts, which began with the Hamas attack in October 2023, have decimated Iran's network of regional allies. However, while Israel has reduced immediate security threats, the underlying political disputes remain unresolved, particularly the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza also continues to tarnish Israel's international reputation, creating long-term diplomatic challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has put an end to the practice of federal courts issuing nationwide injunctions. The ruling came in *Trump v. Casa*, a case concerning an executive order on birthright citizenship. Writing for the majority, Justice Amy Coney Barrett argued that such broad injunctions, which halt a policy for everyone in the country, have no historical basis in judicial authority. This analysis explains that while the decision is a major shift in judicial practice, other legal tools like class actions and complete relief for plaintiffs may still allow for similarly wide-reaching outcomes.</p>
