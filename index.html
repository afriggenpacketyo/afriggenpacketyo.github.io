          <h2>Inflation Rate Moderates in April Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 08:53:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated a 2.3% annual increase in April, slightly below economists' expectations, yet still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Housing and energy costs significantly contributed to the rise, although gasoline prices experienced a drop. Experts are closely monitoring the impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, but the effects may not be immediately apparent due to exemptions and front-loading of purchases, creating uncertainty for the Federal Reserve and global investors. The central bank is taking a wait-and-see approach on Mr. Trump's tariffs, which he said could boost inflation and blunt economic growth.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with their plan to fund President Trump's agenda, which includes substantial Medicaid cuts and tax changes, despite facing internal opposition. The legislation proposes imposing work requirements for Medicaid recipients, more frequent eligibility checks, and defunding organizations that offer abortion services. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the health portions of the bill would save $715 billion, but at least 8.6 million more Americans will go uninsured. Republicans aim to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts and introduce measures like no tax on tips and overtime, while also increasing the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.</p>

          <p>Peter Sullivan, who served 38 years in prison for the 1986 murder of Diane Sindall, has had his conviction overturned by the Court of Appeal due to new DNA evidence.

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's trade policies with China reveals a pattern of bold claims followed by concessions without significant gains. Despite asserting that China needed the U.S. more, Trump's administration ultimately reduced tariffs on Chinese imports. This action reflects the mutually beneficial nature of trade and the potential economic consequences of high tariffs, including price increases and supply chain disruptions. While some tariffs remain, the reduction signals a recognition of the economic interdependence between the two nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration has temporarily reduced tariffs on Chinese goods, signaling a potential shift in his trade war strategy. Despite initial claims that China needed the U.S. more, the move suggests that America also relies on international trade. The tariff reduction, from 145% to 30%, aims to alleviate price hikes and supply shortages that threatened the U.S. economy. However, a 10% tariff remains in place against nearly all of Americaâ€™s trading partners, and the long-term impact of these policies remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Simone Harouche, Kim Kardashian's stylist, testified in a Paris court about the night of the 2016 robbery, describing Kardashian's terror and her own fear for their lives. Harouche recounted hearing Kardashian pleading for her life and fearing she would be sexually assaulted. She noted that the incident has caused both women to experience post-traumatic stress disorder, with Kardashian experiencing a loss of personal freedom. Harouche pushed back against the idea that Kardashian was responsible for the robbery because she flaunted her wealth on social media, stating that women should not be held responsible for sexual assault because of their attire.</p>
