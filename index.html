          <p>The Trump administration has officially implemented new tariffs, imposing a 10% duty on softwood lumber and 25% on select upholstered furniture and kitchen cabinets, with these rates slated to increase further next year. This policy is presented as a measure to bolster US industries and safeguard national security, yet economists predict it will substantially elevate construction costs, exacerbating challenges for prospective homebuyers on an already difficult market. Key exporting nations such as Canada, which faces a combined 45% levy, along with Vietnam, Mexico, and China, are poised to face significant economic repercussions from these duties. This article highlights the continued global market instability stemming from the administration's assertive trade practices, impacting various sectors.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK experienced a slight deceleration in wage growth over the summer, with annual employee earnings rising by 4.7% in the three months to August, down from 4.8% previously. Concurrently, the national unemployment rate edged up from 4.7% to 4.8%, though the Office for National Statistics (ONS) advises caution regarding this data's quality. While private sector earnings growth reached a four-year low, it still outpaced inflation, offering some relief amidst broader economic shifts. The ONS also highlighted differing patterns among age groups, with younger individuals primarily driving the increase in unemployment, indicating specific demographic challenges in the labor market and a period of weak hiring activity.</p>

The incident, occurring around 8:15 a.m., prompted a swift response from law enforcement. Following his apprehension, the suspect informed police he had placed two pipe bombs nearby, which were subsequently located and rendered safe by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department Bomb Squad, ensuring public safety. Two victims were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, while a third was treated on-scene. Authorities have not disclosed the suspect's identity or motive, with the investigation remaining open and ongoing, emphasizing community safety as a top priority.</p>

This move, effective immediately, prohibits Chinese entities from doing business with the sanctioned companies and caused Hanwha Ocean's shares to fall over 8%. The action follows reciprocal port fees imposed by both the US and China on each other's vessels, and broader tensions including China's rare earths export restrictions and US President Trump's threats of further tariffs.

          <p>Two UK government schemes, ECO4 and the Great British Insulation Scheme, have reportedly botched insulation installations in tens of thousands of homes, necessitating extensive repairs. A National Audit Office (NAO) report found 98% of external wall insulation and 29% of internal insulation jobs had problems, risking damp, mould, and immediate health and safety hazards like exposed wiring. The NAO criticized "clear failures" in design, an "under-skilled workforce," and "weak" oversight by consumer protection scheme TrustMark. The government has pledged to fix affected homes at no cost to consumers.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX Starship successfully completed its 11th test flight from Texas, with the Super Heavy booster returning to the Gulf of Mexico and the upper stage splashing down in the Indian Ocean as planned. This marks a significant milestone, being the last test before SpaceX launches an upgraded Starship prototype designed for Moon and Mars missions, which NASA Administrator Sean Duffy called "another major step" toward lunar landings. Previous tests often ended in explosions, but recent missions have shown consistent success, boosting confidence in the vehicle's capabilities for future human spaceflight.</p>

          <p>Blake Snell delivered a historic pitching performance for the Dodgers in Game 1 of the NLCS, allowing only one hit over eight scoreless innings with 10 strikeouts, securing a 2-1 victory over the Brewers. His dominance helped the team overcome a confounding fourth-inning double-play that nearly cost them runs and late bullpen jitters. Freddie Freeman's sixth-inning home run provided the decisive lead, and despite closer Roki Sasaki's struggles, Blake Treinen sealed the win. This article emphasizes Snell's exceptional individual effort in a challenging game.</p>
