          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will double tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a speech at U.S. Steel's Irvin Works in Pennsylvania. He stated that the increase from 25% would further secure the steel industry, making it harder for foreign producers to circumvent the tariffs. Trump also addressed the proposed merger between U.S. Steel and Japan's Nippon, describing it as a partnership that would keep U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh while Nippon invests $14 billion. The president assured that the deal would be controlled by the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a federal court struck down President Trump's use of emergency powers to enact broad tariffs, his administration is exploring alternative trade policy options. While the tariffs remain in place temporarily, the ruling puts much of Trump's trade agenda at risk. Other options include Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, and Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930.

The White House maintains that the CPB was creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime.

          <p>President Trump saw Elon Musk off from the White House, marking the end of Musk's tenure leading the government efficiency initiative known as Doge. Trump praised Musk for delivering a "colossal change" in Washington and presented him with a golden key to the White House. Musk vowed that his departure "is not the end" of Doge and that the team will only grow stronger over time. Doge faced criticism for mass firings and unorthodox cost-cutting methods, achieving less than expected in cost savings.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk deflected a reporter's question about a New York Times article detailing his alleged drug use during President Trump's campaign last year. Musk began talking over the reporter, preventing the journalist from finishing his question. The Times reported that Musk consumed the anesthetic ketamine and allegedly used ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms. Musk questioned the credibility of The New York Times, referencing a Pulitzer Prize they received for reporting on Russia-gate.</p>

          <p>California is contesting the Trump administration's claim that the state obstructs federal immigration law, requesting to be removed from the list of sanctuary jurisdictions. Governor Newsom's office argues that federal court rulings have rejected the idea that California law unlawfully obstructs immigration enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security issued the list in accordance with an executive order directing federal agencies to identify funding to sanctuary cities, counties, and states that could be suspended or terminated. California's sanctuary policies limit local law enforcement coordination with immigration authorities.</p>

          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Maj. Margaret Houlihan on the TV series "M*A*S*H," has died at her home in New York City at the age of 87.
