          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed growing optimism about the potential of quantum computing during a keynote speech at Nvidia's GTC Paris developer conference. He believes quantum computers are nearing a stage where they can solve real-world problems. Huang noted the impressive quantum computing community in Europe, including French startup Pasqal, with whom he recently met. He anticipates that quantum computers will be applicable in areas that can solve interesting problems in the coming years, signaling a significant and exciting time for the field.</p>

          <p>Rioting continued for a second night in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, resulting in injuries to seventeen police officers. Protesters hurled petrol bombs, bricks, and fireworks at police, who responded with baton rounds and water cannons. The unrest began after a peaceful protest concerning an alleged sexual assault, with two teenagers later appearing in court. The violence has been condemned by local leaders, who describe it as "racist thuggery," and there are concerns about the strain on police resources. Some residents have displayed signs indicating their nationality in response to the unrest.</p>

          <p>China's military has criticized Japan for undermining regional security by testing new long-range anti-ship and hypersonic missiles. The People's Liberation Army Daily stated that the missiles' extended range would deter multiple surrounding areas. They argued that this increased ability to strike long-range targets violates the pacifist constitution, which prohibits Japan from possessing offensive weapons. The choice of location was designed to minimize international criticism of Japan's military expansion, but that Japan has been leaping toward ‚Äòfirst strike capabilities‚Äô in the name of building so-called ‚Äòcounter strike capabilities‚Äô.</p>

          <p>With the rise of MLS, the upcoming Club World Cup and World Cup, and the enduring stature of the US women's national team, the question of how much professional soccer America can handle is being asked. Several organizations are betting that the answer to that question is ‚Äúno,‚Äù as evidenced by the emergence of rival leagues at both first and second division levels, as well as the potential for up to 50 women's professional soccer teams in the US by 2030. While the US market presents a massive opportunity for soccer, the history of America‚Äôs sporting experience points in a slightly less bullish direction.</p>

          <p>Climate.gov, a major US government website providing public education on climate science, is likely to be shut down after almost all of its content staff were fired. Former staff members believe the changes were targeted by political appointees within the Trump administration to restrict public-facing climate information. There are concerns that the website could be co-opted to publish anti-science content or that the absence of the content team may help anti-science information flourish more readily.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A California law designed to reduce greenhouse gases by diverting organic waste from landfills has inadvertently led to increased illegal dumping in the Antelope Valley. The law requires residents and businesses to separate organic waste for composting, but a lack of infrastructure and demand in the Los Angeles area has made disposal more expensive. This has incentivized waste haulers to dump illegally, threatening the desert ecosystem with invasive plant species and toxic herbicides. While the state agency claims that property owners are granting permission for waste haulers to come and dump on their property in return for payment, it is still a big problem, and state and local enforcement agencies need to stop it.</p>

          <p>A Dads' Group in Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, offers a supportive community for fathers to discuss the challenges of modern parenting. The bi-weekly meetings at PlayLab provide a space for dads to share personal stories, ask for help, and build emotional connections. Modern parenting can be isolating, with increased expectations and fewer resources, making supportive systems like this crucial. The group aims to address the often-overlooked needs of fathers, fostering vulnerability and camaraderie in a casual, child-friendly environment.</p>

          <h2>Contributor Argues Big Oil Could Face Homicide Charges for Heat Wave Deaths</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cindy J. Cho, a former prosecutor, argues that fossil fuel companies could potentially face homicide charges for heat wave deaths linked to climate change. She contends that if these companies knowingly created lethal climate harms, they could be held accountable under state laws punishing reckless conduct or extreme indifference to human life. Proving causation would require linking deaths to heat, attributing the heat to human-caused climate change, and demonstrating that fossil fuel companies were primary drivers of greenhouse gas emissions. While acknowledging concerns about misusing criminal law, Cho suggests a combination of civil and criminal enforcement may be the best approach to deter future harm.</p>

          <p>A regional curfew was imposed in downtown Los Angeles by Mayor Karen Bass following four days of escalating protests that resulted in property damage and defaced landmarks. The curfew, in effect from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., aims to curb the actions of those who do not support the immigrant community. Violators face arrest, and exceptions are limited to residents, workers, credentialed media, and emergency personnel. The protests began in response to the Trump administration‚Äôs immigration crackdown, with arrests increasing over the weekend due to violence, theft, and property destruction.</p>

          <p>Changes proposed by the Trump administration and House Republicans could undermine access to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), potentially causing millions to lose coverage. Key provisions in the "One Big Beautiful Bill" include ending automatic re-enrollment, requiring documentation before receiving tax credits, and shortening the open enrollment period. These changes are projected to increase the number of uninsured Americans. Critics argue these measures will create bureaucratic hurdles and reduce access to affordable healthcare, while supporters claim they will reduce fraud and abuse.</p>

          <p>Seattle is grappling with balancing the need for increased housing density and the preservation of trees, which are crucial for addressing climate change. A new state law mandates more housing density, but not necessarily more trees, leading to tension between development and environmental concerns. The Bryant Heights development serves as an example of building density while preserving existing trees, cooling buildings, filtering carbon emissions, and providing gathering spaces for residents. The city is also updating its tree protection ordinance and planting more trees in public areas to reach a canopy coverage goal of 30% by 2037.</p>

          <p>Homeowners in states prone to extreme weather events are finding ways to save on insurance by upgrading their houses to withstand disasters. Programs like Alabama's FORTIFIED Roof standard offer discounts to homeowners who strengthen their homes against hurricanes. While these programs are expanding, some homeowners are still struggling to retain insurance coverage altogether. Experts emphasize the importance of community-wide retrofitting and urge insurance companies to account for home improvements when determining coverage. By investing in up-front protection, homeowners can reduce the risk of damage and potentially lower insurance costs.</p>
