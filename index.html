          <p>The Belmont Stakes will feature a rematch of the top three finishers from the Kentucky Derby: Sovereignty, Journalism, and Baeza, marking the conclusion of horse racing's Triple Crown for 2025. Journalism, the Preakness winner, is the morning-line favorite at 8-5 odds. The race will be held at Saratoga Race Course due to ongoing renovations at Belmont Park, shortening the distance to 1 1/4 miles, equivalent to the Derby. Sovereignty, who skipped the Preakness, aims to achieve the rare feat of winning both the Derby and the Belmont, while Journalism seeks to add another victory to his impressive record, after winning the Preakness. </p>

          <p>Pride celebrations across the United States are moving forward despite facing significant budget shortfalls due to a corporate exodus that began in the spring, with several organizations reporting a 20% to 30% reduction in corporate support compared to previous years. Many companies cited financial strain or internal transitions as reasons for withdrawing support, while organizers suggest anti-DEI policies and attacks on transgender Americans may be contributing factors. Despite the challenges, organizers are determined to continue Pride events, but the long-term impact on year-round programming remains a concern, as some organizations may need to cut grant programs that support at-risk communities. Some companies are donating without publicity and some are silent partners, and many are still participating in the parade, so it remains to be seen how the events will be shaped by the lack of funding. </p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a strategic railway project linking the Kashmir Valley to the Indian mainland, marking his first visit to the region since recent military clashes between India and Pakistan. The project includes the Chenab Rail Bridge, touted as the world’s highest railway arch bridge, and aims to improve connectivity, boost tourism, and create livelihood opportunities. The railway is expected to reduce travel time between Katra and Srinagar to three hours, providing all-weather connectivity to the Himalayan valley. Tensions between India and Pakistan remain high following a recent attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, leading to military actions and diplomatic efforts. </p>

          <p>A recent Ipsos poll reveals widespread negative sentiment across Europe, with a majority of citizens in Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy believing their societies are broken, with Germany seeing the largest increase in this belief since 2021. Economic concerns are fueling populist sentiments, as many Europeans feel their economies are rigged to favor the wealthy and powerful, with Brits expressing the strongest agreement with this sentiment. Consequently, Britons are also the most likely to support a strong, rule-breaking leader to address these issues, while economic pressures and limited fiscal space challenge the government's ability to boost its popularity. Right-wing populist parties are adjusting their messaging to appeal to voters who feel mainstream parties have failed them socially and economically. </p>

          <p>A Japanese high court overturned a ruling that had ordered former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) to pay damages for failing to prevent the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The court determined that it was difficult for TEPCO's management to foresee the massive tsunami that caused the disaster, thus reversing the 2022 court decision that mandated the former executives to pay approximately 13 trillion yen ($90 billion) in compensation. The judge stated that the government's earthquake assessment did not provide sufficient basis for the utility to swiftly conduct construction work to protect against a huge tsunami. The lawyer for the shareholders expressed his intention to appeal the latest decision, criticizing the ruling as fundamentally flawed. </p>

          <p>British heavyweight boxer Fabio Wardley is preparing for a significant career test against undefeated Australian contender Justis Huni, while simultaneously anticipating the birth of his first child. Wardley's partner is due to give birth just a week after his fight at Ipswich Town Football Club, adding a layer of uncertainty to his preparations. At 30 years old, Wardley began his boxing career a decade ago after working in recruitment, and a victory over Huni could position him for a world-title shot as early as 2026. He is focused on maintaining dedication, a hunger to learn, and fierce determination in both his boxing career and impending fatherhood. </p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a new radar technology that allows an aircraft to track moving targets on the ground without emitting radar signals, maintaining radio silence. The innovation, called a “space-time decoupling two-channel clutter cancellation method,” enables a silent Cessna aircraft to detect moving vehicles with clarity, even in cluttered environments. This breakthrough addresses a long-standing challenge in detecting moving targets with bistatic airborne radar, which is often hindered by reflections from land, sea, or buildings. The study, led by Li Zhongyu at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, was published in the Journal of Radars. </p>

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra attributed the move to softened inflation and slower-than-expected growth amid global challenges. The decision followed a better-than-expected GDP growth figure in the fiscal fourth quarter, although the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. Despite highlighting growth concerns, the RBI revised its inflation outlook to 3.7% for the current financial year, indicating potential moderation in commodity prices. (not investment advice)</p>

The ban, backdated to April 2024, allows regulator Ofwat to claw back bonuses or take enforcement action, with Environment Secretary Steve Reed stating that the public is furious over bonuses given despite sewage spills.

          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is rippling through global markets, causing concerns in Asia about a flood of cheap imports squeezing local industries. Despite tariffs aimed at deterring Chinese exports to the U.S., and weak domestic consumption, China is doubling down on manufacturing, leading to deflationary pressure on producer prices. This influx of low-cost Chinese goods could provide some relief for inflation-hit economies, potentially easing the cost-of-living crisis and allowing central banks to consider rate cuts. However, economists warn that economies must also prepare for potential barriers to importing from China as countries seek to protect their local industries. (not investment advice)</p>
