            <p>Shares of ASML, a Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer, experienced a 6% drop after the company reported lower-than-expected net bookings for the first quarter of 2025, totaling 3.94 billion euros against an anticipated 4.89 billion euros. CEO Christophe Fouquet acknowledged that while the demand outlook remains robust, driven by artificial intelligence, uncertainty surrounding new U.S. trade restrictions could impact demand. The company estimates 2025 revenue between 30 billion and 35 billion euros, but tariff uncertainties are creating concerns on both macroeconomic levels and potential market demands.

            <p>The U.S. Treasury market experienced an unusual sell-off in response to President Donald Trump's proposed "reciprocal" tariffs, causing market turmoil and ultimately leading to the suspension of the duties. Yields on the 10-year Treasury soared to 4.592%, the highest since February, while the 30-year Treasury bond yield reached its highest since November 2023. Analysts suggest that China and Japan, major holders of U.S. debt, may have been selling Treasurys, although the move could negatively impact China's own investments. The sell-off was unusual, given that investors typically flock to U.S. debt during times of uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Harvard University has refused to comply with demands from the Trump administration, which included directives on governance, hiring, and teaching, leading to the freezing of $2.2 billion in federal funds. President Alan Garber stated that no government should dictate what private universities can teach. While Harvard has made some concessions to address concerns about antisemitism, it drew the line at the White House's comprehensive list of demands. With a substantial $53.2 billion endowment, Harvard is financially equipped to withstand the funding cuts, but experts note that the loss will still create a significant challenge, especially if Trump removes the school's tax-exempt status.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's persistent threats to impose tariffs have plunged the United States into a series of trade wars, increasing uncertainty for businesses and economies worldwide. The timeline details Trump's actions, beginning with his inauguration and promises to impose tariffs on foreign countries. It includes retaliatory measures from countries like China, Canada, and Mexico, and the various pauses, exemptions, and escalations that have characterized the trade conflicts. Economists warn of potentially severe consequences for global businesses and consumers due to the broader tariffs and the resulting retaliatory measures.</p>

            <p>In his first public address since leaving office, Joe Biden criticized the Trump administration's welfare policies, particularly concerning Social Security. Biden described Social Security as a "sacred promise" and attacked the administration for seeking to cut staff at the agency responsible for managing benefits. He accused the administration of "taking a hatchet" to Social Security, while Trump has stated his intention to target fraudulent claims but protect benefits for law-abiding citizens. The Social Security Agency, now controlled by a Trump appointee, refuted Biden's claims, adding a layer of political tension to the debate.</p>

            <p>The use of disposable e-cigarettes or vapes is decreasing in the UK before the government's ban on their sale, scheduled for June 1, 2025. Research indicates that vape users are transitioning to refillable and rechargeable vapes in anticipation of the ban. The percentage of 16-24 year olds primarily using disposable vapes has nearly halved in the past year, dropping from 63% to 35%. The ban aims to reduce littering and tackle rising rates of youth vaping, with health officials emphasizing that vaping should be used as a means to quit smoking, not as an entry point for non-smokers.</p>

            <p>In Oakland's special mayoral election, Loren Taylor took a narrow lead against Barbara Lee in early results, prompted by the recall of the city's mayor. The race remains too close to call, with the city using ranked-choice elections, potentially delaying final results for several days. The special election was triggered by the ousting of Mayor Sheng Thao due to frustrations over crime, homelessness, and financial mismanagement. Taylor appealed to voters seeking a change, while Lee campaigned on her experience and a message of unity.</p>

            <p>Experts warn that consumers could bear the brunt of data centers' increasing energy demands if reforms aren't implemented. Special contracts between utilities and data center companies may shift costs onto consumers due to their complexity and opaque regulatory processes. In the UK, zonal pricing could lead to higher wholesale prices for most consumers, while benefiting data centers that can shift workloads to off-peak hours. Proactive regulation and energy grid reform are crucial to manage energy prices and meet changing energy needs, ensuring that consumers are not unduly burdened by the energy demands of data centers.</p>

            <p>Conservationists are warning that wildfires are pushing some of the UK's rarest wildlife, including endangered birds and mammals, closer to extinction. Record dry spells and high temperatures have contributed to the fires, destroying habitats and food sources for species like hen harriers and water voles. The fires have also impacted temperate Atlantic rainforests and newly planted trees. Conservation charities are calling for increased funding to restore peat bogs and better oversight of controlled burns to mitigate the devastating impact on wildlife and the environment.</p>

The author criticizes the administration's demands on Britain regarding digital regulation and taxation of US tech companies. It suggests that the administration's definition of free speech is warped, prioritizing the amplification of the president's views over objective facts. The author warns against Britain taking instruction on political freedom from a regime that stifles media independence and undermines democratic alliances.</p>

            <p>President Trump's apparent defiance of court orders in the case of Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident deported to El Salvador despite a court order, has raised concerns about a potential constitutional crisis. Legal experts and politicians are questioning whether the president's refusal to abide by court rulings undermines the U.S. system of governance. While some argue that Trump's actions represent a tipping point towards authoritarianism, others believe the judiciary still has tools to enforce its rulings.
