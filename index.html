        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 to keep its key interest rate at 4%, pausing its monetary easing strategy. This decision comes as the central bank balances persistent inflation, which remained at 3.8% in August, against a fragile economic outlook marked by zero growth in July and a cooling labor market. Officials are now cautiously awaiting more data on inflation and the government's upcoming Autumn Budget before considering any further rate cuts later in the year. The central bank aims to see a clear downward trend in price pressures before resuming its gradual approach to easing. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article posits that the current housing affordability crisis stems directly from President Nixon's 1971 decision to detach the U.S. dollar from the gold standard. The author argues this move eliminated fiscal discipline, leading to rampant inflation, stagnant real wages, and soaring housing prices that have outpaced income growth. According to the piece, this policy shift created a "two-income trap," forcing families to require dual incomes to afford essentials that were once manageable on a single salary. The article concludes that this single act fundamentally re-engineered the economy to favor the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.</p>

          <p>A historically brutal and long-shuttered unit at Louisiana's Angola penitentiary, known as "the dungeon," has been repurposed to house immigrant detainees for ICE. The move, initiated under an emergency order by Governor Jeff Landry, is being framed by the Trump administration as a facility for the "worst of the worst" undocumented immigrants with criminal records. Critics and civil rights advocates argue this blurs the legal line between criminal incarceration and civil detention, leveraging the prison's infamous reputation for violence and its racist history as a former slave plantation to create fear. This development highlights a broader national strategy of using harsh carceral settings for immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A newly appointed federal vaccine advisory panel, the ACIP, is meeting this week, with its decisions potentially restricting access to and insurance coverage for key immunizations. The committee, reshaped by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. with members critical of vaccines, will vote on recommendations for COVID-19 jabs as well as routine childhood shots for hepatitis B and MMRV. Public health experts express concern that any move to weaken existing guidance could confuse the public, depress vaccination rates, and create barriers for patients, particularly in rural areas. The outcome of the votes is seen as a critical test of scientific integrity in U.S. public health policy.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of workers across France participated in a national strike on Thursday, causing significant disruption to public transport, schools, and other services. The protests were called by major trade unions to oppose the new government's plans for deep budget cuts, which were initially proposed by the previous, short-lived administration. Unions are demanding increased spending on public services and higher taxes on the wealthy instead of austerity measures. The demonstrations represent a major challenge for new Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu, who is attempting to navigate a hung parliament while addressing France's high public debt.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit to the U.K. shifted from royal ceremony to political business as he met with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers. The leaders discussed a major "tech prosperity deal" intended to bring billions in U.S. investment into the U.K.'s AI, quantum computing, and nuclear energy sectors. While the visit aims to strengthen the "special relationship" and secure economic benefits, tensions remain over unresolved U.S. tariffs on British steel and aluminum. The meeting mixes formal diplomacy with ceremonial elements, reflecting Starmer's effort to build a working relationship with the U.S. president despite their ideological differences.</p>

          <p>ABC has suspended its late-night program "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" indefinitely following pressure from the Trump administration and the FCC chairman. The suspension came after Kimmel's monologue accused the MAGA movement of exploiting the recent killing of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk for political gain. The move was preceded by major broadcast groups, Nexstar and Sinclair, dropping the show and was celebrated by President Trump, who called for other critical hosts to be removed. Free speech advocates have condemned the action as a chilling example of government interference with the media and an attack on critical voices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has reportedly expanded its ban on Nvidia's AI chips, now blocking the RTX Pro 6000D, effectively freezing the U.S. company out of the Chinese market. This follows an earlier halt on H20 chip purchases pending a national security review. Industry analysts suggest the move reflects Beijing's growing confidence in its domestic semiconductor capabilities, with companies like Huawei making significant strides in AI hardware. The decision is also seen as a strategic tactic to gain leverage in ongoing trade and technology negotiations with the United States, as China signals it can reduce its reliance on American technology.

Hasan argues against debating fascists, as they reject democratic principles, but acknowledges that such encounters can reach a wider, younger audience unfamiliar with progressive viewpoints.

The piece criticizes Trump for his passive response and for continuing to blame Ukraine and the previous U.S. administration for the war, rather than Putin.

          <h2>Immersive Séances at L.A.'s Heritage Square Museum Explore History of Spiritualism</h2>

          <p>An event called "Phasmagorica" at the Heritage Square Museum in Los Angeles offers attendees an artistic and historical exploration of the séance. Created by magician and "hopeful skeptic" BC Smith, the experience is designed as an intimate experiment rather than a performance, guiding small groups through the history of 19th-century spiritualism before leaving them alone to commune with spirits. Smith emphasizes that there are no tricks or theatrical effects, aiming instead to create a personal and contemplative space for both believers and non-believers. The popular, sold-out events tap into a modern search for connection and meaning by recreating a historical practice of communing with the beyond.</p>

The store partners with the local nonprofit TippedEars, housing its rescues in a "catio" and donating proceeds from events to support its trap-neuter-return mission. This innovative model has doubled the rescue's adoption rates by allowing potential adopters to interact with the cats in a comfortable, low-stress environment. The boutique serves as a community hub for cat lovers and has successfully educated the public on animal welfare while finding homes for dozens of kittens.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Conservatives Have Embraced Cancel Culture in the Aftermath of Charlie Kirk's Killing</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion column argues that in the wake of Charlie Kirk's killing, conservatives have ironically adopted the "cancel culture" tactics they once condemned. The author points to high-profile figures like Vice President JD Vance encouraging followers to report people to their employers for inappropriate online comments, and government officials threatening punitive action. The piece contends that this represents a reversal of core conservative principles like free speech and limited government. The author concludes that this shift demonstrates that for many in modern politics, principles are secondary to wielding power, and cancel culture was not rejected but simply co-opted.</p>

          <h2>Column: Renaming 'Defense Department' to 'War Department' Offers a More Honest Label for US Military Policy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece explores President Trump's decision to rename the Department of Defense to the Department of War, arguing that while concerning, it provides a more accurate reflection of U.S. military history and function. The author notes that the original War Department played a key role in westward expansion and colonization, and that the "Defense" label adopted in 1949 has often served as a euphemism for aggressive foreign policy. The article suggests that the more direct term "War" could make massive military budgets harder to justify to the public and spark a more transparent debate about the nation's continuous engagement in global conflicts.</p>

          <p>The West Hollywood City Council has passed a comprehensive ban on the retail sale of most live animals, including rabbits, birds, fish, and reptiles, effective May 2026. This ordinance expands on a 2010 law that already prohibited the sale of cats and dogs, making it the first city in Los Angeles County with such a broad restriction. Animal welfare groups like the SPCA and PETA championed the ban, arguing it will combat the cruel conditions of commercial breeding mills. However, the Pet Advocacy Network opposes the move, warning it could eliminate reputable retailers and inadvertently fuel an unregulated black market for animals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starbucks workers in California, Illinois, and Colorado have filed lawsuits and labor complaints against the company, alleging its new dress code illegally forces them to bear the cost of new work attire. The updated policy requires employees to wear solid black shirts and specific types of bottoms, a significant change from the previous, more flexible guidelines. The lawsuits, backed by the Starbucks Workers United union, argue that state laws require employers to reimburse workers for uniform-related expenses that primarily benefit the company. Employees state that they have had to spend their own money on new clothes and shoes to comply with the rules or risk not being allowed to work.</p>

          <p>Shares of Novo Nordisk surged after the company announced positive late-stage trial results for its oral version of the weight-loss drug Wegovy. The once-daily pill demonstrated an average weight reduction of 16.6% after 64 weeks, an efficacy level comparable to its highly successful injectable counterpart. The company has submitted the pill for approval to the U.S. FDA, with a decision expected later this year, positioning it as a convenient alternative for patients. This development intensifies the competition with rival Eli Lilly, as pharmaceutical giants race to dominate the lucrative market for oral obesity treatments. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The families of four passengers killed in the June Air India crash have filed a lawsuit against Boeing and Honeywell in the United States. The suit alleges that negligence and a faulty fuel cutoff switch on the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner led to the disaster, which killed 260 people near Ahmedabad. The plaintiffs claim the switch's design and placement made it susceptible to inadvertent activation, causing a critical loss of engine thrust during takeoff. This legal action blames the manufacturers for failing to address a known risk, shifting focus onto the aircraft's mechanics rather than solely on pilot actions.</p>

          <p>This analysis examines the growing pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve's independence under the Trump administration, highlighted by the recent appointment of a White House economic adviser to the Fed's board. President Trump has persistently and publicly called for rate cuts and attacked Fed Chair Jerome Powell, breaking with decades of presidential norms. The article argues that Trump's efforts to install loyalists and remove dissenting voices are a direct challenge to the central bank's ability to make decisions based on economic data rather than political expediency. While Powell insists the institution's DNA will resist interference, its commitment is facing an extraordinary test. (not investment advice)</p>
