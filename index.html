        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Indiana Fever were defeated by the New York Liberty, 98-77, in their final game before the All-Star break. The Fever played without star rookie Caitlin Clark, who was ruled out with a groin injury shortly before the game, marking her third injury-related absence this season. Coach Stephanie White expressed frustration with the team's lack of consistency and called for a reset during the break. Clark's participation in the upcoming All-Star weekend, where she is a team captain and 3-point contest participant, is now uncertain due to this latest injury.</p>

          <h2>Nvidia CEO Aims to Sell More Advanced Chips to China Following H20 Ban Reversal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 00:20:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated his intention to sell more advanced chips to China, following the recent decision to resume sales of the H20 AI chip. The H20 is a less powerful semiconductor designed to comply with U.S. export controls, which have significantly impacted Nvidia's sales in the Chinese market. Huang argued that as technology advances, the chips available to China should also improve over time. His comments come as U.S. officials suggest a strategy of allowing sales to ensure Chinese companies remain reliant on American technology rather than developing their own alternatives.</p>

          <h2>White House Confirms Fentanyl Overdose Prevention Program Funds Will Be Disbursed Incrementally</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 00:10:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has announced that a key federal grant program for fentanyl overdose prevention, currently facing a $140 million shortfall, will be funded in increments rather than a single annual payment. This change in disbursement for the Overdose Data To Action (OD2A) program has caused concern among CDC staffers and state health officials, who worry about operational uncertainty and potential service disruptions. While the administration insists the program is not threatened, critics point to a lack of clarity on the timeline and process, making it difficult for public health departments to plan and operate effectively.</p>

          <p>Air traffic controllers are expressing that a new push to modernize equipment fails to address more fundamental problems like nationwide staffing shortages, low morale, and grueling work schedules. Despite Congress approving $12.5 billion for technological upgrades, many controllers feel their concerns about stagnating pay and difficult working conditions, including mandatory six-day workweeks, are being ignored. The FAA is currently over 3,000 controllers short of its target, leading to widespread fatigue and stress among the workforce. Controllers argue that without addressing these quality-of-life issues, the safety and efficiency of the U.S. air travel system remain at risk.</p>

          <p>China has launched a new class of amphibious assault ship, the Type 076, designed to enhance its sea-to-land military capabilities. The vessel, named the Sichuan, will function as a flat-top command center capable of deploying a new generation of fixed-wing drones, helicopters, and fighter jets. This marks a significant advancement for the People's Liberation Army (PLA), as it is the first assault ship with these integrated capabilities. The Sichuan is currently undergoing equipment tests and sea trials and is anticipated to be officially commissioned into the PLA Navy by the end of 2026.</p>

The Trump administration cut 1,353 domestic staffers as part of a reorganization effort, but employees describe a chaotic process where some offices, like the one handling passport fraud, faced unexpected cuts. The entire Office of Casualty Assistance, which supports families of employees who die overseas, was reportedly eliminated, leaving critical functions in limbo.

Exports of automobiles to the U.S. saw a significant 26.7% plunge, with carmakers reportedly absorbing the tariff costs to maintain market share.

While about 70% of deportees were convicted criminals, serious violent crimes like sexual assault and kidnapping each accounted for just over 1% of convictions. The data suggests the administration's wide-net deportation push has primarily ensnared undocumented immigrants without serious violent criminal records, contrary to public messaging.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially revoked $4 billion in federal funds for California's high-speed rail project, citing mismanagement, delays, and budget overruns. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the project a "boondoggle," while President Trump labeled it a "disastrously overpriced 'train to nowhere.'" In response, California Governor Gavin Newsom and other state officials have condemned the move as illegal and politically motivated, vowing to explore all options to fight the decision and continue the project, which they state is already in the track-laying phase.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old suspect has been arrested in connection with the murders of "American Idol" music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca. The couple, both 70, were found shot to death in their Encino home during a wellness check on Monday. Police believe the suspect, Raymond Boodarian, gained entry to the fortified property through an unlocked door and confronted the couple when they returned home. The incident appears to be a random attack, and the suspect was identified using surveillance footage and facial recognition software, leading to his arrest by an LAPD and FBI task force.</p>

          <p>A massive reforestation effort in northern China, known as the 'Green Great Wall,' is being linked by scientists to a rise in severe hay fever cases. The project, aimed at combating desertification, heavily utilizes plants from the artemisia family, which are easy to grow but produce highly allergenic pollen. A new study has confirmed the role of these plants in causing allergic reactions at a molecular level, identifying specific volatile components in the pollen. While the greening project has ecological benefits, it has created an unfortunate public health consequence for residents in regions like Inner Mongolia, who suffer from worsening allergy symptoms.</p>

          <p>A coalition of immigrant advocacy groups has filed a class-action lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging a coordinated effort to unlawfully arrest and deport people attending their own immigration court hearings. The lawsuit claims that the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security have colluded to turn courthouses into traps, violating due process rights. The plaintiffs include twelve immigrants, most of whom were seeking asylum from persecution, who were arrested at their hearings. The suit argues this policy abandons the long-standing tradition of treating courts as safe zones, thereby deterring people from complying with their legal obligations.</p>

          <p>In Nevada, companies like Crusoe and Redwood Materials are pioneering a solution to the massive energy demands of the AI industry by using old electric vehicle batteries. These used batteries, which may have lost some capacity for automotive use but are still functional, are being repurposed into large-scale energy storage systems. Paired with solar panels, they provide reliable, renewable power to data centers, offering an alternative to building new gas-fired plants. This innovative approach not only helps meet the voracious power needs of AI but also creates a sustainable second life for EV batteries, addressing a key recycling challenge.</p>

          <p>Recent deadly sectarian violence in southern Syria has drawn attention to the Druze, an Arabic-speaking ethno-religious minority, and prompted military intervention from Israel. Clashes between Druze militias and Sunni Bedouin fighters have escalated, with Israel conducting airstrikes against Syrian government forces, claiming it is acting to protect the Druze community. The violence highlights the fragile security situation under Syria's new government, as minority groups like the Druze resist attempts to impose central authority. Israel's intervention is also driven by its goal to prevent Islamist fighters from establishing a presence near its border on the Golan Heights.</p>

          <p>Recent federal immigration raids on businesses have highlighted significant flaws in the E-Verify system, which is designed to confirm employment eligibility. Business owners who used the system in good faith have found themselves victims of raids, as the system primarily vets documents, not the individuals presenting them, making it vulnerable to identity theft. Experts describe E-Verify as an easy-to-fool, "wink-and-nod" system that creates a false sense of security for employers. While federal officials state it has a high accuracy rate, critics argue it fails to stop the use of fraudulent documents, victimizing both businesses and individuals whose identities are stolen.</p>

The bill addresses a gap created after the VA abruptly ended a pandemic-era assistance program, leaving veterans with fewer options than other homeowners to manage missed mortgage payments. The new law will create a permanent program allowing veterans to move delinquent payments to the end of their loan term, making their mortgages current and preventing foreclosure. This solution was urgently sought by veterans' groups and the mortgage industry to rectify the crisis and provide a stable safety net.</p>

The lawsuit argues that the executive branch acted unlawfully by shutting down the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a decision they claim rests with Congress. The states contend that eliminating the program threatens critical infrastructure projects designed to protect communities from natural disasters like floods and storms. A recent analysis found that the funding cuts disproportionately affect counties that supported President Trump in the 2024 election, particularly in the vulnerable Southeast.</p>

His stance presents a sharp contrast with President Trump, who has dismissed the increased scrutiny surrounding Epstein's associates as a politically motivated "hoax" started by Democrats.

The former inspector general for USAID, Paul Martin, stated that the administration has provided little to no proof for its allegations and that some examples were "completely made up." Officials with knowledge of the review process told NPR that programs were marked for termination based on keywords like "gender" or "climate" rather than evidence of fraud. This has led to accusations that the cuts are politically motivated rather than based on a thorough review of program effectiveness.</p>
