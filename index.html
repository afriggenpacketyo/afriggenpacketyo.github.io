          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court order, allowing the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their origin without first providing an opportunity to raise fears of torture or persecution. This decision is a victory for the administration, enabling the resumption of deportations while legal proceedings continue. Justice Sotomayor dissented, accusing the government of unlawful conduct and undermining due process. The Department of Homeland Security hailed the ruling as a win for American safety and security, while immigrant advocates criticized the decision, fearing the removal of critical protections against torture and death. The high court's ruling allows the administration to continue with its immigration agenda and plans for mass deportations.</p>

          <p>Meta engaged in discussions with Runway, an artificial intelligence startup known for its AI video-generation tools, regarding a potential acquisition before deciding to invest billions in Scale AI. The talks between Meta and Runway did not progress significantly and eventually ended, according to sources familiar with the matter. Runway had previously been recognized on CNBC's Disruptor 50 list. Meta ultimately chose to pursue a different strategy by investing in Scale AI, although the specific reasons for the shift in direction remain undisclosed.

          <p>President Trump's recent remarks about potentially toppling the Iranian regime, using the phrase "Make Iran Great Again," have sparked controversy and division, even among his supporters. This shift in rhetoric contrasts with his earlier stance on discouraging military strikes against Iran. While some, like Vice President J.D. Vance, maintain that the U.S. does not seek regime change, Trump's comments suggest a broader ambition. This has ignited debate, with some warning against repeating the mistakes of past interventions in the Middle East. The president's evolving approach has thrown the MAGA right into acrimony.</p>

Despite facing potential re-detention, Khalil affirmed his commitment to advocating for Palestinian human rights. He also addressed accusations of antisemitism, emphasizing that there is no place for any form of racism within the Palestinian movement.

          <p>President Trump's decision to launch airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities without congressional approval has ignited a debate over the division of war powers between the executive and legislative branches. While the Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war, presidents have often deployed U.S. forces into combat without formal declarations. Lawmakers are divided on whether Trump's actions bypassed their constitutional authority, with some demanding congressional authorization for military action against Iran. The War Powers Resolution of 1973, intended to ensure joint decision-making, has been largely ignored by presidents, further complicating the issue. This has sparked renewed discussion on the balance of power between Congress and the president in matters of war and national security.</p>

          <p>Satellite imagery has revealed the extent of damage to Iranian nuclear facilities following recent U.S. airstrikes, with experts analyzing the images to assess the impact on sites like Fordo, Isfahan, and Natanz. While President Trump claimed the sites were "completely and totally obliterated," others have offered more cautious assessments, awaiting full battle damage reports. The images show damage to Fordo in the form of craters and ash, with possible damage to ventilation shafts. Isfahan suffered extensive building damage, while Natanz shows a large hole over an underground complex.

          <p>Analysts in Taiwan have expressed concern that the United States' military engagement in the Middle East, particularly the recent strikes in Iran, could strain U.S. resources and attention, potentially impacting its ability to respond to a crisis in the Taiwan Strait. The analysts worry that the U.S., already supporting Ukraine, may have fewer military resources and less political bandwidth to deter potential Chinese action against Taiwan. While acknowledging Taiwan remains a core U.S. interest, they question how many resources the U.S. could realistically spare if faced with managing two major conflicts simultaneously. This highlights the delicate balance the U.S. faces in managing its global security commitments.</p>

However, other officials and experts have been more cautious, citing the need for further assessment.

          <p>A top U.S. analyst suggests that China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz, even if Iran threatens to close it amidst rising Middle East tensions. Despite China's heavy reliance on Middle Eastern oil, its approach would likely involve quiet negotiations and prioritizing its self-interests rather than direct military intervention. The analyst pointed to China's agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels as an example of this approach. This indicates China's focus on protecting its own economic interests rather than policing global waterways.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran launched missiles against the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which were intercepted. An expert analyzes potential Iranian retaliation targets, which could include U.S. military assets across the Middle East, the Strait of Hormuz, and cyber attacks. The expert notes that U.S. military installations in the Gulf are vulnerable due to Iran's arsenal of short-range ballistic missiles. Other potential targets include U.S. naval assets and the Strait of Hormuz, through which a significant portion of the world's oil passes. The expert also warns of the risk of asymmetric warfare and state-sponsored terrorism.</p>

          <p>Approximately 80 Labour MPs are supporting an effort to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system. These MPs have signed an amendment that would allow them to vote on a proposal to reject the welfare reform bill in its entirety. The welfare reform bill, called the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill, will include proposals to make it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payment (Pip). The reasons it lists for thwarting the bill include the number of people the plans are expected to push into relative poverty, a lack of consultation, and an inadequate impact assessment on the consequences on the jobs market and on people's health.</p>
