            <p>Lucy Edwards, a blind content creator and TikTok star, is undergoing IVF with pre-implantation genetic testing to screen out the gene that caused her blindness. Edwards has Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP), a rare genetic condition, and wants to minimize the risk of miscarriage and limit any future traumatic load by ensuring her child has the healthiest start possible. She acknowledges the ethical debates around designer babies but feels it's a responsible decision given the science available. Edwards emphasizes that her decision is personal and not a judgment on others with genetic disorders who choose to have children naturally.</p>

            <p>The death toll from attacks in Nigeria's Benue state has risen to 56, with the governor blaming suspected herdsmen. These attacks are part of a larger pattern of intercommunal violence in Nigeria's Middle Belt, driven by clashes between nomadic herders and settled farmers over land use. Climate change exacerbates the issue, as drought and desertification push herders south in search of grazing lands. Amnesty International has criticized the Nigerian government for failing to protect communities from these attacks.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has ordered a pause to the deportation of Venezuelans being held under the Alien Enemies Act. This follows a lawsuit from the ACLU, arguing that the individuals hadn't had the chance to contest their removal in court. The White House has responded that the challenges to the use of the law for mass deportations are "meritless litigation." Donald Trump has accused the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua of "perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion" on US territory.</p>
