          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh, Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean, have established a new world record for the fastest unsupported, non-stop row across the Pacific Ocean. Their journey from Peru to Australia, completed in just over 139 days, was fraught with challenges, including violent storms that swept one brother overboard. The grueling 9,000-mile expedition, undertaken in a boat named after their late sister, also serves as a fundraiser for clean water projects in Madagascar. The trio successfully beat the previous record of 162 days, set in 2014.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK are proceeding with legal action to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling that overturned a temporary injunction. The ruling concerned The Bell Hotel in Epping, but councils like West Northamptonshire and Broxbourne argue the hotels are unsuitable and strain local services. The government maintains its commitment to phase out hotel use by 2029, while refugee advocates highlight the vulnerability of asylum seekers in these highly visible locations.</p>

          <p>Provisional data from the CDC indicates a significant and sustained decrease in drug overdose deaths in the United States, falling to the lowest level since March 2020. This decline contrasts with President Trump's continued emphasis on the fentanyl crisis as a justification for policies like mandatory minimum sentences and trade tariffs. While public health experts debate the reasons for the drop, citing disrupted supply chains and improved treatment access, critics of the administration's approach worry that funding cuts could reverse this positive trend.</p>

          <p>Several European countries are reconsidering or expanding military conscription in response to a changing geopolitical landscape, particularly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Germany is introducing a "new military service" model, initially voluntary but with the potential for mandatory conscription, while nations like Sweden and Latvia have already reinstated it. Countries such as Finland and Norway continue their long-standing traditions of compulsory service, adapting them to include women and selective drafting. This trend reflects a broader European shift towards bolstering defense capabilities and increasing reserve forces.</p>

          <p>Violent protests across Indonesia have resulted in at least three deaths after a mob set fire to a regional parliament building in Makassar, South Sulawesi. The widespread unrest was initially sparked by public anger over a new, generous housing allowance for lawmakers amid rising living costs. Tensions escalated dramatically following the death of a ride-hailing driver who was run over by a police vehicle during a rally in Jakarta. The events represent a significant challenge for the new administration as authorities grapple with the violent demonstrations.</p>

          <p>Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso has indicated that Republicans are prepared to unilaterally change Senate rules to confirm President Trump's nominees, bypassing Democratic opposition. Negotiations to approve dozens of non-controversial appointments collapsed after President Trump rejected funding demands from Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. With 145 nominations pending, Barrasso suggests options include altering debate time rules or creating opportunities for recess appointments. This potential "nuclear option" escalates the partisan conflict over appointments as Congress faces other pressing deadlines, such as government funding.</p>

          <p>Despite another quarter of blockbuster earnings, chipmaker Nvidia saw its stock price fall, reflecting growing uncertainty on Wall Street about the artificial intelligence boom. While the "Magnificent Seven" tech companies have propped up the stock market, a recent MIT survey found that 95% of companies investing in AI are not yet seeing revenue from it. This disconnect, combined with political pressures and President Trump's unconventional deals with tech firms, is raising questions about whether the massive investments in AI will deliver on their economic promise.

The system's reliance on specific "up-back-through" passing patterns can be predictable and stifles individual creativity. Defensively, the formation can be exploited by opponents who overload the two-man midfield, leading to a loss of control in crucial areas of the pitch.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' recent momentum was halted in a 3-0 shutout loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks. The team's offense struggled, managing only three hits and failing to capitalize against pitcher Zac Gallen and Arizona's bullpen. Dodgers starter Blake Snell gave up three runs in just over five innings, including a two-run home run, while experiencing a noticeable drop in his fastball velocity. The loss was a missed opportunity for the Dodgers to extend their lead in the NL West, as their division rivals, the San Diego Padres, also lost their game on the same night.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's policy to expand speedy deportations for undocumented migrants detained within the interior of the U.S. The policy aimed to use "expedited removal" for individuals who have been in the country for less than two years, allowing for deportation without a judicial hearing. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb's ruling argued that the government's plan risks violating the due process rights of a large group of people. This decision is a setback for the administration's broader goal of carrying out a massive deportation operation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks' playoff aspirations took a hit with a close 76-75 loss to the Indiana Fever, sealed by a costly turnover in the final seconds.
