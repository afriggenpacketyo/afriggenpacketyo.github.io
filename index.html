        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense has reversed its plan to stop sharing crucial satellite weather data with hurricane forecasters. The decision came after scientists and meteorologists expressed alarm, warning that the loss of data could lead to less accurate and timely hurricane predictions, especially during peak season. The Navy now states it will continue providing the data, which is also vital for monitoring polar sea ice and climate change, until the program's scheduled end in 2026. This ensures forecasters have the necessary tools to issue early warnings for dangerous storms.</p>

          <p>David Brom, who was convicted of murdering his parents and two younger siblings with an ax at age 16, has been granted an early work release from a Minnesota prison. Now 53, Brom's release is possible due to a 2023 state law, supported by Governor Tim Walz, that ended life sentences for offenders convicted as juveniles. The law allows for parole consideration after a certain number of years served, making Brom retroactively eligible. He will be transferred to a halfway house under GPS monitoring, a decision that has drawn public attention.</p>

This move is part of the administration's strategy to use tariffs as leverage for negotiating more favorable trade deals for the U.S. Economists have raised concerns that such tariffs could lead to increased consumer prices in the United States.

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the withdrawal of approximately 1,350 National Guard members from Los Angeles, significantly reducing the military presence deployed in June to address unrest over immigration raids. The deployment, which California Governor Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass called unnecessary and illegal, was intended to protect federal agents and property. Newsom's office stated that President Trump's "political theater backfired," as the troops had a limited role while costing an estimated $134 million. About 250 California Guard members will remain to protect federal facilities.</p>

However, the judge ruled that the CQC's assessment was rationally focused on patient safety and that its scrutiny of the clinic's procedures was detailed and appropriate.

          <p>Over 58 million people in the southeastern U.S. remain under heat advisories, with feels-like temperatures soaring above 100 degrees. In contrast, the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic are bracing for heavy rain and potential flooding from a passing cold front. This same front is also pushing smoke from Canadian wildfires into the Midwest, triggering air quality alerts across states like Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin, where levels are considered "unhealthy." The combination of extreme weather events highlights diverse and severe environmental conditions affecting large portions of the country.</p>

          <p>Despite a joint announcement of a new trade deal, European officials have indicated that many details of the agreement with the U.S. are not finalized and that key terms are still disputed. Discrepancies exist on tariff rates for sectors like pharmaceuticals and steel, as well as on the nature of EU commitments to purchase U.S. energy and military equipment. The EU characterizes the deal as a set of non-binding political commitments requiring further negotiation, while the White House has presented it as achieving "historic structural reforms." The ongoing talks and disagreements suggest a period of continued uncertainty for European businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

This article explains that the condition is common among those in technical fields, perfectionists, and introverts, and can lead to anxiety, depression, and burnout. To combat these feelings, the article suggests practicing kinder self-talk, tracking personal progress to create an objective record of accomplishments, and building a supportive community of peers.
