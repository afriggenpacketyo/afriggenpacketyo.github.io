          <p>Amid looming US tariffs on UK car imports, Sir Keir Starmer and Donald Trump discussed ongoing "productive negotiations" for an economic deal.  The phone call follows No. 10's statement regarding potential retaliation against US trade taxes.  The BBC's reporting subtly favors the UK's position, potentially downplaying the US's justifications for tariffs.</p>
