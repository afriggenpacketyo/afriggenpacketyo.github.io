          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has signed an executive order establishing the Illinois Accountability Commission to create a public record of alleged civil rights abuses by federal immigration agents. The nine-person task force, chaired by a former federal judge, will document what Pritzker calls "unlawful attacks" by ICE and CBP officers, collecting videos and firsthand accounts for potential future legal action. A CBP official pushed back, accusing the governor of spreading "fake news" and defending the agency's operations as targeting legitimate threats. The commission aims to hold federal agents accountable and is expected to issue its first report in January.</p>

          <p>Recent satellite images confirm the complete demolition of the White House East Wing to make way for a planned $300 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom. The Trump administration defended the move, stating that architects advised the demolition was necessary for a modern and stable structure, a change from initial plans which suggested the wing would not be impacted. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt asserted that the project is being privately funded by the president and other donors, though plans have not yet been submitted for approval. The demolition has sparked public backlash and questions regarding presidential authority over the historic building.</p>

          <p>Eastside Brewing Co. in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, has received overwhelming public support after announcing a policy to bar children after 7 p.m. and prohibit unaccompanied teenagers. The brewery stated on Facebook that its space is designed for adults consuming alcohol, not as a playground, citing issues with unsupervised children. Despite some negative feedback from a minority of customers, the post went viral with hundreds of commenters praising the decision and pledging their patronage. The brewery's management emphasized that while families are welcome, the environment is primarily intended for adults to enjoy a pint.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the upcoming mayoral race, positioning him as the best candidate to defeat Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani. At a joint appearance, Adams criticized Mamdani as a "snake oil salesman" and a threat to the city, while Cuomo argued that Mamdani's socialist platform is fundamentally different from the Democratic party. The endorsement follows Adams' own withdrawal from the race amid low polling numbers and a federal indictment that was later dropped. Mamdani's campaign framed the endorsement as an alliance between two "disgraced executives" representing big money interests.</p>

Singh overcame significant challenges, including going into debt to keep the barbershop afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic.

          <p>As the U.S. national debt surpasses $38 trillion, economists are warning of long-term consequences for the housing market, including persistently higher mortgage rates. The increasing government debt will likely require higher yields to attract lenders, which translates to increased borrowing costs for consumers. Experts like former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers predict the bond market could "hit a wall," causing Treasury yields and mortgage rates to rise significantly. Homebuyers are being advised that the era of 3-4% mortgage rates is unlikely to return, and they should prepare for a sustained period of higher interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

Among the state's voters overall, however, opinions on a Newsom candidacy are more divided. The poll also indicates that while Californians view their state as a leader in technology and culture, they see it as a poor example in housing, tax, and economic policy. Newsom's approval rating as governor remains positive, but many voters feel he is more focused on national issues than local ones.</p>

The article suggests several ways to capitalize on this volatility, such as trading the stocks of gold mining companies, which often have leveraged movements relative to the price of gold itself. For short-term plays, investors can use gold-backed ETFs or futures contracts to trade price movements directly. For those with a long-term strategy, buying physical gold during price dips remains a viable option to hedge against broader economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

The White House stated the pardon was issued because Zhao was a victim of the Biden administration's "war on cryptocurrency" and that there were no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims. Zhao had served four months in prison as part of a multi-billion-dollar settlement with the Justice Department. The move drew sharp criticism from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who called it an act of "corruption" and highlighted financial ties between Binance and the Trump family's crypto ventures.</p>

          <p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has raised safety concerns about essential air traffic controllers taking on second jobs, such as driving for Uber, to make ends meet during the government shutdown. As controllers are required to work without pay, Duffy stated he does not want them working demanding second jobs on top of their high-stress primary role. The financial pressure on these federal employees is contributing to staffing shortages, which in turn has led to thousands of flight delays and cancellations across the country. Duffy emphasized that the department is prioritizing safety, which may mean deliberately slowing down air traffic.</p>

          <p>Freddy Escobar, the president of the Los Angeles firefighters union, has filed an administrative claim against the city, accusing Mayor Karen Bass of retaliation. Escobar alleges that after he publicly criticized the LAFD's underfunding during the January Palisades fire, the mayor's office orchestrated a retaliatory investigation into his overtime pay. The claim states that the mayor was displeased with his comments and that her office instructed the fire department to issue a misleading statement about a review of his hours to damage his reputation. The city has 45 days to respond before Escobar can file a formal lawsuit.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reversed plans to deploy federal agents to San Francisco after receiving phone calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. In a social media post, Trump stated that he was convinced to hold off on the deployment because local leaders were making "substantial progress" on crime. The decision is seen as a political victory for San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, who had argued against a military-style presence in the city. The potential deployment had become a flashpoint, with some tech executives initially supporting it before backtracking amid public criticism.</p>

Orban, who has cultivated close ties with Russia, accused the EU of warmongering over Ukraine. In contrast, Magyar criticized Orban for centralizing power and aligning with the Kremlin, framing his own movement as a push for systemic change and an end to corruption.</p>

In 2023, the IRS sent over one million such notices. Lawmakers and taxpayer advocates hope the new law will help filers correct honest mistakes without needing to hire expensive legal help.</p>

The Treasury Department cited Moscow's failure to engage in a peace process to end the war in Ukraine as the reason for the sanctions, which are intended to harm the Kremlin's ability to fund its military efforts. Global benchmark Brent crude rose over 5% to $65.78 per barrel, while U.S. crude increased by 5.4%.

          <p>A new study in the journal Science reports that elkhorn and staghorn corals are now functionally extinct in Florida following a record-breaking marine heat wave in 2023. This means the species are so rare they no longer serve their crucial ecological role, which includes providing habitats for fish and protecting coastlines from storm surge. Researchers found that between 98% and 100% of these corals were wiped out by the extreme ocean temperatures, which were as much as four times more stressful than any previously recorded heat event. The loss is a significant blow to the state's marine ecosystem and coastal resilience.</p>
