          <h2>NJ Transit Engineers Strike Threatens Commuter Chaos in New York Metropolitan Area</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A strike by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen would shut down New Jersey Transit’s rail network, impacting approximately 70,000 commuters who rely on the agency's trains to reach Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan daily, with many more using stations in Newark and Hoboken. The union is demanding pay parity with engineers at Amtrak and other regional railroads, while NJ Transit argues that meeting these demands would necessitate a significant fare increase. Negotiations have been ongoing for months, with previous interventions failing to produce an agreement. The strike, the first since 1983, is already causing major employers to consider remote work options and is expected to severely disrupt commutes and impact travel to Newark Liberty Airport and events at MetLife Stadium. The Partnership for New York City estimates that each hour of delay for New Jersey commuters will reduce overall productivity in the city by $6 million.</p>

          <p>Nissan is contemplating sharing its global production facilities with its Chinese partner Dongfeng as part of a broader restructuring effort that includes laying off 11,000 workers and closing seven factories worldwide. The company, which employs thousands in the UK, is facing financial difficulties due to weak sales in key markets and increasing pressure from US tariffs. Nissan's partnership with Dongfeng spans over two decades, with current collaborations focused on car manufacturing in Wuhan, China. Despite recent leadership changes and failed merger talks with Honda, Nissan's battery partner AESC has secured substantial funding for a new plant in Sunderland, signaling continued investment in electric vehicle production.</p>

          <p>Australia's most decorated living soldier, Ben Roberts-Smith, has lost his appeal against a defamation judgment that found he committed war crimes in Afghanistan. The original ruling in 2023 stated that news articles alleging he murdered four unarmed Afghans were true, a verdict now upheld by a panel of Federal Court judges. Roberts-Smith, who maintains his innocence and has not been criminally charged, sued three newspapers over the articles, which detailed misconduct during his deployment between 2009 and 2012. The case, dubbed "the trial of the century," has cost an estimated A$35 million and marks the first time an Australian court has assessed claims of war crimes by Australian forces.</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis reveals a growing trend of venue shopping in federal courts, where lawyers strategically file cases in jurisdictions likely to have judges sympathetic to their political views, especially when seeking nationwide injunctions. Conservatives frequently target small federal courts in Texas, often with single judges appointed by Republicans, ensuring initial rulings from Republican appointees and subsequent appeals to the conservative 5th Circuit. Conversely, during the Trump administration, liberals favored larger venues in the 9th Circuit. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should have the power to dictate policy for the entire country, a decision that could significantly alter the landscape of legal challenges to presidential policies.</p>

          <p>Casandra "Cassie" Ventura faced intense cross-examination in Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking trial, with defense attorneys presenting archived text messages to challenge her claims of coercion and portray her as a willing participant in their activities. The defense aimed to undermine Ventura's credibility by highlighting her apparent enthusiasm for Combs' lifestyle, including drug-fueled orgies, while arguing that Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone. Ventura acknowledged her love for Combs and desire to build a life with him, but maintained that his personality grew violent and coercive over time. The trial continues with concerns about Ventura's pregnancy potentially impacting her testimony schedule.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced an unexpected contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a fall in exports attributed to uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade policies. Despite the contraction, domestic demand showed a positive trend, growing by 0.6%. This GDP data arrives as Japan engages in ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S., with potential impacts from U.S. tariffs remaining a concern. Analysts expect a reasonable trade deal with the U.S. to mitigate tariff effects, suggesting the Bank of Japan will likely maintain its current monetary policy, anticipating a rate hike later in the year.</p>

          <p>An internal review reveals that FEMA is ill-prepared for the upcoming hurricane season, citing staffing limitations, hiring challenges, and a lack of coordination with states. Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson acknowledges the agency is only "80 or 85% there" in terms of preparedness, despite aiming to safeguard Americans, prioritize state responses, and coordinate federal assistance when necessary. The review contrasts with a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson's claim that FEMA is fully activated for hurricane season.

          <p>China is experiencing the world's fastest rise in dementia cases, with projections estimating up to 115 million cases by 2050, according to research published in PLOS One.

Researchers from Fudan University attribute this trend to the country's rapidly aging population, which is already causing a range of challenges.

          <p>Northern California's commercial Dungeness crab season faces disruption due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in crab fishing ropes. To mitigate this, some fishermen are using high-tech systems involving remote-controlled pop-up balloons to retrieve crab cages, reducing rope usage and whale entanglements. While effective, the technology is costly, posing a financial challenge for an industry already struggling with losses. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has shortened the crab season to protect migrating whales, but fishermen using the experimental pop-up technology can continue fishing, balancing economic needs with environmental protection.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration fired nearly 600 employees at Voice of America, a federally funded news network providing independent reporting to countries with limited press freedoms. The layoffs, targeting contractors including journalists, represent over a third of VOA's staff, signaling a continuation of efforts to dismantle the broadcaster. This action comes despite a court ruling ordering the federal government to maintain robust news programming at VOA. The federal building housing the organization has also been put up for sale, further indicating the administration's stance. Some terminated journalists face deportation, as their immigration status is tied to their employment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's deals to sell advanced chips to the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia have divided the U.S. government over concerns about potentially outsourcing the A.I. industry to the Middle East and the technology benefiting China. The agreements involve selling hundreds of thousands of Nvidia's advanced chips annually to build large data center hubs, including one in Abu Dhabi supported by 5 gigawatts of electrical power. Critics worry about inadequate protections preventing the technology from reaching adversaries and the possibility of the world’s largest data centers being located outside the United States. Supporters argue that these deals will boost business for American A.I. companies and widen the nation’s lead in artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Republicans are advancing a megabill to enact President Trump’s agenda, proposing a $3.8 trillion tax cut benefiting the wealthy, increased military and immigration enforcement funding, and cuts to health, nutrition, education, and clean energy programs. The bill faces Republican divisions over Medicaid cuts and tax plan details, including the state and local tax deduction. The plan includes new tax cuts, such as those for tips and overtime, and a bonus deduction for older Americans, but would eliminate many clean energy tax credits. Proposed Medicaid changes include work requirements and reduced funding to states providing healthcare to undocumented immigrants.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, when a land bridge connected the two continents. Fossils of Dalianensis horses, found in northeastern China, show a mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. These horses lived 17,000 years ago and were slightly larger than existing wild horses. The study found that multiple migrations occurred between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, with genetic exchanges in both directions across the Bering land bridge.</p>

          <p>The CDC is considering shifting COVID vaccine recommendations to focus on older Americans and those with chronic health problems, mirroring practices in other countries. New clinical testing requirements for vaccines may delay the availability of updated shots this fall, potentially including the seasonal flu vaccine. This shift is driven by concerns about the benefits of annual boosters for younger, healthy individuals and questions about the pediatric vaccine's approval status. While some experts support targeted vaccination, others fear it could undermine vaccine infrastructure and access, particularly for those who rely on CDC recommendations for insurance coverage.</p>
