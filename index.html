          <p>The Producer Price Index, a measure of wholesale inflation, surged by 0.9% in July, significantly exceeding economists' expectations of a 0.2% gain. This unexpected jump, the largest since June 2022, raises concerns about persistent inflationary pressures within the U.S. economy. While consumer price inflation has been moderate, this report suggests businesses are absorbing rising costs, which could eventually be passed on to consumers. The data complicates the Federal Reserve's decision-making regarding potential interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Agricultural machinery giant John Deere has revised its forecast, now expecting tariffs to cost the company nearly $600 million for the 2025 fiscal year. The announcement came alongside its third-quarter earnings report, which showed a 26% year-over-year drop in net income despite beating Wall Street expectations. The company's stock fell approximately 7% following the news, as higher production costs and trade uncertainty weigh on its financial outlook. Despite near-term challenges, company leadership expressed cautious optimism about future growth in European and South American markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) recorded an $8 billion writedown on its domestic "gigaprojects," such as the futuristic city Neom, according to its latest annual report. Despite this decline in project investments, the fund's total assets under management grew to nearly $1 trillion, partly due to an increased allocation of Saudi Aramco shares. The writedown reflects challenges from lower global oil prices and a growing fiscal deficit in the kingdom. The PIF is reportedly shifting focus, increasing its debt fundraising and planning more investments in high-growth sectors like artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

The dissolution of the deal is seen as a potential setback for Target, which has faced declining sales and store traffic recently. Analysts suggest that operational issues at Target, including theft and staffing, may have contributed to the decision to end the popular and once-promising retail arrangement.</p>

The project, long frozen due to international pressure, would connect the Maale Adumim settlement to Jerusalem, effectively dividing the West Bank and, in Smotrich's words, "burying the idea of a Palestinian state." This move comes as several countries plan to recognize Palestinian statehood, a development Israel opposes. The plan has been condemned by the Palestinian foreign ministry, Israeli NGO Peace Now, and the European Commission as a significant obstacle to a two-state solution.</p>

In a preemptive video call, EU officials briefed Trump on their unified position, urging him not to concede Ukrainian territory and to push for a ceasefire before negotiations. Key European fears include the possibility of Trump being outmaneuvered by Putin, potentially leading to a reduction in U.S. weapons supplies to Ukraine or a withdrawal of American troops from Europe.

          <p>AI search company Perplexity has made a public offer to purchase Google's Chrome browser for $34.5 billion. This move comes as Google awaits a judge's decision on potential divestitures following a landmark antitrust ruling that found the company holds a monopoly in the search market. The Department of Justice has previously called for Google to sell Chrome to foster a more competitive environment. While analysts are skeptical of the bid's seriousness, it highlights the significant regulatory pressure on Google and prompts valuation discussions for its various assets in the event of a forced breakup.

          <p>Hunter Biden has rejected a demand from First Lady Melania Trump to retract and apologize for comments linking her to the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. In response to her threat of a defamation lawsuit seeking over $1 billion in damages, Biden bluntly stated, "That's not going to happen." He defended his remarks by citing reports from journalist Michael Wolff and others, claiming he was repeating information already in the public domain. Mrs. Trump's lawyers assert the claim is false and defamatory, causing her significant financial and reputational harm, setting the stage for a potential high-profile legal battle.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin is strengthening in the Atlantic Ocean and is expected to become the season's first hurricane by Friday, according to the National Hurricane Center. Forecasters predict it will intensify into a major hurricane (Category 3 or stronger) by the end of the week as it approaches the Caribbean. While the storm is not an immediate threat to the U.S. mainland, its long-term path remains uncertain. Swells from Erin are expected to cause dangerous surf and rip currents for the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico over the weekend.</p>

          <p>Researchers at MIT have utilized generative artificial intelligence to design two new potential antibiotics that have successfully killed drug-resistant bacteria, including MRSA and gonorrhea, in lab tests. Unlike previous AI methods that scanned existing chemicals, this approach designed the molecular structures of the drugs from the ground up. The development is hailed as a significant step in combating the growing threat of antibiotic resistance, which causes over a million deaths annually. While the new compounds require years of further testing before clinical use, the breakthrough suggests AI could usher in a new era of drug discovery.</p>

          <p>This year's A-level results in the UK show a slight increase in top grades (A* or A), with 28.3% of entries achieving this mark. A record number of 18-year-olds secured a place at their first-choice university, with the most selective institutions seeing the steepest growth in acceptances. The results also revealed a widening regional gap in England, with students in London outperforming those in the North East by a significant margin. For the first time since 2018, boys slightly outperformed girls in achieving the highest grades, partly driven by results in popular subjects like mathematics.</p>

          <p>A historical examination reveals the dark connection between the development of the modern birth control pill and horrific medical experiments conducted in Auschwitz. Nazi gynecologist Carl Clauberg subjected hundreds of Jewish women in the concentration camp's infamous Block 10 to non-consensual, torturous sterilization procedures using hormonal compounds. This research, financed by the pharmaceutical company Schering (now part of Bayer), contributed to the scientific understanding of hormones that later enabled the creation of hormonal contraceptives. The article highlights the profound ethical horror of how a tool of female emancipation was partially built upon the unimaginable suffering of Holocaust victims.</p>

          <p>A years-long federal investigation that began with a minor car accident in a small Tennessee town has resulted in the indictment of five leaders and enforcers of Mexico's United Cartels. The initial incident led investigators through wiretaps and surveillance to a major drug distribution network, uncovering a tractor-trailer containing 850 kilograms of methamphetamine. The Justice Department has now unsealed charges against top cartel figures, including leader Juan José Farías Álvarez, and is offering multimillion-dollar rewards for their capture. The case illustrates the direct link between violent international cartels and drug trafficking in local American communities.</p>

          <p>Rabbits with startling, horn-like growths spotted in Fort Collins, Colorado, are not a cause for alarm, according to wildlife officials. The animals are infected with the Shope papillomavirus, a common disease that causes keratinous warts to grow on their heads and faces. While visually grotesque, the virus is typically harmless to the rabbits unless the growths interfere with their ability to see or eat. The virus does not spread to humans or other animals, and it is believed to be the origin of the mythical "jackalope" folklore in North America.</p>

The article points to the administration's recent decision to allow the sale of certain advanced AI chips to China, a reversal of previous export controls, in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenue. Critics, including former Trump administration officials, warn this is a strategic misstep that endangers America's technological edge.
