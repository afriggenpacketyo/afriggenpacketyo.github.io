        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) projects that U.S. economic growth will decelerate to 1.6% this year, a significant drop from last year's 2.8%. This slowdown is attributed to President Trump's trade policies, which disrupt global commerce and increase costs for businesses and consumers. The OECD also forecasts a further slowdown to 1.5% in 2026, noting that Trump's tariffs have raised average U.S. tariff rates to the highest level since 1938. World economic growth is expected to slow to 2.9% this year and remain there in 2026, impacting business and consumer confidence negatively (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>An independent review of the water sector in England and Wales has revealed significant failures, calling for stronger regulation to protect billpayers and the environment. Led by former Bank of England deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, the review cited pollution, financial mismanagement, and infrastructure failures as key issues shaking public trust. The commission emphasized the need for clearer government direction, better long-term investment, and a stronger voice for local communities. The government has ruled out nationalizing the sector, instead focusing on reforms to improve the existing system.</p>

          <p>According to Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health, at least 27 people were killed and over 90 injured in a shooting by Israeli forces near a humanitarian aid distribution center in the southern Gaza Strip. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) acknowledged the shooting, stating that their forces identified suspects moving towards them and fired warning shots before firing additional shots near the individuals. The IDF is investigating the incident and maintains that it allows the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) to operate independently in distributing aid. The GHF confirmed that aid distribution was conducted safely at their site but acknowledged an IDF investigation into injuries beyond the designated safe corridor.</p>

          <p>Many popular holiday destinations are grappling with the environmental impact of excessive visitor numbers, a phenomenon known as overtourism. This issue strains infrastructure, depletes local resources, and alters landscapes, disrupting local flora and fauna. The surge in visitors leads to problems like noise, littering, and traffic jams, while increased water consumption and wastewater discharge threaten water resources and ecosystems. Emissions from tourism, particularly air travel, contribute significantly to the climate crisis, prompting cities and regions to implement measures such as limiting visitor numbers, imposing taxes, and promoting attractions outside city centers.</p>

          <p>The Fresno County Sheriff's Office significantly increased its transfers of individuals to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in 2024, transferring 102 people, more than double the 39 transfers in 2023. Sheriff John Zanoni stated that all 102 individuals were charged with felonies, including crimes against persons, property, and sexual offenses. Zanoni has criticized Senate Bill 54, arguing that the lack of communication with ICE poses a public safety concern. Supervisor Luis ChÃ¡vez emphasized that immigrants who commit crimes represent a small percentage of the overall population and that the county does not inquire about the immigration status of those reporting crimes.</p>

          <p>Thames Water's future is in jeopardy after KKR, a US private equity firm, withdrew from plans to invest Â£4bn into the UK's largest water company. This setback increases the likelihood of the company collapsing into government-supervised administration. KKR's decision was influenced by the politicization of the water industry, making it unattractive for investors. Thames Water, serving a quarter of the UK's population, will continue to work on an alternative plan with its lenders, aiming to raise equity and avoid government takeover. An independent review highlighted the need for regulatory reform to attract long-term investors.</p>

          <p>Train services between Glasgow and London faced significant disruptions due to a fallen tree damaging overhead electric lines in southern Scotland.

Passengers holding tickets were advised to use alternative services on the east coast rail line at no extra cost or to request a refund, while Network Rail Scotland worked to repair the damaged lines with the goal of reopening the line by 11:30.</p>

          <p>The Dutch coalition government, led by Prime Minister Dick Schoof, collapsed after Geert Wilders, leader of the far-right PVV party, withdrew his party due to disagreements over immigration policy. Wilders expressed frustration with the slow progress in implementing his proposed strict immigration measures, including border closures for asylum-seekers and deporting dual nationals convicted of crimes. Political experts suggested that Wilders may have intentionally created a crisis to collapse the government.

          <p>Red Bull made two critical mistakes during the Spanish Grand Prix, according to post-race analysis. The first error involved ordering Max Verstappen to cede his position to George Russell after an incident in Turn One, a decision influenced by concerns over potential penalties. The stewards later ruled that no further action was necessary, suggesting Verstappen could have justifiably maintained his position. The second mistake was pitting Verstappen for fresh hard tires under the safety car, a move Verstappen questioned and which Horner admitted was incorrect, as he should have stayed out on his soft tires.</p>

          <p>Politicians often operate with a degree of shamelessness, justifying changes in their positions to navigate political pressures. This can involve offering explanations that are known to be insincere, a common aspect of political flexibility.

This willingness to adapt allows him to maintain viability and appeal to a broad range of voters, who appreciate his willingness to challenge established institutions while also accepting checks on his power.</p>

          <p>Beijing has expressed increasing concern over the intense price wars among carmakers in China, warning of potential threats to product quality and the industry's long-term development. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and state media have criticized the discounts offered by manufacturers as "involutionary" competition. This excessive competition is seen as hindering companies' investments in research and development, which could ultimately affect product quality and service levels. The People's Daily highlighted the shrinking profit margins in the carmaking sector due to overcapacity.</p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has further reduced its economic growth forecasts for the U.S. due to the impact of President Trump's tariff policies. The U.S. growth outlook was revised down to 1.6% this year and 1.5% in 2026, citing the fallout from tariffs, economic policy uncertainty, a slowdown in net immigration, and a smaller federal workforce. Global growth is also expected to be lower than previously forecast, with the slowdown concentrated in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Frequent changes regarding tariffs have led to uncertainty in global markets and economies (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Japan, known for its cleanliness, presents a puzzling situation for tourists due to the scarcity of public trash cans. This lack of trash cans is a frequent complaint among visitors, with many struggling to find places to dispose of their garbage. The absence of public bins is partly due to Japanese etiquette, where eating while walking is frowned upon, and people typically take their trash home. However, the increase in tourism has exacerbated the issue, leading some cities to reconsider their policies and install bins in high-traffic areas.</p>

While Tesla has engaged in several rounds of negotiations to enter the Indian market, analysts suggest that the Indian EV market may not be mature enough for Tesla to invest locally.</p>
