          <p>Nike announced that its fourth-quarter sales and profits fell significantly as it implements a major turnaround plan. The company beat low Wall Street expectations but warned of new challenges, including an estimated $1 billion impact from new tariffs in the current fiscal year. To mitigate these costs, Nike plans to further reduce its manufacturing presence in China, adjust its supply chain, and implement price increases. Despite a drop in digital and wholesale revenue, sales at Nike's physical stores saw a slight increase, signaling some positive signs amid the difficult restructuring period.

          <p>Construction is underway in Florida's Big Cypress National Preserve for a controversial migrant detention facility dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." The project, championed by Governor Ron DeSantis, will use federal emergency funds to house up to 1,000 people in tents. The plan has drawn fierce opposition from activists, who criticize the use of hurricane relief funds and the inhumane conditions. Additionally, the Miccosukee and Seminole tribes are protesting the construction on their sacred ancestral homelands, arguing that the area is a vital part of their cultural heritage and not an uninhabited wasteland.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old lifeguard in Asbury Park, New Jersey, is recovering after being impaled by a beach umbrella pole in a bizarre accident. The teen, identified only as Alex, was attempting to secure the umbrella when a gust of wind pulled her off the lifeguard stand, causing her to land on the pole which went through her armpit. Remarkably, the pole missed all major arteries and nerves by a fraction of a centimeter. First responders had to use a bandsaw to shorten the pole for transport, and throughout the ordeal, Alex remained surprisingly calm, a trait her colleagues attributed to her lifeguard training.</p>

          <p>For the first time since its launch, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has directly imaged a potential new planet outside our solar system. The exoplanet, named TWA 7b, is believed to be a gas giant with a mass similar to Saturn's, orbiting a young star. Scientists utilized a high-contrast imaging technique with a coronagraph, which blocks the star's bright light to reveal fainter nearby objects. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, researchers state that the evidence strongly suggests it is a newly discovered planet, marking a significant achievement for the telescope.</p>

Mamdani's win over a more established, moderate candidate highlights the party's ideological divide between its progressive and centrist wings. His campaign, focused on affordability with proposals like free childcare and rent freezes, energised younger voters, raising questions about whether his playbook represents a viable path forward for Democrats nationally.

After a judge ordered his return to the U.S., he was immediately jailed on separate federal smuggling charges in Tennessee, creating a convoluted legal situation where he faces both criminal prosecution and new deportation proceedings.</p>

However, the extent of the damage to the deeply buried enrichment halls at Fordo and Natanz remains difficult to confirm.

An analyst from the Asia Society Policy Institute argued that President Trump's aggressive tariff policies are accelerating this trend. The discussion highlighted China's active efforts to establish its own financial sphere centered on the yuan. Panelists suggested that factors like U.S. economic mismanagement and the rise of alternative payment systems are creating an opening for the yuan to become a more significant global currency, potentially surpassing the euro as an alternative to the dollar.</p>

          <p>The sexual abuse scandal at the now-shuttered Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, California, has widened with charges against two more former officers. Jeffrey Wilson and Lawrence Gacad are the ninth and tenth individuals to be charged in connection with the facility, which inmates and staff reportedly called the "rape club." Wilson faces five counts of sexual abuse of an inmate, while Gacad is charged with one count of abusive sexual contact. The ongoing investigation has exposed a rampant culture of abuse at the all-female prison, leading to multiple convictions and a massive settlement with victims.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has pushed back against U.S. Treasury sanctions imposed on three Mexican financial institutions accused of laundering money for fentanyl traffickers. Sheinbaum stated that the U.S. has provided "just words" and no concrete proof, asserting that Mexico is not subordinate to any country. The sanctions against CiBanco, Intercam Banco, and Vector Casa de Bolsa effectively cut them off from the U.S. financial system. The move is part of the Trump administration's effort to combat drug cartels, but it has created significant diplomatic friction with the Mexican government.</p>

The defense rested its case without calling any witnesses, and Combs himself chose not to testify.

          <p>The UK government is reportedly preparing to climb down on its controversial welfare reform bill to avoid a significant parliamentary defeat. Following pressure from a large group of over 100 rebel Labour MPs, ministers are expected to announce a deal where planned cuts to disability benefits will only apply to future claimants, not existing ones. The proposed legislation, which aims to save Â£5 billion annually, has been heavily criticized. This expected U-turn represents a major concession from the government and marks another blow to the prime minister's authority after several recent policy reversals.</p>

A barbecue for ten people is estimated to cost $90.06 in the Golden State, well above the national average of $70.92. Staples like ground beef, chicken, and hamburger buns are all more expensive in California. The report attributes the higher prices to a combination of factors, including inflation, lower availability of some food items, and the impact of Trump administration tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and Canada.</p>
