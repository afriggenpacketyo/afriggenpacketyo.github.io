          <p>President Trump departed the G7 summit early, citing more pressing matters than mediating a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, urging civilians to evacuate Tehran. G7 leaders affirmed their support for Israel while calling for de-escalation and condemned Iran for regional instability. Israel claimed to have eliminated a top Iranian military commander, further escalating tensions, while China advocated for a peaceful resolution. The G7 also addressed Trump's tariff policies and their impact on global economic growth. This article details the international response to the ongoing conflict.

          <p>A group of House Democrats from New York are claiming that President Trump's proposed budget cuts to homeland security grants would leave New York City vulnerable to terror attacks. They argue that these cuts would significantly reduce the FDNY's emergency management capabilities and the NYPD's counterterrorism efforts. The White House budget proposal aims to cut $163 billion in non-defense discretionary spending. However, a DHS spokesperson refuted the claims, stating that the department remains dedicated to preventing another 9/11 with targeted investments.

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is monitoring the construction of a new facility at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear complex, which resembles a known uranium enrichment site. Analysts suggest that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un views an increased atomic weapons capability as crucial for regime survival. A study estimates North Korea has assembled approximately 50 nuclear warheads and has sufficient fissile material to produce up to 90. While some analysts interpret this as a sign of wanting to negotiate, others fear it could lead to regional proliferation and increased tensions.
