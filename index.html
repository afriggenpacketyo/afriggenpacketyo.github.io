          <p>Eric 'Butterbean' Esch, a 58-year-old former boxing champion, has announced he is returning for one more fight and has publicly challenged Jake Paul. In a commercial, Esch, who has overcome significant health issues that once left him in a wheelchair, criticized Paul for fighting retired opponents and stated he wants the match because Paul "runs his damn mouth too much." The challenge comes as Paul continues to build his boxing career, recently securing a unanimous decision victory over Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. This unusual call-out adds another unique chapter to Paul's unconventional journey in the sport.</p>

          <p>Senator Mark Warner has criticized the Trump administration for an "outrageous" pressure campaign that led to the resignation of University of Virginia President Jim Ryan. The resignation was reportedly submitted to resolve demands related to a federal investigation into the university's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Warner stated the threat was explicit, with the university facing major funding cuts and other penalties if Ryan did not step down. He warned that this action sets a dangerous precedent, suggesting that if the federal government can interfere with a flagship state university's governance, it could happen anywhere, threatening academic freedom.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has instructed Palestinians to evacuate parts of northern Gaza, including areas in Gaza City and Jabalia, ahead of an intensified military offensive. This comes as the Hamas-run health ministry reported at least 86 fatalities in a 24-hour period, including three children killed in a designated "safe zone." Concurrently, U.S. President Donald Trump is advocating for a ceasefire and hostage release deal, which mediators are trying to broker. The escalating conflict and humanitarian concerns continue as diplomatic efforts to secure a lasting peace and the return of hostages remain stalled.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection, citing frustration with the current political climate in Washington. His decision follows public criticism from President Trump after Tillis opposed the GOP's major tax and spending bill due to its projected financial impact on his state. In his statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and compromise, stating that too many elected officials are motivated by "pure raw politics" rather than the welfare of their constituents. His retirement opens up a competitive race for his Senate seat in the upcoming election.</p>

          <p>An analytical article explores the historical and technical complexities of Battle Damage Assessment (BDA), using the recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities as a contemporary example. It argues that preliminary assessments, like a leaked DIA memo suggesting minimal damage, are often unreliable and that a full picture takes considerable time to develop. The author posits that given the advanced U.S. platforms, precision munitions, and extensive intelligence on the targets, the damage was likely severe and has significantly set back Iran's program. The piece suggests that President Trump's declaration of "obliteration" is likely closer to the truth than the hasty critiques suggest.</p>

          <p>According to a new assessment from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Republican-led Senate's budget bill could result in nearly 12 million Americans losing healthcare coverage. The report also projects the legislation would add almost $3.3 trillion to the national debt, largely through $1 trillion in cuts to healthcare funding for programs like Medicaid. This analysis is complicating efforts to pass President Trump's signature bill, as some Republicans have already voiced concerns over its financial implications. Democrats have strongly criticized the bill, framing it as a plan that provides tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of vulnerable populations. (not investment advice)</p>

In a Fox News interview, Trump stated that a group of "very wealthy people" is prepared to acquire the platform, with more details to be revealed soon. The sale would require approval from the Chinese government, but Trump expressed optimism that President Xi Jinping would consent. This development comes after Trump repeatedly used executive actions to delay the enforcement of a law mandating the sale of TikTok by its parent company, ByteDance.</p>

          <p>In a television interview, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, declared that his country's uranium enrichment activities will "never stop." He asserted that enrichment is an "inalienable right" for Iran under international treaties for peaceful purposes. While stating that Iran is ready for negotiations, Iravani said that the current conditions following recent U.S. military aggression are not suitable for a new round of talks. He also denied any official Iranian threats against the head of the IAEA, despite a call for his execution in a state-affiliated newspaper.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the United States faces a critical vulnerability due to China's overwhelming dominance in the rare earth minerals market. The author contends that for over 15 years, across multiple administrations, the U.S. has failed to address its dependency on China, which controls over 90% of the refining capacity for these essential materials. China's recent export controls are presented as a clear sign of its willingness to weaponize this supply chain. The article calls for a coherent, long-term national strategy to build an independent supply chain to mitigate this significant geopolitical and economic risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Virginia Senator Mark Warner described the Republican's "big, beautiful bill" as a "political albatross" that will harm the party. Speaking on "Face the Nation," he argued that the legislation's cuts to Medicaid and other programs would strip 16 million Americans of healthcare coverage, shut down rural hospitals, and reduce food assistance. Warner asserted that these cuts are being made to fund tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans while adding trillions to the national debt.

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary highlights a significant ideological shift within the party, particularly concerning Israel. As an outspoken critic of Israel's government and a supporter of the BDS movement, his success in America's most Jewish city shows that such a stance is no longer a disqualifier for many Democratic voters. The outcome reflects a growing divide, especially among younger and more progressive voters, who are increasingly dismayed by Israel's conduct in the war in Gaza. This has alarmed some in the Jewish community while being celebrated by others as a rejection of weaponizing the issue.</p>

Key advice includes avoiding walks during the hottest parts of the day, checking pavement temperature with the back of one's hand, and always providing cool water. Signs of heatstroke include heavy panting and lethargy, and if they appear, owners should cool the dog with water immediately and seek veterinary care.</p>

This assessment contrasts with the Trump administration's claims of having "totally obliterated" the program.
