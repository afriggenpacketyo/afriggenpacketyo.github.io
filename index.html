          <p>Bradley Murdoch, the man convicted of murdering British backpacker Peter Falconio in Australia in 2001, has died from cancer while serving a life sentence. Murdoch never revealed the location of Falconio's body, a source of ongoing distress for the victim's family and police, who had hoped for a confession. The case remains one of Australia's most high-profile crimes, drawing international attention and partly inspiring the horror film 'Wolf Creek'. Despite Murdoch's death, authorities maintain a significant reward for any information that leads to the discovery of the remains.</p>

          <p>Beijing has vowed to severely punish those responsible for Taiwan's tightened residency rules affecting mainland-born spouses, calling the policy discriminatory and an abuse of power. Under President Lai Ching-te, Taipei has increased enforcement, requiring mainland spouses who gained residency before 2004 to prove they have renounced their mainland status. A spokesman for Beijing’s Taiwan Affairs Office accused Taiwanese authorities of deliberately suppressing these individuals and furthering a separatist agenda. Those who fail to comply with the new documentation deadline risk having their Taiwanese residency revoked.</p>

          <p>Fears of a new war are growing in Ethiopia's Tigray region, still recovering from a brutal two-year conflict that ended in 2022. Residents report a climate of fear amid troop movements and sporadic clashes, with many stockpiling essentials. Eritrea, which supported Ethiopian forces in the previous war but was absent from peace talks, is seen as a key destabilizing factor, allegedly exploiting internal divisions within the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). Analysts suggest Eritrea benefits from a fragmented Ethiopia and may be supporting armed groups to maintain regional instability.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by a significant outperformance in its trading divisions. The bank's profit increased 22% to $3.72 billion, with revenue climbing 15% to $14.58 billion. The equities trading division was a standout performer, generating $4.3 billion in revenue, a 36% jump from the previous year and well above analyst forecasts. The strong results reflect a favorable market environment for trading desks, spurred by market volatility, and a rebound in investment banking activity.</p>

          <p>A nurse in Scotland, Sandie Peggie, has been cleared of gross misconduct by NHS Fife after she complained about sharing a changing room with a transgender doctor. Peggie was suspended after an incident on Christmas Eve 2023, facing allegations that included misgendering her colleague, Dr. Beth Upton. The internal hearing found insufficient evidence for misconduct, a decision that precedes the resumption of Peggie's employment tribunal case against the health board. The case highlights ongoing legal and social debates in Scotland regarding transgender rights and single-sex spaces, particularly following a recent UK Supreme Court ruling clarifying sex under the Equality Act.</p>

          <p>Bank of America posted mixed financial results for the second quarter, beating profit estimates but falling short on revenue. The company's profit grew approximately 3% to $7.12 billion, while its revenue of $26.61 billion was slightly below analysts' expectations. A key factor was its net interest income (NII), which missed estimates by $70 million, as loan and deposit growth were counteracted by lower interest rates compared to the prior year. Despite the revenue miss, CEO Brian Moynihan highlighted the resilience of consumers and positive momentum in the bank's markets businesses.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues Trump's Deportation Policy is Based on Flawed Economic Assumptions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policy is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the U.S. labor market. The administration's idea that deported undocumented workers can be easily replaced by American citizens, such as those on Medicaid, is described as a "key fiction." Economists and industry leaders argue that many of these immigrants work jobs that Americans are unwilling to do, particularly in agriculture. Mass deportations could therefore lead to severe labor shortages, reduced domestic production, and higher consumer prices, ultimately harming the U.S. economy rather than helping it.</p>

          <p>While welcoming President Trump's announcement of new weapons for Kyiv, Ukrainian officials have expressed concern that his 50-day deadline for a ceasefire could be seen by Russia as a green light to intensify its attacks. An analysis of recent data shows that Russian drone and missile strikes have already been escalating steadily in recent months. Moscow has given a cold response to Trump's ultimatum, with officials calling the demands "unacceptable" and stating their position is "unshakable." The 50-day window has created a period of high tension and uncertainty for Ukraine as it braces for a potential increase in Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>Thai police have arrested a woman who allegedly targeted senior Buddhist monks, luring them into sexual relationships and then extorting them for large sums of money to keep the affairs secret. The scandal has reportedly led to at least nine abbots and senior monks being disrobed for violating their vow of celibacy. The suspect, Wilawan Emsawat, is accused of receiving millions of dollars over three years, which police say was largely spent on online gambling. The case has shaken Buddhist institutions in Thailand and prompted calls for greater transparency in temple finances.</p>

          <p>For the first time in its history, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game was decided by a home run swing-off after the American and National Leagues were tied 6-6. Philadelphia's Kyle Schwarber became the hero for the National League, hitting three home runs on three swings to overcome a deficit and secure the victory. The new tiebreaker rule, implemented in 2022 to avoid exhausting pitching staffs, provided a dramatic conclusion to the game. The exciting finish has sparked discussion about whether the format could be used in other contexts, such as regular season games.</p>

A fourth suspect from the Bahamas was injured and arrested. The seizure is a rare success for law enforcement in the troubled nation, which has long been identified by the U.S. as a major transit hub for illicit drugs.</p>

          <p>The UK has lifted a five-year ban on Pakistani airlines, allowing them to apply to resume direct flights after determining that Pakistan has made significant improvements to its aviation safety standards. The ban was first imposed in 2020 following a scandal involving fraudulent pilot licenses, which emerged after a fatal Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) crash. The decision follows a similar move by the European Union earlier this year and is expected to provide a major boost to PIA.

          <p>President Trump's efforts to direct millions of dollars, including a Boeing 747 from Qatar and large legal settlements, to his future presidential library are drawing criticism and calls for reform. Senate Democrats are introducing a bill to regulate such fundraising, citing concerns that donations from special interests could be a way to seek favor from a sitting president. Currently, fundraising for presidential libraries is largely unregulated and opaque, with no limits on contributions or requirements for public disclosure. Critics argue this lack of transparency creates the appearance of impropriety and a potential for corruption.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using Africa as a testing ground for the global rollout of its currency, the yuan. During a recent visit to Egypt, Chinese and Egyptian central banks signed agreements to promote the yuan in trade and investment, including expanding China's UnionPay services and facilitating cross-border payments through CIPS, China's alternative to the SWIFT network. Egypt is the latest African nation to establish yuan-based deals with China, joining countries like South Africa and Nigeria.

One perspective, from Beth Miller of Jewish Voice for Peace Action, argues that many progressive Jews strongly support Mamdani for his focus on local issues and his belief in Palestinian human rights. The opposing view, from Jo-Ann Mort, expresses concern over Mamdani's support for the BDS movement and his refusal to condemn certain protest chants, which she argues instills fear.

By siding with his administration's decision not to release documents and telling his followers to move on, Trump is seen as betraying this populist cause.

          <p>Luxury group Richemont, owner of Cartier, reported a 6% rise in quarterly sales, slightly beating analyst forecasts. However, the results were weighed down by a 15% sales decline in Japan, where a currency-fueled spending boom by tourists has abated. A recent strengthening of the Japanese yen has reduced the purchasing power of international visitors, particularly from China, who had flocked to the country for luxury bargains. Despite the slowdown in Japan, Richemont's high-end jewelry brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels continued to show strong growth, helping the company outperform a wider luxury market downturn.</p>
