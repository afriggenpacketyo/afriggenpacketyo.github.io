          <p>The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) has informed its foreign partners that it anticipates the C929, China's domestically developed widebody passenger jet, will commence its maiden commercial flight by 2035. This timeline, although more extended than prior projections, aligns with the development timelines of Boeing and Airbus for their initial widebody aircraft. Comac expects the C929, resembling the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 series, to receive certification in China by 2032. The C929, designed to accommodate up to 440 passengers, will feature a maximum range of 12,000km, approximately the distance between Shanghai and New York, marking a significant advancement in China's aviation industry.</p>

          <p>Iran experienced a nationwide internet blackout for over 12 hours, as reported by NetBlocks, a cybersecurity and internet access monitoring organization based in London. This disruption occurred amidst escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, which included Israeli airstrikes targeting military sites in Tehran. Iranian officials attributed the restrictions to Israel's alleged misuse of national communications networks for military purposes, which jeopardized the safety of civilians and property. The Israeli military confirmed that its air force was conducting strikes on military targets within Tehran, further exacerbating the situation.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda are scheduled to sign a peace agreement on June 27, facilitated by the United States, aiming to resolve the conflict in eastern Congo. Technical teams from both countries have already begun drafting the agreement, which is expected to be formally signed in Washington next week, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio attending the ceremony. The peace deal seeks to end the fighting in eastern Congo, where Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have made significant advances, capturing key cities, and includes provisions for respecting territorial integrity, ceasing hostilities, disarming, and integrating non-state armed groups. Previous ceasefires have failed, but the US hopes this agreement will bring stability and economic opportunities to the mineral-rich region.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran has led to a significant increase in shipping insurance costs for vessels navigating the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Marine insurers are now charging 0.2% of a ship's value for voyages into the Gulf, up from 0.125% before Israel's recent attack on Iran, according to data from Marsh McLennan. War risk insurance rates for the Red Sea have also risen, and coverage for ports in Israel has more than tripled to 0.7%. The reassessment of shipping insurance costs reflects the deteriorating security environment in the Middle East, raising concerns about a broader conflict and potential U.S. intervention.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is navigating a delicate situation regarding U.S. tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, as he aims to prioritize "Japan first" ahead of crucial national elections. Despite high-stakes meetings with Trump, Ishiba has not secured a deal on tariffs, particularly on autos, which are vital to Japan's export-driven economy. The Prime Minister is wary of appearing to concede to Trump's "America First" agenda, while also striving to set a precedent that tariff negotiations can benefit both countries without compromising Japan's commitment to multilateral free trade arrangements. The outcome of these negotiations will significantly impact Japan's economic and diplomatic standing.</p>

          <p>Analysts are voicing concerns about the rapid pace at which Donald Trump's administration is allegedly moving towards authoritarianism. They cite examples such as the arrest of opposition politicians, the deployment of the military against protesters, and discussions about suspending habeas corpus. Some experts argue that Trump is implementing authoritarian measures more aggressively than leaders like Hugo Chávez, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, or Vladimir Putin. These actions have led to a decline in the U.S.'s democracy score, raising fears about the future of American institutions and freedoms.</p>

Critics argue that the policy, while aimed at easing financial burdens, lacks adequate support for struggling public schools facing declining enrollment and budget shortfalls. The policy could pressure public schools to attract more applicants without providing the necessary resources to compete with private schools on an equal footing.

          <p>Hundreds gathered outside Minnesota’s Capitol for a vigil to honor former House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were fatally shot at their home. The vigil included a Native American drum circle, a string quartet, and the singing of “Amazing Grace,” with attendees laying flowers and notes at a memorial. The man charged with the killings, Vance Boelter, is also accused of shooting another Democratic lawmaker and his wife, who survived. The event served as a moment of community mourning and remembrance for the Hortmans, who were remembered for their dedication to public service.</p>

This discovery sheds light on the affluence of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London," and suggests the presence of skilled artists who traveled the Roman empire. The team hopes to find a missing fragment bearing the artist's name, which is crucial to understanding the rich Roman history of the UK.</p>

Refusal to grant access to social media accounts may result in visa rejection, raising concerns about privacy and freedom of expression.

Despite the repressive nature of the Iranian regime, attempts to overthrow it could lead to enduring troubles and miseries for ordinary Iranians. Kettle argues that regime destruction does not guarantee successful regime change, citing the lessons of Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. A defeated Iran could result in civic instability and a weakened but still significant state, making a replaced regime as likely as a replaced one.</p>

          <p>China has urged the US to "look at the whole picture" regarding tariffs to understand the true nature of their trade ties, as a recently agreed framework to ease trade tensions remains uncertain. Chinese ambassador Xie Feng stated that the trade relationship is "generally balanced" and that tariffs on Chinese imports are "still unreasonably high." He argued that the US goods deficit would not shrink as long as export controls, visa denials, and barriers to Chinese firms persist. China has expressed a willingness to buy more from America, but notes that US restrictions on exports and investment hinder progress.</p>
