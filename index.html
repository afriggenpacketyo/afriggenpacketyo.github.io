            <p>The RSPB reports a concerning decline in starling sightings in UK gardens, marking the lowest numbers since their survey began in 1979. Starlings, once common garden visitors, have experienced a sharp population decrease since the 1960s, despite their known spectacular winter acrobatics. The conservation charity urges individuals to take small actions like avoiding pesticides and providing nest boxes to aid starlings and other garden wildlife. The RSPB also emphasizes the need for governments and businesses to join the effort to restore the natural world.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court upheld a lower court order requiring the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador.

The ruling acknowledged the Executive Branch's deference in foreign affairs. Abrego Garcia's lawyer stated that the rule of law prevailed, while the Justice Department emphasized the President's exclusive prerogative in conducting foreign affairs.</p>

            <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.4% in March, indicating progress in the Federal Reserve's efforts to bring inflation down to 2%. The CPI was forecast to rise 2.6% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. Inflation eased due to lower fuel prices and travel-related costs. However, experts warn that President Trump's tariffs could still lead to higher inflation later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Sony has won the distribution rights to "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!," after a court rejected CBS's bid to block Sony from taking over. Sony had accused CBS of unauthorized licensing agreements, including licensing the shows at below-market rates. CBS plans to appeal the ruling, while Sony expresses satisfaction with the court's decision. The two iconic game shows were created by Merv Griffin and debuted in 1975.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador's notorious mega-jail. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who entered the US illegally as a teenager, was granted protection from deportation in 2019 due to the risk of persecution in El Salvador. The government claims Garcia was deported due to an "administrative error," but also alleges he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his lawyer denies.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled on the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported to El Salvador despite a court order forbidding it. The Court ordered the Trump administration to "facilitate" Abrego Garcia's release, but stopped short of requiring the administration to "effectuate" his return. The decision suggests the Court is open to the possibility that the administration will request Abrego Garcia's release, but may not be able to force the Salvadoran government to comply.</p>
