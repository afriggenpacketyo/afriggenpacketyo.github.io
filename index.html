          <p>China's economy showed signs of faltering in July as key indicators missed forecasts. Retail sales grew by 3.7%, falling short of the expected 4.6%, while industrial output rose 5.7%, also below expectations. The slowdown is attributed to weak domestic demand, a challenging external environment, and extreme weather events that disrupted operations. Analysts note that the contractionary effects of Beijing's policies to curb overproduction may be starting to show, raising concerns about achieving the annual growth target without new policy support.

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, currently in the eastern Atlantic, is forecast to intensify and become the season's first hurricane by Friday. The U.S. National Hurricane Center predicts it could escalate into a major hurricane with winds over 111 mph by the weekend as it approaches the Caribbean's northern Leeward Islands. While it does not pose an immediate threat to the U.S. mainland, its long-term path remains uncertain. The storm has already caused deadly flooding in the Cabo Verde islands off the African coast.</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have issued new guidelines for managing high blood pressure, recommending a more aggressive and earlier approach to treatment. The updated advice suggests that individuals with systolic pressure between 130-139 should first try lifestyle changes, with medication considered if there is no improvement after three to six months. Notably, the guidelines now recommend complete abstinence from alcohol, a shift from previous advice that permitted moderate consumption, citing mounting evidence of its negative impact on blood pressure.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, has formally requested that the prime minister allow his party to appoint peers to the House of Lords. In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer, Farage argued that the current composition of the upper chamber is democratically imbalanced, pointing out that parties with fewer votes and MPs have representation while Reform UK has none. He highlighted his party's significant vote share in the last general election and recent local election successes to justify the need for representation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly increased federal control over Washington D.C. by appointing DEA head Terry Cole as the city's "emergency police commissioner," effectively superseding the local police chief. Attorney General Pam Bondi's directive requires the Metropolitan Police Department to seek federal approval for all orders. This move is part of a broader federal law-enforcement takeover in the capital, justified by the administration as a response to crime and disorder, and includes the deployment of National Guard troops throughout the city.</p>

This event occurs amidst a wider crackdown on dissent, with analysts suggesting the arrests may be a tactic to intimidate opponents rather than a response to a legitimate coup.

          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled a new high-speed jet drone with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities. This innovation could effectively turn any warship, such as a destroyer or frigate, into a functional aircraft carrier without the need for a runway. The uncrewed aircraft is designed to launch from ship decks, even in rough seas, and then transition to fast, long-range flight. According to the project team, the drone's performance, particularly its speed, is far superior to other mainstream VTOL drones currently in use, representing a significant potential advancement in naval aviation.</p>

          <p>President Trump expressed confidence in the U.S. economy's performance when asked about Latin American nations looking to China for economic partnerships. He asserted that the U.S. is "blowing everyone away, including China," and suggested that the countries turning to Beijing are not performing well economically. His comments were made as Brazil increases its coordination with China to develop a multilateral response to U.S. tariffs imposed in late July. The tariffs have threatened billions of dollars in trade between the U.S. and Brazil, pushing the South American nation to seek other alliances.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department will seek the death penalty for Teresa Youngblut, a 21-year-old woman accused of murdering a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Vermont. A grand jury indicted Youngblut on a murder charge for the fatal shooting of Agent David Maland during a traffic stop in January. The incident, which also resulted in the death of Youngblut's companion, occurred after the pair had been under surveillance. Authorities have reportedly linked the shooting to the Zizians, a cultlike group associated with several deaths across three states.</p>

          <p>As students in Los Angeles return to school, immigrant families report living in a state of heightened fear due to increased immigration enforcement activity in the area. Some undocumented parents are considering keeping their children home from school to avoid potential separation during raids. In response, the L.A. Unified School District has established "safe zones" around 100 schools in largely Latino areas to monitor for federal activity. The climate of fear has been exacerbated by recent incidents, including the mistaken detention of a 15-year-old student outside his high school.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by ConsumerAffairs has ranked Oregon as the fourth-worst state to move to in 2025, citing significant challenges in affordability, safety, and the economy. The state also scored poorly for its access to healthcare and education, and was noted for its high vulnerability to environmental risks like wildfires and drought. In contrast, neighboring Washington was ranked the 35th best state, outperforming Oregon in several key metrics. The report suggests these factors are driving relocation decisions and present a challenge for Oregon in attracting and retaining residents.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll found that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, believe that expectations for tipping have grown in recent years. For many, tipping is seen as a way to show appreciation or supplement service workers' income, but a significant portion views it as an added cost. The sentiment that tipping is becoming more prevalent was generally viewed negatively by respondents. This feeling may be linked to broader concerns about rising prices and costs that have been a consistent theme in public opinion over the past few years.</p>

This campaign addresses growing concerns over Britons traveling overseas for cheaper cosmetic procedures like hair implants and dental work, which can lead to life-altering injuries and botched results. The influencers will advise viewers to consult a UK doctor, secure proper travel insurance, and avoid package deals that include surgery. The initiative aims to help people make more informed and safer choices, reducing the burden on the NHS to fix procedures gone wrong.</p>
