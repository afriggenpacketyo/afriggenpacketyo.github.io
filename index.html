          <p>Authorities are investigating the collision of a Mexican tall ship, the Cuauhtémoc, with the Brooklyn Bridge, an accident that resulted in the deaths of two people and injuries to at least 19 others. The incident occurred as the ship was departing for Iceland when it reportedly lost power and drifted backward, causing its masts to strike the bridge. Senator Schumer has raised concerns about potential Coast Guard operational issues and staffing shortages that may have contributed to the accident, while the Coast Guard asserts its vehicle traffic service was fully functional. New Yorkers gathered for a vigil to honor the victims and support their families amidst the ongoing investigation by the NTSB.</p>

          <p>The House Budget Committee advanced President Trump's domestic policy bill after negotiations addressed concerns from conservative Republicans who initially stalled the legislation due to insufficient spending cuts. The bill, which extends tax cuts from Trump's first term and increases military and border security spending, faces further hurdles in the Rules Committee and potential opposition in the Senate. Key points of contention include work requirements for Medicaid recipients and the elimination of clean energy subsidies implemented under the Inflation Reduction Act. Speaker Johnson remains committed to bringing the legislation to a floor vote before Memorial Day, despite ongoing disagreements within the party.</p>

          <p>Top officials from the European Union and Britain are meeting in London to establish a new defense and security partnership, signaling a major reset in relations post-Brexit. The agreement aims to foster military cooperation and address geopolitical issues, particularly in light of Russia's war in Ukraine and the United States' evolving role in global security. Key points of discussion include trade, immigration, and the potential for Britain to participate in European defense initiatives. While challenges remain regarding fishing access and youth mobility schemes, both sides recognize the need for stronger collaboration in a world where the United States is a less reliable ally.</p>

          <p>Satellite imagery reveals that Russian forces are expanding military bases and infrastructure near the Finnish border, a move that NATO officials are closely monitoring. The expansion includes new tents, warehouses for military vehicles, renovated fighter jet shelters, and construction on a helicopter base. While Russia's troop presence along the border remains limited due to its involvement in the Ukraine war, Finland anticipates a significant increase in Russian forces within the next five years. This military buildup reflects Moscow's perception of a threat from NATO expansion and could potentially turn the Arctic Circle into a future hot spot.</p>

          <p>The FBI has identified 25-year-old Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing, who is believed to have died in the explosion. Bartkus, who had nihilistic beliefs and opposed bringing people into the world against their will, is suspected of using a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device in the attack. The explosion injured four others and caused extensive damage to surrounding buildings, leading authorities to investigate the incident as an act of terrorism. All embryos stored at the fertility clinic were successfully saved, and the clinic plans to reopen at a temporary location, emphasizing their commitment to helping families despite the devastating event.</p>

However, recent advances in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer have significantly improved survival rates for men with advanced disease. Treatments such as cutting off testosterone and using androgen blockers, along with improvements in diagnosis through PSMA PET scans, offer hope for patients like Mr. Biden. Federal research funding, particularly through Mr. Biden’s cancer moonshot effort, has contributed to this progress.</p>

          <p>At least two people were killed and one person is missing after a train struck multiple pedestrians in Fremont, Ohio, on Sunday night. The incident occurred near the Sandusky River, where the search for the missing person is focused. Witnesses reported that the train sounded its horn continuously before the incident, and some people appeared to have jumped into the water from the train trestle. The victims were reportedly crossing the trestle to reach the other side, despite a no trespassing sign being present.</p>

          <p>China's economy showed resilience in April despite the impact of high US tariffs, with industrial output growing by 6.1% and retail sales rising by 5.1%. These figures were observed during the period when triple-digit tariffs were in full effect before Washington and Beijing agreed to remove or pause most of the duties. The Chinese government has vowed to stabilize employment, businesses, markets, and expectations in response to global trade uncertainties. The Politburo, a high-level political body, affirmed the need to shore up domestic consumption in an environment where the future of global trade is less than certain.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is facing increasing criticism for accepting a $400 million luxury plane from Qatar, with both Democrats and some Republicans questioning the propriety of the gift. Critics argue that the gift is a form of corruption and contradicts Trump's promise to "drain the swamp." Trump has defended the gift, claiming it was for the U.S. and not for him personally, a claim disputed by Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. Meanwhile, lawyers are challenging the Trump administration's efforts to cut funding and punish civil servants.</p>

          <p>Former US President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The cancer is an aggressive form of the disease, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 out of 10. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options, and his office noted that the cancer is hormone-sensitive, meaning it could likely be managed. President Donald Trump and former Vice-President Kamala Harris have expressed their support, along with Barack Obama, who tasked Biden with leading a "cancer moonshot" government-wide research program in 2016.</p>
