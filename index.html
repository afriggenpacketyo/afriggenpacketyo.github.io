          <h2>Kerr County's Flood Warning System Project Was Scheduled to Start After Catastrophic Flooding Occurred</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 17:13:19 EDT</div>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, confirmed that a contract for a new flood warning system was finalized just last month, with a project kickoff meeting planned for mid-July. The system, intended as a decision-support tool for emergency managers, was not designed to issue public alerts but would have provided real-time data on rainfall and streamflow. Following the recent catastrophic floods that resulted in over 100 fatalities, the timeline for implementing this long-advocated-for technology is now being reevaluated. The delayed implementation highlights a critical gap in the region's emergency preparedness infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has announced his intention to impose a 50% tariff on all goods imported from Brazil, escalating a trade dispute with the South American nation. In a social media post, he cited Brazil's alleged "attacks" on U.S. technology companies and what he termed a "witch hunt" against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro as justification for the punitive measure. This move follows a public disagreement with current Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who has asserted that Brazil will not tolerate foreign interference in its judicial processes concerning Bolsonaro.</p>

          <p>Sir Jake Berry, a former chairman of the Conservative Party and a Member of Parliament until 2024, has announced his defection to Reform UK. He becomes the second former Tory Cabinet minister to join Nigel Farage's party this week, citing a belief that "Old Westminster politics has failed" and that both the Conservative and Labour parties are to blame for Britain's problems. Berry, a close ally of Boris Johnson, criticized the current tax system and lack of control over immigration. His move signals growing momentum for Reform UK and further fractures within the Conservative party.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose significant new tariffs on at least 20 countries, extending a previous deadline from July 9 to August 1, 2025. The proposed levies vary by country, with nations like Myanmar and Laos facing rates as high as 40%, while key partners such as Japan and South Korea face 25% tariffs. The White House stated that these countries must reach preliminary trade deals with the U.S. by the new deadline to avoid the duties. Economists warn these widespread tariffs could reignite inflation and disrupt global trade, while the administration argues they will protect American manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Kevin O'Connor, who served as President Joe Biden's White House physician, declined to answer questions during a closed-door interview with the House Oversight Committee, citing physician-patient privilege and his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The Republican-led committee had subpoenaed O'Connor as part of its investigation into Biden's mental fitness and the alleged use of an autopen while he was in office. Committee Chairman James Comer called the move unprecedented and suggested it fuels speculation of a cover-up. The investigation continues, with other former Biden aides scheduled for interviews.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has recommended loosening mortgage lending regulations, a move that could provide greater access to financing for first-time buyers in the UK. The bank's Financial Stability Report suggests allowing individual lenders to issue a higher percentage of new mortgages with loan-to-income ratios exceeding 4.5. Lenders like Nationwide welcomed the change, stating it will help aspiring homeowners who struggle with saving for a deposit due to high rent and living costs. This policy shift, which could create up to 36,000 new mortgages annually, follows a government call for regulators to find ways to stimulate economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Medical professionals are expressing alarm that the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in hospitals and other healthcare settings is creating an atmosphere of fear, causing some undocumented immigrants to delay or avoid necessary medical care. While ICE agents are required to bring detainees for medical services, doctors report that their presence can be intimidating and may lead to negative health outcomes for the wider community. An emergency physician in Los Angeles alleged ethics violations, including interference with patient privacy. In response, some hospitals are now providing staff with guidance on how to interact with federal law enforcement to protect patient rights.</p>

          <p>Linda Yaccarino has announced her departure as the CEO of X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, after a two-year tenure. Her time at the company was marked by efforts to repair relationships with advertisers who had fled the platform, then known as Twitter, following Musk's takeover. However, many analysts viewed her role as limited, with Musk remaining the ultimate decision-maker and public face of the company. Her exit comes amid ongoing controversies at X, including issues with its AI chatbot, and follows the recent merger of the platform with Musk's artificial intelligence venture, xAI.</p>

          <p>Indirect negotiations in Qatar between Israel and Hamas for a new ceasefire and hostage release deal have reportedly stalled after three days. A Palestinian official indicated that key disagreements remain over the unrestricted distribution of humanitarian aid and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Despite a recent meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump, where both expressed a desire for a deal, significant obstacles persist. Hamas described the talks as "tough" due to what it called Israel's "intransigence," dimming hopes for an imminent breakthrough in the 21-month-long conflict.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has secured guilty pleas from two individuals, Tina Brown Cooper and Ronnie Jay Oxendine, for their roles in selling the rifle allegedly used in the assassination attempt on President Trump. Court documents state they sold an SKS rifle to Ryan Routh for $350 in a cash deal arranged in North Carolina, knowing he was a convicted felon prohibited from owning firearms. This same rifle was allegedly found with Routh when he was arrested outside Trump's Florida golf club six weeks later. The charges provide new details on how Routh acquired the weapon for his alleged plot.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to lift a lower court's injunction against a controversial Florida law that criminalizes the entry of undocumented immigrants into the state. This decision means the law, passed by the Republican-controlled legislature, cannot be enforced while the ongoing legal challenge proceeds. A federal judge had previously blocked the law, ruling that it likely infringes upon the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration policy. The law, challenged by the ACLU, imposes mandatory prison sentences and has been criticized as unconstitutional and cruel by immigrant advocacy groups.</p>

          <p>Turkey's media regulator, RTÜK, has imposed a 10-day broadcasting ban on two of the country's largest government-critical television stations, Sözcü TV and Halk TV, accusing them of "incitement of the people." This move is seen by observers as a new escalation in the government's long-running suppression of press freedom, where over 95% of media is already considered pro-government. The bans, which also carry significant economic consequences due to lost advertising revenue, come at a politically tense time in Turkey. Critics, including opposition politicians and international rapporteurs, have condemned the decision as an attempt to silence the last remaining critical voices.</p>

          <p>In a first-of-its-kind move, the Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino, California, has issued a formal dispensation lifting the obligation for parishioners to attend Mass if they fear immigration enforcement actions. The decision by Bishop Alberto Rojas came after ICE agents reportedly carried out detentions on two church properties in June, creating "a tremendous amount of fear, confusion and anxiety." The bishop called on officials to cease tactics that disrespect human dignity. This action reflects the growing concern among religious leaders nationwide about the impact of the Trump administration's immigration policies on their communities.</p>

The article outlines several strategies, including debt settlement, which can reduce principal but severely damages credit. Credit counseling and debt management plans can lower interest rates and consolidate payments with less credit impact. Other options like debt consolidation loans, credit card hardship programs, and bankruptcy each have distinct benefits and drawbacks.

This revelation raises new questions about the adequacy of the camp's preparedness and the state's oversight. The Guadalupe River rose with shocking speed, overwhelming the camp and leading to one of the flood's worst tragedies.</p>
