          <p>Russian forces launched a significant and deadly strike on Kyiv, resulting in at least nine fatalities and numerous injuries, including children, as reported by Ukrainian officials. The assault involved attack drones and ballistic missiles targeting residential areas and other districts within the capital. Ukrainian authorities have condemned the attacks as a clear indication that Russia is not pursuing peace but continues to inflict harm on Ukrainian citizens and homes, as rescue operations are underway to search for survivors amidst the rubble of damaged buildings.</p>

          <p>Fueled by trade turmoil under President Trump, gold prices have surged as investors seek safe-haven assets, while U.S. Treasuries and the dollar decline in appeal. Analysts attribute this shift to waning confidence in the U.S. economy and its assets, driven by geopolitical and economic uncertainties. The traditional inverse relationship between Treasury yields and gold has broken down, with gold's inflation-hedging qualities making it an attractive option. As the U.S. dollar weakens, commodities like gold become more attractive to holders of other currencies. (not investment advice)</p>
