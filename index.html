          <p>Devastating flash floods have struck Texas' hill country, with the Guadalupe River rising an unprecedented 26 feet in under an hour. Authorities have reported multiple fatalities and are conducting extensive water rescues. At a summer camp with 700 children, 20 people are currently unaccounted for, prompting a massive search and recovery effort as officials describe the flooding as a "catastrophic level" event. Governor Greg Abbott has mobilized state resources to assist the affected communities in the five counties under a flash flood emergency.</p>

          <h2>New Tax Bill Does Not Eliminate Social Security Taxes, Contrary to Claims</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite claims that President Trump's new spending bill eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security, the legislation does not repeal the tax itself. Instead, it introduces a temporary new "bonus" tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors over 65, which applies to their total income, not just Social Security benefits. Policy experts note this is misleading, as the change does not alter the fundamental taxation of benefits and primarily advantages higher-income seniors, while many low-income recipients who already pay no federal tax will see no change. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Allied Materials, a Kansas City-based company, is increasing its production of American flags in anticipation of the nation's semiquincentennial celebration next year. The factory, which produces about 1,000 flags daily, is one of the largest vertically integrated manufacturers in the U.S., ensuring every component is American-sourced. Many of its flags are destined for government use and military funerals, a responsibility the company takes very seriously. The company is building inventory to meet the expected surge in demand for what could be the largest flag-flying event in U.S. history.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C. has issued another temporary halt to the deportation of eight immigrants to South Sudan, a country embroiled in civil war. This decision came just hours after the Supreme Court had cleared the way for the Trump administration to proceed with the removal. The case involves men from various countries, only one of whom is from South Sudan, who all have serious criminal convictions. Their lawyers argue they would face perilous conditions upon arrival, and the judge determined their new claims deserved a hearing, transferring the case to another judge in Boston.</p>

          <p>During trade negotiations in Washington, the Trump administration reportedly threatened to impose a 17% tariff on all food and agricultural products exported from the European Union. The proposed tariffs would impact a wide range of popular European goods, from Irish butter to Italian olive oil. The threat was communicated by U.S. officials to the EU trade commissioner this week and is seen as an aggressive negotiating tactic to extract concessions. This comes as Trump has set a self-imposed deadline to finalize new tariff deals with dozens of countries, vowing to impose permanent tariffs of up to 70%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Turkey's LGBTQ+ community is facing a systematic crackdown, with authorities banning Pride events and the government engaging in hostile rhetoric that demonizes its members. Despite the risks, activists continue to insist on their right to exist, using the slogan "Insisting on life." Recent state actions include the blocking of a prominent LGBTQ+ news portal and the arrest of dozens of demonstrators at a Pride march in Istanbul. Activists and lawyers report that this official hostility fuels a dangerous atmosphere, while critical issues like poverty, housing, and hate crimes against the community are ignored.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has publicly refuted claims of abuse made by Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man who was mistakenly deported from the U.S. and held in the country's notorious CECOT supermax prison. Abrego Garcia alleged in a U.S. court filing that he was subjected to severe beatings and psychological torture. In response, President Bukele posted photos and videos on social media, claiming Abrego Garcia was not tortured and appeared well. The allegations align with reports from human rights groups that have documented hundreds of deaths and widespread torture within El Salvador's prison system.</p>

          <p>A multi-story residential building has collapsed in Lyari, a densely populated neighborhood in Karachi, Pakistan, killing at least seven people and injuring several others. Rescue operations are underway, but efforts are being hampered by narrow streets that prevent heavy machinery from accessing the site. Authorities believe as many as 100 people were living in the building and fear that more victims may still be trapped in the rubble. Building collapses are a frequent and tragic occurrence in Pakistan, where construction laws are often poorly enforced.</p>

          <p>Cars manufactured in China accounted for one in every ten new cars sold in the United Kingdom in June, a record high that reflects the rapid growth of Chinese brands like BYD and MG. This surge, up from 6% a year ago, comes as the UK has so far refrained from imposing the heavy tariffs levied against Chinese electric vehicles by the EU and North America. While the trend offers UK consumers more affordable and innovative options, some industry leaders have warned that it poses a competitive threat to domestic manufacturing. The growth has been particularly strong in the electric vehicle sector.</p>

          <p>High-profile left-wing MP Zarah Sultana has announced she is leaving the Labour Party with the intention of launching a new political party alongside former leader Jeremy Corbyn. While Corbyn welcomed her decision, his statement suggested that discussions about a new party are still in the early stages. The move signals a significant splintering on the British left, with polling suggesting a new Corbyn-led party could capture up to 10% of the vote. This could potentially damage both the Labour Party and the Green Party by attracting progressive and younger voters.</p>

          <p>The direct-action group Palestine Action is set to be officially banned as a terrorist organization in the UK after a High Court judge denied its request for a temporary injunction. The proscription means that membership in or expressing support for the group will become a criminal offense, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The government moved to ban the group, which uses civil disobedience to target companies supplying arms to Israel, following an action that caused an estimated £7 million in damage. The group's co-founder called the decision a "dystopian nightmare" and plans to appeal.</p>

This trend of "tokenization" is also being pursued by giants like Deutsche Bank and BlackRock, who are leveraging Ethereum for its stability and security.

The denial of access occurred one day after the first immigrant detainees were transferred to the jail, which is managed by the state of Florida in partnership with the federal government. The lawmakers condemned the move as a "blatant abuse of power" and an attempt to hide potential human rights violations.
