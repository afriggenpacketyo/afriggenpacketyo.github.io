          <p>Florida has scheduled the execution of David Pittman for September 17, following his 1991 conviction for murdering his estranged wife's parents and sister. The crime, which occurred in 1990, also involved Pittman setting the family's home on fire and stealing and burning a car. Governor Ron DeSantis signed the death warrant, marking what could be the state's 12th execution this year, a record since the death penalty's reinstatement. Pittman's legal team is expected to file last-minute appeals to both the state and U.S. Supreme Courts, following previously denied claims of intellectual disability.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has suspended the issuance of temporary medical-humanitarian visas for individuals from Gaza, pending a comprehensive review of its procedures. This decision followed social media posts by far-right influencer Laura Loomer, who made unsubstantiated claims that recent visa recipients, including critically wounded children, were affiliated with Hamas. The policy change has drawn condemnation from charities like the Palestine Children's Relief Fund and civil rights groups, who argue it will have a devastating impact on children needing lifesaving medical treatment unavailable in Gaza's collapsed healthcare system.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Celine Song's new film, 'Materialists', examines the transactional nature of contemporary dating, where financial stability is often as crucial as romantic connection. The movie follows a matchmaker, played by Dakota Johnson, who views relationships through a market-based lens, a perspective that reflects the influence of dating apps and economic pressures on modern love. The article's author argues that rising wealth inequality and stagnant wages have made a partner's financial status a pragmatic consideration for many, particularly young adults. This shift challenges traditional romantic ideals, suggesting societal economic changes are needed to separate love from financial necessity.</p>

          <p>Thousands of residents have been forced to flee Gaza City's Zeitoun neighbourhood due to relentless Israeli bombardment, which the local municipality describes as creating a catastrophic situation. The ongoing Israeli offensive has led to mass displacement, with at least 1.9 million people in Gaza displaced and facing widespread malnutrition. Simultaneously, a general strike is underway in Israel, with protesters demanding an end to the war and the government's plan to occupy Gaza City, arguing it endangers the lives of hostages still held by Hamas. The Israeli military has indicated it will resume allowing tents into Gaza for displaced populations.</p>

Hui fled Hong Kong in 2020 after facing criminal charges related to the 2019 pro-democracy protests and was among several activists targeted with a police bounty in 2023. In a social media post, Hui expressed gratitude to the Australian government but also conveyed the sadness of being a political refugee unable to return to his hometown. He urged Australia to increase its efforts to help other Hong Kong activists who remain imprisoned.</p>

          <p>The British horse racing industry has announced an unprecedented one-day strike on September 10, canceling four fixtures in protest against a proposed government tax hike on betting. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) is campaigning against the Treasury's plan to increase the remote gambling tax on racing from 15% to 21%, aligning it with online gaming. The BHA warns this change could be catastrophic, citing economic analysis that predicts a £330 million loss in revenue and threatens over 2,700 jobs in the first year alone. This marks the first time the sport has voluntarily stopped racing due to government policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new judicial interpretation from China's Supreme People's Court is set to increase enforcement of mandatory social insurance contributions from employers, effective next month. This move is causing concern that companies may increasingly hire retirees, who are exempt from these contributions, potentially reducing job opportunities for the record number of university graduates entering the workforce. The trend has already been noted with companies like McDonald's actively recruiting older workers, sparking debate on social media about generational equity in the job market. The stricter enforcement aims to address China's growing pension crisis by ensuring funds are properly collected.</p>

Her comments coincide with the Metropolitan Police announcing that 60 more individuals will be prosecuted for supporting the group, bringing the total number of arrests since the July ban to over 700.

However, removals to France have not yet begun, and crossings have continued at a high rate, with around 28,000 arrivals so far this year.

          <p>The author reflects on a personal journey from dismissing Renaissance art in their youth to deeply connecting with it as an adult, particularly after experiencing trauma and motherhood. Initially finding the religious art unrelatable, life events allowed for a new appreciation of the emotional complexity in works by artists like Piero della Francesca and Raphael. The article connects this evolution to a broader theme of shedding youthful cynicism and embracing earnestness. This newfound perspective helps the author understand the profound connection local communities have to historical art, seeing it not just as a masterpiece but as a protector of life and a vessel for shared human experience.</p>

Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu cited economic risks as the reason for the intervention, while the union accused the government of violating workers' constitutional right to strike.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, capitalizing on a series of defensive and strategic mistakes by their rivals to retake sole possession of first place in the NL West. The Padres' sloppy play included three runners caught stealing by Dodgers catcher Will Smith in the first two innings alone. Dodgers starting pitcher Blake Snell delivered six shutout innings against his former team, while a two-run error by the Padres' center fielder and multiple walks allowed the Dodgers to build an early and insurmountable lead. The win also clinched the season series for the Dodgers, giving them a crucial tiebreaker advantage.</p>
