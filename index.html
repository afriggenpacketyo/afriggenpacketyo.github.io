          <p>Dozens of White South Africans arrived in the U.S. after the Trump administration granted them refugee status, citing "egregious discrimination." The South African government denies these claims, arguing that the land seizure law respects private property rights and isn't racially targeted. The Trump administration has clashed with South Africa over foreign policy, including its criticism of Israel. One refugee group declined to assist with resettlement, citing racial justice concerns, while others remain committed to serving all eligible refugees. The unusual speed of the process and preferential treatment compared to other refugees have drawn criticism. Optimism for this article is based on the potential for safety for the people in question.</p>

          <p>A temporary pause in tariffs between the U.S. and China is expected to trigger a surge in freight shipments and potentially higher prices for consumers.

          <p>Former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was denied over $600,000 in public matching funds after the New York City Campaign Finance Board found he likely coordinated with a super PAC.

The penalty has little practical effect due to the level of super PAC support he has attracted.
