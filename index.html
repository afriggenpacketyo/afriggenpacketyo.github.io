          <p>Patrick Schwarzenegger discusses his role as Saxon Ratliff in "The White Lotus," a character he describes as a sex-obsessed and self-absorbed individual, and how he prepared for the part by focusing on a short sentence describing Saxon's excitable personality during the audition. He acknowledges concerns about being typecast but credits the role with showcasing his acting abilities beyond his famous lineage. Schwarzenegger also reflects on his upbringing, his relationship with his parents Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, and his early entrepreneurial ventures, such as managing his father's memorabilia for nonprofit purposes. He hopes his performance will dispel notions of nepotism and establish him as a serious actor in the industry. The article also touches on his family's reaction to his role and his interest in public service. Optimism score is not applicable in this context.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Turley argues that Democratic outrage over President Trump's military actions against Iran without congressional authorization is hypocritical, citing similar actions by previous Democratic presidents, such as Barack Obama's intervention in Libya and Bill Clinton's strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan. He criticizes the abandonment of the Constitution's clear language on the declaration of wars, noting that only eleven such declarations have been made in U.S. history. Turley points out the ineffectiveness of the War Powers Act and argues that presidents have long asserted inherent powers to conduct such attacks under their Article II authority. He suggests that the calls for impeachment are absurd given the prior actions of presidents and that Trump is currently in compliance with the Act, although the future remains uncertain. The article emphasizes that politicians have long abandoned their responsibilities to declare war, and the current outrage is largely political theater.</p>

          <p>The world's largest organization for shipowners warns of increased threats to commercial shipping around the Arabian Peninsula following the U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. The Houthi threat against shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has also risen, with potential targets including U.S. warships and merchant ships affiliated with Israel or the U.S. Iran could attempt a wider disruption of commercial shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil chokepoint, through attacks on merchant ships using antiship missiles or drones. The conflict has already caused ocean freight rates to surge, particularly from Shanghai to Jebel Ali, and spot rates for tankers have also increased significantly.

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that Iran's nuclear ambitions have been "obliterated" following U.S. attacks on three major nuclear enrichment facilities. Hegseth emphasized that the mission was a focused and precise operation to neutralize threats to U.S. national interests posed by Iran's nuclear program and to defend U.S. troops and ally Israel. He echoed President Trump's remarks about the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. The full extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear capabilities was not immediately clear, but the U.S. government portrayed the strikes as a significant success in curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

          <p>Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska discusses her experiences as a moderate in a polarized Washington, D.C., highlighting themes from her new memoir, "Far from Home: An Alaskan Senator Faces the Extreme Climate of Washington, D.C." She emphasizes her allegiance to the people of Alaska rather than to the Republican Party, noting her independent write-in victory in 2010 reinforced this commitment. Murkowski reflects on her role in Congress, particularly regarding oversight of government spending and the importance of maintaining congressional authority, especially in the context of President Trump's executive orders. She expresses concern about the Republican conference's willingness to cede power to the executive branch and stresses the need for Congress to fulfill its constitutional duties, regardless of the president's party affiliation. Her effectiveness is tied to relationships and navigating an administration where she and the president have had disagreements.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran faces a critical decision on how to respond, with options ranging from immediate retaliation to negotiation, each carrying significant risks. The internal debate within Iran's security establishment will likely weigh the desire for revenge against the potential for further escalation and the survival of the Islamic Republic regime. Retaliation could involve targeting U.S. bases in the Middle East, using proxies in Iraq and Syria, launching swarm attacks on U.S. Navy warships, or disrupting commercial shipping in the Strait of Hormuz. A delayed response could involve surprise attacks on U.S. interests at a time of Iran's choosing, while the option of not retaliating would mean engaging in negotiations, which could require giving up nuclear enrichment inside Iran.</p>

The advisory also warns that the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could motivate violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators to target specific groups.

          <p>The U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear sites involved a complex mission using decoy bombers and "misdirection" to maintain secrecy, according to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Dan Caine revealed that decoy B-2 stealth bombers flew over the Pacific toward Guam to divert attention from the actual mission. The B-2s used in the attack were deployed earlier and flew under the cover of darkness, refueling multiple times in flight. The operation involved precision, misdirection, and high operational security, with Iran caught off guard by the attack.</p>

          <p>Iranians have expressed fear and anger following US airstrikes on key nuclear sites, with many feeling paralysed and caught by surprise. The strikes, which targeted facilities in Isfahan, Natanz, and Fordo, have heightened tensions in the region. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned of "everlasting consequences," while some Iranians expressed defiance and a willingness to defend their country. The situation has sparked concerns about the future and the potential for further conflict. The conflict is essentially between three leaders, from three countries, driven by their own ideologies.</p>

          <p>Iran launched a wave of missiles at Israel, wounding at least 21 people, after the U.S. joined Israel's attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. Iranian missiles impacted multiple sites across Israel, including Haifa and Tel Aviv, with searches underway for people trapped under rubble. The Israel Defense Forces reported that Iran launched about 30 missiles. The Iranian assault occurred hours after President Trump announced U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Israel's military retaliated by striking missile and drone sites in Iran, escalating the conflict.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran's top diplomat stated that the country reserves all options to defend itself. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi condemned the U.S. operation as an "outrageous, grave and unprecedented violation" of international law.

Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, also condemned the strikes and requested an emergency meeting of the U.N.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The bombing of nuclear sites in Iran, ordered by President Trump without congressional approval, is viewed as a violation of the Constitution, which grants Congress the authority to declare war. The absence of a congressional vote weakens American democracy by depriving citizens of representation and accountability. The Iraq War, though a mistake, involved congressional debate and votes, allowing citizens to hold representatives accountable. Unilateral actions by presidents, like Trump's, remove democratic channels for citizens to oppose war, which can be dangerous and radicalizing. The lack of official channels for citizens to effect change can be radicalizing.</p>

          <h2>Toxic Phrases Parents Should Avoid and What to Say Instead</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships reveals that parents who avoid defiance do not use threats, bribes, or harsh consequences, but instead use language that encourages cooperation. Traditional parenting phrases can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, while language that honors autonomy and sets boundaries fosters cooperation. Examples of phrases to avoid include "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine." Instead, parents should explain their reasoning, give children agency over their behavior, validate their emotions, and invite problem-solving instead of blame. By shifting from punishment to partnership, parents can create conditions where cooperation feels natural, fostering trust, self-regulation, and emotional resilience in children.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Florida are accused of racially gerrymandering two state senate districts to disenfranchise Black voters in the Tampa Bay area, according to court proceedings. The ACLU of Florida argues that the redistricting process, which involved taking a small chunk of St Petersburg with a high minority population and adding it to an area of Tampa across a 10-mile waterway, diluted Black voting power. The lawsuit challenges the state's defense that the districts are contiguous due to the waters of Tampa Bay, emphasizing the lack of direct connection between the areas. The case highlights concerns about Republican officials manipulating voting districts to their advantage by undermining Black voting power.</p>
