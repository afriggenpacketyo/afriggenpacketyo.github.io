          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is the last minister yet to agree on a funding deal with the Treasury before Wednesday's Spending Review, which will set government department budgets for the next few years. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle stated that all parts of society are struggling and that the Chancellor is facing pressure from every department for additional funding. While extra money is expected for the NHS, other government areas will likely see budget cuts as the Chancellor aims to meet fiscal rules. The government has announced an ¬£86bn package for science and technology and a ¬£15.6bn package for public transport extensions. The ongoing negotiations highlight the difficult choices the government faces in balancing spending priorities with fiscal responsibility. </p>

          <p>Ed, a pet zebra that had been roaming free in Tennessee for over a week, has been safely captured. The Rutherford County Sheriff‚Äôs Office confirmed that Ed was located in a pasture near Christiana and airlifted back to a waiting animal trailer. Ed had previously been spotted running along Interstate 24, leading to temporary road closures, and became a social media sensation during his time on the loose. The pursuit of Ed follows a similar incident involving a runaway kangaroo in Alabama earlier this year. </p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that the administration will prevent a "repeat of 2020" in Los Angeles, following President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard. Noem criticized California Governor Newsom's handling of the situation, asserting that the President prioritized community safety. Newsom, however, argued that the federal government's actions were inflammatory and unnecessary. The deployment marks the first time since 1965 that a president has sent troops into a state without a state request, raising concerns about federal overreach. </p>

          <p>National leaders are portraying Los Angeles as chaotic due to recent protests, leading to the deployment of the National Guard. President Trump has described the protests as being driven by ‚Äúpaid troublemakers‚Äù and framed the situation as a form of rebellion against the U.S. government. Despite this depiction, the city remains largely calm, with most residents continuing their daily routines. The situation underscores the tension between the federal government's perception and the reality on the ground, raising questions about the motives behind the military deployment. </p>

          <p>According to a psychologist specializing in couples, the most common reasons couples fight include tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. A sour tone signals contempt, a predictor of divorce, while family arguments reflect unmet needs and value clashes. Uneven chore distribution leads to resentment, and ineffective communication escalates conflicts. Strategies to move past these issues include naming the effect, reassuring each other, acknowledging the invisible load, and using a designated word for time-outs. </p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles is viewed as an assault on democracy and an attempt to provoke unrest, enabling attacks on constitutional freedoms. The move is seen as a way to divert attention from Trump's failures and reestablish his image as a strongman. It also raises concerns about the potential for radicalizing citizen-soldiers and creating a national emergency to justify authoritarian control.
