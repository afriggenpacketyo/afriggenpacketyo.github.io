            <p>Malaysia Aviation Group (MAG), the parent company of Malaysia Airlines, is in talks with Boeing about potentially acquiring new jets if Chinese airlines cease taking deliveries. This opportunity arises due to possible trade tensions between the United States and China, leading to Boeing potentially returning some 737 MAX jets from China. MAG views this as a chance to secure earlier delivery slots to expand its narrow-body fleet. Airlines worldwide are facing supply chain issues and production slowdowns, making new plane acquisitions challenging. Optimism Score: 65</p>
