          <p>A mass shooting at the well-known Or Tor Kor Market in Bangkok has resulted in the deaths of five people, with the suspected shooter also reported deceased by police officials. Local media indicates that some of the victims were security guards at the market, which is famous for its high-quality fresh produce and seafood. The incident highlights a troubling trend in Thailand, a country with relatively high gun ownership where several deadly mass shootings have occurred in recent years, despite such events not being common historically.</p>

          <p>Shi Yongxin, the abbot of the world-famous Shaolin Temple, is facing a criminal investigation for serious allegations including embezzlement and having improper relationships with multiple women. Known as the "CEO monk" for commercializing the 1,500-year-old institution, he has been stripped of his ordination certificate by China's Buddhist association. This is not the first time Shi has faced scrutiny, having been cleared of similar charges in 2015, but the current investigation has become a major topic of public discussion in China.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Thailand and Cambodia have begun urgent ceasefire negotiations in Malaysia, hosted by the Malaysian Prime Minister as chair of ASEAN. The talks aim to end five days of deadly border clashes that have killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000, which reportedly began after a landmine explosion injured Thai soldiers. Despite the meeting, fighting was reported to be ongoing, with international pressure, including from the U.S., mounting for an immediate resolution to the rare military confrontation between ASEAN members.</p>

          <p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England is anticipated to announce an overwhelming rejection of the government's 3.6% pay award, which the union has labeled as "grotesque." This development increases the likelihood of nursing strikes later in the year, as the union demands further negotiations to avoid a formal strike ballot in the autumn. The government has stated it cannot increase the headline pay offer but is open to discussing wider reforms, while other health unions like GMB have also rejected the deal.</p>

          <h2>Dubai's Crackdown on Illegal Housing Leaves Low-Wage Migrant Workers with Few Options</h2>

          <p>Authorities in Dubai are conducting a widespread crackdown on illegally partitioned and overcrowded apartments, citing fire safety concerns after a recent high-rise blaze. This campaign is displacing numerous low-wage migrant workers, who rely on these cheap, albeit cramped and often unsafe, living situations due to the city's expensive rental market. With no minimum wage and limited housing benefits for non-nationals, many evicted workers face uncertainty and the risk of homelessness in a city they help build and maintain.</p>

          <h2>New US Tariff Deal with Japan Offers Little Relief to Automakers Facing Chinese Competition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 00:01:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While a new trade deal has lowered US tariffs on Japanese-made cars from 25% to 15%, industry experts say it provides little comfort for Japan's auto industry. The bigger threat comes from the meteoric rise of Chinese automakers, who are eroding Japan's market share globally, particularly in electric vehicles and key markets like Southeast Asia. Analysts note that while the tariff deal provides some predictability, Japanese brands still face significant challenges from both fierce external competition and domestic economic pressures.

          <p>After 74 years of scientific expeditions and research that began in 1951, China has officially launched the Yarlung Tsangpo River hydropower project in Tibet. The groundbreaking ceremony for what is set to be the world's largest hydropower dam was announced by Premier Li Qiang. The project is the culmination of decades of geological, hydrological, and meteorological study on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This massive infrastructure endeavor marks a significant milestone in China's long-term energy and engineering ambitions for the region.</p>
