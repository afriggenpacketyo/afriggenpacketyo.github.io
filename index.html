          <p>As a government shutdown looms, House Democrats continue to pressure the GOP, following the failure of a Democratic funding bill in the Senate. President Trump asserts that Democrats are responsible for impending layoffs, falsely claiming they insist on healthcare for undocumented immigrants. Attorney General Pam Bondi echoed this sentiment in a Justice Department memo, blaming Democrats for obstructing a clean continuing resolution due to "unrelated policy demands." The department has prepared contingency plans, which include curtailing civil litigation and potentially furloughing employees if federal funding lapses by the deadline.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a deal with Pfizer to offer discounted drugs directly to consumers via the new TrumpRx.gov website, set to launch in 2026. This initiative aims to align U.S. drug prices with those in other developed countries, with Pfizer pledging 50% average discounts on new drugs and most-favored-nation pricing for Medicaid. However, the agreement lacks specific details on discount calculations, and experts like Harvard's Ameet Sarpatwari express skepticism, suggesting it's "window dressing" rather than a transformational reform. The website will primarily benefit uninsured patients, as insured individuals might still find lower prices through their existing plans. (not investment advice)</p>

She described looking into the gunman's eyes, perceiving his pain, and instantly forgiving him. The incident involved 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford driving a truck into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, opening fire on approximately 100 congregants, and setting the building ablaze before dying in a shootout with police. Officials have labeled the attack as targeted violence, driven by the attacker's hatred for people of the Mormon faith.</p>

          <p>Shares of Lithium Americas surged over 35% in extended trading after U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced the government would acquire a 5% equity stake in the company and its Thacker Pass project in Nevada. This strategic move aims to bolster North American lithium supply, with the mine expected to become one of the largest sources by late 2027. The investment, which includes substantial debt capital, is deemed "economic common sense" to ensure lithium is mined and refined domestically, marking the White House's latest effort to secure critical mineral supply chains vital for U.S. interests. General Motors also holds a minority stake in the project. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed hundreds of generals and admirals, outlining a controversial agenda to transform the military, aligning it with the MAGA movement. His speech, mirroring his book "The War on Warriors," attacked diversity initiatives, lowered accountability for "toxic" commanders, and vowed to end "woke" policies like identity months and climate-change worship. Hegseth promised stricter fitness standards and new regulations, while President Trump followed with a speech advocating using the military for domestic law enforcement. Many officers expressed discomfort and disappointment with the politically charged event, fearing negative impacts on recruiting and retention.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 288, significantly expanding the state's power over workplace disputes and union elections. This legislation allows the California Public Employment Relations Board to intervene when the federal National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is unable to act, a situation exacerbated by the Trump administration's hampering of federal regulators. The new law aims to protect workers' rights, particularly for non-union, foreign-born construction workers vulnerable to exploitation. While the California Chamber of Commerce opposes the bill due to potential conflicts with federal law, proponents argue it restores a historical balance of state enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The impending federal government shutdown largely stems from a dispute over Affordable Care Act (ACA) enhanced premium tax credits and their eligibility for certain immigrants. Republicans accuse Democrats of seeking healthcare for "illegal immigrants," while Democrats counter that they aim to restore coverage options for "lawfully present" immigrants, eliminated by a recent Trump tax bill. Democrats insist on extending these subsidies, which prevent millions of Americans from facing higher premiums, as part of any short-term funding resolution. Republicans, however, view the extension as too costly and a "Covid-era policy" no longer necessary.</p>

          <p>Premiums for health plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace are projected to more than double in 2026 if enhanced subsidies expire as scheduled at the end of 2025, according to a KFF analysis. This finding underscores the high stakes of the current political stalemate between Democrats and Republicans, which threatens a government shutdown. The enhanced premium tax credits currently make health insurance significantly cheaper for 22 million ACA enrollees, saving them an average of $705 annually. Without congressional action, a 114% average increase is expected, compounded by changes to tax credit calculations and proposed insurer rate hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts issued a scathing ruling, finding that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio unconstitutionally targeted pro-Palestinian international students for deportation. Judge William Young stated their actions, approved by President Trump, aimed to chill lawful speech and misused government powers. The ruling, which followed a nine-day trial, accused officials of "invidious" intent and deploying masked agents to "terrorize Americans into quiescence." Young criticized the president's "palpable misunderstanding" of free speech and praised the judiciary for defending constitutional values against executive overreach.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 53, a bill mandating transparency reports from developers of powerful "frontier" AI models to address potential catastrophic risks. This law requires companies to develop safety frameworks, publish security reports before deployment, and report "critical safety incidents" within 15 days, with penalties up to $1 million per violation. While lauded as a proactive step in AI governance, the article questions if transparency alone can prevent large-scale disasters like AI-enabled biological weapons or cyberattacks. The bill's focus on catastrophic risks, defined as events causing over 50 casualties or $1 billion in damages, reflects California's role as a regulatory trailblazer in the AI industry.</p>
