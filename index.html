          <p>The FBI conducted court-authorized searches at former National Security Adviser John Bolton's Maryland home and D.C. office, reportedly in connection with a classified documents investigation. President Trump, claiming he learned of the searches via television, publicly criticized Bolton, calling him "not very smart" and questioning his patriotism. This event echoes past conflicts, including the first Trump administration's lawsuit against Bolton over his book, "The Room Where It Happened," for alleged classified information disclosure. Top law enforcement officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, posted on social media emphasizing that "NO ONE is above the law."</p>

          <p>Kimbal Musk, brother to Elon Musk, publicly affirmed that the Tesla CEO "deserves to be paid," noting Elon has received no cash salary for six to eight years, relying instead on performance-based stock options. This statement arises as Tesla navigates a legal challenge following a Delaware judge's revocation of Elon's 2018 $56 billion pay package. An "interim" $29 billion package was subsequently approved by a special committee of the board without a shareholder vote, prompting an investment group to call for an investigation by Nasdaq. The board plans to put a longer-term compensation strategy to a shareholder vote in November. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump declared he would fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook if she refused to resign, citing mortgage fraud allegations publicly made by FHFA Director Bill Pulte, which the Justice Department is now investigating. Cook, a Biden appointee, has rebuffed the pressure, asserting she will not be "bullied" into stepping down. This potential removal could allow Trump to appoint a replacement, shifting the central bank's governing board towards his monetary policy preferences, as two current governors are Trump appointees and another seat is open. The political clash coincides with the Fed's challenging task of balancing inflation and employment. (not investment advice)</p>

This stance comes after Palestinian factions in a refugee camp handed over weapons to the Lebanese army, a step lauded by the US envoy. Despite UN resolutions and an agreement brokered to end the 2024 conflict with Israel calling for Hezbollah's disarmament, the group's leader Naim Kassem stated they would treat the decision "as if it doesn't exist," arguing it serves US and Israeli interests.

          <p>Lyle Menendez is scheduled for a parole board hearing, following his brother Erik's denial of release the previous day, decades after their 1989 conviction for the murders of their parents. Their life sentences were recently reduced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole under California's youth offender law. The brothers consistently claim self-defense due to alleged physical, sexual, and emotional abuse from their parents, though the Los Angeles County District Attorney opposes their release, arguing they have not taken full responsibility. Erik's parole denial was largely attributed to his "behavior in prison," including policy violations like drug smuggling and illicit cell phone use, rather than solely the original crimes.</p>

          <h2>Wage Growth for Job Stayers Surpasses Job Switchers, Signaling Labor Market Weakness</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an unusual economic trend, wage growth for "job stayers" has outpaced that of "job switchers" for six consecutive months in 2025, a phenomenon last observed during the Great Recession. This reversal indicates an underlying weakness in the labor market, as workers, facing economic uncertainty and fewer job openings, are "job hugging" rather than seeking better-paying new roles. Economists note that employers are less compelled to offer higher wages to new hires, and the declining quits rate suggests a lack of confidence among workers to find improved employment, particularly affecting the long-term unemployed.

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke has lost his libel case against The Guardian, which published allegations of sexual misconduct against him in 2021. The judge dismissed Clarke's claim, ruling that the newspaper successfully defended its stories on grounds of truth and public interest. Over a dozen women testified to experiencing misconduct during the six-week trial, with the judge finding Clarke "not a credible or reliable witness" and rejecting his claim of an "unlawful conspiracy." The Guardian's editor welcomed the decision as a victory for the women who suffered and a landmark for investigative journalism.</p>

          <p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the world's leading authority on food crises, has officially declared a famine in Gaza City, marking the first confirmed famine in the Middle East, warning it will spread without a ceasefire and increased aid. This "entirely man-made" crisis is attributed to Israel's deliberate and sustained blocking of humanitarian aid since October 7, 2023, a claim Israel denies, calling reports "Hamas lies." Gaza residents share harrowing accounts of severe hunger, with children suffering extreme malnutrition and mothers reporting a lack of basic food items. This dire situation, documented by human rights groups as using starvation as a weapon of war, highlights catastrophic humanitarian conditions.</p>

          <p>Texas Instruments (TI) is undertaking a $60 billion U.S. manufacturing megaproject, with Apple committing to produce "critical foundation semiconductors" for iPhones at TI's new plants in Utah and Texas. This initiative aligns with President Trump's tariff policy to incentivize domestic chip production. Despite a recent 13% stock plunge for TI due to weak guidance and tariff concerns, analysts view TI as a "tariff winner" due to its U.S. foundry's potential to undercut rivals. The project, involving seven new fabs, aims to quintuple TI's capacity and address the decline in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

The National Weather Service warns that the lack of nighttime cooling poses significant health risks, as bodies cannot recover from daytime highs, and also fuels elevated fire conditions. A red flag warning is in effect for mountains and foothills, with a chance of monsoonal thunderstorms potentially bringing localized flooding, debris flows, and dry lightning that could spark wildfires.

While PDVSA's exports reportedly increased in 2024, the article highlights how geopolitical tensions and sanctions significantly limit Venezuela's market prominence, despite its immense potential, making the situation a point of global interest for energy markets.

Through translocation efforts between 1998 and 2016, 54 woodpeckers were moved, with approximately 70% surviving and forming breeding pairs, leading to offspring with stronger survival rates. This project not only boosted numbers but also restored genetic diversity, demonstrating translocation's potential as a conservation method when combined with habitat management. The species, once common, has faced dramatic decline due to habitat loss but was reclassified from "endangered" to "threatened" in 2024, with Avon Park playing a key role.</p>
