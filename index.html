          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has arrived in Washington D.C. for a critical meeting with President Donald Trump and European leaders, stating his goal is to achieve a "lasting peace" with Russia. His arrival follows a Trump-Putin summit where a potential land-for-peace deal was discussed, a concept Zelenskyy has previously resisted. Ahead of the talks, President Trump posted on social media that Zelenskyy could end the war "almost immediately" if he chooses, placing the onus for a resolution on the Ukrainian leader.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has restrengthened into a major Category 4 storm as it moves north of the Caribbean.

Life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents are expected along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard throughout the week.

          <p>The United States and South Korea have begun their annual "Ulchi Freedom Shield" joint military exercises, involving computer simulations and field training aimed at bolstering their defensive readiness. While the allies maintain the drills are defensive, North Korea has condemned them as a provocation and vowed a response. The exercises are taking place amid heightened regional tensions and as the Trump administration continues to press South Korea for increased financial contributions for the cost of stationed U.S. troops.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the killing of Palestinian journalists in Gaza is a deliberate Israeli strategy to eliminate credible witnesses and control the narrative of its military campaign. The author praises the professionalism and dedication of Gaza's reporters, who continue their work despite immense personal loss and direct threats from the Israeli military. The piece contends that this systematic targeting is intended to annihilate the dignified and professional image of Palestinians that these journalists convey to the world.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have developed a method to convert human stem cells into dopamine-producing neurons and transplant them into mice with depressive symptoms. The procedure successfully reduced behaviors like anxiety and anhedonia (the inability to feel pleasure) in the animal models. This breakthrough provides a proof-of-concept for potential cell-based therapies to treat major psychiatric disorders by directly repairing specific dysfunctional neural circuits in the brain, offering hope for future treatments.</p>

          <p>This article provides context for the Trump-Zelenskyy talks by focusing on the devastating human impact of the war, where civilian casualties recently hit a three-year high. It argues that diplomatic discussions of "land swaps" ignore the reality of eradicated communities, lost homes, and the destruction of a way of life. The piece highlights the profound personal losses faced by ordinary Ukrainians, contrasting the transactional nature of political negotiations with the grim, daily struggle for survival on the frontlines.</p>
