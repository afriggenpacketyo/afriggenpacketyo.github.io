            <p>A 43-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a house explosion in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, that resulted in the death of 53-year-old David Howard. The explosion destroyed one terraced house and partially collapsed two others, damaging nearby properties and cars. While the cause of the explosion is still under investigation, authorities have urged the public to avoid speculation. Approximately 50 people were evacuated from 35 properties, and residents have expressed shock and fear following the incident as demolition and investigation work continues in the area.</p>

            <p>Several prisons across France were hit by coordinated attacks overnight, prompting a strong response from authorities. Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin linked the attacks to the government's crackdown on drug trafficking, while Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau pledged a "relentless" response. Vehicles were set on fire, and one prison entrance was targeted with gunfire, causing concern among prison staff and unions. No group has claimed responsibility, but inscriptions related to "French prisoners' rights" were found at some sites, suggesting a possible motive.</p>

            <p>Bank of America reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed analysts' estimates, driven by stronger-than-expected net interest income and trading revenue. Profit increased by 11% to $7.4 billion, or 90 cents a share, with revenue rising 5.9% to $27.51 billion. The bank's performance mirrors that of its peers, which also benefited from a surge in equities trading revenue due to market volatility. Despite concerns about potential economic impacts from tariff policies, Bank of America's results indicate a robust start to the year. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>U.S. betting firms are actively lobbying against state regulations designed to protect consumers from gambling-related harms, according to a report by the Campaign for Accountability. With the surge in online gambling following a 2018 Supreme Court ruling, companies are pushing back against restrictions on advertising, deposit limits, and certain types of wagers. The report highlights instances where industry lobbying has successfully influenced state laws, raising concerns about the balance between consumer protection and industry profits. Problem gambling advocates emphasize the need for careful regulation to mitigate addiction-related risks.</p>

            <p>Major donors and investors with financial ties to President Trump are positioned to potentially profit from a U.S. takeover of Greenland, raising ethical concerns. These individuals, including tech moguls and fossil fuel executives, have invested in mining companies operating in Greenland, which is rich in rare minerals essential for the tech industry. Some donors also support establishing a libertarian "post state" in Greenland for tech elites. Critics view these efforts as a colonialist operation aimed at exploiting Greenland's resources, while the administration justifies its interest as bolstering U.S. security and industry.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs, while seemingly excluding Russia, have inadvertently disrupted its energy production, a key component of the Russian economy. Falling oil prices, triggered by fears of a trade war-induced global recession, have negatively impacted Russia's oil revenues, which are crucial for funding its war in Ukraine. This development has been met with cautious optimism in Ukraine, as lower oil prices could weaken Russia's ability to sustain its military efforts. The situation presents a potential shift in the dynamics of the conflict, as Russia faces economic challenges due to declining oil prices.</p>

            <p>A third federal judge has issued a temporary order halting some deportations under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) in Colorado. Judge Charlotte Sweeney's order prevents the Trump administration from removing noncitizens in Colorado subject to the AEA proclamation for two weeks, with a hearing set to consider extending the order. This decision follows similar rulings in New York and Texas, creating a patchwork of district-level protections limiting the AEA's use in lieu of a nationwide order. The judge is not ruling on the lawfulness of the AEA proclamation, but blocking removals to preserve the court’s jurisdiction as she considers the issue.</p>

            <p>For those struggling to meet the April 15 tax filing deadline, filing an extension provides an additional six months to submit their federal return. While the IRS encourages early filing, a tax extension offers valuable time to gather necessary forms and navigate complex tax situations without incurring penalties. To file an extension, taxpayers can utilize the IRS's online payment system, IRS File Free, or submit Form 4868. It is important to remember that an extension only grants extra time to file, not to pay, and penalties may apply for late payments.</p>

            <p>British Steel's blast furnaces will continue operating after the government secured the delivery of essential raw materials, including coking coal and iron ore from the U.S. and Australia. The government intervened following a breakdown in talks with the company's Chinese owner, Jingye, amid concerns about potential furnace closures. Industry Minister Sarah Jones confirmed the arrival of shipments and emphasized the government's commitment to maintaining steel production capabilities. The move aims to safeguard 2,700 jobs and ensure the UK's capacity to produce virgin steel.</p>

            <p>The availability of low-deposit mortgages has reached its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, providing a boost for first-time buyers. The number of deals requiring a 5% or 10% deposit has significantly increased, offering more choice for those with limited savings. However, house prices and mortgage rates remain elevated, and competition for homes is fierce. The UK housing market remains relatively stable, but buyers must navigate uncertainty surrounding interest rates and stamp duty changes.</p>

            <p>China has strongly refuted accusations from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who described Chinese aid to developing nations as "rapacious deals." The Chinese embassy in Argentina accused the U.S. of undermining the welfare of the Global South to advance its own geopolitical interests. The embassy asserted that China's assistance to developing nations, including those in Latin America and Africa, is provided without political conditions and aims to promote mutual development. The exchange reflects ongoing tensions between the two countries regarding their respective roles in international development.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump’s plans to expand infrastructure to produce artificial intelligence in the US could face years of delays with the Republican-controlled Texas statehouse poised to pass legislation that imposes regulatory hurdles on data centers. The Texas legislation SB6 introduces new regulatory measures including a six-month review process in addition to the existing 6-18 month evaluation period with the goal of protecting its own power grid in the face of storms. The regulatory measures could result in a maximum 24-month approval process, while the requirement to pay additional fees to the Texas grid operator and install backup generators would dramatically raise construction costs.</p>

            <p>The article discusses a new study by researchers at Stanford, NYU, the University of Georgia, and Georgia State followed the implementation of a law in Louisiana that required any website publishing a substantial amount of pornographic content to take reasonable steps to verify the age of users before giving them access. The researchers found that while search traffic to Pornhub—which complied with the law—dropped by 51 percent, traffic to its noncompliant rival, XVideos, rose by 48.1 percent. One of the researchers, Zeve Sanderson, discusses what governments can even do to regulate the internet on behalf of minors and what doing so might cost the rest of us.</p>

            <h2>Supreme Court Threatens to Bring “Don’t Say Gay” to Every Classroom in America</h2>

            <p>The Supreme Court will hear a case that could impose a regime similar to Florida’s original Don’t Say Gay law on every public school in the country. The plaintiffs in Mahmoud v. Taylor — a group of Muslim and Christian parents — don’t specifically ask the justices to ban discussions of homosexuality or gender identity from classrooms. If public schools were required to provide advance notice of any lesson that might offend any parent’s religious views, they would be overwhelmed by this obligation.</p>
