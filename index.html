          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer funds to assist eligible students with private school tuition. Abbott hailed the bill as the culmination of a statewide movement prioritizing families, while supporters like Attorney General Ken Paxton view it as a step toward educational freedom. Conversely, Texas Democrats argue the legislation will divert critical funds from already underfunded public schools, primarily benefiting wealthier families. State Senator Jo Brown criticized the bill as 'welfare for the wealthy' at the expense of public education.</p>
