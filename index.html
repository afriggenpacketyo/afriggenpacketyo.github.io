        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for the upcoming fall/winter season, marking the narrowest authorization since their initial release. These vaccines are primarily cleared for adults 65 and older and individuals aged 5-64 with at least one underlying condition that increases their risk of severe COVID. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known for his vaccine skepticism, emphasized that this framework delivers on demands for science and safety. This policy shift, which diverges from previous recommendations for all Americans aged 6 months and older, could result in some individuals facing out-of-pocket costs, as insurance coverage often depends on broader CDC advisory panel recommendations, a panel recently restructured by Kennedy.</p>

          <p>Top European Union leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron, visited Moldova to mark its independence day and express strong support for its EU membership bid. Moldovan President Maia Sandu emphasized that there is "no alternative to Europe," linking it to freedom and peace, contrasting with Russia's war in Ukraine. The visit underscores the fragility of Moldova's pro-Europe pivot ahead of crucial parliamentary elections, with Merz warning that the path is not "taken for granted" amid allegations of Russian election interference and economic challenges stemming from the war. Despite a "Hungary-sized roadblock" in EU accession talks due to Ukraine's stalled bid, leaders pledged to advance discussions, recognizing the strategic importance of preventing Moldova from falling under Russian influence.</p>

          <p>The Venice Film Festival is set to be a platform for protests against Israel's military offensive in Gaza and the dire humanitarian situation in the enclave. A local left-wing group already held a rally with "Free Palestine" banners, preceding a larger protest planned for Saturday involving hundreds of groups. Figures from the Italian film industry have urged the festival to take a clear stance against the war. While festival director Alberto Barbera maintains the event is a cultural space for dialogue, not direct political statements, one film vying for the Golden Lion, "The Voice of Hind Rajab," tells the story of a Palestinian girl killed by Israeli soldiers, ensuring the conflict's presence.</p>

          <p>Iranian security forces reportedly killed at least 13 militants in the southeastern Sistan-Baluchistan province, which borders Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) announced the arrests of others, stating some of the deceased were suspects in the recent killing of five police officers in the province. Jaish al-Adl, a Sunni separatist militant group classified as a terrorist organization by Iran and the United States, had claimed responsibility for those police killings. This operation underscores the ongoing security challenges and ethnic tensions in this predominantly Sunni Baluch region, one of the poorest in Shiite-majority Iran, which has seen previous attacks and unrest.</p>

          <p>Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have returned to Iran after a seven-week absence, following Israeli and US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. While IAEA Director Rafael Grossi announced the resumption of their work, Iran's Foreign Minister stated that no final agreement has been reached on a new cooperation framework with the UN-backed inspectors. Tehran allowed the return as a deadline from Germany, France, and the UK approached, threatening reintroduction of UN sanctions if the nuclear program dispute wasn't resolved diplomatically. The international community suspects Iran is developing nuclear weapons, an allegation Tehran consistently denies, insisting its activities are for civilian purposes.</p>

          <p>Turkey's Foreign Ministry strongly criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for acknowledging the 1915 killings of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire as genocide. The ministry labeled Netanyahu's statement an attempt to "exploit past tragedies for political reasons," accusing him of trying to cover up alleged crimes committed in Gaza. Netanyahu, who faces an International Criminal Court arrest warrant for war crimes, made the comment during a podcast when asked why he hadn't recognized the Armenian genocide, simply responding, "I just did." This diplomatic spat highlights ongoing tensions and historical grievances, with Turkey asserting Netanyahu's current legal challenges undermine his stance.</p>

          <p>The maximum Social Security benefit in 2025 can reach $5,108 per month for those retiring at age 70, but this amount is accessible to very few individuals who meet specific criteria, including 35 years of exceptional lifetime earnings. The article highlights that most retirees receive significantly less, making additional income streams crucial for financial security. Options like reverse mortgages, annuities, part-time work, and investment portfolios are presented as ways to supplement Social Security. Understanding these diverse strategies and planning early is essential for a secure retirement, as relying solely on Social Security often proves insufficient for maintaining a desired lifestyle.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly accused Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud, alleging she claimed primary residences in two different states. This accusation comes amidst a broader focus on owner-occupancy mortgage fraud, a practice where borrowers claim a primary residence to secure lower interest rates and tax benefits. Cook's attorney has stated she will file a lawsuit to challenge her removal, asserting Trump lacks the authority. Experts highlight that proving such fraud in court is challenging, requiring evidence of specific intent to deceive rather than just a mistake, as this type of fraud is often difficult to detect until long after a mortgage is originated.</p>

Card issuers are also factoring in high risk, as credit card debt has hit record levels nationwide and delinquencies are climbing, making them cautious about lowering rates. To secure a lower rate, consumers are advised to negotiate directly with issuers, consider balance transfers, debt management plans, or personal loans rather than waiting for broader market changes.

          <p>Taylor Swift's engagement to Travis Kelce is framed as an "existentially fitting" culmination of her career-long exploration of love and marriage in her lyrics, from teenage dreams to adult complexities. The article delves into her discography, highlighting recurring motifs of forever love and the tension between personal relationships and her immense ambition. While Swift's songs have sometimes presented ambition as winning over marriage, her relationship with Kelce, who appears supportive and unthreatened by her fame, suggests a new balance. Her choice to announce the engagement with "So High School" reflects a nostalgic return to simpler longing before widespread fame.</p>

          <p>The concept of universal basic income and unrestricted cash transfers for poverty alleviation is facing renewed debate following recent studies that showed limited lasting improvements in mental health, stress, or financial well-being for recipients. This challenges earlier optimism, drawing criticism from the right about welfare's impact and prompting nuanced discussions on the left about cash's role versus systemic fixes like housing and healthcare. While some research has been influenced by pandemic-era aid and other barriers, proponents emphasize that cash remains crucial for basic security, preventing homelessness, and improving outcomes, with ongoing studies continuing to explore its potential.</p>

The prosecution alleged Read hit O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die, while the defense presented an alternative theory involving a fight at a party.

          <p>Nvidia is expected to report robust fiscal second-quarter earnings, with analysts forecasting $1.01 adjusted earnings per share and $46.02 billion in revenue, representing 53% year-over-year growth. This continued surge is driven by insatiable demand for its GPUs in the generative AI era, particularly from its data center business, which accounts for 88% of total sales. Key questions for analysts revolve around the performance of the new Blackwell chips and the state of Nvidia's China business, especially after the Trump administration's export controls and China's push for homegrown chips. Nvidia previously anticipated an $8 billion loss in China sales, though licenses were later granted.</p>

He expects this incentive, along with the removal of an €80 monthly cap on earnings, to encourage ground handlers to enforce rules, ultimately leading to faster boarding and fewer flight delays.

          <p>An NPR international team member joined archaeologists in the Negev desert, uncovering remains of an ancient Nabataean Christian church, including remarkably intact baptismal pools. The Nabataeans, known for Petra and their extensive trade routes, built cities and churches like this caravanserai city, Mamshit, to support their voyages. The discovery of a smaller pool for babies and a larger, cross-shaped pool for adults illustrates the civilization's transition to Christianity around the 4th century A.D. This site serves as a poignant reminder of constant societal change and the impermanence of even long-lasting human endeavors in a land traversed by many cultures over millennia.</p>
