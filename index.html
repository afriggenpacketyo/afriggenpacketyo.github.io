          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that Iran's nuclear ambitions have been "obliterated." Hegseth praised President Trump's order as focused and clear, emphasizing that the mission was not about regime change but to neutralize threats to U.S. national interests and protect allies. Hegseth echoed Trump's remarks about the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity, though the full extent of the damage remains unclear. The strikes represent a significant escalation in tensions between the U.S. and Iran, raising concerns about potential retaliation and regional instability. The optimism score for this article reflects the uncertainty surrounding the long-term consequences of the strikes and the potential for further conflict.</p>

          <p>A party yacht struck a dock in the Hudson River, resulting in injuries to dozens of passengers. The 200-foot yacht, "Timeless," hit a pylon while attempting to dock near Riverside Park, leading to 35 people sustaining non-life-threatening injuries, with 22 hospitalized. Passengers described being knocked off their feet during the incident, which occurred during a 69th birthday party with nearly 400 people on board. The Coast Guard is investigating the incident, which follows a similar accident a month prior involving a Mexican navy ship and the Brooklyn Bridge.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth described the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites as a meticulously planned operation involving misdirection and high operational security. He highlighted the use of B-2 stealth bombers, emphasizing that the mission demonstrated the strength of the U.S. alliance and joint forces. Hegseth reiterated that the U.S. does not seek war but will act decisively when its interests, people, or partners are threatened. The operation, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, involved the longest B-2 spirit bomber mission since 2001 and the first operational employment of the Massive Ordnance Penetrator. The optimism score is relatively low, considering the article discusses military action and potential for further conflict.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, details have emerged regarding the operation, weapons used, and potential ramifications. President Trump claimed a "successful" bombing attack, while Iran confirmed the strikes but downplayed the damage. The US used GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) to target sites like Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with initial assessments indicating severe damage. Iran has launched missiles at Tel Aviv and Haifa in retaliation, and is considering further strategic responses. The optimism score is tempered by the acknowledgement of retaliatory attacks and the potential for further escalation.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, calling it a "spectacular military success" aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. B-2 Spirit bombers dropped GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators on Fordo, while Tomahawk missiles targeted Natanz and Isfahan. Iran has pledged to retaliate, prompting Trump to warn against any retaliation with a threat of far greater force. The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed no increase in off-site radiation levels, and the U.S. has communicated that regime change is not planned.
