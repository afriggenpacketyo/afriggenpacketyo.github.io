          <p>Google is partnering with researchers to develop an AI model, DolphinGemma, to decipher dolphin communication. The project utilizes 40 years of dolphin sound recordings from the Wild Dolphin Project, aiming to identify patterns and potential meanings in dolphin vocalizations. DolphinGemma uses Pixel phone technology to filter out background noise, ensuring high-quality audio for analysis. The ultimate goal is to establish a shared vocabulary for interactive communication with dolphins, and Google plans to release DolphinGemma as an open-source model this summer.</p>
