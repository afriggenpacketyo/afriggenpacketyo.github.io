          <p>Retail sales in the UK saw a 0.4% increase in March, marking the third consecutive month of growth. Warmer weather significantly boosted sales of clothing and DIY goods, benefiting various sectors.  However, food sales remained weak, particularly in supermarkets, and consumer confidence fell to its lowest since November 2023 due to rising bills and economic pessimism.</p>
