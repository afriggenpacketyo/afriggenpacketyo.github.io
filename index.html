          <p>As the U.S. federal government shutdown enters its sixth day, the Senate is scheduled to vote on a Democrat-backed bill to continue government appropriations. Republicans have indicated their opposition, preferring their own seven-week stopgap funding measure that has already passed the House. Both parties have continued to publicly blame each other for the political impasse and the resulting shutdown. The key procedural votes are expected to determine the immediate path forward for resolving the funding crisis and reopening federal agencies.</p>

          <p>A consumer group, Which?, has initiated a £480 million legal case against U.S. tech firm Qualcomm, alleging anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit claims Qualcomm overcharged Apple and Samsung for essential smartphone components, which inflated handset prices for consumers between 2015 and 2024. If the five-week trial is successful, approximately 29 million UK consumers could be entitled to a payout of around £17 per affected device. The case highlights ongoing scrutiny of Qualcomm's business practices, which have previously faced antitrust fines in the EU. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS News is set to appoint Bari Weiss, founder of The Free Press, as its new editor in chief following the network's acquisition by Skydance Media. The move is seen as an effort to appeal to right-of-center audiences and address accusations of liberal bias. Weiss, a former New York Times opinion editor known for her contrarian views, will reportedly partner with the current president to redefine the network's brand. The appointment comes as CBS plans network-wide layoffs, creating a complex environment for this significant leadership change.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has issued a series of grants totaling $50 million for its Autism Data Science Initiative, aimed at improving the understanding of autism treatments and outcomes. Cornell University received a $5.1 million grant to establish a center that will validate the research from all other projects funded by the initiative. This funding proceeds despite the administration's controversial and unproven claims about the causes of autism. Researchers involved expressed relief that the grants support sophisticated, complex scientific approaches rather than simplistic theories.</p>

          <p>A growing bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers is publicly refusing their salaries as the federal government shutdown continues. Representatives from both the Republican and Democratic parties have formally requested that their pay be withheld for the duration of the shutdown. However, constitutional and federal laws prevent them from permanently forgoing their compensation, meaning they will receive it as backpay once the government reopens. This symbolic gesture is intended to show solidarity with federal workers who are missing paychecks during the funding lapse.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Australia are appealing the sentence given to Erin Patterson, who was convicted of murdering three relatives with a poisonous mushroom meal. Patterson was sentenced to life in prison with a possibility of parole after 33 years, but the Department of Public Prosecutions argues the term is "manifestly inadequate." The judge's original sentencing decision considered the harsh prison conditions Patterson faces, including extended solitary confinement due to her notoriety. Patterson's legal team has also indicated its intent to appeal her conviction, setting the stage for further legal battles.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study across 528 mammal species, including humans, reinforces that females consistently live longer than males, offering clues to this longevity gap. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute found that genetics, such as females having two X chromosomes, and evolutionary pressures contribute to this disparity. Risky behaviors, which are more common among males in many species for mating purposes, shorten lifespans. In humans, men's higher rates of smoking, alcohol use, and lower likelihood of seeking preventative medical care contribute significantly to the gap, suggesting that behavioral changes could help narrow it.</p>

          <p>A woman was shot and injured by federal agents in Chicago after authorities say their vehicle was rammed and boxed in by multiple cars. The Department of Homeland Security stated that agents, unable to move, exited their vehicle and opened fire when they saw one of the drivers had a gun. The injured woman and another man have been charged with assaulting a federal officer. The incident, which occurred near a site of ongoing protests against ICE, led to a tense standoff between demonstrators and law enforcement, with special operations teams deployed to the scene.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite critical acclaim, including Oscar wins, filmmakers from both Israel and Palestine are facing significant obstacles in securing international distribution for their work. The polarized global debate over the Gaza war has made distributors in key markets like the U.S. and Germany hesitant to release films that address the conflict. For example, the Oscar-winning Palestinian documentary "No Other Land" failed to find a U.S. distributor and was self-released. Israeli filmmakers also report increased difficulty in obtaining co-production financing and international sales, highlighting the chilling effect of the political climate on artistic expression.</p>

          <p>A group of 176 Zambian farmers has filed a lawsuit against two local subsidiaries of Chinese state-owned mining companies, alleging an "ecological catastrophe." The suit claims that a tailings dam collapse in February released acidic waste that contaminated local rivers and farms, destroying livelihoods and causing health issues. This legal challenge presents a dilemma for the Zambian government, which has maintained strong economic and political ties with China, a major funder of the nation's infrastructure. The case highlights growing tensions between foreign investment and local environmental and human rights.</p>

          <p>Motor neurone disease (MND) is a rare condition affecting nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, leading to progressive muscle weakness. While the exact cause is unknown, a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors is believed to play a role, with a lifetime risk of about one in 300. Recent studies have suggested a correlation between contact sports and a higher risk of developing MND, with professional football and rugby players showing increased incidence. However, researchers emphasize this does not prove causation, as the number of cases remains relatively low.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued a sweeping temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Oregon. The ruling came after the administration attempted to mobilize troops from California and Texas to Portland, just one day after the same judge had blocked the use of Oregon's own National Guard. Judge Karin Immergut questioned how the move was not in direct contravention of her initial order, stating that conditions on the ground did not justify military intervention. The decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's efforts in the city.</p>

          <p>The UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) spends approximately £1 million per year on private school fees for the children of service personnel in north Wales. This allowance is provided specifically because local state schools teach some or all lessons in the Welsh language. The MoD defends the practice, stating it aims to minimize educational disruption for service children who move frequently. However, the policy has drawn criticism from Plaid Cymru, which called it a "complete waste of money" and an "insult" to the Welsh language.</p>
