          <p>A 61-year-old man was killed and thirteen others, with ages ranging from 7 to 61, were injured after a lightning strike occurred at an outdoor archery range in Jackson Township, New Jersey. The incident happened during a severe thunderstorm that prompted warnings in the area. Bystanders performed CPR on the deceased victim before emergency services arrived, and all other victims were transported to local hospitals for treatment of various injuries, including burns. This marks the third significant lightning strike incident in the Tri-State Area in the past month.</p>

          <h2>Japanese Exports Decline for Second Consecutive Month Amid US Trade Tensions, Sparking Recession Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 22:14:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports fell by 0.5% in June, marking the second straight month of decline and defying economists' expectations of a rise. The drop is largely attributed to ongoing trade disputes with the United States, with shipments to the U.S. falling by 11.4%, the largest decrease since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The automotive sector has been hit particularly hard, with carmakers reportedly absorbing the cost of a 25% U.S. tariff through price cuts to maintain market share. Analysts warn these continued export weaknesses could push Japan's export-reliant economy into a technical recession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>ICE Deportation Data Reveals Low Percentage of Violent Crime Convictions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 22:13:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data obtained by CBS News shows that of the approximately 100,000 people deported in the first half of the year, less than 1% had homicide convictions. While the Trump administration has focused its public messaging on deporting violent criminals, the data indicates that many deportees were convicted of non-violent offenses like traffic or immigration violations. According to the document, about 15% of deportees had assault convictions, while known or suspected gang members or terrorists constituted just over 3% of those removed. The data highlights a discrepancy between public rhetoric and the statistical reality of deportation actions.</p>

          <p>During Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's visit to China, both nations have focused on securing trade and investment agreements, setting aside major political conflicts like the dispute over the Port of Darwin. The deals reportedly include expanded market access for Australian agricultural products, financial sector cooperation, and potential tariff reductions. Analysts suggest this approach is a strategic effort by Beijing to find common ground and strengthen economic ties amid its ongoing trade tensions with the United States. Chinese Premier Li Qiang did, however, request a fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investors in Australia during discussions.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts are cautioning that any attempt by President Trump to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell would likely cause significant market instability, including a potential equity selloff and a spike in long-term yields. The speculation follows reports that the president considered the move, though he later stated it was "highly unlikely." Experts argue that such an action would undermine the central bank's independence, a cornerstone of U.S. economic stability, and could lead to protracted legal battles ultimately decided by the Supreme Court. The situation creates uncertainty, as the president has a history of changing his stance on personnel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration's Justification for Foreign Aid Cuts Faces Scrutiny</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration's claim of widespread "waste, fraud, and abuse" to justify clawing back nearly $8 billion in foreign aid is being questioned by former and current officials. Paul Martin, the former USAID inspector general fired by Trump, stated the administration has provided little to no proof for its claims. Officials familiar with the review process allege that programs were marked for termination based on keywords like "gender" or "climate" rather than on effectiveness. The administration maintains its review was thorough, but critics argue the cuts are politically motivated and undermine lifesaving humanitarian efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Coinbase has launched a new "everything app" called Base App, aiming to attract a broader consumer base beyond its core crypto trading business. The app integrates a digital wallet, payments, social media, and messaging, all running on its Base blockchain network. A key feature is Base Pay, a one-click checkout system for USDC stablecoin payments developed with Shopify, which will eventually support in-store tap-to-pay. By bundling multiple services, Coinbase hopes to replicate the success of "super apps" and drive more utility for its blockchain technology, particularly for content creators seeking new monetization models.

          <p>The Department of Justice has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York and daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. She was a highly regarded prosecutor who recently led the case against Sean "Diddy" Combs and was instrumental in the successful prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell. Her dismissal marks the latest significant personnel change in the prominent prosecutor's office under the Trump administration. Sources suggest the president had privately expressed frustration about having a Comey working in his administration, following his firing of her father during his first term.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the fatal Air India crash in Ahmedabad is reportedly focusing on the captain's actions, according to sources familiar with a preliminary assessment. A cockpit voice recording allegedly captured the first officer questioning the captain for moving the fuel switches to the "cutoff" position moments after takeoff. A preliminary report from India's accident investigation bureau confirmed the switches were moved but did not assign blame, noting one pilot denied cutting the fuel. The loss of fuel flow caused the Boeing 787 to lose thrust, leading to the crash that killed all 260 people on board.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to switch from using high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar in its beverages sold in the United States. The move follows advocacy from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has raised concerns about the health impacts of corn syrup. While Coca-Cola has not explicitly confirmed the change, a spokesperson acknowledged the president's enthusiasm and hinted at new product innovations. The decision was praised by Trump but criticized by the Corn Refiners Association, which warned it could cost American manufacturing jobs and increase foreign sugar imports.</p>

          <p>The average cost for parents in Britain to place one child in a holiday club for the six-week summer break has risen to £1,076, according to research from the charity Coram. Prices vary significantly by region, with some areas seeing increases of up to 13% compared to last year, driven by high demand and a shortage of cheaper, council-run options. The report highlights the financial strain on working families, as many must pay these substantial costs upfront, while government support for those on Universal Credit is paid in arrears, creating a difficult cash-flow problem for many.</p>

          <p>Thousands of flat owners in the United Kingdom are planning a class-action lawsuit against freehold companies, alleging they were charged inflated service fees due to secret insurance commissions. The legal claim asserts that freeholders received undisclosed payments from insurance companies for arranging building policies, then passed the inflated cost on to leaseholders. Lawyers argue these commissions are unlawful and are seeking compensation that could amount to £2,000 per flat owner. The issue has been exacerbated by spiraling insurance costs since the Grenfell Tower fire, which has in turn increased the percentage-based commissions for freeholders.</p>

          <p>An opinion column argues that the U.S. Senate has a constitutional duty to reject the judicial nomination of Emil Bove for a lifetime seat on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The author contends that Bove, a former personal lawyer for President Trump, is disqualified due to his record of alleged power abuse, disregard for the law, and primary loyalty to the president rather than the Constitution. The piece cites a whistleblower's claim that Bove instructed Justice Department lawyers to defy court orders related to deportations. The columnist concludes that confirming him would compromise judicial integrity and set a dangerous precedent.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that any attempt by President Trump to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell would ultimately harm the president and the markets. He noted that Wednesday's market volatility reflected Wall Street's anxiety over the possibility, and that a successful removal would likely rock the stock market and cause long-term interest rates to rise. Cramer suggested that Powell has no compelling reason to cut rates currently, given recent inflation data and a strong job market. He concluded that the president would be better served by waiting to see the full impact of his tariffs before attacking the Fed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A package of three cryptocurrency regulation bills has stalled in the House of Representatives for a second day due to opposition from within the Republican party. After an initial group of conservative hardliners was persuaded to support the legislation, a new bloc of Republicans, including some who authored the bills, objected to last-minute changes. The stalemate has cast doubt on the House's ability to pass any significant crypto legislation, even with President Trump's intervention. The impasse is a major setback for the crypto industry, which had hoped for regulatory clarity during what was being promoted as "Crypto Week" in Congress. (not investment advice)</p>
