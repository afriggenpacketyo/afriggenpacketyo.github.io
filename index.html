          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 14:13:03 EDT</div>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced new 25% tariffs on imports from Japan and South Korea, effective August 1, via letters to their leaders. This move reinstates higher rates initially proposed in April, following a 90-day pause meant for trade negotiations. The administration justifies these tariffs by citing persistent U.S. trade deficits, though experts question the view that deficits are inherently negative. The announcement caused U.S. financial markets to fall, reflecting investor concerns over the renewed trade tensions. These tariffs are separate from other sector-specific duties, and the U.S. warned against retaliatory measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A joint review by the Justice Department and FBI has concluded that disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein did not possess a "client list" implicating prominent figures, nor was there credible evidence he blackmailed individuals. The review also affirmed that Epstein died by suicide in August 2019 while in custody, a finding supported by video footage. This comprehensive report aims to counter long-standing conspiracy theories surrounding his death and alleged secret files, which President Trump had previously pledged to release. Officials emphasized that perpetuating unfounded theories does not aid victims, of whom Epstein harmed over 1,000, each suffering unique trauma.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Block CEO Jack Dorsey has launched Bitchat, a new decentralized, peer-to-peer messaging app designed to operate entirely over Bluetooth mesh networks. This innovative platform requires no internet, central servers, phone numbers, or emails, prioritizing user privacy and censorship resistance. Bitchat enables ephemeral, encrypted communication between nearby devices, passing messages from phone to phone to extend reach even without Wi-Fi or cell service. This development aligns with Dorsey's broader campaign to decentralize social media and payments, offering a robust solution for staying connected during outages, shutdowns, or surveillance. Future updates plan to incorporate WiFi Direct for enhanced speed and range.</p>

          <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt strongly criticized Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democrats for blaming President Donald Trump for the high death toll in the Texas flash floods. Leavitt called such accusations a "depraved lie" and stated they serve no purpose during a time of national mourning. She provided a timeline of National Weather Service warnings, asserting that the NWS executed timely and precise forecasts despite unprecedented rainfall. Schumer, conversely, demanded an investigation into NWS vacancies in Texas. President Trump is expected to visit Texas later this week, offering prayers and support to the affected families.</p>

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of a $20,000 investment in long-term versus short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs). Traditionally, long-term CDs offered higher rates due to the extended commitment required from savers; however, recent market uncertainty has led some banks to offer higher rates on short-term accounts. Despite these higher short-term rates, the article's calculations show that long-term CDs still offer substantially greater returns over their full duration. Savers are cautioned to assess their ability to keep funds invested for the entire term, as premature withdrawals can result in penalties that diminish or eliminate earned interest.

          <p>The United States is poised to potentially impose increased tariffs on European goods, a move economists warn could significantly impact consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. While President Trump recently announced 25% tariffs on Japan and South Korea, the European Union awaits clarity on whether similar punitive measures will apply to its exports. The article highlights the substantial U.S.-EU trade relationship, valued at $2 trillion annually, describing it as the world's most important commercial link. Higher tariffs could lead to increased prices for American consumers on various imported products, and the EU is prepared for retaliatory tariffs if a satisfactory trade deal isn't reached, potentially harming both economies.

The article emphasizes that bankruptcy, despite its societal stigma, is a legal tool designed to provide relief and protect crucial assets like retirement savings.

          <p>The United States is reportedly set to remove the Syrian Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), formerly al-Qaeda's affiliate, from its list of foreign terrorist organizations. This significant decision follows HTS leading a rebel offensive that toppled the Assad regime, with its leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, now serving as Syria's interim president. The move aligns with recent Western efforts, including President Trump ending US sanctions, to support Syria's "path to stability and peace" and economic recovery. However, concerns persist within Syria regarding the new government's operations, including recent violent attacks against minority groups, despite promises of a new Syria.</p>

While justified by Poland as necessary measures against irregular migration and human trafficking, critics view these actions as part of a broader trend of European countries reasserting national self-interest over solidarity. The article highlights how such internal border controls, despite being legally temporary, are becoming increasingly permanent in some member states, creating significant economic costs and undermining the foundational principles of the EU's single market. Experts warn that if governments continue to use these controls as political instruments, the Schengen Area could unravel entirely, with profound economic and symbolic losses.</p>

          <p>This article provides meteorological insights into the catastrophic Texas flash floods that tragically claimed at least 90 lives, many of them children. Heavy rains, originating from the remnant moisture of Tropical Storm Barry, fell rapidly in the predawn hours over the Texas Hill Country, causing the Guadalupe River to surge an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes. Preliminary data indicates rainfall totals ranged from over 6 inches in Sisterdale to upwards of 20 inches in Bertram. The region's natural susceptibility to flash flooding, where dry soil prevents water absorption, significantly exacerbated the impact. Forecasters anticipate additional rainfall, maintaining a "slight" risk for excessive rainfall and continued flash flooding concerns across central Texas.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Investing Club discussed potential market movements, including Nvidia's prospects in China and CrowdStrike's recent downgrade. Citigroup raised Nvidia's price target, citing an expanded artificial intelligence total addressable market forecast, and Cramer believes Nvidia could soon regain the ability to sell AI chips to Chinese customers following eased export restrictions for other firms. Conversely, CrowdStrike was downgraded by Piper Sandler due to its high valuation after a significant run-up, though the article notes the Investing Club has periodically taken profits. Cramer also advised against immediate buying due to the S&P 500 being in overbought territory, suggesting caution for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CCTV footage was presented to a jury in the trial of two brothers, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz and Muhammad Amaad, accused of assaulting three police officers at Manchester Airport. The incident occurred after police responded to an alleged headbutt at a Starbucks, leading to a confrontation in a car park. The footage reportedly shows a "high level of violence" as the brothers resisted arrest. Prosecutors detailed multiple punches and kicks aimed at officers, including one that knocked an unarmed officer to the floor. An officer testified fearing for his Glock 17 pistol during the struggle, noting that no members of the public intervened to help, instead watching and recording on phones.</p>

          <p>UK farmers are warning that wildfires are a "disaster waiting to happen" as the country anticipates a third heatwave, following its warmest and driest spring on record. Farmers express fear over "tinder box" mountains and attribute the increased risk to incentivized removal of grazing sheep from uplands, leading to a dangerous build-up of dry vegetation. This shift in land management, intended for wildlife protection, has resulted in hundreds of thousands of tons of extra vegetation annually. The article highlights the rising cost of farm fires, which increased by 37% in 2023, and urges government and fire services to collaborate on prevention, education, and response, and to urgently review land management policies.</p>

The Belgian cyclist secured his second Tour de France stage victory, edging out Milan by the slenderest of margins, while Mathieu van der Poel retained the race leader's yellow jersey. The stage was marked by multiple crashes, including one that forced stage one winner Jasper Philipsen to abandon the race, and two more in the final 5km involving Olympic champion Remco Evenepoel and Geraint Thomas. Despite the chaotic conditions, the two main general classification favorites, Tadej Pogacar and Jonas Vingegaard, finished safely in the main pack.</p>

Trump called the move "ridiculous" and stated Musk had gone "completely off the rails," warning that third parties only create "disruption and chaos." This marks a dramatic souring of their previously symbiotic relationship, which included Musk's significant donations to Trump's campaign and his appointment to lead the Department of Government Efficiency. Trump also took aim at Musk's past support for electric vehicle mandates, which contrasts with the president's recent termination of EV tax credits, claiming he had warned Musk about this policy change.</p>

This durability record is crucial for attracting investors to the nascent marine energy sector, which harnesses power from tides, currents, and waves. The MeyGen project's turbine, equipped with SKF bearings and seals, has operated without unplanned maintenance, proving that these systems can withstand harsh sea environments for extended periods. This breakthrough addresses a key skepticism among investors and governments, paving the way for larger tidal energy farms and advancing the world's largest untapped renewable energy resource.

          <p>Ukrainian air defenders and first responders are detailing Russia's "double-tap" strike tactic, where a target is hit twice to maximize casualties, particularly among emergency services. This brutal strategy involves an initial drone or missile strike, followed by a second attack after rescuers and civilians arrive, a practice United Nations officials have described as "ruthless." Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported that Russia has intensified its drone and missile strikes, launching hundreds of munitions recently. The article also notes the Trump administration's halt of critical weapons shipments to Ukraine due to concerns over US stockpiles, which analysts warn could severely undermine Kyiv's ability to defend against these escalating and deadly attacks.</p>

          <p>A newly surfaced campaign memo reveals that President Joe Biden's advisors pushed for an early debate with Donald Trump to project "strength" and leadership ahead of the 2024 election. The memo, part of a new book, suggested an early debate would reach a wider audience and showcase Biden's capabilities against Trump's "weakness and chaos" before early voting began. However, Biden's June 2024 debate performance, marked by a hoarse voice and struggles with coherence, ultimately led to mounting pressure for him to withdraw from the race. He subsequently endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who ran the shortest presidential campaign in history before being defeated by Trump.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over a provision in a new domestic policy bill that aims to strip federal funding from its health centers. The organization argues the provision is unconstitutional and specifically designed to prevent its clinics from receiving Medicaid reimbursements, which would have "catastrophic consequences" for over a million patients annually. Planned Parenthood estimates these cuts could force the closure of roughly 200 clinics, disproportionately affecting blue states. The lawsuit seeks to declare the provision unconstitutional or at least preserve funding for clinics not providing abortions, highlighting concerns about access to vital healthcare services and calling the provision a "backdoor abortion ban."</p>

The attack on the community where the hotel was located began late Saturday, with residents fleeing amid heavy gunfire between police and gangs.

CNBC's "America's Deficit Reckoning" explores the potential consequences across markets, the economy, and international relations. Experts warn of risks like inflation, crowding out private investment, and reduced government ability to respond to emergencies, emphasizing future generations will bear the burden. The U.S. has already crossed a historical threshold by spending more on interest payments than defense, signaling potential decline. Experts estimate less than 20 years to correct the fiscal trajectory before aggressive measures may no longer suffice, highlighting the urgency of addressing the debt. (not investment advice)</p>
