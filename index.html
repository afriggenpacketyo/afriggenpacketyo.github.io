          <p>A 1991 quadruple murder case in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop remains unsolved after more than three decades, leaving the community searching for closure. Recent advancements in DNA technology have revived hope for a breakthrough, focusing on a male DNA profile found on one of the victims. Despite initial leads and even convictions that were later overturned, this genetic evidence has been the central point of the investigation, though efforts to identify the donor have so far been inconclusive. Investigators remain optimistic that future scientific improvements will finally provide the answers needed to solve this tragic and high-profile cold case.</p>

Despite this significant cost, Ford's second-quarter revenue surpassed expectations, and its commercial "Pro" division showed strong growth.

          <p>A jury in Arapahoe County, Colorado, has found dentist James Craig guilty of first-degree murder for poisoning his wife, Angela Craig, in 2023. Prosecutors successfully argued that Craig had laced his wife's protein shakes with arsenic, presenting evidence of his incriminating internet searches on undetectable poisons. The defense's suggestion that Angela's death might have been a suicide was rejected by the jury. Craig was also found guilty on several other charges, including soliciting an inmate to murder an investigator, and now faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole.</p>

The suspect, identified as Shane D. Tamura, left a note suggesting he blamed the National Football League, which has offices in the building, for a traumatic head injury he believed was CTE. The victims included the officer working a private security detail, a security guard, and employees from two different firms located in the tower. The tragic event has prompted renewed calls from New York officials for federal action on gun control, highlighting the accessibility of assault-style weapons.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, maintaining its position between 4.25% and 4.5% despite pressure from President Donald Trump for a rate cut. The decision was not unanimous, with two board members dissenting in favor of lowering rates, a rare occurrence. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited concerns over the potential inflationary effects of tariffs as a reason for caution. The move comes as new data shows the U.S. economy grew by 3% in the second quarter, a rebound that complicates the central bank's task of balancing growth and inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

Jones criticized California's Democratic leadership for blocking what he termed an "oil goldmine," arguing that it forces the state to import oil from nations with weaker environmental and labor standards. The project, which was opposed by Democratic Senator Adam Schiff over environmental concerns from a past spill, is estimated to hold 190 million barrels of recoverable oil.

They fear the UK's policy could inadvertently prolong the conflict by removing a key bargaining chip for a ceasefire and hostage release. The UK government has stated its primary aim is to improve the humanitarian situation, but this approach has drawn sharp criticism from those directly affected by the conflict.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Holds Benchmark Interest Rate Steady at July Meeting</h2>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, continuing its cautious approach amid economic uncertainty and the potential impact of tariffs on inflation. The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was widely anticipated but included a rare dissent from two governors, who favored a rate cut. The committee's statement noted that while economic growth moderated in the first half of the year, the labor market remains solid and inflation is somewhat elevated. This decision reinforces the Fed's wait-and-see strategy as it monitors incoming economic data before making future adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has put an end to speculation by announcing she will not run for governor of California in 2026. In her statement, Harris expressed her love for her home state but explained that after deep reflection, she has decided against seeking the office. This decision keeps her options open for a potential 2028 presidential bid and reshapes the field of candidates for California's governorship. Harris emphasized her commitment to public service and hinted at sharing more about her future plans to remain involved in national politics in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Residents in states including California, Texas, and Colorado should anticipate an increase in tarantula sightings as the spiders' mating season begins. During September and October, thousands of mature male tarantulas, which can be the size of a baseball, emerge from their burrows to search for mates. These spiders are generally timid and rarely bite humans unless provoked. The males, typically 8 to 10 years old, embark on this journey as their final act, often dying within a year of mating, while females can live for over 20 years.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that trade negotiations with China regarding tariffs are progressing well. Speaking from the White House, Trump expressed confidence that the two nations would arrive at a "very fair deal" but did not provide specific details about the potential agreement. This optimistic statement comes after a period of escalating trade tensions and a significant decline in Chinese exports to the U.S. While negotiators from both countries have described recent discussions as constructive, they have offered different timelines for a potential pause in new tariffs.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Senate committee has voted to advance a bill that would prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks. Republican Senator Josh Hawley joined with Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to pass the measure, known as the PELOSI Act, in an 8-7 vote. The bill aims to prevent potential conflicts of interest by requiring lawmakers to divest their stock holdings. The legislation sparked a debate within the committee about wealth and public service, but its path to a full Senate vote remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>President Trump is advocating for the elimination of the Senate's 'blue slip' tradition, which gives home-state senators veto power over certain presidential nominees, including U.S. attorneys. This push follows the expiration of the temporary appointment of his former lawyer, Alina Habba, as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor, a nomination blocked by the state's two Democratic senators. The article explains that removing this tradition would allow Trump to install loyalist prosecutors and potentially sympathetic judges in blue states, which could lead to politically motivated investigations and trials against his opponents.</p>

          <p>International aid organizations, including Doctors Without Borders, have strongly criticized the recent airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza, calling them futile, dangerous, and cynical. Experts argue that airdrops are notoriously inefficient, expensive, and fail to reach the most vulnerable populations, instead creating chaotic and unsafe distribution scenarios. They contend that the only effective solution is for Israel to fully open land border crossings and allow for the unhindered, large-scale delivery of aid by truck convoys. The article highlights the severe hunger crisis, with the UN now reporting that a famine scenario is unfolding.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet suggests that walking 7,000 steps per day can provide significant health benefits, challenging the widely-held 10,000-step goal. The research, a meta-analysis of multiple studies, found that achieving 7,000 steps daily was linked to a substantially lower risk of death and cardiovascular disease, making it a more realistic target for many people. The benefits varied by age, with younger adults seeing the most improvement around 5,400 steps, while for older adults, more steps continued to yield greater benefits. The study also reaffirmed that daily walking helps reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.</p>
