          <p>Government data released in Japan indicates that the estimated child population has decreased for the 44th consecutive year, reaching a new record low of 13.66 million as of April 1st. This decline reflects the ongoing struggle to reverse the country's declining birth rate, despite initiatives implemented to provide financial assistance to child-rearing households and expand daycare services. The ratio of children to the overall population has also fallen to a record low of 11.1 percent, which is the second-lowest among 37 nations with a population of at least 40 million, only behind South Korea.

          <p>The death of Kendy Howard in Athol, Idaho, initially reported as a suicide, is now under investigation by "48 Hours" due to suspicious circumstances. Kendy's husband, Dan Howard, a former Idaho State Trooper, called 911 claiming his wife shot herself in the bathtub. Investigators found several inconsistencies at the scene, including broken glass, wet towels, and a running dryer with six minutes left on the cycle which had been started within a minute of the 911 call. The case examines how these clues led authorities to suspect Dan Howard of staging his wife's death.</p>

Kendy was found dead in her bathtub with a gunshot wound to her head, and while the initial call was dispatched as a suicide, investigators grew suspicious due to clues at the scene, including a packed duffle bag and a running dryer.

While some hope for regime change through foreign intervention, others believe change must come from within.

However, a historian warns that military invasion would fail, and a diplomatic resolution would be in line with Iran's national interests, potentially leading to economic opening and more freedom for pro-democratic activities.</p>

          <p>This article critiques the recent panic surrounding ultra-processed baby food pouches, arguing that it's another way of making mothers feel guilty. The author acknowledges concerns about the sugar content and nutritional value of these pouches but questions the moral judgment placed on mothers who use them for convenience. She argues that the debate often ignores the social, political, and economic factors at play, such as the time and labor involved in preparing fresh baby food. The author advocates for a society that supports and facilitates good food choices for parents, rather than shaming them.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's ambition to become prime minister is no longer a wild notion, as his Reform UK party has achieved stunning success in recent elections. The article suggests that Reform is ahead of the Conservatives in the polls and could potentially replace them in the medium term. Reform's challenge is to transition from effective campaigning to running things, proving they can govern beyond promises of cutting waste. The success of Reform is leading politicians in the two traditional parties to consider the depth of public disillusionment with the political system.</p>

          <p>China and Japan have traded accusations after a plane was spotted flying over a disputed island in the East China Sea, reigniting tensions between the two countries. The Chinese coastguard said a routine patrol spotted a Japanese civilian plane flying "illegally" over the airspace of an unnamed island in the Diaoyu chain, known as the Senkakus in Japan. Tokyo lodged its own protest with Beijing, saying four Chinese coastguard ships had been spotted in its “territorial waters” around the islands.</p>

          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's choice of JD Vance as his vice president signaled a shift away from the uneasy alliances of his first term towards a "royal court" of loyalists and enforcers. This choice indicated that Trump's second term would lack the checks and balances that tempered his first, leading to a more disinhibited and reckless presidency. The decision to pick Vance over more moderate choices revealed Trump's preference for those who would not question his authority or challenge his impulses, creating a government structure with fewer constraints.</p>
