          <p>German researchers have announced the discovery of 31 shipwrecks in Lake Constance, a finding that includes two large metal hulls believed to belong to World War II-era paddle steamers. The "Wrecks and Deep Sea" project, initiated in 2022, has been utilizing divers and remotely operated vehicles to investigate underwater anomalies. Among the discoveries is a remarkably well-preserved cargo sailing ship with its mast still intact, protected by the deep water from invasive mussels. The project underscores the lake's role as a historical time capsule, with research efforts scheduled to continue through the summer of 2027.</p>

This vote of confidence comes after a difficult year for UnitedHealth, which has faced a Justice Department investigation and had seen its stock fall by nearly 50% in 2025.

Despite the distressing incident, Semenyo went on to score two goals in the game. The event drew widespread condemnation from both clubs, the Football Association, and anti-discrimination groups, with Liverpool FC stating its full support for an ongoing police investigation.

With its status as the world's second-largest economy and a top trading partner for many Middle Eastern nations, Beijing possesses unique leverage. The article suggests that China could utilize its global influence to advocate for constructive solutions that prevent wider wars and alleviate humanitarian suffering. This contrasts with the West, which the article argues has either failed to prevent or has been involved in multiple simultaneous conflicts in the region.</p>

          <p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that she would nominate Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize if he successfully negotiates an end to the war in Ukraine without Kyiv conceding territory to Russia. Speaking on a podcast during the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, Clinton emphasized that a successful outcome must not validate Russia's aggression or its vision of a "greater Russia." She expressed a hope that Trump would stand up to Putin for the sake of Ukrainian democracy and U.S. security interests. In response, Trump told Fox News that Clinton's remarks were "very nice."</p>

          <p>A recent working paper from the U.S. Census Bureau reveals a significant decline in the number of young adults achieving traditional life milestones such as moving out, securing a job, getting married, and having children. The study found that while nearly half of young adults had met four key milestones in 1975, less than a quarter have done so today. Researchers attribute this shift to increased economic barriers, including the rising cost of living, and changing societal attitudes toward family formation. The report notes that economic stability and educational attainment are now often prioritized over milestones like marriage.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a strategy to make EVs more affordable by offering a simple, customizable pickup truck. The company's basic model is a spare, two-seat vehicle that owners can upgrade with over 100 accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. By minimizing initial manufacturing costs, Slate aims to address the high sticker price that deters many American car shoppers. However, with the rollback of federal EV incentives, the truck's price point may become less competitive against other models in the sub-$30,000 range, such as the Ford Maverick.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering taking a government stake in the struggling chipmaker Intel, a move that some analysts argue is essential for U.S. national security. The potential intervention aims to revitalize the American semiconductor industry and reduce reliance on foreign manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. News of the possible government investment caused Intel's stock to climb, finishing the week up 23%. While government ownership of a private enterprise is unconventional, proponents argue it is necessary to ensure the domestic production of critical technology, especially with the rise of advanced artificial intelligence.

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials fell by 14% after the company issued a weak financial forecast, citing demand pressures and increasing uncertainty in its China business. The company's projected earnings and revenue for the upcoming quarter fell short of analyst expectations. CEO Gary Dickerson attributed the cautious outlook to the current macroeconomic environment and ongoing trade issues, which have reduced visibility. The guidance also reflects a slowdown in spending from clients in China who had previously been ramping up equipment manufacturing at a rapid pace. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has lifted a lower court's injunction, potentially allowing the Trump administration to proceed with its plan to fire 1,500 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). In a split decision, the court ruled that the lower court lacked the jurisdiction to block the mass layoffs. The ruling is a significant development in the administration's effort to overhaul the consumer watchdog agency, which was created after the 2008 financial crisis. Lawyers for the CFPB workers plan to seek a review of the case, but the decision marks a victory for the administration's agenda.</p>

          <p>The cost of preparing a homemade school lunch has risen, according to a new report from Deloitte, which finds the average packed lunch now costs $6.15, up nearly 3% from last year. This increase is driven by general food inflation, with grocery staples like milk and bananas seeing significant price hikes. Cafeteria lunches are also becoming more expensive, with prices at schools up 3.3% since last July. In response, the USDA is increasing funding for school meal programs, and many parents are switching to store brands and cheaper options to manage the rising costs.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Health Forum reveals that children experiencing a mental health crisis frequently become stuck in emergency departments for days while awaiting hospitalization. The research, which analyzed Medicaid data, found that about one in ten pediatric mental health ER visits result in a child boarding for three or more days. The most common reasons for these extended stays were depressive disorders and suicidal ideation. Experts attribute the problem to a nationwide shortage of inpatient psychiatric beds and inadequate outpatient mental health services for children, which can cause conditions to escalate to a crisis point.</p>

The move follows a lawsuit from the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense, which Kennedy founded, demanding the panel be re-established.
