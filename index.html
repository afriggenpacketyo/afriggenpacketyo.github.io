          <p>President Trump announced he has commuted the prison sentence of former New York Republican Congressman George Santos, ordering his immediate release. Santos, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft, was serving an 87-month sentence for charges that led to his expulsion from Congress. Trump cited Santos' alleged "horrible mistreatment" in solitary confinement as a reason for the decision, noting Santos' direct plea for a chance to rebuild. This commutation, distinct from a pardon, means Santos' criminal record will not be wiped clean.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation imposing 25% tariffs on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and their parts, along with 10% tariffs on imported buses. This measure aims to protect U.S. companies and incentivize domestic manufacturing by discouraging the use of foreign materials. The administration will offer credits to manufacturers who import parts to assemble vehicles in the U.S., offsetting tariff liabilities. This policy seeks to bolster American labor and production, ensuring cost competitiveness for domestic automakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Regional banks, including Zions and Western Alliance, are facing investor scrutiny after disclosing significant losses from alleged fraud in loans to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs). JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of potential wider risks, drawing comparisons to the 2023 banking crisis. The incident highlights a rapidly growing, less-regulated lending category that has seen near-total wipeouts on some loans. While some analysts believe the market sell-off was an overreaction, concerns about credit quality and hidden NDFI exposures persist among investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>ESPN host Stephen A. Smith suggested that LeBron James' interactions with critics might be influenced by race, specifically questioning if James confronts white commentators as he did Smith. Smith referenced a past incident where James confronted him over criticisms of his son, Bronny James, emphasizing his professional ethics regarding sports commentary. James, in turn, clarified that he defends his family and players when criticism becomes personal, not when it's about on-court performance. The exchange highlights ongoing tensions between sports figures and media personalities.</p>

          <p>The phrase "6-7" has become a widespread, enigmatic trend among kids and teens, causing both amusement and disruption in classrooms. Originating from Philadelphia rapper Skrilla's song "Doot Doot (6 7)," the artist himself admits it holds no inherent meaning. This lack of definition has allowed the phrase to become a playful, almost secret code, amplified by social media and celebrity endorsements. While some schools have banned it, educators are finding that attempts to suppress it often only fuel its popularity, highlighting a generational desire for lighthearted, collective fun.</p>

          <p>Former National Security Adviser John Bolton has been indicted on 18 counts of systematically sharing classified information with unauthorized relatives while writing a tell-all book. Prosecutors allege Bolton used a group chat to transmit over 1,000 pages of sensitive material, some of which later appeared to be compromised by Iranian hackers. While Bolton claims political retribution from the Trump administration, the detailed indictment, compiled by experienced prosecutors, suggests a "righteous" case distinct from other recent prosecutions.

His initial remarks sparked backlash due to federal laws restricting domestic troop deployment for law enforcement.

          <p>The U.S.-China trade war is characterized by "shock tactics," including blame games, tit-for-tat threats, and erratic meeting schedules between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping. Experts suggest this volatility stems from a disregard for diplomatic norms, leading to mutual misinterpretations. Recent escalations include Trump's salvoes following Beijing's expanded export controls on rare earth minerals, which in turn were triggered by Washington's sanctions on blacklisted firms. This cycle of aggressive actions raises concerns about the prospects for a peaceful resolution to the ongoing trade conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study reveals exciting results for the Galleri blood test, capable of detecting over 50 types of cancer, many of which currently lack screening programs. A North American trial involving 25,000 adults showed the test correctly identified cancer in 62% of positive results, with more than half detected at early, more treatable stages. Made by Grail, the test identifies cancerous DNA fragments in blood, and combined with existing screenings, it significantly increased overall cancer detection. Further research, including a large NHS trial, is needed to confirm its impact on reducing cancer deaths.</p>
