          <h2>Student Loan Collections Resume After Years-Long Pause</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a five-year pause, the Trump administration is restarting student loan collections for millions of borrowers in default, potentially leading to wage garnishment and other severe financial consequences. This shift marks a significant change from the Biden administration's approach, which focused on providing borrowers with more options to manage their debt. Millions of borrowers who had enrolled in the SAVE repayment plan are now in limbo due to GOP-led lawsuits blocking the plan, and the administration has eliminated forgiveness provisions from some repayment plans. The Education Department has also faced staffing cuts, resulting in long wait times for borrowers seeking assistance with their loans, with some reporting hold times of up to eight hours.</p>

          <p>Tesla is experiencing a decline in popularity among its once-devoted fanbase, with many owners selling their cars and investors dumping stock due to disillusionment with the company and CEO Elon Musk. Musk's political activities and work with President Donald Trump have been a breaking point for many, sparking protests at Tesla stores. Disappointed fans trying to sell their used Tesla vehicles are finding that their value has significantly decreased. While Musk has stated his intention to dedicate more time to Tesla, the damage has already been done for many former loyalists who feel betrayed by his actions and decisions.</p>

          <p>After a five-year pause, the federal government is resuming collections on defaulted student loans, impacting over 40 million Americans. This New York Times article highlights the end of pandemic-era relief measures, including payment freezes and interest waivers, which had provided significant financial relief to borrowers. The article addresses the status of loan forgiveness programs, noting the Supreme Court's rejection of President Biden's mass debt cancellation plan and the subsequent expansion of other forgiveness pathways. However, the future of the SAVE income-driven repayment plan remains uncertain due to legal challenges from Republican-led states, leaving millions of borrowers in limbo. The article advises borrowers to check their loan status on StudentAid.gov and download copies of their information to protect against potential data loss during administrative changes.</p>

Three generations of the Royal Family made an appearance at the parade, followed by a flypast of military aircraft, including the Red Arrows.

          <p>The Israeli government has approved plans to capture the entire Gaza Strip and maintain control of the territory indefinitely, a move that is likely to intensify international opposition. This CBS News article reports that the decision follows a Houthi missile strike on Tel Aviv's airport and involves calling up tens of thousands of reservists for an expanded military operation. The plan aims to defeat Hamas and free hostages but will also displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. The European Union has voiced concern, urging restraint, while Israel intends to move Gaza's population for their own protection, according to Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares experienced a significant drop after Warren Buffett's surprise announcement to step down as CEO, ending his 60-year tenure. The company's Class A and Class B shares both fell by nearly 5% following the news that Greg Abel will succeed Buffett as CEO on January 1, 2026, with Buffett remaining as chairman. Despite the decline, some shareholders expressed confidence in the transparent transition and Buffett's continued mentorship of Abel. The change marks the end of an era for Berkshire, which Buffett transformed from a failing textile mill into a $1.2 trillion conglomerate.</p>

          <p>President Trump has made a series of remarks about potentially seeking a third term in office, despite constitutional limitations. This CBS News article outlines Trump's various comments on the issue, ranging from joking suggestions to more serious assertions that "there are methods which you could do it." While some supporters have called for amending the Constitution to allow Trump to serve another term, experts consider this highly unlikely. The president has also downplayed the possibility, stating that he will be a "two-term president" and is not looking to pursue a third term.</p>

          <p>Ekaterina Barabash, a Russian journalist critical of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, has fled to France with the help of Reporters Without Borders (RSF) after facing up to 10 years in prison for criticizing the Russian army. This DW article reports that Barabash described her journey as "very difficult" and said that journalism no longer exists in Russia. RSF director general Thibaut Bruttin stated that Barabash's escape sends a message to the Kremlin that free voices cannot be silenced. Barabash had been detained at Moscow airport and charged with "spreading false information" about the Russian military.</p>

          <p>The U.S. faces increasing difficulties in halting Iran's oil exports to China, a vital economic lifeline for Tehran, despite Washington's efforts to enforce sanctions. This DW article reports that Iran is adapting and thriving in the shadows, exporting an estimated 1.2 million to 1.5 million barrels of crude per day, mostly to China. The article highlights the complex web of clandestine operations, including the use of a "shadow fleet" of tankers and the forging of documentation, that allow Iran to evade detection. The U.S. has lost leverage over China due to the tariff war, diminishing the impact of financial sanctions.</p>

Sudan had requested urgent measures against the UAE, alleging that it was violating the Genocide Convention by supplying weapons to paramilitary forces. The UAE argued that it had entered a "reservation" to a key clause when signing up to the UN's Genocide Convention in 2005, meaning the ICJ had no power to intervene.</p>
