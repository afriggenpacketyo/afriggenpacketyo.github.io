          <p>Alphabet, Google's parent company, announced first-quarter earnings that surpassed revenue expectations, driven by strong growth in search and advertising units despite increasing AI competition; overall revenue increased 12% year-over-year. YouTube advertising revenue fell slightly short of expectations at $8.93 billion, while Google Cloud revenue was marginally below estimates at $12.26 billion, though cloud revenue increased 28% year-over-year with improved margins. Alphabet's AI tool, AI Overviews, now boasts 1.5 billion monthly users, and net income surged by 46% to $34.54 billion, boosted by unrealized gains from private company investments.

          <p>The Trump Organization's online store has begun selling "TRUMP 2028" hats, fueling speculation that President Trump may attempt to run for a third term despite constitutional limitations. The merchandise release follows Trump's earlier remarks teasing a potential third term, prompting debate about the feasibility and legality of such a move. Legal experts emphasize that the 22nd Amendment restricts presidents to two terms, though Trump has alluded to possible "methods" to circumvent this. Democrats have criticized the merchandise as confirmation of a fourth presidential run.</p>

          <p>Robert Crimo III, the perpetrator of the 2022 Highland Park July 4th parade mass shooting, has been sentenced to seven consecutive life sentences without parole, one for each victim he killed, along with additional concurrent sentences for attempted murder. The judge's decision aims to prevent any future appeals or clemency. Crimo, who pleaded guilty to all charges, was absent during most of the sentencing hearing after requesting to speak and then changing his mind, and his attorneys presented no mitigating factors. The shooting led to Illinois passing a statewide assault weapons ban in 2023.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on goods imported from China are threatening the availability and affordability of essential ingredients in Chinese grocery stores, impacting millions of Americans who rely on these stores for cultural foods. The tariffs, which can exceed 160% on some items, are expected to lead to price increases and potential shortages, forcing shoppers to make difficult choices. Small, independent grocery stores catering to ethnic communities are particularly vulnerable. The rising costs of cultural foods could disproportionately affect communities that rely on them for continuity and connection to their heritage.</p>
