          <p>Shares of chip design firm Arm Holdings fell by as much as 9% in after-hours trading following its first-quarter earnings announcement. The company's revenue of $1.05 billion slightly missed analyst expectations, and its net income saw a significant 42% decrease compared to the previous year. Executives cited weaker-than-expected growth in the smartphone sector's royalty business as a key factor for the disappointing results. Arm also confirmed it is exploring designing its own processors, a strategic shift that could introduce execution risks by turning current customers into competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Colorado jury has found dentist James Craig guilty of murdering his wife, Angela Craig, sentencing him to life in prison without parole. The investigation began after Angela Craig's health mysteriously deteriorated over several weeks, leading to her death in March 2023. Police alleged that her husband had administered poison, including arsenic and potassium cyanide, through her daily protein shakes. A key piece of evidence was a package of potassium cyanide delivered to his dental office, which a colleague reported to authorities after becoming suspicious about Angela's symptoms, ultimately unraveling the plot.</p>

          <p>Former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas was arrested and charged with conspiracy for his alleged role in running high-stakes, illegal poker games from an Encino mansion he owned. Prosecutors claim Arenas rented the property between 2021 and 2022 for the games, where players were charged a fee and women were hired to provide "companionship." The indictment details text messages where Arenas discussed game arrangements and custom poker tables. Arenas pleaded not guilty to charges including operating an illegal gambling business and making false statements to federal investigators during the subsequent inquiry.</p>

In exchange, the university has committed to several policy changes regarding women's sports, antisemitism, and admissions, and will donate $50 million to local workforce development programs. The deal resolves pending federal investigations and ends a grant freeze that was costing the university over $3 million per week. Brown's president stated the agreement was necessary to end financial uncertainty while preserving the university's academic integrity, though it includes concessions on administration priorities.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company has reinstated its full-year financial guidance after suspending it due to tariff uncertainty, now estimating a net $2 billion impact from the levies. The automaker reported second-quarter revenue that surpassed expectations but also noted a net loss of $36 million, partly due to recall-related charges. The new guidance projects adjusted earnings of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion, which is lower than its pre-tariff forecast. CEO Jim Farley expressed that the company is in constructive communication with the Trump administration to mitigate the financial pressures from tariffs on imported parts.

This achievement solidifies Microsoft and Nvidia as the two most valuable companies, pulling ahead of Apple in the market capitalization rankings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has filed a formal misconduct complaint against federal Judge James Boasberg, an unusual move targeting a sitting judge. The complaint accuses Boasberg of making improper public comments critical of President Trump and alleges bias in his rulings concerning the administration's deportation policies. This action follows courtroom clashes where the judge criticized the government's handling of a case involving deported Venezuelan migrants. Legal experts suggest the complaint, particularly the parts challenging the judge's rulings, may be misdirected and that such issues are typically handled through the appeals process rather than misconduct complaints.</p>

          <p>A New Mexico judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin, in which he alleged malicious prosecution by state officials regarding the fatal 2021 "Rust" film set shooting. Baldwin had sued prosecutors and law enforcement, claiming he was made a celebrity scapegoat after involuntary manslaughter charges against him were dropped last year. The judge dismissed the civil suit due to a lack of significant action in the case over a six-month period, though Baldwin's lawyers have 30 days to file a motion to revive it.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores why intensely stressful television shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt" have become so popular with audiences. These series use hyperrealistic filmmaking techniques, such as long, unbroken takes, to immerse viewers in high-pressure environments like a chaotic kitchen or a busy emergency room. Psychologists suggest that watching such scenarios can induce a form of "vicarious stress," a fight-or-flight response that can be satisfying because it carries no real-world risk. The trend may also reflect a cultural shift away from pure escapism, with viewers finding catharsis in seeing relatable characters navigate realistic, high-stakes workplace challenges.</p>

          <p>A group of twelve Democratic House members has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unlawfully blocked them from conducting oversight visits at immigrant detention facilities. The lawsuit claims that despite federal law guaranteeing them access, the lawmakers were repeatedly denied entry when attempting to investigate conditions such as overcrowding and lack of medical care. The plaintiffs, including several high-ranking committee members, are demanding that the administration comply with the law and cease obstructing congressional oversight of these federally operated centers.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Imposes Tariffs and Sanctions on Brazil Over Bolsonaro Case</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 17:40:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is escalating pressure on Brazil by imposing 50% tariffs and sanctioning a Supreme Court justice, Alexandre de Moraes. These actions are seen as an attempt to interfere in the criminal case against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right ally of Trump, who is accused of planning a coup. The administration has labeled the prosecution a "witch hunt" and is using economic leverage to influence the outcome. Brazil's government has so far responded with defiance, as the trial against Bolsonaro continues amid rising domestic political support for President Lula da Silva.</p>

          <p>A massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami waves across the Pacific, but the threat to Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast has largely passed. Initial warnings and evacuation orders in Hawaii were downgraded to advisories and later canceled, with only minor flooding and small waves reported. While alerts remained in effect for a time along the West Coast, most were lifted by Wednesday afternoon. However, several South American countries, including Chile and Colombia, issued new warnings and ordered evacuations of coastal areas as the tsunami continued to propagate across the ocean.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris has officially announced she will not be a candidate for governor of California in the upcoming election, ending months of speculation about her political future. The former vice president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee stated that her public service will not be in elected office for now, leaving the race to lead the nation's most populous state wide open. Harris's decision was highly anticipated and had effectively frozen the field of potential candidates, as polls showed her as the top choice among Californians. She indicated she will focus on helping elect Democrats nationwide.</p>

          <p>This article advocates for greater recognition of independent and avant-garde artists at the Latin Grammy Awards, which often favor major commercial acts. It highlights six specific artists from across Latin America whose innovative work during the 2024-25 season merits consideration. Among those featured are Argentine digital artist Juana Aguirre, Chilean songwriter Gepe, and Guatemalan-born cellist Mabe Fratti. The piece argues that their forward-facing and creatively rich albums deserve to be celebrated in major categories, pushing the boundaries of what is typically acknowledged by the Latin Recording Academy and reflecting the genre's true diversity.</p>

Nezza stated her performance was a response to ongoing immigration sweeps in Los Angeles and an act of solidarity with the Latino community.

          <p>NFL legend Tom Brady, a minority owner of Birmingham City Football Club, is shown questioning former manager Wayne Rooney's work ethic in a new Amazon documentary. In the series, Brady expresses concern about Rooney's attitude during his brief, unsuccessful tenure as the team's head coach in late 2023. The documentary also captures Brady calling the team's players "lazy and entitled" following a visit to the training ground. Rooney's 83-day stint as manager saw the club plummet in the standings, ultimately contributing to their relegation to League One at the end of the season.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that while Americans' views of the national economy have slightly improved, a majority remain concerned about future price increases. Two-thirds of respondents expect the cost of goods to rise in the coming months, a sentiment that is dampening their financial outlook and spending plans, especially for lower-income households. Although ratings for the stock market have become more positive, this has not significantly boosted overall economic confidence. The survey suggests that personal experiences with inflation continue to have a stronger impact on public sentiment than stock market performance.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's grand strategy to pivot U.S. foreign policy to focus solely on containing China has largely failed. The premise that America could disengage from conflicts in Europe and the Middle East has proven unrealistic. Instead of ending the war in Ukraine, the administration has escalated its commitment due to domestic and allied pressure. Similarly, strikes against Iran have deepened U.S. entanglement in the Middle East, diverting military and diplomatic resources that were intended for countering Beijing. These ongoing crises have drained American power, undermining the single-minded focus on China.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 50% tariff on specific copper products, including pipes, tubes, and wiring, set to begin this week. The move, intended to protect national security, fell short of the sweeping restrictions on all copper imports that President Trump had previously suggested. By excluding raw materials like copper ore and cathodes, the policy primarily aids domestic manufacturers rather than the mining industry. The surprise announcement caused U.S. copper prices to fall significantly as the market had been anticipating a much broader levy that would have included major suppliers from Chile and Peru.

          <p>This political analysis suggests that by declining to run for California governor, Kamala Harris has strategically kept the door open for a potential 2028 presidential bid. Running for governor would have likely required her to forswear a presidential campaign and presented the practical difficulty of governing the nation's largest state while campaigning nationally. While she would enter a 2028 Democratic primary with high name recognition, she would also face a potentially crowded field and questions about the 2024 election loss. The decision avoids these immediate hurdles and allows her to chart a different path toward a possible future White House run.</p>
