          <h2>UK Government Borrowing Exceeds Expectations in April</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate that the UK government's borrowing was higher than expected in April, reaching Â£20.2 billion, a Â£1 billion increase from the previous year. This figure surpasses analysts' predictions of Â£17.9 billion. The Office for National Statistics reported that this is the fourth-highest April borrowing figure since monthly records began in 1993. The difference between government spending and tax income is the key factor contributing to this increased borrowing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A landmark review suggests that violent prisoners, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, could be released after serving only a third of their sentence to alleviate prison overcrowding. The Independent Sentencing Review also suggests managing more offenders in the community and expanding a chemical castration pilot scheme for sexual offenders. Former Lord Chancellor David Gauke, who chaired the review, emphasized the need for major reforms to address dangerous prison conditions and high reoffending rates. The government is expected to accept some measures, with further details in a future sentencing bill.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's rally continued, reaching a new record high above $111,000 before slightly decreasing. The price surge is attributed to positive momentum, growing optimism regarding U.S. crypto regulation, and sustained interest from institutional buyers. According to CoinShares, broader macro concerns, including Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. This price increase occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, indicating investors are seeking alternative stores of value. (not investment advice)</p>

Kato expressed concerns about the impact of U.S. tariffs on the global economy, emphasizing that tariffs are an inappropriate tool for addressing trade imbalances.

The study highlights the increasing frequency of wildfire smoke events and their severe impacts on public health, particularly for vulnerable populations.

Diminishing stockpiles of military equipment and challenges in recruiting soldiers are straining Russia's war-focused economy. International sanctions, rampant inflation, and high production costs are also contributing to a marked slowdown in the Russian economy. Tighter sanctions on Russia's shadow fleet and declining oil prices further exacerbate the situation.</p>

          <p>Martin Kettle argues that the UK faces growing divisions, particularly economic, that threaten its stability.

Collaboration between different parts of the UK's devolved system of governance is crucial for achieving government priorities and restoring public confidence in politics.</p>

These waivers allow California to set stricter emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue they have the authority to overturn these waivers, while Democrats contend it's an illegal overreach.

          <p>Chronic water shortages in Gaza are worsening due to Israel's military offensive, causing displacement and fuel shortages for desalination and hygiene plants. The UN warns that a complete shutdown of water and sanitation facilities is possible without immediate fuel deliveries. Israel's blockade has cut off power lines to main desalination plants, a critical water source. Parents report children drinking salty water, leading to kidney complaints. The escalating conflict and displacement make water distribution increasingly challenging.</p>

          <p>Thursday's newspaper headlines are dominated by Keir Starmer's "U-turn" on winter fuel payments and Donald Trump's "ambush" of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. The Times reports pensioners will wait over a year for fuel payments to be reinstated. The Financial Times highlights Starmer bowing to pressure from Labour MPs after local election losses. The Guardian notes the government's climbdown will help head off a backbench rebellion. Several papers also feature Trump confronting Ramaphosa with a video alleging white farmers in South Africa are being murdered.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reprimanded officials following a "serious accident" during the launch of a new destroyer, calling it an intolerable "criminal act."

          <p>Scientists are warning that a 1,000-foot-tall "mega-tsunami" could potentially devastate parts of America's West Coast if a major earthquake occurs along the Cascadia subduction zone. A recent study estimates a 15 percent chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years. The earthquake could cause coastal land to sink and trigger waves reaching up to 1,000 feet, posing a significant threat to cities like Seattle and Portland. The scientists emphasize the need for preparedness and mitigation efforts.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has initiated a revamped gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to ease cost-of-living pressures ahead of a parliamentary election. The subsidy will provide a fixed sum regardless of prices, which have recently dropped below the previous benchmark. The government aims to reduce the wholesale gasoline price gradually, with price reductions expected to reach gas stations in a few weeks. The program has allocated around 1 trillion yen and could last until March 2026.</p>
