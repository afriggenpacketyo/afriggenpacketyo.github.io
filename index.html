          <p>David Beckham and Gary Neville have completed a takeover of Salford City, acquiring the remaining shares from their Class of '92 teammates. Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, and Phil Neville are no longer shareholders but will maintain roles in technical, football, commercial, recruitment, and foundation aspects of the club. Beckham expressed pride in joining Neville in this new chapter for Salford, which achieved four promotions in five seasons after the Class of '92's initial involvement in 2014, though they missed the League Two play-offs this past season by a single point. The new ownership group also includes former banker Lord Mervyn Davies and businessman Declan Kelly, signaling a broader investment and management structure for the club's future.</p>

          <p>Toyota announced that President Trump's tariffs are expected to cost the automaker $1.3 billion over two months, specifically April and May. The tariffs, which include a 25% levy on imported vehicles, are impacting Toyota's profits, though the company is hesitant to predict future tariff impacts. Other automakers like General Motors and Ford have also reported significant financial hits and potential price increases due to the tariffs. While Toyota is considering appropriate actions, CEO Koji Sato emphasized the company's reluctance to hastily raise prices in response to the tariffs, which consulting firms estimate could increase car prices by $2,000 to $12,000 for consumers.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first deal since the implementation of new tariffs. The agreement maintains a 10% tariff on UK imports but adjusts tariffs on UK autos, allowing the first 100,000 vehicles to be imported at a 10% rate, with higher rates thereafter. The deal aims to create a $5 billion export opportunity for U.S. farmers and streamline customs procedures. While the UK Prime Minister hailed the deal, some experts caution that this approach may not be easily replicable with countries having larger trade surpluses with the U.S. The article notes that UK duties on U.S. goods are expected to decrease from 5.1% to 1.8%.</p>

          <p>President Trump withdrew his nomination of Ed Martin, a conservative Republican, for the position of U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., following opposition from Senator Thom Tillis due to Martin's defense of January 6 rioters. Martin, who served as interim U.S. attorney, had overseen the firing of prosecutors involved in January 6 cases and faced scrutiny for his association with individuals holding antisemitic views. Despite Trump's initial support, the lack of Senate confirmation prospects led to the withdrawal, with Trump suggesting Martin might find another role in his administration. The article highlights Martin's controversial actions, including attempts to investigate political opponents and issue unusual directives, contributing to low morale within the U.S. attorney's office.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government is facing a growing rebellion from within its own party over planned welfare cuts. Forty-two Labour MPs have voiced their concerns over the proposed £5 billion annual welfare savings by 2030, arguing that these cuts will disproportionately affect disabled people. The MPs are urging ministers to delay any decisions until a comprehensive impact assessment on employment and health is completed. While the government insists the reforms will help people find work, critics argue that cuts will only exacerbate hardship, representing the biggest attack on the welfare state in recent years.</p>

          <p>Economists are revising their forecasts for interest rate cuts due to President Trump's tariffs, which have increased the risk of higher inflation and slower economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the need to assess the impact of the policies before making any decisions on interest rates, acknowledging the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. While some economists anticipate a rate cut as early as September, others predict a later start date or even no cuts until 2026.

          <p>Former CDC staff are warning of a 'five alarm fire' due to widespread firings, reductions in force, and buyouts since January, as part of the Trump administration's plan to reduce the size of the federal government.

          <p>A Lords committee heard that home working has led to a decline in after-work drinking in city centers outside London, as spending data suggests that in the capital, post-work drinks have switched from Friday to Thursday. A similar shift is not seen in other large British cities, where spending in bars is more likely to shift into the weekend. The data analyzed by the Centre for Cities showed that 32% of weekly pub spending in big cities outside London now takes place on a Saturday, suggesting workers are more likely to return on weekends to socialize than in the capital.</p>

The authors argue that the cost of opposition has risen, forcing Americans to think twice about engaging in what should be constitutionally protected activities, and that a collective defense of democracy is needed to reverse this trend.</p>
