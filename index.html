Norris acknowledged errors on his final run, while Verstappen cited challenges with Turn One, indicating that McLaren's car performed exceptionally well.

          <p>The European Union criticized President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel imports from 25% to 50%, warning it undermines efforts to reach a negotiated solution in the ongoing trade war. An EU spokesperson stated that the decision adds further uncertainty to the global economy and increases costs for consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The EU is prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to the latest U.S. tariff increase, with consultations on expanded measures currently being finalized. The United Steelworkers union also criticized Trump's announcement, calling it a direct attack on Canadian industries and workers. (not investment advice)</p>

The author argues that NOAA's tools and observations are crucial for accurate hurricane forecasting, and cutting the agency could lead to deadly surprise hurricanes. The National Weather Service provides warnings and data essential for local broadcasts and weather apps. The author contends that gutting an agency protecting coastlines from disasters is not in the best interest of the economy or national security.</p>

          <p>Hailstones can grow to the size of golf balls or even grapefruits, causing significant damage. Hail begins as tiny ice crystals swept into a thunderstorm's updraft, growing as they collide with supercooled water. Supercells, rotating and long-lived thunderstorms, often produce the largest hail due to strong updrafts. Climate change may be worsening hailstorms by increasing warm, humid air and unstable air masses. Staying safe during a hailstorm involves seeking sturdy shelter, staying away from windows, and knowing your insurance coverage.</p>
