          <p>The Justice Department is investigating whether California's law allowing transgender athletes on female sports teams violates federal civil rights law. The investigation was disclosed to California's attorney general a day after President Trump threatened to revoke federal funding from the state if it ignored his executive order banning transgender athletes from women's sports. The probe will examine whether California's School Success and Opportunity Act conflicts with Title IX, which bans sex discrimination in schools receiving federal funding. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon stated the division will aggressively defend women's rights to equal educational opportunities, highlighting the administration's stance on protecting female athletes.</p>

          <p>Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic New York Governor Kathy Hochul are in a dispute over the cancelled Constitution Pipeline, potentially impacting Coterra Energy. The pipeline project resurfaced after Trump lifted a stop-work order on the Empire Wind 1 project, with Coterra CEO Tom Jorden emphasizing the pipeline's importance for delivering natural gas to the New England market. If revived, Coterra, which has shifted its focus towards natural gas, could significantly benefit from the pipeline's capacity to transport gas from its Marcellus Shale properties. Roth analyst Leo Mariani predicts a bull market for gas, setting a price target on Coterra higher than the Club's, suggesting potential gains for the company.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance addressed the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas, asserting that the cryptocurrency industry now has a champion in the White House with President Trump. The Trump administration aims to ease regulations, promote growth, and mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which Vance personally backs, viewing them as a hedge against bad policymaking and inflation. Vance urged Congress to pass the GENIUS Act, creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, which the administration sees as a force multiplier for economic might. The conference also featured other Trump allies who have invested in crypto ventures, signaling the administration's growing embrace of digital assets. (not investment advice)</p>

Philip Chao, a certified financial planner, suggests this move signals to employers that they can add digital assets to 401(k) lineups without consequence, but believes this sends the wrong message.

          <p>President Trump has suggested redirecting $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools, but education experts say this faces significant legal and practical obstacles. Harvard receives federal grants through a competitive process for specific research purposes, requiring specialized faculty, facilities, and staff. Trade schools, which focus on vocational training, typically lack the infrastructure for such research, making a direct transfer of funds infeasible. Experts argue that redirecting funds would require evidence that Harvard's grants were improperly awarded, which has not been alleged, while also stating that the money that has been awarded to Harvard is awarded because they competitively applied for, and were awarded, scientific research funding, which is what it overwhelmingly is.</p>

The World Travel & Tourism Council estimates the U.S. economy could lose $12.5 billion in spending from international visitors in 2025, directly affecting communities, jobs, and businesses across the country.

The Congressional Budget Office projects the bill will raise the federal budget deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years.

          <p>Financial experts advise recent college graduates to begin saving for retirement immediately to take advantage of compound interest and long-term market benefits. Despite potential financial constraints, establishing an investment routine early is crucial for long-term financial stability. Investors should focus on low-cost index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in broad market indexes, with a heavier tilt towards stocks for younger investors. While market volatility may seem daunting, time in the market is more important than timing the market, emphasizing the importance of consistent investing habits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's tax bill includes a 3.5% tax on remittances made by non-US citizens, which is expected to negatively affect African economies. Remittances are a significant source of income for many African families, often exceeding aid and foreign direct investment. The tax could lead migrants to seek unofficial channels to avoid the levy, reducing the flow of recorded transactions. Some countries, like Lesotho and Somalia, are particularly reliant on remittances, with these transfers representing a substantial portion of their GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

This expansion comes amid regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles, despite Toyota's continued investment in EVs.
