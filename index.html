          <p>Tensions rise between Iran and Britain as both countries summon each other's envoys following the arrest of three Iranians in the UK on espionage charges.

The individuals, who sought asylum in the UK, are accused of surveilling journalists associated with Iran International.

The plan also faces criticism for potentially benefiting middle-income earners more than low-income individuals.

          <p>The WNBA is investigating allegations of racist comments made by a fan toward Chicago Sky star Angel Reese during a game against the Indiana Fever. The league and both teams have condemned the alleged misconduct. The incident occurred during a game that was already marked by heightened attention due to the rivalry between Reese and Caitlin Clark. The WNBA has launched the “No Space for Hate” campaign to combat hate and promote tolerance.</p>

          <p>Israel has permitted five UN lorries carrying humanitarian aid into Gaza after an 11-week blockade, but the UN calls it a "drop in the ocean" compared to the urgent needs of the population. The decision followed pressure from US senators, and Netanyahu stated that deliveries would continue until alternative distribution hubs are established. Meanwhile, Israeli air strikes continue, and the military has ordered evacuations in Khan Younis. The blockade has caused severe shortages of food, medicine, and fuel, leading to warnings of famine.</p>
