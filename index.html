          <p>The 2025 Met Gala, benefiting The Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, maintains its hefty price tag, with individual tickets costing $75,000 and tables starting at $350,000, and attendance is by invitation only. This year's theme, "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," marks the first Met exhibit dedicated exclusively to Black designers and menswear in over two decades. The event has already raised a record $31 million for the Costume Institute, and the host committee includes figures like Simone Biles, Spike Lee, and Janelle MonÃ¡e. A counter-event, The Debt Gala, will be held in Brooklyn to raise funds for medical debt relief in marginalized communities.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares experienced a drop as investors reacted to Warren Buffett's announcement of stepping down as CEO, with Greg Abel slated to take over on January 1, 2026, though Buffett will remain chairman. The transition marks the end of Buffett's 60-year leadership of the conglomerate, which has grown from a failing textile mill into a $1.2 trillion juggernaut. Despite the share decline, analysts view the transparent transition positively, noting Buffett's continued role as chairman will allow him to mentor Abel and provide guidance on major capital allocation decisions. Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Macrae Sykes believes shareholders should have confidence that Buffett isn't going anywhere.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA following ongoing delays and cancellations at Newark Liberty International Airport, which have significantly impacted hundreds of flights and are expected to worsen during the summer. Schumer attributes the problems to a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, old technology, DOGE cuts to the FAA, and critical leadership vacancies. He criticizes the FAA's decision to offer bonuses to air traffic controllers at other towers but not in Washington, Philadelphia, or New York, where the need is greatest. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to release details of a new plan to revamp the air traffic control system this week.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts warn that the restart of "involuntary collections" on defaulted federal student loans by the U.S. Department of Education is likely to have a severe negative impact on borrowers' credit scores. A TransUnion analysis reveals that consumers facing default have seen their credit scores fall by an average of 63 points, with super prime borrowers experiencing drops of up to 175 points. The higher the initial credit score, the more significant the drop, potentially making it difficult for borrowers to obtain credit or secure favorable interest rates on loans. Bankrate's Ted Rossman emphasizes that even a single derogatory mark can have a jarring impact on those with excellent credit.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is encouraging global business leaders to invest in the United States, despite concerns about President Trump's trade policies, arguing that the administration's economic plans extend beyond trade and will yield long-term benefits. Speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference, Bessent highlighted plans to cut taxes and regulations to spur job creation and output. He defended tariffs as a means to encourage direct investment in the U.S., promising a favorable tax and regulatory environment. Bessent's comments aim to reassure investors amid growing wariness of Trump's policies, which have led to market volatility and downgraded economic outlooks from organizations like the International Monetary Fund.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is restarting student loan collections for millions of borrowers in default after a five-year pause, coinciding with significant changes and disruptions to the lending system. Borrowers who enrolled in the Biden administration's SAVE repayment plan face uncertainty due to GOP-led lawsuits blocking the plan, potentially forcing them into other repayment options with higher monthly bills. The administration has also eliminated forgiveness provisions from some repayment plans and reduced staff at the Education Department, leading to long wait times for borrowers seeking assistance. Borrowers in default may experience a decline in their credit scores as a result of the resumed collections efforts.</p>

Critics, including Senator Bernie Sanders, have condemned Trump's comments as demonstrating a lack of understanding of the struggles faced by working-class families.

          <p>The UK government has confirmed that proposed film tariffs by President Trump will be part of ongoing trade negotiations with the US, following Trump's announcement of a potential 100% charge on foreign-made films. UK filmmakers are expressing concerns that the tariffs could severely impact the industry, potentially leading to job losses for freelancers and a "knock-out blow" to the sector, which is still recovering from Covid and a recent slowdown. The UK film sector is worth Â£1.36 billion and employs over 195,000 people. The UK government says it will take a calm and steady approach to talks and aim to find a resolution to help ease the pressure on UK businesses and consumers.</p>

The transaction occurs during a challenging period for the retail and footwear industries, which are affected by discretionary spending and President Trump's trade war. Skechers had previously signed onto a letter requesting an exemption from Trump's tariffs and withdrew its full-year 2025 guidance due to macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies.</p>

          <p>Critics argue that President Trump's proposed 100% tariff on foreign movies, citing a threat to national security, reveals a lack of understanding and a xenophobic attitude towards international film production. The tariff, aimed at purportedly American productions shooting overseas for tax incentives, is seen as a simplistic solution that ignores the complex financial and creative realities of the industry. Concerns are raised about the potential return to pandemic-style productions relying on soundstages and green screens, and the loss of visually spectacular location shoots around the world.

Hess argues that the illusion of control is sold through apps, gadgets, and experts, promising insights into sleeping habits and developing psyches. The review highlights the commodification of parental helplessness and the pressure to resolve the 'problem' of parenting with techniques that stamp out childishness. Hess's work recognizes the anxieties of modern parents while cautioning against the notion that more information equates to better parenting, emphasizing that babies don't conform to optimization.</p>

          <p>Social media platforms like Meta and TikTok are shifting away from traditional fact-checking and adopting community-based moderation systems, such as Community Notes, to combat misinformation. Meta's decision to end its fact-checking program is framed as a return to free expression, while TikTok is testing its own version of Community Notes called Footnotes. These systems rely on users to correct each other's posts, with algorithms prioritizing notes that are rated as helpful by a diverse group of people. While these tools may foster a culture of responsibility and offer a cost-effective alternative to professional fact-checkers, they may struggle to counter sophisticated disinformation campaigns and penalize repeat offenders.</p>

          <p>Israel's government approved plans for its forces to capture the entire Gaza Strip, potentially exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in the region, which has already displaced over 90% of the population. The plans also involve keeping Hamas from distributing humanitarian aid, with Israel accusing the group of keeping aid for itself. The U.N. has criticized the proposed Israeli plan to control aid distribution through private security companies, stating that it violates its core principles. The memo says the U.S. government has voiced clear support for Israel's plan.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering declaring a national emergency to impose a 100% tariff on foreign movies, citing a threat to national security due to other countries offering incentives for film production. This action could be the ninth formal national emergency declared by Trump, following similar measures on issues ranging from energy to border security. The potential move has impacted Hollywood studio stocks, with shares of companies like Netflix, Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery declining in early trading. Canada is a key destination for Hollywood film and television productions (with the nation indeed offering generous incentives), and Trumpâ€™s post comes as the president is set to meet Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House on Tuesday.</p>

          <p>A European Central Bank assessment indicates that European consumers are increasingly avoiding U.S. products and services due to President Trump's trade war, with a preference to move away from U.S. products and brands altogether, no matter what the cost. The ECB found that even a 5 percent tax on American products would deter Europeans, and that the sentiment has hardened due to Trump's treatment of America's allies. Apps have been developed to help consumers identify and avoid American products, and Facebook groups promote alternatives to U.S. brands.

The decline in News Corporation's influence is attributed to the fragmentation of media and the rise of distrust in mainstream media.
