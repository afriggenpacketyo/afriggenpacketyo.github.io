Jacob Fearnley, another British player, also progressed with a win over Alex Bolt. Evans' win marks his first against a top-20 player since 2023. Norrie's aspirations to replicate his 2021 final appearance were dashed by 19-year-old Jakub Mensik.

          <p>Following the fatal shootings of Minnesota state assemblywoman Melissa Hortman and her husband, along with the wounding of state Senator John Hoffman and his wife, House Republicans held a tense conference call with security officials. Members voiced concerns about safety in their districts, requesting increased protection, which law enforcement officials said would require more funding from Congress. Senators will also receive a briefing on security matters. Vance Boelter faces multiple federal charges in connection with the shootings, which are being described as "political assassinations," and Michigan Democratic Rep. Hillary Scholten postponed a town hall event after learning she was on a list connected to the shooting. The number of threats against members of Congress has risen in the past two years.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is contemplating expanding its travel ban to include up to 36 additional countries, according to a State Department memo. These countries, primarily in Africa, Central Asia, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Islands, are identified as having deficient vetting and screening processes. The memo requires these nations to address U.S. concerns, including issues related to terrorism, unreliable identity documents, and high visa overstay rates. Failure to comply could result in a travel ban recommendation as early as August. Critics have previously condemned Trump's travel bans as discriminatory, while the administration asserts that limiting entry from these countries will enhance national security.</p>

          <p>Israel has reportedly attacked Iranian state television and issued evacuation warnings to parts of Tehran after accusing Iran of targeting Israeli civilians. The strike on Iranian state television disrupted a live broadcast, causing damage and casualties.

The U.S. State Department raised its travel advisory for Israel to the highest level, urging citizens not to travel there.

          <p>The U.S. Army is restructuring its approach to technology acquisition, aiming to move faster and cut costs to adapt to the changing landscape of modern warfare. The Army Transformation Initiative will shift defense dollars to products that can be made quickly and cheaply. This initiative involves trimming some jobs and repositioning others. The goal is to move beyond the rigid, years-long acquisition process and infuse formations with technology that will be effective on the battlefield.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his commitment to expanding deportation efforts in major U.S. cities, particularly those governed by Democrats. Speaking at the G7 summit in Alberta, Trump stated that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should focus on cities with "sanctuary cities." These comments follow a social media post where Trump announced his intention to oversee the largest mass deportation program in history. The president accused Democrats of using illegal immigration to influence elections and grow the welfare state, claims that are unsubstantiated. Trump's stance comes after protests against his administration's immigration policies and a shift in his approach to undocumented workers in the farming and hospitality industries.</p>

Hamzah Nanabawa, Akeel's brother, expressed frustration with the lack of UK leadership and support in India.
