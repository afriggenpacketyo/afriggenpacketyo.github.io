          <p>Thousands of Bulgarian nationalists marched in Sofia and other cities to protest Bulgaria's planned adoption of the euro, demanding a referendum on the issue. Critics fear economic harm and mistrust institutions, fueled by disinformation campaigns alleging the euro will increase poverty. Bulgarian President Rumen Radev supports the referendum, citing public concerns about inflation and purchasing power, but parliament rejected the proposal, accusing Radev of pro-Russian sentiments. The controversy highlights the challenges of economic transition and the influence of misinformation in shaping public opinion in Bulgaria, one of the EU's poorest members. The people are concerned about the instability of their economy in the wake of the upcoming changes. </p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the latest U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal, reiterating demands for a permanent ceasefire, complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and continuous humanitarian aid. The group's hostage exchange proposal includes releasing 10 living and 18 dead hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, but U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff deemed Hamas's response "completely unacceptable," urging them to agree to the U.S. framework. Meanwhile, Israeli forces have reportedly killed at least 60 Palestinians in Gaza in the past 24 hours. The ongoing conflict has resulted in over 54,000 Palestinian deaths since Hamas's initial attack on Israel, underscoring the urgent need for a resolution, though the current proposal remains contentious. </p>

          <p>Ncuti Gatwa has left his role as the Doctor after two series, regenerating into Billie Piper in a shocking twist during the series finale of Doctor Who. Piper, who previously played companion Rose Tyler, will be the second woman to portray the Doctor, following Jodie Whittaker. Gatwa's tenure lasted only 18 months, making it the shortest since Christopher Eccleston's departure after one series in 2005. Piper had previously expressed doubts about playing the Doctor herself, despite advocating for a female lead after Peter Capaldi's exit, but the BBC has confirmed that she is indeed the new Doctor and will be taking on the role moving forward.</p>

          <p>The Independent reports that obese patients in England and Wales are being denied knee and hip replacements by the NHS based on BMI, contradicting NICE guidance. Patients must lose weight before being eligible, but NHS weight loss programs have long waiting lists, leaving many in pain and without access to necessary care. The Royal College of Surgeons criticizes the policy, warning it could worsen patients' mobility and health. This cost-cutting measure highlights the difficult choices the NHS faces amid rising obesity rates and strained resources. </p>

Beekeepers assisted in the rescue effort to re-hive the bees and locate their queen, with the road closed for about 24 hours during the operation. Officials initially reported a much higher number of escaped bees, but later corrected the figure with assistance from a beekeeper on the scene. By morning, most of the bees were expected to return to their hives, and the road was reopened. </p>

Despite increased costs across the board, the Melos aim to maintain a 20-30% profit margin per item.

          <p>Millions of bees escaped from an overturned truck in Washington state, leading authorities to issue warnings for the public to avoid the area. The truck was hauling approximately 70,000 pounds of active honey bee hives when it flipped over near the Canadian border. Emergency officials and beekeepers worked to save as many bees as possible, closing the site of the crash until the rescue was complete. The incident highlights the challenges of transporting large quantities of bees and the potential risks to public safety. </p>

          <p>Experts are criticizing Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s focus on environmental toxins as the primary cause of autism, arguing that genetics play a more significant role. Kennedy has declared autism an "epidemic" and launched a federal effort to investigate environmental factors, but scientists emphasize that autism is largely driven by genetics, with hundreds of genes associated with the condition. Researchers fear that Kennedy's fixation on toxins could divert resources from genetic research, which has led to the development of promising new therapies. They suggest that the increase in autism rates is mainly due to broader diagnostic criteria and increased awareness rather than a single environmental cause. </p>
