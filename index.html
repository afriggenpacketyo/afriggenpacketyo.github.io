          <p>Following their victory in the Euro 2025 final, England's Under-21 football team has drawn attention to the potential of its young stars. The article analyzes which players, such as Tino Livramento and Harvey Elliott, might transition to the senior squad for the upcoming World Cup. It contrasts this potential with historical trends, noting that many past U21 champions did not go on to have significant senior careers. The piece reflects on the Football Association's development strategy since 2012, which has yielded consistent success at youth levels, building an expectation of winning for England's emerging talent.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials have reported that Russia launched its most massive aerial assault of the war, deploying over 500 drones and missiles across the country. The attack targeted multiple regions, including areas far from the front line, resulting in at least two civilian deaths and several injuries. A significant fire broke out at an industrial facility in the Lviv region, and power was disrupted. Amid the assault, Ukraine's air force confirmed the loss of an F-16 fighter jet and its pilot while repelling the attack, highlighting the intense and widespread nature of the latest Russian offensive.</p>

          <p>Following a U.S. attack on three Iranian nuclear sites, descriptions of the damage from the Trump administration have shifted throughout the week, creating uncertainty about the operation's success. Initially, President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed the sites were "obliterated," but subsequent intelligence reports suggested the setback to Iran's program might only be months. Officials later offered more nuanced assessments, acknowledging the difficulty in confirming the destruction, particularly at the fortified Fordo facility. The administration also began emphasizing that the strike successfully prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, shifting the stated goal from complete destruction of the nuclear program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that California's public and cultural identity, shaped heavily by early 20th-century scholars, systematically erases authentic Native American history. The author points out how visitor guides, local histories, and even university projects often present a sanitized version of the past, ignoring the violence of colonization and the continued presence and resistance of Indigenous tribes. The article highlights the role of institutions like UC Berkeley in both plundering Indigenous sites and creating a narrative of disappearance. This historical amnesia, the author contends, distorts a basic understanding of American history and perpetuates harmful myths.</p>

          <p>The recent U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities exemplifies what the article calls President Trump's "One-and-Done Doctrine" for military force. This approach favors discrete, high-impact strikes over sustained campaigns, reflecting Trump's aversion to "endless wars." The article traces the evolution of his military decision-making from his first term, noting his willingness to authorize high-risk operations like the Soleimani strike, while also showing a tendency to quickly seek an exit. With a more compliant advisory team in his second term, this doctrine is more pronounced, though its long-term effectiveness remains in question if adversaries like Iran do not capitulate after a single attack.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. and Israeli military strikes against Iran have exposed potential weaknesses in the supposed alliance between Iran, China, and Russia. Despite shared anti-American sentiment, the reactions from Beijing and Moscow to the attacks were surprisingly muted, focusing on de-escalation rather than strong condemnation or material support for Iran. The article argues that when global stability is at risk, China prioritizes its economic and diplomatic ties with the West over its partnership with Iran. This cautious approach suggests the "no limits" partnership between China and Russia may also be less robust than advertised, revealing the pragmatic limits of alliances built solely on opposition to the U.S.</p>

          <p>The slang term "crashing out" has become a popular Gen Z descriptor for having an intense, unfiltered emotional or mental breakdown, often showcased on social media platforms like TikTok. The phrase is used to describe a wide range of behaviors from angry outbursts to despondent withdrawals, as seen with public figures like Justin Bieber and reality TV stars. The article explores why a generation fluent in pop-psychology is embracing such a general term, suggesting it may reflect a form of catharsis for a stressed-out demographic. However, mental health professionals express concern that the trend glorifies emotional dysregulation and discourages developing healthy coping skills.</p>

While these "finfluencers" are making financial topics less intimidating, their rise also prompts regulatory questions, as they are not held to the same standards as certified financial planners.

          <p>A century after a devastating earthquake ruined downtown Santa Barbara, experts say the event holds crucial lessons for California's readiness for the next "Big One." The 1925 quake highlighted the extreme vulnerability of unreinforced brick buildings, a danger that took decades for many cities to address through mandatory retrofitting laws. The article notes that significant structural risks, such as soft-story apartment buildings, remain unaddressed in Santa Barbara and other areas. The event also shaped the city's distinctive Spanish Colonial Revival architecture, as officials mandated the style during the rebuilding effort, fundamentally changing its appearance while displacing its historic Chinatown.</p>

The issue of player ancestry has been a talking point, fueled by comments from Australia's coach.

His comments come as an Israeli official indicated plans for Netanyahu to visit Washington, suggesting potential movement on a new deal. Meanwhile, the Israeli military has ordered new mass evacuations in northern Gaza, signaling an expansion of its offensive in the war-torn region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has developed a searchable national citizenship data system, integrating Social Security and immigration databases, to help election officials verify voter eligibility. The tool, an expansion of the SAVE system, was rolled out without a public process, alarming privacy advocates and legal experts who argue such a significant data consolidation effort requires public scrutiny and debate. While it could ease the burden on voters to prove citizenship, election experts worry about the accuracy of the data and the potential for misuse, especially given the administration's history of promoting false claims about noncitizen voting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. wedding industry is facing significant disruption due to tariffs imposed on Chinese-made goods, as approximately 90% of American wedding dresses are manufactured in China. Brides are now encountering surcharges of 10-30% on their gowns, and boutique owners are struggling with financial uncertainty, unable to predict future costs for special orders that take months to arrive. The article notes that producing these intricate, hand-beaded gowns domestically is not a viable alternative due to a lack of skilled labor and much higher costs, challenging the argument that tariffs will bring back manufacturing jobs.

          <p>Markus SÃ¶der, the state premier of Bavaria and head of the CSU party, has called for a massive expansion of Germany's defense capabilities, including the creation of a German "Iron Dome." He advocated for acquiring 2,000 Patriot systems, a 100,000-strong drone army, and hundreds of new tanks and fighter jets to create a protective shield for the country. His comments were made alongside a visit to Israel by German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, who offered strong support for Israel's recent military actions against Iran. SÃ¶der emphasized the need to cooperate with Ukraine and Israel to learn from their military experience.</p>

One member, currently on bail for a terrorism-related charge which he denies, declared himself a "free man" to the audience.

The attack is part of the recent escalation in the conflict between the two nations. This news comes as the head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, stated that Iran could resume enriching uranium within months, contradicting claims by President Trump that its nuclear program was crippled. In a related development, Israel has ordered a new evacuation of the northern Gaza Strip as it intensifies its military operations against Hamas in the area.</p>

Grossi clarified that the damage was severe but not total, and that Iran's industrial and technological capabilities remain. The IAEA's primary concern is the location of 400kg of previously enriched uranium, as Iran has suspended cooperation with the agency following the attacks.</p>

The article details how online visibility and self-expression for women often lead to threats, privacy violations, and real-world violence, rooted in patriarchal social norms. Many female social media users share experiences of being stalked, harassed, and receiving death threats, with little effective recourse from platforms or authorities. Activists argue that women who are active online are often perceived as a threat to cultural values, which is used to justify the harassment they endure.</p>

          <p>The French government has led a major investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to build a European alternative to Elon Musk's Starlink. The move is part of Europe's push for technological sovereignty in the space sector, where it lags behind the U.S. However, experts are skeptical about Eutelsat's ability to compete directly with Starlink's massive satellite constellation and launch capabilities. Eutelsat's OneWeb arm has far fewer satellites and will need significant further investment to scale up. Analysts believe Eutelsat is better positioned to serve specialized government and enterprise markets that prioritize sovereignty over raw capacity. (not investment advice)</p>
