          <h2>Satellite Images Reveal Extent of Damage to Iranian Nuclear Sites After U.S. Strikes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Satellite images provide a first look at the damage inflicted on Iran's nuclear facilities following the U.S. operation Midnight Hammer, which targeted Fordo, Isfahan, and Natanz. While President Trump claimed the sites were "completely and totally obliterated," other officials have offered more cautious assessments pending full battle damage evaluations. Experts analyzing the imagery have identified significant damage, including large craters, ash deposits, and blocked tunnel entrances at Fordo, while Isfahan shows extensive building damage. Natanz features a large hole over part of the underground complex, suggesting a focus on subterranean facilities during the strikes. The degree of damage inside the uranium enrichment halls remains uncertain until on-site inspections can be conducted. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted an injunction, allowing the Trump administration to resume deportations of certain immigrants to countries other than their own without advance warning or the chance to challenge the deportations based on potential torture or death. This decision overrides a federal District Court judge's April ruling that blocked the practice, which was initiated by an executive order signed in January. The Supreme Court's three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Sotomayor criticizing the government's disregard for due process, citing instances of wrongful deportations to Guatemala and South Sudan. The order will remain in effect while the Trump administration's appeal proceeds, marking a significant victory for the administration's immigration policies. </p>

          <p>Defense analysts in Taipei are raising concerns about the United States' capacity to respond to a potential crisis in the Taiwan Strait, given its recent military actions in the Middle East. The analysts suggest that the U.S., already heavily involved in supporting Ukraine, might have limited military resources and political attention to address a Chinese move against Taiwan. Experts highlight that while Taiwan remains a core U.S. interest, managing multiple major conflicts simultaneously could strain American resources, potentially impacting its ability to swiftly assist Taiwan. This assessment underscores the delicate balance the U.S. must maintain in managing its global security commitments. </p>

          <p>Following the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, officials and experts have presented varying assessments of the damage inflicted. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth initially stated that Iran's nuclear ambitions had been "obliterated," while President Trump echoed this sentiment, emphasizing "Monumental Damage" to all nuclear sites. However, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine indicated that a full assessment would take time, and an Israeli official noted uncertainty regarding the extent of the damage and whether materials had been moved beforehand. A European weapons expert expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of bunker-buster bombs against deeply buried facilities, highlighting the conflicting perspectives on the operation's success. </p>

          <p>Pixar's latest film, 'Elio,' experienced the studio's worst opening weekend ever, earning only $21 million domestically and underscoring the challenges faced by original animated movies in the current market. Despite positive reviews, the film was squeezed out by competition from live-action remakes and existing franchises, while marketing may have contributed to unfamiliarity with the title. Disney remains optimistic that 'Elio' will find its audience over time, similar to the success of 'Elemental,' and plans to continue investing in original animated intellectual property. The success of animated sequels and films based on existing IP highlights a trend, but industry insiders emphasize the importance of fresh stories for the long-term health of the animation industry. </p>

          <p>A top U.S. analyst suggests that China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it. Instead, China's approach would likely involve quiet negotiations and prioritizing its own economic interests, rather than direct military intervention. The analyst cited China's agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels as an example of Beijing's focus on protecting its own interests. Despite China's heavy reliance on Middle Eastern oil, its response to potential disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz is expected to be shaped by economic self-interest rather than military force. </p>

          <p>A debate has emerged regarding the authority to initiate military action following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, highlighting the tension between Congress's power to declare war and the President's role as Commander in Chief. While some lawmakers argue that President Trump acted within his rights as Commander in Chief, others insist on the need for congressional authorization, citing the War Powers Act and the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). The debate underscores the complex political landscape and differing interpretations of constitutional authority in matters of war, with some lawmakers expressing concern over potential escalation and the need for congressional involvement.

          <p>Following Iran's retaliatory missile strike on a U.S. base in Qatar, which resulted in no casualties or damage, President Trump suggested that Iran had gotten the response "out of their system." Trump expressed hope that Iran would now pursue peace and harmony in the region, signaling a potential de-escalation. This scenario raises the possibility that Trump's high-risk maneuver of striking Iranian nuclear facilities could lead to negotiations. The situation mirrors the 2020 Soleimani killing, where limited Iranian retaliation led the U.S. to avoid further escalation, paving the way for cooler heads to prevail. </p>

His attorney, Brian McGoldrick, expressed dismay that Naser was detained despite having an active asylum case and a brother who was recently granted asylum. McGoldrick suggested that Naser's arrest may be related to a White House directive to increase ICE arrests, and voiced concern that Naser is unable to contact his family in Iran due to an internet blackout. </p>

          <h2>Oil Prices Plunge After Trump Says U.S. Had Early Notice of Iranian Retaliatory Strike</h2>

          <p>Oil futures experienced a significant drop after President Trump announced that Iran's retaliatory missile strikes against a U.S. base in Qatar were anticipated, easing concerns about further escalation in the Middle East. West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude both fell nearly 9% following Trump's statement that Iran's strikes were a way to get "it all out of their 'system'." The oil market had initially surged after the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities but quickly reversed course as the retaliatory move appeared to be more symbolic than escalatory. Analysts suggest that the market's focus has shifted back to supply-demand fundamentals, with JPMorgan expecting oil to trade in the low-to-mid $60 range for the remainder of 2025.

          <p>The Supreme Court's conservative majority has sided with the Trump administration, allowing officials to resume deporting migrants to third countries without due process requirements imposed by a lower court. The court's order effectively allows the expedited removal of unauthorized immigrants to countries other than their own, a practice that has drawn criticism from immigrant advocates. Justice Sotomayor issued a scathing dissent, accusing her colleagues of condoning "lawless" behavior by the administration in "matters of life and death." The Department of Homeland Security praised the court's decision as a major win for national security. </p>

          <p>Following Iran's missile launch against the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, an expert analyzes potential retaliatory targets, including U.S. military assets across the Middle East, the Strait of Hormuz, and asymmetric warfare tactics. The U.S. operates numerous military bases in the region, with Al Udeid in Qatar housing thousands of service personnel. Iran could attempt to disrupt oil passage through the Strait of Hormuz, causing global economic pain, or employ terrorist and cyber attacks. The U.S. National Terrorism Advisory System has warned of a "heightened threat environment," with potential low-level cyber attacks by pro-Iranian hacktivists. </p>

          <p>At least 80 Labour MPs are backing an effort to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system, expressing concerns about cuts to disability and sickness-related benefits payments. The MPs have signed an amendment that would allow them to vote on rejecting the welfare reform bill in its entirety. Reasons for opposing the bill include the number of people expected to be pushed into relative poverty, a lack of consultation, and an inadequate impact assessment on the jobs market and people's health. The success of the amendment is uncertain, but the level of support among Labour MPs indicates the potential rebellion facing ministers. </p>

          <p>Anna Repkina, a Moscow native, was found murdered on a remote Oregon logging road after becoming engaged to William Hargrove, an American she met online. Repkina's move to the U.S. placed her in the middle of a love triangle with Michelle Chavez, who had been dating Hargrove before Repkina's arrival. Chavez issued an ultimatum, pressuring Hargrove to choose between her and Repkina, leading to a series of events culminating in Repkina's death. The investigation revealed Hargrove's involvement in the murder, driven by his desire to maintain both relationships and ultimately leading to his conviction, though later overturned due to a flawed search warrant. </p>
