          <p>A woman has been left unable to walk after being accidentally trampled during the Hallaton bottle kicking event in Leicestershire. Alexie Winship, a spectator, sustained a neurological injury and a bleed on her spine after being caught in a scrum of players. She will require a wheelchair for several months. Event organizers stated that attendees are warned of the risks, as injuries are common and paramedics are present, but Winship believes more marshals could improve safety.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of a Venezuelan couple detained by ICE, criticizing the government's lack of evidence supporting their alleged gang affiliation. The couple, who fled Venezuela in 2022 and were granted Temporary Protected Status, were arrested and re-arrested multiple times based on claims of being associated with a foreign terrorist organization. The judge, a Clinton appointee, accused the government of failing to provide meaningful evidence to support the allegations. The couple's attorneys emphasized the drastic consequences they faced, including potential life sentences in brutal prisons, had ICE been successful in their deportation efforts.</p>

          <p>Learner drivers in the UK are experiencing significant delays in booking driving tests, with some comparing the process to securing Glastonbury tickets. The average waiting time is 22 weeks, and the government aims to reduce it to seven weeks by summer 2026. Some learners are resorting to paid apps to find cancellations, and instructors report that it is easier to pass the test than to book one. The DVSA blames increased demand and changes in booking behavior, while bots are also buying up slots and reselling them at inflated prices.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-26 19:07:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The area burned by wildfires in the UK this year has already surpassed the total for any year in over a decade, with more than 29,200 hectares affected. Prolonged dry weather in March and early April created ideal conditions for the fires, which are common in early spring due to dead vegetation. Researchers expect an increase in extreme wildfire weather due to climate change, and scientists are concerned about a potential second peak in the fire season later in the year. A study found that extreme fire weather like that of July 2022 was made at least six times more likely by human-caused climate change.</p>

          <p>Australia's universal healthcare system is facing a crisis due to inadequate government funding, leading to shortages of healthcare workers, ballooning wait times, and rising costs for patients. Many Australians are delaying or forgoing necessary care, and health has become a key issue in the upcoming election. Experts say the current solutions are insufficient and sweeping changes to funding are needed. The crisis is particularly acute in rural areas, where access to care is increasingly difficult to maintain.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's arrest of a Wisconsin judge is viewed by some as an attempt to intimidate the judiciary. Attorney General Pam Bondi's statement implies that judges who anger the administration will be prosecuted. This action raises concerns about the separation of powers and judicial independence, as judges must be free to make decisions without fear of retaliation from the executive branch. The context of this arrest, amid the administration's broader crackdown on immigration, suggests an effort to vilify judges who rule against the administration in deportation cases.</p>

          <p>The Chargers have drafted South Carolina edge rusher Kyle Kennard with the 125th overall pick in the NFL draft. Kennard, who won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, is expected to add youth and talent to the team's edge rusher group. With Khalil Mack's re-signing and the departure of Joey Bosa, the Chargers are in a period of transition at the edge rusher position. Third-year player Tuli Tuipulotu is also expected to take on a more significant role.</p>
