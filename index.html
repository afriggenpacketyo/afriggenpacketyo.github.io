          <p>The US Senate is debating a massive budget bill supported by President Trump, which has narrowly passed a procedural vote. A non-partisan Congressional Budget Office report estimates the legislation could add nearly $3.3 trillion to the national debt and cause 12 million Americans to lose healthcare coverage through significant cuts to programs like Medicaid. The bill's passage remains uncertain as Republican leaders work to secure enough votes against both internal party opposition over the debt and unified Democratic resistance to the proposed cuts.</p>

          <p>University of Virginia President Jim Ryan has resigned following what Senator Mark Warner described as an "outrageous" pressure campaign from the Trump administration. Sources indicate the resignation was demanded to resolve a federal investigation into the university's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Ryan stated his decision was to protect the university from severe consequences, including job losses and funding cuts, which were explicitly threatened by the administration. The move highlights a broader trend of federal scrutiny targeting DEI programs at major American universities.</p>

The Guardian Angels founder insists he is the only candidate to represent true New Yorkers and blames incumbent Eric Adams's perceived failures for the rise of socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani. Sliwa is focusing his campaign on public safety and housing affordability, hoping to capitalize on a potential split in the Democratic vote.

          <p>In cities like Dessau in eastern Germany, right-wing extremism is reportedly becoming a "cool" part of pop culture among young people, with Nazi slogans and symbols becoming more common. This trend is part of a broader radicalization of youth with right-wing views that authorities are observing across the country. The article connects this phenomenon to the region's history of economic collapse after reunification and recent political shifts, such as the electoral success of the far-right AfD party. Despite these challenges, many local civic groups and individuals are actively working to counter the rise of hate and extremism.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, debate has emerged over the extent of the damage, echoing historical challenges in "battle damage assessment" (BDA). While President Trump claimed the program was "obliterated," a leaked preliminary intelligence report suggested minimal impact. This article argues that a full assessment requires time, integrating various intelligence sources beyond initial imagery. Considering the sophisticated munitions used, like the 15-ton GBU-57 bombs, and the cumulative effect of a preceding 12-day Israeli campaign, expert consensus suggests the damage to Iran's nuclear ecosystem was likely severe and lasting.</p>

          <p>NBA player Malik Beasley is the subject of a federal investigation concerning allegations of gambling on league games. The inquiry is reportedly related to the 2023-24 season when Beasley played for the Milwaukee Bucks. The NBA has confirmed its cooperation with the investigation. This probe comes after the league issued a lifetime ban to another player, Jontay Porter, for a betting-related scandal, highlighting the ongoing scrutiny of gambling's influence within professional sports. Beasley has not been charged with any crime at this point.</p>

          <p>According to a Washington Post report citing U.S. intelligence sources, intercepted communications from Iranian officials have downplayed the severity of the damage from recent U.S. military strikes on their nuclear facilities. This account adds to conflicting assessments, contrasting with President Trump's claim that the program was "obliterated." While one source cautioned that the intercepts may be unreliable, the report raises further questions about the true impact of the attack. The White House dismissed the report, stating the idea that Iranian officials know the full extent of the damage is "nonsense."</p>

Despite a recent six-month reprieve on some export licenses from Beijing, the U.S. remains dangerously dependent, as China controls over 90% of refining capacity and uses invasive licensing processes to extract competitive intelligence. The article argues that years of U.S. inaction have allowed this dependency to grow, and a sustained, strategic national effort is required to build a secure supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>
