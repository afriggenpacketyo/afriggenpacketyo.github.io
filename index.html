          <p>Former President Donald Trump responded to global "No Kings Day" protests against his administration by calling the demonstrations a "joke" and claiming the participants were not representative of the country. He suggested the rallies were funded by "radical left lunatics" and emphasized his own work ethic, stating, "I’m not a king. I work my ass off to make our country great." The protests, which occurred in major cities including New York and Washington, D.C., were reported to be largely peaceful and aimed to voice organized opposition to his administration's policies.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 driver Max Verstappen has openly stated for the first time this season that winning a fifth world championship is a realistic possibility, following a commanding victory at the United States Grand Prix. Previously dismissing the idea due to a large points deficit to McLaren drivers, Verstappen's recent string of wins has dramatically closed the gap. He described the situation as "positive pressure" and confirmed his team is going "flat out" for the remainder of the season. His recent performance has been remarkable, gaining 64 points on the championship leader in just four races.</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 4.8 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2025, a figure that slightly exceeded economists' forecasts and aligns with market expectations. This performance brings the nation's economic growth for the first three quarters of the year to 5.2 percent, positioning it to meet its official annual target of "around 5 percent." Despite facing increasing external uncertainties and global economic pressures, the data suggests resilience in the Chinese economy. A spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics characterized the country's economic development path this year as "extraordinary."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region saw gains after China's central bank decided to keep its benchmark lending rates unchanged, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. The stability in policy helped boost investor confidence, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rising over 2% and Japan's Nikkei 225 gaining 1.6%. This market activity occurred as investors awaited key economic data from China, including the third-quarter GDP figures. The positive sentiment in Asia followed a higher close on Wall Street, where traders reacted to a softer U.S. tone on trade talks with China.</p>

          <p>A fragile ceasefire in Gaza was tested after Israel launched air and artillery strikes, alleging that Hamas had violated the agreement by firing on its soldiers, resulting in the deaths of two IDF personnel. In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered "strong action," and Israel subsequently halted the transfer of aid into Gaza. Hamas denied involvement in the reported clashes, reaffirming its commitment to the ceasefire. The violence marks the first major challenge to the truce, which had seen the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners as part of a multi-stage peace plan.</p>

          <p>Families of individuals who died by suicide are calling for a public inquiry, alleging the UK government repeatedly failed to act on warnings about a website that promotes self-harm. A report from the Molly Rose Foundation states that government departments were alerted 65 times about the online forum, which is linked to at least 133 deaths in the UK from a toxic chemical it promotes. Campaigners argue that despite coroners' warnings, the official response has been slow and fragmented. The website recently blocked UK users, a move it claims was proactive rather than a result of government enforcement action.</p>

Both Paz and his right-wing opponent, Jorge Quiroga, campaigned on promises of economic change, including attracting foreign investment and restructuring state-owned enterprises.

Social media posts warned of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in the area, particularly at the popular gay bar The Abbey, causing some establishments to lock their doors. However, officials later confirmed that ICE was not involved and the operation was a local law enforcement response to reports of pickpocketing and drug sales.

          <p>A California grape grower was forced to watch as a local winery, his sole customer, rejected and dumped his entire harvest because the grapes' sugar content was off by a fraction of a percent. This situation highlights the increasing challenge of climate volatility, where subtle shifts in weather can alter a crop's chemistry and jeopardize a farmer's livelihood. The incident underscores the precarious position of small growers who often rely on single buyers and must meet precise quality standards. This article uses the farmer's experience to illustrate broader financial lessons about diversification, insurance, and managing climate-related investment risks.</p>

          <p>In its ongoing trade war with the United States, China is now employing tactics similar to those long used by Washington, particularly the "foreign direct product rule." Beijing has expanded its export controls on rare earths, requiring foreign companies to get Chinese approval to export products containing China-originated rare earth materials or technology. This move mirrors the U.S. policy of extending its legal reach to foreign-made products, which it has used to restrict China's access to technology.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To combat workplace burnout and establish healthier boundaries, career experts suggest a simple but powerful linguistic change: replacing the phrase "I can't" with "I don't." Career coach Helen Tupper explains that "I can't" often invites negotiation, whereas "I don't" presents a more definitive and less challengeable statement about one's personal rules, such as "I don't attend meetings after 5 p.m." This strategy helps individuals reclaim personal time and avoid the slippery slope of overcommitment that can lead to burnout. The advice comes as research indicates a rising number of workers are experiencing extreme levels of stress.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered that the antitrust lawsuit filed by X and xAI against Apple and OpenAI must remain in Fort Worth, Texas, despite the companies having "at best minimal connections" to the area. In a sharply ironic ruling, Judge Mark Pittman criticized the practice of "forum-shopping" but noted his hands were tied by precedent. He sarcastically encouraged the California-based tech giants to relocate their headquarters to Fort Worth given their apparent preference for the venue. The lawsuit accuses Apple and OpenAI of an anticompetitive scheme to monopolize artificial intelligence markets.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted its seventh strike since last month on a vessel allegedly transporting narcotics, killing three people, according to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The attack targeted a boat in international waters linked to a Colombian guerrilla group and was said to be on a known drug-trafficking route. The Trump administration has justified these actions by declaring a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, arguing their activities constitute an armed attack on the U.S. However, the strikes have faced criticism from some lawmakers who question the legal rationale and demand more evidence.</p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner revealed two pivotal moments that led to the recent ceasefire in Gaza. One was an apology phone call from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Qatar's Prime Minister, facilitated by President Trump, to smooth over tensions from an Israeli airstrike. The other was a moment of human connection when Witkoff, who lost a son to an overdose, shared his condolences with a top Hamas negotiator whose son had been killed in an airstrike. These personal and diplomatic steps were crucial in breaking the impasse and securing the deal.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump boarded Air Force One using the aircraft's smaller, internal stairs instead of the larger rolling staircase, a move attributed to "increased security measures" at Palm Beach International Airport. The heightened caution follows the recent discovery by the Secret Service of a suspected hunting stand positioned in a tree line with a clear view of the presidential plane's boarding area. The FBI is leading the investigation into the structure, which was found during advance security sweeps. This incident comes just weeks after a man was convicted of attempting to assassinate Trump at a nearby golf course.</p>

          <p>China's Five-Year Plans, the blueprints for its economic and political goals, have historically had profound global repercussions. The "Reform and Opening Up" policy of the early 1980s transformed China into a manufacturing powerhouse, leading to the "China shock" that shifted industrial jobs from the West. Later plans focused on "strategic emerging industries," which allowed China to dominate green technologies like electric vehicles and solar panels. The current focus on "high quality development" aims to challenge U.S. technological supremacy, escalating geopolitical tensions as China's top leaders prepare their next plan for 2026-2030.</p>

          <p>During a U.S. Marine Corps live-fire demonstration at Camp Pendleton, an artillery round prematurely detonated over Interstate 5, dropping metal shrapnel onto a California Highway Patrol vehicle. The vehicle was part of a protective detail for Vice President JD Vance, who was attending the event celebrating the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary. The incident prompted the immediate cancellation of further live rounds over the freeway and drew sharp criticism from Governor Gavin Newsom, who called the event reckless. No injuries were reported, but the exercise had already caused significant traffic disruptions due to a last-minute freeway closure.</p>

These new qualifications are set to replace existing Level 3 BTECs and other technical courses. The plan is part of a broader effort to streamline educational pathways and provide clearer options for students not pursuing traditional A-levels. Additionally, ministers intend to introduce an alternative qualification to reduce the number of teenagers who are required to repeatedly resit their maths and English GCSE exams.</p>

          <p>In an interview, economist Liu Qian, founder of Wusawa Advisory, argues that the economic threat of the U.S.-China trade rivalry is often exaggerated. She points out that exports to the U.S. now constitute only about 2.8 percent of China's total GDP, with ASEAN having become its largest export destination. Liu Qian discusses the nature of Chinese innovation, the broader ideological and technological competition with the U.S., and the critical importance of including women's voices in policymaking. She suggests that even a complete loss of the U.S. export market would have a limited direct impact on China's overall economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Ambassador Jamieson Greer condemned China's new export controls on rare earth minerals as a "chokehold" on the global technology supply chain. This accusation comes as the U.S. itself deploys an aggressive tariff strategy. The article notes that while the global economy has so far absorbed the shocks, the escalating use of tariffs and export controls creates profound uncertainty.</p>
