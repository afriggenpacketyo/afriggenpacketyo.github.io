          <p>President Trump's policies are inadvertently benefiting Vladimir Putin's agenda, including pressuring Ukraine to cede territory and weakening U.S. alliances. Trump's vision for peace in Ukraine favors Russia, allowing them to keep captured regions and preventing Ukraine from joining NATO. Furthermore, Trump's actions on other fronts, such as creating rifts with allies and altering the U.S. government, also align with Moscow's interests. This suggests a pattern where Trump's decisions, whether intentional or not, serve to advance Putin's goals.</p>

          <p>Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre offered encouragement to NFL Draft prospects, particularly Shedeur Sanders, who surprisingly fell to Day 3 of the draft. Favre, drafted 33rd overall in 1991, emphasized that the draft position is less important than what players do once they get their chance. He recalled that the team that drafted him, the Atlanta Falcons, didn't initially want him, but he went on to have a successful career with the Green Bay Packers. Favre's message aims to inspire players like Sanders to focus on their performance and potential regardless of where they are drafted. </p>

          <p>The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining "woman" and "sex" as biological. The guidance states that trans women (biological men) may be excluded from women-only spaces, such as hospitals and restaurants, while ensuring trans people are not left without any facilities. The EHRC emphasizes that identifying as trans does not change a person's sex under the Equality Act, and organizations should seek legal advice when necessary.

          <p>Despite plans for a special tribunal to prosecute Russia's crimes in Ukraine, significant hurdles remain. Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot be prosecuted while in office due to immunity, and the Council of Europe lacks the UN Security Council's power to waive immunity for high-ranking officials. The tribunal's jurisdiction, the scope of investigations, and the political will of international actors are all factors that could delay or undermine its effectiveness. While Ukrainian officials seek accountability for atrocities, the process faces numerous legal and political obstacles.</p>

Conversion therapy is a discredited practice aimed at changing a person's sexual orientation or gender identity, and major medical associations consider it harmful.</p>

Moffett has a "sell" rating on Apple and a price target implying a substantial drop, citing the impact of tariffs and potential deceleration in consumer demand.
