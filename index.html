          <p>A federal judge dismissed the criminal case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, rejecting the Department of Justice's attempt to dismiss it without prejudice.  The judge cited concerns that a dismissal without prejudice would create the perception of a bargain between Adams and the Trump administration regarding immigration policy. The DOJ's request was met with the resignation of seven federal prosecutors who deemed it politically motivated.</p>
