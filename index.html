        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Berlin court has once again stopped the renaming of a central city street, known as M-Strasse, which many consider to have a racist name rooted in Germany's colonial past. The street was set to be renamed in honor of Anton Wilhelm Amo, the first African-born scholar to earn a doctorate from a European university in the 18th century. Despite years of activism and a previous court ruling allowing the change, a last-minute injunction was granted following a lawsuit by a citizens' initiative opposing the renaming. The decision highlights the ongoing and contentious debate in Germany over decolonizing public spaces and confronting historical injustices.</p>

          <p>British actor Noel Clarke has lost his libel case against Guardian News and Media after a High Court ruling dismissed his lawsuit. Clarke sued the publisher after a series of articles in 2021 detailed allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment from multiple women within the film and television industry. His legal team argued the claims were false and part of a conspiracy, while The Guardian defended its reporting as a careful and thorough investigation. The allegations led to Bafta suspending his membership and revoking his Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema award, which he had received that same year.</p>

          <p>A United Nations-backed report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has officially confirmed the presence of famine in parts of northern Gaza. The report highlights that over half a million people are at immediate risk of starvation, with the crisis projected to expand to other areas by September. This man-made catastrophe is attributed to months of deliberate aid restrictions, the destruction of essential infrastructure, and relentless bombardment. Aid organizations have accused Israel of obstructing aid delivery, while Israel maintains its restrictions are necessary for security against Hamas and to prevent the group from benefiting.</p>

          <p>China's electricity consumption in July soared to a record high of 1.02 trillion kilowatt-hours, an 8.6% increase year-on-year, driven by scorching heatwaves across the country. According to the National Energy Administration, this monthly usage is comparable to the total annual electricity consumption of all ASEAN nations combined. The primary industry sector, including agriculture and fisheries, saw the fastest growth in power use at 20.2%. The surge in demand occurred alongside a slight slowdown in industrial output growth, which rose by 5.7% in July, down from 6.8% in June, highlighting the immense strain on the nation's power grid.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) as one of history's greatest companies, stating that investing in its stock would be a very smart decision. His comments came during a visit to Taiwan and in response to questions about the U.S. government potentially acquiring equity stakes in chip companies receiving CHIPS Act funding. Huang confirmed that TSMC is manufacturing six new products for Nvidia, including its next-generation Rubin AI chip platform. The discussion follows reports that the U.S. Commerce Secretary was exploring such stakes, although a subsequent report indicated no current plans to do so. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Thai court has acquitted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of a royal defamation charge, a verdict that spares him a potential 15-year prison sentence. The case, originally filed in 2016 while he was in exile, concerned remarks made in a 2015 interview. The court found the evidence presented by the prosecution to be weak and incomplete, noting that witnesses may have been politically biased against him. This acquittal provides some relief for the influential Shinawatra family, as Thaksin's daughter, suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, faces a separate court ruling that could remove her from office.</p>

Advocates and bipartisan supporters in Congress counter that TRIO programs, such as Upward Bound, have a proven track record of success, significantly increasing the likelihood of participants earning a degree.

          <p>A growing number of patients are discovering that paying the out-of-pocket cash price for medical services, such as prenatal genetic tests, can be significantly cheaper than using their health insurance. One patient's story highlights this counterintuitive trend: after her insurer was billed over $4,400 by the testing company Natera, she was left with a $750 bill for her deductible. However, after learning of a cash-pay option, she was able to settle the bill directly with the company for a much lower price. This situation reflects a broader issue in the U.S. healthcare system where high list prices for insurers can lead to substantial out-of-pocket costs for patients with high-deductible plans.</p>

          <p>Consumers should prepare for another increase in chocolate prices due to the lingering effects of record-high cocoa costs, though relief may be on the horizon by next Easter. Cocoa futures have soared in recent years due to poor weather and disease in West Africa, leading to significant price inflation on retail products. While cocoa futures have eased slightly this year, chocolatiers are still processing the higher-priced beans purchased previously. However, analysts predict that softening industrial demand and improving supply from new plantings could lead to more stable, albeit structurally higher, prices in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Millions of people across the UK are expected to face significant travel disruption during the upcoming bank holiday weekend due to a combination of busy roads, rail strikes, and engineering works. The RAC anticipates 17.6 million car journeys, warning of heavy traffic on major routes like the M5, particularly on Friday. On the railways, a strike by the RMT union will halt all CrossCountry services on Saturday and cause major alterations on other days, while engineering projects will affect other lines, including the East Coast Main Line. The disruption coincides with major events like the Notting Hill Carnival and the Reading and Leeds festivals.</p>

          <p>A growing trend in the UK sees couples incorporating their pet dogs into their wedding ceremonies, treating them as integral members of the family. Dogs are taking on roles such as ring bearers, flower girls, and official greeters, reflecting a societal shift where pets are viewed as best friends and sources of emotional support. To accommodate this demand, specialized dog chaperone services have emerged to manage the pets on the big day, handling everything from transport and grooming to practicing their specific roles. For many couples, having their dog present is a non-negotiable part of their celebration, adding a unique and personal touch to the event.</p>

          <p>Prolonged and severe summer heatwaves across Europe have led to a massive surge in demand for air conditioners, with China's exports of the units to the continent jumping by nearly 60% in July compared to the previous year. As cities from Madrid to Paris experience record-breaking temperatures, the continent's general lack of preparedness for extreme heat has created a booming market for cooling systems. Chinese brands, which dominate the global market by producing approximately 80% of the world's air conditioners, are the primary beneficiaries of this increased demand. The trend highlights a direct economic consequence of accelerating climate change.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, eased to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in the previous month, largely due to cooling rice inflation.

The "core-core" inflation rate, which also strips out energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, held steady at 3.4%. The persistent inflation adds pressure on the Bank of Japan to consider raising its policy interest rate from its current level of 0.5%. (not investment advice)</p>
