        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate narrowly advanced a major Republican tax and spending package, championed by Donald Trump as the "One Big Beautiful Bill." The procedural vote succeeded after last-minute negotiations persuaded several conservative holdouts to flip their votes. Senators Ron Johnson, Rick Scott, and others secured promises for an amendment vote related to Medicaid, which made them more comfortable advancing the legislation. The bill, which extends tax cuts and boosts security spending, now faces a lengthy debate and amendment process before a final vote.</p>

          <p>A Morgan Stanley executive has suggested that the recent panic and sell-off in the U.S. bond market is an overblown reaction, potentially driven by inexperienced investors. Chief Investment Officer Jim Caron argued that concerns over the U.S. budget deficit, exacerbated by recent legislation, are not new information and should not undermine the fundamental perception of U.S. Treasury bonds as low-risk investments. He believes the market's unease following a spike in Treasury yields is not directly tied to the deficit talk, characterizing worried investors as mere "tourists in the market."

          <p>This opinion article argues that the United States is critically vulnerable due to its dependence on China for rare earth elements, which are essential for modern technology and defense systems. The author contends that despite years of warnings, the U.S. has failed to create a secure, independent supply chain, leaving it exposed to China's ability to weaponize these resources, as seen with recent export controls. The piece criticizes past and present administrations for slow and incoherent responses and calls for a long-term, unified national strategy that treats critical minerals as instruments of geopolitical power, not just commodities.</p>

The vehicle was safely lowered to the ground, and no one was injured, with BeyoncÃ© later telling the crowd, "If ever I fall, I know y'all will catch me."

          <p>The Trump administration is taking steps to dismantle federal energy-efficiency regulations, including the popular Energy Star program. Following a series of executive actions, the Department of Energy and the EPA are planning to eliminate or modify dozens of rules governing appliances like dishwashers, light bulbs, and toilets. These actions are opposed by consumer protection groups and some appliance manufacturers, who argue the standards save consumers money and reduce energy waste. The move could lead to a less-regulated market, potentially increasing household utility bills and creating uncertainty for an industry that has relied on uniform federal standards.</p>

          <p>Norway's state-owned gambling company, Norsk Tipping, mistakenly notified several thousand Eurojackpot winners that they had won massive prizes, some in the millions of kroner. The error was caused by a currency conversion mistake where prize amounts were multiplied by 100 instead of being correctly calculated from euros. The company's CEO, Tonje Sagstuen, has since resigned, apologizing for the major breach of trust and the disappointment caused to people who briefly believed they were millionaires. While the correct, much smaller prize amounts were later updated and no incorrect payouts were made, the incident has prompted scrutiny from the government.</p>

          <p>The recently designated SÃ¡ttÃ­tla Highlands national monument in northern California, a sacred area for the Pit River Tribe, is facing an uncertain future. After President Biden granted federal protection to the nearly 230,000-acre region, Donald Trump announced his intention to undo the action to open the land for economic development. This has sparked concern among the tribe and environmental groups who fought for decades to protect the area from industrial projects. Legal experts question a president's authority to fully rescind a monument, setting the stage for a potential legal battle if the administration attempts to roll back the protections.</p>

The push for a deal continues as a top Israeli adviser is set to visit Washington for talks, though a major sticking point remains whether a permanent end to the war is part of any agreement.

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly criticized Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina for voting against the procedural advancement of his "big, beautiful bill." In a social media post, Trump accused Tillis of grandstanding and threatened to support a primary challenger against him in his 2026 re-election campaign. Tillis was one of only two Republican senators to oppose the measure, citing concerns over potential cuts to Medicaid that would harm his state's hospitals. This move highlights Trump's strategy of enforcing party loyalty by targeting Republicans who defy his legislative priorities.</p>

          <p>Glastonbury Festival organizers stated they were "appalled" by comments made by the punk duo Bob Vylan during their performance, which included chants calling for "death to the IDF." The festival said the statements "crossed a line," and the BBC, which broadcast the set live, will not make it available on its iPlayer service. UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting called the comments "revolting," noting the irony that Israelis were attacked, killed, and sexually assaulted at a music festival. The incident has sparked widespread condemnation and a formal complaint to the BBC from an antisemitism campaign group.</p>

          <p>This excerpt from Sam Tanenhaus's new biography, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," delves into the family history of William F. Buckley, Jr. It chronicles his father's journey from a Texas frontier upbringing to becoming a wealthy oil speculator in Mexico and Venezuela. After being expelled from Mexico, W.F. Buckley, Sr. rebuilt his fortune and established the family at a large estate in Sharon, Connecticut, which he named Great Elm. It was into this world of wealth, deep Catholic faith, and staunch anti-communist sentiment that William F. Buckley, Jr., the future leader of the modern conservative movement, was born.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," examines the profound influence of William F. Buckley Jr. on the American conservative movement. The article highlights how Buckley, through his magazine National Review and TV show "Firing Line," created a platform for conservative ideas and propelled figures like Ronald Reagan to power. Tanenhaus and former Speaker Newt Gingrich argue that Buckley invented a form of cultural politics that paved the way for the modern Republican Party.

          <p>Chelsea Football Club has engaged in discussions with the Mayor of London's office regarding the potential construction of a new stadium. The club is currently weighing its options between redeveloping its historic Stamford Bridge home or relocating to a new, larger venue to increase its capacity, which is currently smaller than many Premier League rivals. A site at Earl's Court has been identified as a possible new location, although the development company managing the land has stated its current plans are for housing and commercial use. These talks represent an early step in formulating a proposal for a modernized home for the club.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has significantly altered its flagship welfare reform bill after facing a substantial rebellion from its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the government had mishandled the rollout and that concessions were made after over 120 Labour MPs threatened to vote against the initial plans. The changes, which include limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants and commissioning a review of the benefit, have put the government in a better position to pass the legislation. Rebel MPs expressed satisfaction with the changes, averting a major defeat for the prime minister.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in The Lancet Global Health revealed that a significant number of cancer drugs in four African nations are substandard or falsified. Researchers tested nearly 200 products in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, and Cameroon, finding that approximately 17% had incorrect levels of active ingredients. Such defects can lead to treatment failure and disease progression for patients. The issue stems from a combination of manufacturing faults, poor storage, and counterfeit products, compounded by challenges in regulation and the lack of facilities for testing toxic chemotherapy drugs in the region.</p>

          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, couples who are miserable in their relationships often answer "no" to four critical questions. These questions assess whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts and if they can be their authentic selves with each other. They also probe whether a partner shows genuine curiosity about the other's inner world and if they take accountability for their mistakes. Travers suggests that conflict is inevitable, but how it's handled and whether partners maintain intimacy through curiosity and mutual respect are key indicators of a relationship's health.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Gen Z's 'Sex Recession' Masks a Deeper Political and Social Revolution</h2>

          <p>This article argues that while statistics show Gen Z is having less sex than previous generations, this "sex recession" is not due to a lack of interest. Instead, it reflects a generation that is politically reshaping the definitions of sex, gender, and relationships. Having grown up post-#MeToo and post-Roe, many young people are rejecting traditional expectations and are highly active in advocating for sexual and reproductive freedom. The author contends that Gen Z's approach to sex is more a form of progressive resistance against restrictive social and political forces than a retreat from intimacy.</p>

          <h2>Startup CEO Prioritizes Candidates Who Can Both Strategize and Execute</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 09:00:01 EDT</div>

          <p>Priyanka Jain, CEO of the startup Evvy, says the most important trait she looks for when hiring is the ability to both strategize and execute. She finds it concerning when a candidate is only interested in high-level strategy and sees implementation as outside their scope. At a startup, Jain explains, every team member must be able to identify a problem, get into the details to find a solution, and then actively build and launch it. To assess this, she asks candidates to describe a problem they solved, listening for the level of detail in their process and their enthusiasm for both sides of the work.</p>

          <h2>Vanguard Data Shows 401(k) Balances Correlate with Income Levels</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 09:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newly released data from Vanguard shows a strong correlation between income and retirement savings, with higher earners accumulating significantly larger 401(k) balances. For instance, the median balance for workers earning between $100,000 and $149,999 is nearly double that of those earning between $50,000 and $74,999. The report also highlights the effectiveness of automatic enrollment in boosting savings, as participants in such plans for over ten years have median balances about 60% higher than those who enrolled voluntarily. This demonstrates the powerful impact of consistent, automated saving over time. (not investment advice)</p>
