            <p>An Israeli military inquiry concluded that an "operational misunderstanding" caused the deaths of 14 emergency workers in southern Gaza last month. The investigation cited a series of failings and led to the dismissal of a unit's deputy commander for providing an incomplete report. The incident occurred when a convoy of Palestinian Red Crescent Society ambulances and other vehicles came under fire near Rafah. The IDF also acknowledged that the killing of a UN worker shortly after was "a breach of orders during a combat setting."</p>

He also reflects on his comedy influences, from "The Dick Van Dyke Show" to Monty Python, and the importance of making people laugh, finding connection with the audience through live performance, and also reflects on his relationship with his husband, Brian Hargrove, and his decision not to participate in the "Frasier" reboot.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to investigate the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident allegedly affiliated with MS-13, despite a court order prohibiting his removal. Van Hollen emphasized that his trip was about upholding the rule of law and defending Abrego Garcia's right to due process, rather than defending the individual himself. He criticized the Trump administration's handling of the case, calling the deportation an "administrative error" and a violation of international law. Van Hollen also expressed concern over the conditions of Abrego Garcia's detention and the Salvadoran government's complicity in the matter.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, responding to an emergency appeal from the ACLU. The court's order prevents removals from the Bluebonnet Detention Center until further notice, ensuring detainees have the chance to argue their case in court. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, claiming the court acted prematurely without sufficient evidence. The ACLU argued that immigration authorities were planning to deport the men to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison, raising concerns about their safety and due process rights.</p>

He also criticized Senator Chris Van Hollen for meeting with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador.

            <p>The article examines the reliability of various economic indicators, including unusual metrics like lipstick sales and men's underwear purchases, as predictors of a recession. It argues that there is little empirical evidence to support the predictive power of these metrics, and that even widely used indicators like consumer sentiment and GDP can be unreliable. The author suggests that the best way to gauge the economy's health is to look at actual data from companies driving consumer spending, capital investment, and labor, such as retailers, banks, and payroll companies.

Experts noted the drills demonstrated cross-unit coordination and front-line coastal support exercises required during conflict.

            <p>The Justice Department is preparing for the final phase of a landmark antitrust case against Google, which could result in the company's breakup. The government accuses Google of illegally stifling competition by paying to be the default search engine on web browsers and phones. The Justice Department is proposing remedies such as preventing Google from making third-party payments and spinning off its Chrome web browser and Android smartphone operating system. Google argues that the proposed remedies would harm consumers and innovation.</p>

            <p>The article discusses the potential for China to use the renminbi as a strategic tool in its trade war with the US. It suggests that China could require bilateral trade to be settled in renminbi, which would significantly strengthen the currency's exchange rate and challenge the dominance of the US dollar. This would force the US to buy Chinese currency on a large scale, increasing demand and pushing up the exchange rate. This strategy could also attract international capital to China and away from the US.</p>

            <p>The conflict between Donald Trump and Harvard University represents the latest front in a decades-long conservative war against American academia. The Trump administration froze grants to Harvard after the university refused demands to control hiring, admissions, and curriculum. Experts say this is part of a broader attempt to undermine higher education and democracy, mirroring authoritarian tactics. The move has sparked debate over academic freedom, antisemitism, and the role of universities in society.</p>
