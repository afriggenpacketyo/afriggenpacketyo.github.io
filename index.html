          <p>A jury in Miami has found Tesla 33% responsible for a 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system, which resulted in one death and a serious injury. The driver, who was distracted looking for his phone, believed the system would automatically brake for obstacles. The verdict assigns a portion of the $329 million in damages to Tesla, potentially setting a significant precedent for numerous other lawsuits concerning the company's automated driving technology. Tesla has called the verdict wrong, stated it plans to appeal, and maintains that the driver was solely at fault for overriding the system by keeping his foot on the accelerator. The case highlights ongoing debates about the safety and marketing of semi-autonomous vehicle features.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Victims of Jeffrey Epstein and the family of the late Virginia Giuffre have expressed outrage over Ghislaine Maxwell's transfer to a minimum-security prison in Texas. They condemned the move as preferential treatment, suggesting it was a political favor from the Trump administration, and noted they were not notified in advance. The transfer occurred after Maxwell met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, a former lawyer for President Trump, sparking speculation about a potential deal or pardon. In a joint statement, the victims described the decision as a failure of the justice system that smacks of a cover-up, arguing Maxwell is a dangerous sexual predator who deserves no leniency.</p>

          <p>Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has been moved from a low-security facility in Florida to a minimum-security federal prison camp in Bryan, Texas. This facility, which also houses Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, is designed for non-violent offenders and offers more amenities and freedoms than higher-security prisons. The transfer has drawn sharp criticism from the family of Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre, who called it an example of preferential treatment for a convicted predator. The move's timing is notable, as it follows meetings between Maxwell and a high-ranking Justice Department official, fueling ongoing speculation about her cooperation with authorities and the potential for a reduced sentence or pardon.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he has ordered two U.S. nuclear submarines to be repositioned in response to what he termed "highly provocative statements" from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The move is a direct reaction to Medvedev's recent threats regarding Trump's ultimatum for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine or face severe sanctions. Trump stated on social media that the deployment is a precautionary measure in case Medvedev's "foolish and inflammatory statements" are more than just words. The specific locations of the submarines were not disclosed, escalating geopolitical tensions between the two nuclear powers amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, just hours after the agency released a surprisingly weak jobs report for July. The report indicated only 73,000 new jobs were added and included significant downward revisions for the previous two months, sparking a sharp drop in financial markets. In a social media post, Trump accused the commissioner of manipulating data for political purposes and undermining his administration's economic narrative. The move has raised concerns among economists about the politicization of federal data agencies and the integrity of future economic reporting. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a significant rally over the past year, gold prices may face a period of stagnation in August, according to market analysis. Key factors influencing this forecast include the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates on hold until September, which removes a major catalyst for price movement. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding the next inflation report and evolving demand for portfolio diversification could lead to muted activity in the gold market. While the precious metal has seen its price increase by approximately 40% over the last year, experts suggest that short-term volatility is likely, advising investors to focus on long-term strategies rather than immediate price fluctuations.

The court found that Italy's method for designating a country as "safe" for returns violates EU law, a concept central to the fast-track processing system. This decision effectively halts the project until Italy revises its laws to comply with the ruling, which requires that a country be deemed safe for its entire population. The verdict is being closely watched by other European nations, including the UK, that are considering similar offshore asylum processing models to manage migration.</p>

          <p>A new study conducted by researchers at Oxford University has found that a species of common European songbird sometimes engages in a form of "divorce." The research indicates that these birds, which typically form monogamous pairs, may separate from their partners between breeding seasons. This behavior challenges common assumptions about lifelong pair-bonding in certain avian species. The study provides new insights into the complex social dynamics and mating strategies of birds, suggesting that factors such as breeding success and individual fitness can influence the stability of their partnerships over time.

          <p>While Certificates of Deposit (CDs) still offer high interest rates, the potential earnings on a new deposit are notably lower than they were a year ago.

This decline in rates reflects the broader economic environment, even as the Federal Reserve keeps its benchmark rate on hold. Despite the reduced returns compared to last year, CDs remain an attractive option for savers seeking fixed, predictable growth, especially when compared to the variable rates of high-yield savings accounts or the low returns of traditional savings.

Speaking at a monastery, Putin expressed that any disappointment from the U.S. side stems from "inflated expectations" and showed no signs of adhering to the deadline. His comments came a day after a deadly Russian airstrike on Kyiv, which drew condemnation from Trump. Putin reiterated his demands for Ukrainian neutrality and recognition of occupied territories, indicating that a ceasefire is not in Moscow's immediate interest, thereby defying the threat of new U.S. sanctions.</p>

          <p>An Arkansas schoolteacher has been arrested and charged with capital murder after admitting to killing a couple who were hiking with their two young daughters at Devil's Den state park. The victims, Clinton and Cristen Brink, were found dead on a walking trail; their children, ages seven and nine, were unharmed. Investigators are calling the attack a random act, as there is no evidence the suspect, Andrew McGann, knew the family. Police matched McGann's DNA to evidence at the scene. The couple had recently moved to Arkansas, and authorities have praised Cristen Brink for ushering her children to safety before she was killed.</p>

          <p>A new debate has ignited in Germany over the sustainability of its pension system, with Economy Minister Katherina Reiche proposing that people need to "work more and longer." This suggestion to raise the retirement age beyond the currently planned 67 has drawn sharp criticism from her coalition partners and trade unions. They argue it would unfairly penalize manual laborers who may be physically unable to work longer. With a rapidly aging population and a shrinking ratio of workers to pensioners, Germany faces a significant fiscal challenge, prompting a contentious discussion about various reforms, including contribution increases and expanding the base of contributors to the public system.</p>

The administration argues its return is necessary to combat rising rates of obesity and inactivity, which it calls a threat to national vitality.

This move follows a campaign by President Trump against what he calls "left-wing propaganda," culminating in legislation that rescinded over $1 billion in allocated funds.

          <p>President Trump's recent wave of tariffs appears to follow a more discernible strategy than his previous actions, functioning as a tool to pressure countries into bilateral trade deals. Nations that offer concessions, such as commitments to buy more U.S. goods, are given deals with lower tariff rates, as seen with the EU and Japan. Those that do not, or have otherwise angered the president, face much steeper punitive tariffs intended to force them to negotiate. Despite this transactional coherence, the policy remains fraught with legal and economic uncertainty, facing challenges in appellate courts and risking further damage to a U.S. economy that recent data suggests is already slowing.

The new windfarm is projected to generate enough electricity to power every household in Scotland twice over, marking a significant step in the country's commitment to renewable energy. The timing of the announcement has been viewed by many as a pointed and humorous rebuttal to the former U.S. president's stance on climate change and green technology.</p>
