        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The use of smokeless nicotine pouches like Zyn on airplanes is causing confusion among travelers due to inconsistent airline policies. While the TSA permits these products in carry-on and checked bags, individual airlines determine their own rules for in-flight use. A recent incident on a Delta flight, where a passenger was asked to spit out a Zyn pouch, highlighted this ambiguity, as Delta's policy prohibits all smokeless tobacco products. This has sparked debate among passengers, especially since other products like nicotine gum are allowed and competitors' in-flight magazines have even featured ads for Zyn.</p>

          <p>Following a period of internal disarray within NATO, Europe is approaching a significant summit with China with its geopolitical influence seemingly diminished. Analysts suggest that recent events have exposed Europe's weakness on the global stage, undermining long-standing efforts to establish the continent as a truly independent power. This perceived vulnerability comes at a critical time, as leaders prepare for crucial diplomatic engagements with Beijing. The article suggests that Europe's internal challenges and reliance on external partners are casting a shadow over its ability to project strength and unity in international affairs.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian F-16 pilot, identified as Lt. Col. Maksym Ustimenko, was killed during a massive overnight Russian drone and missile attack. According to Ukraine's air force, the pilot successfully shot down seven aerial targets before his jet was damaged while engaging an eighth. He reportedly steered the damaged aircraft away from populated areas and did not have time to eject. The large-scale assault involved nearly 540 drones and missiles targeting multiple regions, prompting neighboring Poland to scramble its own aircraft as a precaution.

          <p>Iran's judiciary has announced that an Israeli airstrike on Tehran's notorious Evin prison killed 71 people, including prisoners, staff, and visiting relatives. This report comes amid escalating tensions and a wider regional conflict. In separate developments, Israel has ordered new evacuations in northern Gaza as it intensifies its military operations there. Meanwhile, UN nuclear watchdog head Rafael Grossi stated that Iran could resume enriching uranium within months, despite recent attacks on its nuclear facilities. The situation remains volatile, with ongoing military actions and diplomatic maneuvering throughout the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran retains the capacity to restart enriching uranium for a potential nuclear bomb in a matter of months. This assessment contradicts claims by former President Donald Trump that recent US and Israeli strikes had completely obliterated Iran's nuclear program. Grossi clarified that while the damage to facilities was severe, it was not total, and Iran's technological capabilities remain intact. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is particularly concerned about the location of 400 kilograms of previously enriched uranium, as Iran has recently suspended cooperation with the agency.</p>

Despite the clear victory, with judges scoring it 99-91, 97-93, and 98-92, questions remain about the quality of Paul's opponents.

The attacks continue as mediators intensify efforts to broker a new ceasefire and hostage-release deal, following the collapse of a previous truce in March.

          <p>After a six-year wait for justice, a jury has convicted Samuel Woodward of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement for the 2018 killing of Blaze Bernstein, a 19-year-old gay and Jewish university student. Prosecutors successfully argued that Woodward, who had ties to the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen, was motivated by hate. The defense conceded Woodward killed Bernstein but claimed it was an act of provoked manslaughter, an argument the jury rejected. Bernstein's family, who founded a kindness movement called "BlazeItForward" in his honor, expressed relief at the verdict, which carries a sentence of life without parole.</p>

This move, which makes the French state Eutelsat's largest shareholder, is part of a broader push for European technological sovereignty in the space sector. However, experts express skepticism about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance, citing a massive disparity in scale. Eutelsat's OneWeb constellation has about 650 satellites, compared to Starlink's more than 7,000, posing a significant hurdle to achieving global parity in the consumer market.</p>

Once a heavily militarized front line, it has transformed into a quiet community caught between two powerful political systems. Despite its history as a symbol of Taipei's governance, the island's unique position reveals the practical limitations of influence for both Beijing and Taipei.

          <p>Israel's ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, has confirmed he will attend the upcoming peace ceremony in Nagasaki, marking the anniversary of the 1945 U.S. atomic bombing.

His attendance signals a restoration of diplomatic custom for the solemn commemoration, which is attended by dignitaries from around the world to honor the victims and advocate for nuclear disarmament.</p>

The launch from a southwestern Japanese island marked the end of an era for the vehicle, which has been a cornerstone of Japan's space development. The H2A, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, is now being succeeded by the new H3 rocket. The successor vehicle is designed to be more cost-effective, ensuring Japan's continued competitiveness in the global space launch market.</p>

          <p>In response to the perceived threat from Russia, five NATO countries bordering Russia or Belarus—Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland—have announced their withdrawal from the Ottawa Convention, a treaty banning anti-personnel mines. This move will allow them to produce and deploy land mines as part of a new border defense strategy. The plan aims to create a significant deterrent by making a potential invasion costly for an aggressor. This decision is highly controversial, as land mines pose a long-term, indiscriminate danger to civilians long after conflicts end, a risk these nations now appear willing to take for security.</p>

          <p>A new smoking ban has gone into effect across France, prohibiting smoking on all public beaches, in parks, and near schools and bus shelters. The rules are part of a government initiative aimed at protecting children from secondhand smoke and creating a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. Violators could face fines up to €700, although a grace period will be observed initially. The ban, however, does not extend to the outdoor terraces of bars and restaurants, and e-cigarettes are not included in the new regulations. The move comes as France continues to battle a high smoking rate, with over 30% of adults still smoking.</p>

          <p>A lay preacher for the Church of England, Venessa Pinto, has been convicted of stalking after a prolonged campaign of harassment against a church volunteer, Jay Hulme. The case is notable because Hulme's initial complaint was dismissed by the Bishop of Leicester, Martyn Snow, who instead accused the victim of witchcraft. Hulme endured months of relentless online abuse, false allegations, and threats before police eventually took action, leading to Pinto's arrest and guilty plea. The Bishop has since apologized, and Leicestershire Police acknowledged their initial response was inadequate, highlighting systemic failures in protecting the victim.</p>
