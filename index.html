          <p>An aid boat named the Madleen, carrying climate activist Greta Thunberg, actor Liam Cunningham, and other activists, was intercepted by Israeli forces as it attempted to reach Gaza. The Israeli Foreign Ministry stated the boat was being directed to Israel, while the Freedom Flotilla Coalition accused Israel of kidnapping the activists and confiscating humanitarian aid. Defense Minister Israel Katz affirmed Israel's blockade of Gaza, aimed at preventing Hamas from importing arms. The incident follows a previous attempt by the Freedom Flotilla to reach Gaza, which was thwarted by drone attacks, and highlights the ongoing tensions surrounding aid delivery to the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing an expansion of the ban on bottom trawling in English waters, aiming to protect marine ecosystems. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans. The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, would extend the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of UK offshore areas already designated as protected. The move comes amid growing concerns about the environmental impact of bottom trawling, highlighted by figures like Sir David Attenborough, and seeks to safeguard rare marine animals and delicate seabed habitats.</p>

          <p>China's consumer prices fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating persistent deflationary pressures.
