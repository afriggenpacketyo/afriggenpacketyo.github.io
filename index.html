          <p>A 65-year-old grandmother, dubbed 'Gangsta Debbs,' has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for masterminding a family-run drug trafficking operation in the UK. The gang, which included her four children and sister, distributed cocaine worth up to £80 million, funding a lavish lifestyle that included designer goods for her cat. Undercover police monitored the operation for seven months, observing drug collections from ports and deliveries across the country. The judge described her as having a "leading role" and corrupting her children rather than setting a positive example.</p>

          <p>The Syrian presidency has announced the deployment of a new military force to quell deadly sectarian violence between Bedouin and Druze communities in the southern Suweida province. The clashes have reportedly resulted in over 700 deaths, with UN reports indicating widespread human rights violations, including summary executions by various armed groups. Amid the escalating violence, the US ambassador to Turkey stated that Israel and Syria have agreed to a ceasefire, though this has not been publicly confirmed by either nation. The move follows Israeli strikes intended to force government troops, accused of killing civilians, to withdraw from the region.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have developed a new, more affordable method for CAR-T cell therapy, a highly personalized treatment for blood cancers and other serious diseases. The innovative technique allows for the production of anti-cancer cells directly within the patient's body using gene therapy tools, significantly reducing complexity and cost. Researchers at Huazhong University of Science and Technology successfully used this approach to treat four patients with multiple myeloma. This breakthrough could make the powerful immunotherapy, which currently costs over a million yuan per treatment, more accessible globally.</p>

          <p>An amber weather warning has been issued for parts of the UK, including London, as severe thunderstorms are expected to bring torrential rain and potential flash flooding. The Met Office warns that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours, leading to dangerous conditions, transport disruptions, and power outages. The risk of flooding is heightened because the ground is parched from a recent heatwave, which will reduce its ability to absorb the sudden downpour. This weather event follows days of high temperatures that led to hosepipe bans in several regions.</p>

The article highlights that despite government incentives, challenges such as the high cost and low availability of childcare deter many women from having children.

The law requires stablecoins to be backed by liquid assets, a move intended to bolster the dollar's global status and increase demand for U.S. Treasuries.

A clinical trial based on these findings is now underway with breast cancer patients, offering hope for developing strategies to mitigate this dangerous side effect.</p>

The current naval railgun, a world-first, has been limited by its power, capping projectile weight and reducing its effectiveness for naval warfare. The proposed solution involves cross-stacking two railguns into a single unit, which would significantly increase bore pressure. This would allow the weapon to fire much heavier projectiles of up to 30kg at speeds of Mach 7, potentially overcoming previous limitations and advancing its military application.</p>

          <h2>State Audit Reveals Critical Understaffing at California's Workplace Safety Agency</h2>

          <p>A new state audit has found that California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) is critically understaffed, impairing its ability to protect the state's 19 million workers. The report revealed a 32% vacancy rate in the last fiscal year, leading to the agency closing complaints without proper on-site inspections and failing to adequately document cases. This chronic understaffing has crippled the agency's enforcement capabilities at a time when its responsibilities are growing due to climate-related hazards like extreme heat. While Cal/OSHA states it has made recent strides in hiring, experts argue that significant investment is needed.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, News Corp, and The Wall Street Journal. The suit stems from an article that claimed Trump had sent a sexually suggestive letter to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003. Trump vehemently denies writing the letter and alleges the article was a malicious and false attempt to link him to the disgraced financier. The lawsuit names the reporters, Murdoch, and his companies as defendants, escalating a conflict as Trump faces pressure to release Justice Department files related to the Epstein investigation.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died after being pulled into an MRI machine at a medical facility in Westbury, New York. According to Nassau County police, the man was wearing a large metallic chain and entered the MRI room while a scan was in progress for his relative. He reportedly defied orders to stay out of the room after hearing the patient screaming. The powerful magnetic force of the machine pulled the chain, causing him to be drawn in and suffer fatal injuries. The incident serves as a tragic reminder of the strict safety protocols required around MRI machines.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced at the White House that ten more hostages are expected to be released from Gaza "very shortly." This development comes as the administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. The proposed truce terms reportedly include the return of these ten living hostages and the remains of eighteen others, in exchange for Israel releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement follows recent indirect talks mediated by Qatar and a visit to Washington by the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has confirmed it has delivered M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine to aid in its defense against the ongoing Russian invasion. The tanks are part of a larger A$245 million military assistance package from Australia, which is one of the largest non-NATO contributors to Ukraine's war effort. According to Defence Minister Richard Marles, most of the 49 promised tanks have now been transferred to Ukrainian possession. This contribution is part of the A$1.5 billion in total aid Canberra has provided since the conflict began, which also includes humanitarian support and sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>Scott Harrison, a U.S. Marine veteran, has found a unique way to heal from the trauma of the Vietnam War by building a carousel in Nederland, Colorado. During the war, Harrison would listen to a music box and imagine a carousel in a peaceful mountain meadow to cope with the brutality around him. Decades later, struggling with PTSD, he decided to make that vision a reality, purchasing a broken-down carousel in 1986 and spending 26 years hand-carving new animals for it. Now a nonprofit, the "Carousel of Happiness" has brought joy to over a million visitors and provided Harrison with profound healing.</p>
