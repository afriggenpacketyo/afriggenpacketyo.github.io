          <h2>Trump Urges Fed to Cut Rates Despite Positive Jobs Report</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 10:17:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump called for a full-point interest rate cut from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, even after a strong jobs report indicated a decrease in unemployment. Trump has consistently pressured Powell to lower rates to stimulate the economy, arguing that such cuts would enable the U.S. to reduce long- and short-term debt costs. He also suggested that Powell could raise rates again if inflation were to increase, criticizing the Fed's current policies as costly to the country. Trump's remarks follow a Labor Department report showing that nonfarm payrolls rose by 139,000, exceeding expectations, though analysts had anticipated weaker results due to Trump's tariff policies.

          <p>Lululemon shares dropped significantly after the company reduced its full-year earnings guidance, citing a challenging macroeconomic environment influenced by tariffs and a potentially slowing U.S. economy. Despite beating Wall Street expectations for its fiscal first-quarter earnings, Lululemon's CEO noted cautious consumer behavior in the U.S. market. To mitigate the impact of tariffs, the company plans to implement strategic price increases on a small portion of its product assortment, starting in the second half of the current quarter. The company's report follows similar actions by other retailers who have reduced guidance and plan to raise prices due to tariff uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article chronicles the shift in relations between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, from close allies to public adversaries. Initially, Musk was a key advisor in Trump's inner circle, even leading the Department of Government Efficiency, and a significant campaign donor. However, the relationship deteriorated after Musk voiced opposition to Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, leading to a bitter public feud. The timeline highlights key moments, including Musk's endorsement of Trump after an assassination attempt, his presence at Trump rallies, and his eventual departure from the White House amid disagreements over policy.</p>

Merz addressed key issues such as strengthening U.S.-German relations, tariffs impacting German industries, support for Ukraine, and increased NATO defense spending.

          <p>Initial claims for unemployment benefits in the U.S. have reached their highest level in eight months, suggesting a possible weakening in the labor market amid concerns over tariffs. New applications for jobless benefits totaled 247,000, exceeding economists' expectations, though overall filings remain near historic lows. Analysts suggest the increase could indicate broader shifts in the workforce, with tariff-related uncertainty adding strain to the job market. Several major companies have announced layoffs, contributing to the trend, while firings from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are also a leading cause of job cuts.
