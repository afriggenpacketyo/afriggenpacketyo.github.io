          <p>Chinese shipping companies are strategically forming alliances with global partners and exploring regional markets to mitigate the impact of new, steep US port fees expected in October. Giants like Cosco Shipping Holdings are expanding into emerging markets, noting increased services in mainland China, intra-Asia, and other international routes, while also seeing growth in transpacific services. This proactive approach aims to navigate an "unprecedented historical evolution" in the container shipping industry. The industry is bracing for potential challenges but also identifying new opportunities for growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has initiated a new campaign, directly contacting tens of thousands of international students via text and email, warning them to leave the country if their visas have expired. This action addresses a perceived "alarming" rise in students claiming asylum after their legal stay ends, with 41,100 asylum claims coming from visa holders in the year to June 2025. While many claims are legitimate, ministers aim to reduce the number of those seeking asylum solely to remain in the UK. The government also recently shortened the post-study stay for overseas graduates.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.3 billion for Wednesday's drawing, following Monday night's drawing where no tickets matched all winning numbers. This marks the game's fifth-largest jackpot ever, with a cash value of approximately $589 million. The prize has been growing since May 31, and the previous drawing saw multiple $1 million and $2 million winners. Hope for a single winner to claim this massive prize continues to build anticipation across the nation.</p>

          <p>Belgium's Foreign Minister, Maxime Prevot, declared that his country will recognize an independent Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly this month, also announcing "tough sanctions" on the Israeli government. This decision follows Israeli strikes that killed 13 people in Gaza City, as Israel prepares for an offensive there. Prevot emphasized the "humanitarian tragedy" in Gaza and "violence carried out by Israel in violation of international law," while condemning antisemitism and glorification of terrorism. Several other countries are also considering similar recognition, which Israel has repeatedly criticized.</p>

          <p>Pickleball is gaining significant traction in China, with online sales of equipment skyrocketing over six-fold this year to an average of $1.2 million monthly.

The sport's accessibility and ease of learning contribute to its appeal, with local businesses building courts and the Chinese Tennis Association systematizing its development.

          <p>Chinese state broadcaster CCTV has hinted that upcoming Victory Day parade in Beijing will showcase improved variants of its hypersonic missiles, the YJ-21 and DF-17, featuring enhanced penetration capabilities. Military commentator Wei Dongxu suggested the air-launched YJ-21 variant, known as KD-21, could be deployed from bombers outside enemy air defense zones to destroy targets. This development points to a versatile "family of land-, sea- and air-launched variants" adapted for various combat scenarios. While China has not confirmed these missiles are in service, the announcement signals significant advancements in its military technology.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has arrived in China by train, accompanied by top officials, to attend a military parade alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. This marks Kim's first visit to China since 2019 and his fifth since assuming leadership. The trip occurs amid calls from US and South Korean presidents for renewed talks with Pyongyang, which has been increasing its nuclear arsenal. The potential trilateral meeting between Kim, Xi, and Putin, all considered adversaries of the US, signals deepening ties and a united front against Western influence.</p>

          <p>A computer scientist is using advanced facial recognition technology to investigate a photo of a decomposed body from a secret Libyan mortuary, potentially solving the nearly 50-year mystery of charismatic Lebanese cleric Musa al-Sadr's disappearance. Sadr vanished in Libya in 1978 after an invited meeting with then-leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, sparking numerous conspiracy theories. The algorithm showed a "high probability" that the body was Sadr, with a damaged skull suggesting he was killed. This investigation highlights the enduring political and religious significance of Sadr, whose fate remains a powerful symbol for his followers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article explores the surprising parallel drawn by some prominent Anglo-American intellectuals between their own countries and the late Soviet Union. The author cites a Telegraph op-ed claiming "Britain is the Soviet Union in the 1980s," pointing to political rigidity, fear of questioning obsolete dogma, and a managerial class ignoring impending change. While acknowledging the plausibility of these historical comparisons, the article emphasizes that the mere decline of the West, let alone its collapse, would have profound global consequences. This piece encourages serious consideration of these warnings about institutional stagnation.</p>

          <p>Marie Tidball, a Labour MP with a congenital disability affecting all four limbs, has highlighted significant accessibility challenges within the Houses of Parliament. She described difficulties with heavy doors and round handles, as well as the considerable distances to accessible toilets. Tidball, who missed years of school due to surgeries, advocates for Parliament to better reflect the 22% of the voting-age population who are disabled. While some changes, like an accessible door in Portcullis House, have been made, she stresses that more is needed to make the historic buildings and archaic procedures truly inclusive for disabled MPs and constituents.</p>

Its unique design, including wiring bored through logs for lighting, was cutting-edge for its time. The Old Faithful Inn's popularity influenced the design of other grand lodges across national parks, cementing its legacy as an iconic and enduring structure.</p>

          <p>Health experts are sounding the alarm over a surge in Vibrio vulnificus infections, a rare but deadly bacterial illness, attributing its rise to warming seas and higher temperatures. This "flesh-eating" pathogen thrives in warm, brackish coastal waters and can be contracted by consuming raw shellfish or through open wounds. Historically associated with the Gulf Coast, cases are now increasing further north on the East Coast, with Massachusetts reporting 71 cases this year. With a 33% fatality rate, and one in five victims dying within days, officials urge vigilance through safe swimming practices and avoiding raw shellfish.</p>

          <p>A federal judge on Sunday blocked the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children without a deportation order, issuing the ruling just as flights were prepared to take off. The judge's temporary restraining order, lasting 14 days, followed lawyers' alerts about a hurried government effort to repatriate hundreds of children, allegedly circumventing legal protections. The Justice Department confirmed 76 children were slated for deportation, but were deplaned and returned to Health and Human Services custody. The lawsuit argues that US law protects these minors, ensuring they can request humanitarian protection before any removal.</p>

Odell, who now embraces a more confessional style, finds solace in shared vulnerability with his audience and acknowledges the "terrifying" global political uncertainty, yet seeks peace in the present moment.</p>

The Taliban government's Health Ministry expects the death toll to rise, and aid efforts are underway, though hampered by severed international ties and US aid cuts under President Trump.

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a stark warning, claiming a record $15 trillion in planned US investment would be "immediately cancelled" if courts invalidate his tariff policies. This follows a US appeals court ruling that deemed his administration's broad use of tariffs unconstitutional, though they remain in effect pending a Supreme Court appeal. Trump asserted that losing these tariffs would devastate the American economy, potentially turning the nation into a "Third World Nation." Economists, however, note the ruling focuses on executive authority, not the economic merits, suggesting Congress could still authorize tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
