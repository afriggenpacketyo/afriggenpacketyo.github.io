          <p>Donald Trump has publicly condemned calls for the complete release of files related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, dismissing the matter as a "hoax" orchestrated by Democrats. In a social media post, he criticized his own "PAST supporters" for focusing on the issue, stating he no longer wants their support if they continue to pursue it. This reaction comes as prominent Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have urged for greater transparency from the Justice Department regarding the case and the handling of related documents.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have voiced concerns following recent Israeli airstrikes on military targets in Damascus, Syria. Israel stated the strikes were intended to protect the Druze minority amid escalating internal conflicts in southern Syria, where a fragile ceasefire was announced. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed hope for "de-escalation," while the EU and Turkey condemned the strikes, emphasizing the need to respect Syria's sovereignty. The violence has reportedly resulted in hundreds of casualties.</p>

          <p>Scott Swift, the 73-year-old father of pop star Taylor Swift, recently underwent a quintuple bypass heart surgery and is now recovering well. A representative confirmed the procedure was not the result of a heart attack and that he is doing "fantastic" with his family by his side. The article notes this is not the first health challenge for the Swift family, referencing Andrea Swift's previous battles with cancer and a brain tumor. Taylor has previously spoken about how her family's health issues have shaped her perspective.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that former Conservative ministers have "serious questions to answer" regarding a significant data breach that exposed the details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who aided British forces. The breach, which occurred in 2022, was concealed by a super-injunction and led to a secret, costly relocation program. Starmer highlighted these inherited failings in Parliament after the injunction was lifted, bringing the issue to public light for the first time. The breach has raised significant constitutional and security concerns.</p>

The institutional securities and wealth management segments both showed significant revenue growth, attributed to higher client activity and asset management fees.

          <p>President Donald Trump has downplayed the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating such a move is "highly unlikely" unless for reasons of fraud. This comment came shortly after reports that he had discussed the idea with Republican lawmakers, causing brief volatility in financial markets. Trump has frequently criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates, continuing his critique by calling him a "knucklehead." Despite the rhetoric, the statement appears to signal a temporary de-escalation of his pressure on the independent central bank.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by Lord David Anderson KC has concluded that the UK's Prevent counter-terrorism program missed multiple opportunities to intervene with Axel Rudakubana, who later murdered three children in Southport. Teachers had referred Rudakubana to Prevent three times due to his obsession with violence, but his case was closed each time because he lacked a specific terrorist ideology. The review calls for the program to address individuals fascinated by extreme violence, regardless of ideological motive, to prevent future tragedies. The report also noted separate failings in the handling of the man who murdered MP Sir David Amess.</p>

          <p>A major spending package signed by President Donald Trump will introduce significant changes to the federal student loan system, including new lifetime borrowing limits for students and parents. Effective July 2026, the legislation establishes a total lifetime cap of $257,500 and creates new annual and aggregate limits for graduate and Parent PLUS loans, while eliminating Grad PLUS loans entirely. Experts suggest these changes will reshape how higher education is financed, potentially forcing students toward private loans or prompting high-cost universities to lower tuition. The move is expected to particularly impact those pursuing expensive professional degrees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Model and author Emily Ratajkowski is returning to acting with a role in the new Netflix romantic comedy "Too Much," created by Lena Dunham. Ratajkowski explains that she took a step back from her acting career around 2020 to reset her priorities after feeling unfulfilled and firing her professional team. She says returning to work with Dunham, a longtime friend, felt like a natural fit for her first project back. In the series, she plays a character Dunham wrote specifically for her, exploring themes of career, aging, and personal fulfillment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is considering amendments to a White House-requested spending cut package that targets approximately $9 billion, primarily from foreign aid and public broadcasting. The proposal, which narrowly advanced after a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President, has faced opposition from some Senate Republicans concerned about its impact. A potential amendment would restore $400 million in funding for an AIDS prevention program to secure more support. Congress must approve the final version by the end of the week, requiring both the Senate and House to agree on any changes.</p>

          <p>An off-duty police officer in Pennsylvania, John J. Hawk, has been sentenced to five years of probation after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the 2022 death of Kenneth Vinyard. Vinyard, a bystander, was attempting to provide police with information about a shooting when Hawk confronted him, struck him, and performed a leg-sweep maneuver, causing a fatal head injury. At the sentencing, Hawk apologized to the victim's family, who described Vinyard as their family's glue. The victim's family also reportedly settled a nearly $1 million lawsuit against the township and Hawk.</p>

          <p>A segment on CNN's "NewsNight With Abby Phillip" became tense when political commentator Scott Jennings accused a fellow panelist of lying about the price of eggs. During a discussion on the economy, Jennings repeatedly insisted that egg prices have decreased significantly since Donald Trump's inauguration. Host Abby Phillip eventually intervened, chastising Jennings for derailing the conversation. While egg prices have fallen from a peak, government data indicates they are still up year-over-year, which was the source of the on-air dispute.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the significant and open revolt within Donald Trump's MAGA base following the Justice Department's conclusion on the Jeffrey Epstein case. For the first time, many of his most ardent supporters are rejecting his narrative, viewing the official report as a "deep state" cover-up and Trump's acceptance of it as a betrayal. The author suggests the Epstein conspiracy became a sacred symbol for the movement, representing the ultimate corruption they believe Trump was elected to expose. Trump's inability to control his base on this issue reveals the power of the conspiratorial mindset he cultivated.</p>

The leak, which occurred in 2022, was hidden from the public by a super-injunction until this week. It led to the creation of a secret and costly program, the Afghanistan Response Route, to relocate those at risk, who were not informed about the breach.
