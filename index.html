          <p>A recent ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll reveals that President Trump's approval rating stands at 39% at his 100-day mark, the lowest in 80 years, reflecting public disapproval of his policies and economic concerns about a potential recession. Seventy-two percent of those polled believe his economic policies will cause a recession in the short term, and 73% feel the economy is in bad shape. The poll also highlights concerns about presidential overreach, with 64% stating he's going too far in expanding presidential powers, and 62% feeling his administration doesn't respect the rule of law. Despite these negative assessments, Trump still maintains trust over Democrats in Congress to handle the nation's main problems.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has offered a glimmer of hope to Ukrainians amid ongoing conflict with Russia. Trump questioned why President Putin would continue to attack Ukraine as the U.S. is trying to broker peace talks. Trump suggested Putin may need to be “dealt with differently” and potentially face more sanctions. This development comes at a crucial time in the war, as the U.S. has been pushing Ukraine to accept a peace plan that many Ukrainians see as unfavorable.</p>

          <p>Indiana Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith has criticized state Senate Democrats for comparing a GOP bill restricting DEI programs to the Three-Fifths Compromise, arguing that the compromise was not pro-discrimination but rather limited the power of pro-slavery states. The bill, which passed both chambers, restricts DEI programs in schools and allows lawsuits against institutions compelling certain beliefs about race or origin. Critics argue the bill ignores historical discrimination, while Beckwith claims it was a step toward equality by limiting pro-slavery representation in Congress. The bill now awaits the governor's signature.</p>

Legal experts from both parties say that this effort has gained unprecedented traction, as judges have shown a willingness to entertain challenges to votes cast by people who followed instructions. The outcome of this case could set a precedent for overturning future elections, even if the initial attempt fails, by creating a blueprint for challenging votes on technical grounds after Election Day.</p>

          <p>A research group at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has found success using the immunotherapy drug dostarlimab to treat solid tumors in the stomach, esophagus, and rectum, potentially sparing patients from invasive surgeries and harsh therapies. In a trial of 103 people with tumors responsive to immunotherapy, the drug was administered on its own, replacing standard treatments. This approach offers a promising alternative for cancer patients, potentially improving their quality of life.</p>

          <p>A protest movement against Donald Trump, initiated on Reddit with a post calling for protests in all 50 states, has grown significantly, drawing hundreds of thousands to the streets. The movement, known as "50501," operates without a central leader and focuses on local organizing and action.

          <p>Actions by Donald Trump are causing growing uncertainty in Taiwan regarding the reliability of American support. The imposition of unexpected tariffs on Taiwanese exports to the US has blindsided Taipei, raising questions about the strategic value of the island. The Lai administration believed that Taiwanese exports to the US would face tariffs of 10 per cent at most.

          <p>An opinion piece criticizes Donald Trump for breaking norms of good government and engaging in questionable ethics practices, including personal enrichment and expanding presidential powers. Trump's actions, such as promoting Teslas on the White House driveway and benefiting from a cryptocurrency marketed with his likeness, are seen as exceeding the transgressions of previous presidents. The author argues that Trump's behavior represents a new low in presidential ethics.</p>
