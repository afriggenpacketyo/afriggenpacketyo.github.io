          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that intelligence data suggests Russia is planning new offensive operations, disregarding peace efforts. He emphasized the lack of indications that Russia is seriously considering peace or diplomacy. The announcement follows recent cross-border drone attacks between Russia and Ukraine, with both sides claiming to have downed numerous drones. Zelenskyy views Russia's continued strikes as evidence of their insincerity in seeking peace and highlighted the need for the world to recognize Russia's blatant disregard for diplomatic solutions.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested reallocating $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools across the country. This proposal follows previous actions by his administration to freeze or withdraw funding from Harvard, citing concerns about antisemitism and liberal ideology. Trump gave no specific details on how this redistribution would occur, but the move appears to be aimed at pressuring Harvard and promoting vocational education. Trump's administration has previously frozen research funding for scientific studies at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which is now facing severe budget cuts.</p>

Domestic shipments of gin have increased significantly, driven by the flexibility of gin production and the ability to utilize existing shochu and whiskey equipment. Distilleries across Japan are incorporating local botanicals like goya bitter gourd, burnt lacquer wood, and camellia flowers. This boom has led to the rise of gin-focused e-commerce sites and bars, with major manufacturers also entering the market.</p>

Streeting emphasized the progress being made in the NHS and cautioned that strikes would hinder this progress, asserting that strikes are in no one's best interest. Resident doctors are set to receive a 5.4% average pay rise this year, but the union argues that this is insufficient to compensate for below-inflation pay awards since 2008. The union is advocating for industrial action, potentially including strikes.</p>

          <p>The government is implementing changes to apprenticeship funding in England, shifting the focus to individuals under 21. Funding for level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree, will be restricted to this age group, potentially impacting advanced NHS training. The government aims to create 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults and those needing retraining. An increase in a charge paid by employers recruiting from outside the UK will be used to create 45,000 training places, building on existing programs aimed at helping adults get into work.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Vladimir Putin, calling him "absolutely crazy" for escalating attacks on Ukraine, a shift from his previous claims of a good relationship and ability to quickly end the conflict. This change in tone comes after Russia launched its largest aerial assault of the war, undermining Trump's assertions about influencing Putin. The outburst suggests Trump is realizing his inability to resolve the conflict is damaging his image as a dealmaker. Macron believes Trump is beginning to understand Putin's true intentions, leading to potential shifts in U.S. policy.</p>

          <p>King Charles III visited Canada, seen as a symbolic move to assert Canadian sovereignty amid President Trump's past suggestions of annexation. The visit, at the invitation of Prime Minister Mark Carney, included Charles opening Canada's Parliament, a rare occurrence meant to emphasize Canada's distinct identity. While the King's role is largely ceremonial, the visit is viewed as a subtle diplomatic gesture to strengthen Canada's ties to its heritage and independence from the United States, especially at a time when Trump's comments have raised concerns about Canada's sovereignty.</p>
