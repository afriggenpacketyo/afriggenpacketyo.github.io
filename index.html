          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 17:16:22 EDT</div>

          <p>Tesla has applied to operate its robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, aiming to compete with Waymo, which has been active there since 2020. The move follows a pilot program in Austin, Texas, that has faced some operational issues and regulatory scrutiny. Tesla's approach relies heavily on cameras rather than more expensive sensors like lidar, a distinction the company believes will make its autonomous vehicles more economically viable. The Arizona Department of Transportation is expected to make a decision on the application by the end of July.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in central Gaza killed at least 15 Palestinians, among them eight children, who were waiting for nutritional supplements outside a health clinic. The aid group Project Hope, which operates the clinic, condemned the attack as a violation of international law. The Israeli military stated it had targeted a Hamas operative and expressed regret for any harm to civilians, adding that the incident is under review. This event occurs amidst ongoing, difficult negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.</p>

The potential for South Korea to acquire nuclear arms is seen as a particularly strong catalyst that could push Japan to follow suit. This shift reflects a dangerous new phase of potential nuclear proliferation in East Asia amid rising geopolitical tensions.</p>

Instead, he suggested she consider downsizing to a condo, which would reduce maintenance responsibilities while allowing her to retain the financial benefits of homeownership and build equity.
