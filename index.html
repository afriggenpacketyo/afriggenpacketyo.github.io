          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, which allows taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. Most students attending accredited private schools will receive $10,000 per year, while students with disabilities will receive up to $30,000, and home-schooled students will get $2,000 annually. Democrats argue that the legislation will hurt public schools by siphoning funds to benefit wealthier students already in private schools, labeling it 'welfare for the wealthy'.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's rocket facility in South Texas, Starbase, is on track to become an official city following a vote approved by local residents, primarily SpaceX employees.

SpaceX says the city status is needed to manage roads, utilities, schooling, and medical care for residents, while critics worry about public access to Boca Chica State Park and Boca Chica Beach.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence will receive the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his actions on January 6, 2021, when he refused to overturn the 2020 election results. The BBC article highlights that Pence defied pressure from President Trump to reject electoral votes cast for Joe Biden. The JFK Library Foundation praised Pence for putting his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power. Since leaving office, Pence has largely been shunned by Trump and the Republican Party.</p>

          <p>A Houthi missile strike near Israel's main airport forced a brief shutdown and exposed vulnerabilities in the country's defenses, according to this Yahoo News article. The article notes that the strike highlights the Houthis' continued ability to strike distant targets despite a sustained US military campaign. While Israel's missile defense system has intercepted many projectiles, this incident raises questions about its effectiveness. Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed further attacks against the Houthis, and Iran warned it would respond to any attack on it.</p>

          <p>In a New York Times guest essay, Damon Linker explores the intellectual tradition that informs President Trump's expansive view of executive power. The article traces the influence of thinkers like Carl Schmitt, Leo Strauss, and Adrian Vermeule, who advocate for a strong executive capable of decisive action. Linker argues that this approach threatens to transform the American presidency into a dictatorial office, disregarding the separation of powers and asserting a near-permanent state of emergency.</p>
