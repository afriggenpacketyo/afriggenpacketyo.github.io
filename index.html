The State Department does not anticipate offering direct U.S. government-assisted departure from Iran, advising Americans there to use existing means to leave.

Khalil's attorneys argued that the government was violating his free speech rights due to his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests.

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated 639 employees at Voice of America (VOA) and its parent organization, USAGM, reducing the international broadcasting service to a fraction of its former size. These terminations round out the elimination of 1,400 positions since March, significantly scaling back an organization founded in 1942 to counter Nazi propaganda. Kari Lake, Trump's senior advisor to USAGM, stated the move ends decades of taxpayer funding for an agency she claims was riddled with dysfunction, bias, and waste. The cuts represent a major retreat from America's Cold War strategy of using broadcasting to reach audiences behind the iron curtain.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with ICE in order to receive transportation funding. The ruling prevents the government from enforcing new immigration rules for states while the lawsuit proceeds. The judge stated that Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on transportation funding. The Trump administration has threatened to cut off federal funding to "sanctuary" jurisdictions that limit cooperation with ICE.</p>
