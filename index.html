          <p>ABC News has decided not to renew Terry Moran's contract due to a social media post where he referred to President Trump and advisor Stephen Miller as "world-class" haters, which the network deemed a violation of its objectivity and fairness policies. Moran's post on X criticized Miller's character, focusing on his "bile" and capacity for hatred, while also labeling Trump a "world-class hater." White House officials, including Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and Vice President JD Vance, condemned Moran's remarks as unhinged and disgraceful. Stephen Miller responded by saying Moran's post unmasked the radicalism of privileged media figures. The network emphasized its commitment to trusted journalism and high standards for its reporters, thus ending its agreement with Moran.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has instructed U.S. embassies to proceed with the termination of all remaining U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) staffers overseas, transferring USAID's foreign assistance programs to the State Department by the following Monday. This directive comes despite a federal judge's temporary block on President Trump's executive order for mass firings across multiple federal agencies. The Trump administration claims the reorganization plan was already underway before the executive order, thus not violating the court injunction. The termination of USAID staffers is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to dismantle the aid agency, which they targeted for elimination, but the legalities are being challenged.</p>

          <p>China's military-civilian fusion strategy, designed to integrate military and civilian technology, aims to modernize its military by 2035 and establish world-class armed forces by 2049. While Beijing credits the plan with advancing equipment and improving training for the People’s Liberation Army, the plan also faces challenges. Despite encouraging private sector involvement in defense orders since 2016, state-owned conglomerates continue to dominate the sector. The strategy has also become a point of contention in the US-China rivalry, leading to U.S. sanctions on Chinese companies accused of aiding the PLA, impacting sectors like semiconductors, AI, and drone manufacturing.</p>

He claimed, without providing evidence, that paid "insurrectionists" and "criminal invaders" were seizing the city. Trump stated he deployed National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles, despite objections from California Governor Gavin Newsom, to prevent the country from being destroyed by invasion and lawlessness. He described the events in California as a full-blown assault on peace and national sovereignty carried out by rioters bearing foreign flags, aiming to continue a foreign invasion.</p>

          <p>The UK has imposed sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, for inciting violence against Palestinian communities in the occupied West Bank.

Foreign Secretary David Lammy accused Smotrich and Ben-Gvir of inciting extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights.

The Joy-Cons now connect magnetically and can function as a mouse, which is useful in strategy games like "Civilization VII." The Switch 2 also includes enhanced chat features with an optional camera, and a 1080p screen with 4K TV support, enhancing the visual experience of older games, however battery life may be a challenge.</p>

Trump's lawyers dismissed the request as legally meritless, claiming it would jeopardize the safety of Homeland Security personnel and interfere with federal operations.

          <p>Google has offered buyouts to employees across several divisions, including its knowledge and information (K&I) unit, which houses search, ads, and commerce, as well as central engineering, marketing, research, and communications teams. This move is part of Google's ongoing efforts to reduce headcount following layoffs in 2023. The "voluntary exit program" applies to U.S.-based employees, with some teams mandating office returns for remote workers near offices. This initiative comes as Google aims to cut costs while expanding its investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure for 2026.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department is requesting a pause on a ruling that mandates due process for deported Venezuelans. This emergency request was made shortly before the Trump administration was scheduled to outline procedures for allowing nearly 140 Venezuelans deported to El Salvador to challenge their expulsions. The legal battle centers on whether these individuals were afforded sufficient legal protections before being removed from the United States. The outcome of this request could significantly impact immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>Ballymena, County Antrim, has experienced a second night of serious disorder, with petrol bombs, masonry, and fireworks thrown at police. Police responded with baton rounds and water cannon, deploying riot dogs to the scene. The violence occurred in the Clonavon Terrace area, following an earlier peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault in the town. A number of homes and businesses were damaged during the unrest. A 29-year-old man has been charged in connection with the previous night's violence.</p>
