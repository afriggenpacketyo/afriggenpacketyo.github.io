          <p>Two firefighters were killed and a third was critically wounded in what authorities are calling a deliberate ambush in Idaho. The incident occurred as they responded to a wildfire on Canfield Mountain, which police believe was intentionally set by the suspect to lure first responders to the scene. Following an hours-long standoff, law enforcement located the body of the suspected lone gunman near the fire with a firearm. The attack has been condemned as a heinous assault on public safety personnel.</p>

          <p>Canada has rescinded its planned digital services tax on major U.S. technology companies, prompting the resumption of trade negotiations with the United States. The decision came after President Trump threatened to suspend talks over the proposed 3% levy, which would have retroactively affected firms like Amazon, Google, and Meta. Following a phone call between Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Trump, both leaders agreed to continue discussions toward a new economic and security relationship. The move is seen by some analysts as a concession to appease the White House and big tech. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tensions are rising between Ghana and China over the issue of rampant illegal gold mining within the West African nation. In response to accusations targeting Chinese nationals, China's ambassador to Ghana, Tong Defa, has pushed back, stating the perception is unfair. He argued that Chinese citizens cannot obtain local mining licenses and are often facilitated by Ghanaians who enable the illicit operations. This diplomatic friction highlights the complexities of addressing illegal mining and its international dimensions.</p>

          <p>A significant political debate is unfolding in Germany regarding a potential ban on the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) passed a motion calling for preparations to ban the AfD, a move supported by the Green Party. However, Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt from the conservative CSU has urged caution, advocating for the legal process to play out before taking such a step. The debate intensifies as the AfD, which has been classified as a "right-wing extremist" group by intelligence agencies pending a court challenge, continues to grow in popularity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is proceeding with a final vote on President Trump's major legislative package, titled the "One Big, Beautiful Bill," after a weekend of debate. The bill, which includes increased spending on border security and defense offset by cuts to social programs, is estimated to add nearly $3.3 trillion to the national deficit over ten years. Republicans are utilizing the budget reconciliation process to advance the measure with a simple majority, bypassing the need for Democratic support.

The persistent slump is attributed to a combination of sluggish consumer demand, a deepening price war among manufacturers, and deflationary pressures.

          <p>China has announced a conditional and partial lifting of its blanket ban on Japanese seafood, which was imposed in 2023 following the release of treated water from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The new measure allows for the resumption of imports of aquatic products from most of Japan. However, the prohibition will remain in effect for ten prefectures, including Fukushima and Tokyo. This move is seen as a potential step toward resetting diplomatic and trade relations, which were strained by the initial comprehensive ban.</p>

The author contends that Russia, bogged down by its protracted and costly war in Ukraine, is no longer capable of meaningfully defending its strategic partners. Despite a formal alliance and Iran's support for Russia's war effort, Moscow offered only verbal condemnation rather than concrete military or diplomatic backing. This inaction is presented as a clear sign that Russia's status as a superpower has been critically weakened.</p>

          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers attribute to the vehicles' unique design. Studies indicate that the smooth but rapid acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs can induce queasiness more readily than internal combustion engine cars. A key factor is the regenerative braking system, which creates low-frequency deceleration that can provoke motion sickness symptoms. The issue is being studied by automotive engineers seeking to improve passenger comfort in the new generation of vehicles.</p>
