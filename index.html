          <p>The Trump administration is poised to deploy over 100 federal agents to the San Francisco Bay Area for a major immigration enforcement operation, drawing sharp criticism from California leaders. Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the move as authoritarian, likening it to an arsonist creating fear to then claim solving it. San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie reiterated the city's readiness, having taken executive actions to bolster support for immigrant communities and coordinate departments ahead of the federal presence. This deployment marks San Francisco as the latest target in President Trump's campaign of mass immigration arrests in Democratic-led cities, potentially triggering a significant confrontation between federal and local authorities. The legal basis for such deployments has faced challenges in other locations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband's pledge to cut UK energy bills by £300 is facing scrutiny, as the expert whose 2023 report formed the basis of the estimate now suggests rising electricity costs could "wipe out" the savings. Economist Pawel Czyzak of Ember stated his analysis needs updating due to changes in offshore wind costs and other factors. While Miliband's department stands by its commitment to lower bills through clean power, a Tony Blair Institute report advocates shifting focus to cheaper electricity and axing carbon taxes. The ongoing debate highlights the volatility of energy markets and the complexities of achieving promised savings.</p>

          <p>A family of three was rescued by the Coast Guard off Cape Cod after their 30-foot pleasure boat caught fire, forcing them to swim to Naushon Island where they sheltered in a barn for nearly two days. A relative alerted authorities when they didn't return as expected. The son's quick thinking to use the boat's marine radio, which washed ashore, enabled a mayday call that led to their rescue by helicopter. One family member was in critical condition, while two were stable. The Coast Guard praised their use of quality equipment, highlighting the importance of preparedness in maritime emergencies.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca hails Reggie Walsh, a 17-year-old midfielder, as a special talent, having plucked him from the club's academy to become its third-youngest player. Walsh recently broke an 11-year record as Chelsea's youngest player in the Champions League, making his fourth first-team appearance in a dominant 5-1 victory. Maresca admires Walsh's innate understanding of his system, noting the youngster performs desired actions without prompting. A technical, deep-lying playmaker with impressive vision, Walsh signed his first professional contract this week, marking him as a promising prospect for Chelsea and an England Under-18s international.</p>

          <p>Helen Ledwick, a former BBC journalist, is campaigning to break the silence around pelvic organ prolapse, a common condition affecting one in twelve women, often after childbirth. Experiencing symptoms two weeks post-delivery, Ledwick initially felt confusion and isolation due to the lack of awareness and "taboo" nature of the issue. Prolapse occurs when pelvic organs shift and bulge into the vagina, impacting daily life and mental health. Through a podcast and book, Helen aims to provide knowledge and comfort, encouraging women to seek support and challenging the stigma that often prevents open discussion and timely medical intervention for this treatable condition.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new sanctions on Russia's largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, citing Moscow's refusal to end the Ukraine war and fund its "war machine." Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated the action aims to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin towards an immediate ceasefire, following a recent wave of Russian drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities that killed several civilians, including children. President Trump expressed frustration over Putin's lack of seriousness in peace negotiations, shelving a planned meeting. The sanctions, which target dozens of subsidiaries, are part of an ongoing international effort to exert economic pressure on Russia.</p>

ACL's CEO, Andrew Abbott, expressed shock, warning that the tariffs could force the company to relocate operations, impacting US importers and exporters who rely on its unique hybrid service.

          <p>An Illinois sheriff's deputy, Sean Grayson, is on trial for first-degree murder, accused of fatally shooting Sonya Massey, a Black woman, in her home without justification. Prosecutors argue Grayson, who is white, disregarded training and policing principles, acting out of anger during a confrontation over a pot of hot water. Body camera footage, shown to the jury, reportedly depicts Massey posing no threat despite Grayson's repeated demands for her to drop the pot. The defense contends the use of force was reasonable, fearing the hot water. This case highlights ongoing questions about law enforcement shootings and has prompted changes in Illinois law regarding officer background transparency.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur secured a goalless draw against Monaco in the Champions League, despite a dismal performance that saw them rely heavily on goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario's brilliance and a measure of good fortune. This marked Spurs' first goalless draw in 125 games, with the team managing only two shots on target and failing to impress travelling supporters. Manager Thomas Frank acknowledged Vicario's exceptional saves as crucial to earning the "hard-fought point." While the draw keeps Spurs unbeaten after three group games, their uninspired display suggests a significant improvement will be needed for future challenges, especially against stronger opponents like Paris St. Germain.</p>

          <p>North Carolina's Republican-controlled legislature has successfully passed a new congressional map, strategically redrawing district lines to bolster the GOP's prospects of retaining control of the House in the upcoming midterms. This measure, which targets a major Democratic-held battleground district to make it more favorable to conservatives, passed despite the state's Democratic governor having limited veto power over standalone maps. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries condemned the map as a "morally corrupt move" designed to dilute the voting power of Black citizens and announced plans for immediate legal challenges. This redistricting initiative aligns with a broader national Republican effort to secure additional House seats.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced a 12% increase in third-quarter revenue, ending two consecutive periods of decline, yet its stock dropped almost 5% in extended trading due to missed earnings estimates. While automotive revenue grew, net income fell 37%, attributed to lower EV prices and a 50% rise in operating expenses, partly for AI and R&D. The quarter also saw sales pulled forward by expiring federal EV tax credits. CEO Elon Musk's grand futuristic visions on the earnings call offered little specific guidance, and slow progress on the Full Self Driving system remains a concern for investors.</p>

This deal aims to conclude months of federal scrutiny that saw the university's president resign in June, reportedly to protect staff and students from severe repercussions. Under the terms, UVA will provide quarterly data to the department through 2028, with its president personally certifying compliance. This follows similar agreements by other universities to restore federal funding, marking UVA as the first public institution to settle amid the administration's expanded campaign against DEI practices.</p>

          <p>The International Chess Federation (Fide) is investigating former world champion Vladimir Kramnik's public attacks on American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky, whose sudden death at 29 has shocked the chess world. Naroditsky, a popular online player and coach, had denied Kramnik's unsubstantiated accusations of cheating, which he said took a toll on his mental well-being. Following Naroditsky's unexpected passing, tributes poured in, accompanied by outrage and calls for Fide to address Kramnik's conduct. Fide's CEO, Emil Sutovsky, confirmed an investigation into Kramnik's behavior, while also sparking further controversy by questioning the support Naroditsky received during his lifetime. The incident highlights deep divisions and the volatile nature of online chess.</p>

          <p>The US government shutdown has now entered its 22nd day, marking it as the second-longest federal funding lapse in the nation's history, with no immediate end visible. This prolonged stalemate arises from Senate Democrats' refusal to support a Republican-sponsored short-term funding bill, demanding the inclusion of extended Affordable Care Act tax credits, which are scheduled to expire. Republicans contend that Democrats are holding the government hostage, while Democratic leaders urge President Trump to engage directly in negotiations to resolve the impasse. The ongoing shutdown has significant consequences, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal workers without pay and causing considerable disruption to the national economy.</p>

          <p>The US gross national debt has for the first time exceeded $38 trillion, a concerning milestone further aggravated by the current government shutdown. This fiscal challenge disrupts the economy and results in hundreds of thousands of federal workers going unpaid. According to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, the pace of debt accumulation is accelerating at twice the rate observed since 2000, underscoring a failure by lawmakers to meet their basic fiscal responsibilities. Experts caution that this escalating debt could erode investor confidence and necessitate higher interest payments, thereby curtailing crucial public and private sector spending in the future.

          <p>China is pursuing an ambitious transformation of its energy consumption and urban planning to build a climate-proof future, contrasting sharply with US President Donald Trump's skepticism on climate change. Chinese President Xi Jinping unveiled strategies to cut emissions by 7-10% from peak levels by 2035 and increase non-fossil fuels to over 30% of its energy mix, focusing on wind and solar. Driven by data on rising climate risks, Beijing is re-engineering infrastructure for resilience against floods, heatwaves, and extreme weather. This strategic shift is framed as both an environmental imperative and economically sensible, positioning China as a leader in green development.</p>
