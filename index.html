          <p>According to an Israeli official, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is advocating for a military solution to free the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. This shift in strategy comes from a growing belief within the Israeli government that Hamas is not genuinely interested in a diplomatic deal. The news follows recent protests in Tel Aviv demanding the government secure the hostages' release, fueled by distressing videos showing their poor condition. Meanwhile, concerns over the severe humanitarian and hunger crisis in Gaza continue to escalate globally.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotech companies Innovent and BeOne are projected to achieve profitability by 2025, marking a significant milestone for the nation's pharmaceutical start-up sector. This success is largely driven by new products, particularly Innovent's weight-loss drug mazdutide, which is expected to generate substantial revenue. The development indicates a maturation of China's biotech industry, showing it can create valuable treatments and achieve financial independence without constant investor funding. Analysts see this as a positive sign for the sector's long-term sustainability and innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government has pledged an extra £100 million to intensify efforts against people-smuggling gangs operating across the English Channel. The funding will support the National Crime Agency with hundreds of additional officers and new technology to disrupt the criminal networks. This initiative comes as a record number of migrants have crossed the Channel this year. However, the plan has drawn criticism from opposition parties, who have labeled it as insufficient and a reactive measure to a persistent crisis.</p>

The tragic incident, which occurred on July 28, had already claimed the lives of a 7-year-old and a 13-year-old girl who were also on the sailboat. A fourth girl was injured but has since been released from the hospital. The U.S. Coast Guard is leading a thorough investigation into the crash, with participation from international authorities, to determine the cause of the devastating accident.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic legislators has left Texas to break the state House's quorum, a dramatic move aimed at preventing a vote on a new congressional map proposed by Republicans. The map could create up to five new GOP-leaning districts, a plan Democrats have called a partisan gerrymander. In response, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has called for the lawmakers to be found and arrested. This tactic, which Democrats have used in the past, is intended to run out the clock on the 30-day special legislative session.</p>

          <p>A riot at the Taxpan prison in the eastern Mexican state of Veracruz has resulted in the deaths of seven inmates and left eleven others injured. The violence reportedly erupted due to inmate anger over alleged extortion and abuse by members of the Grupo Sombra criminal organization within the facility. Authorities intervened to restore order, but the event highlights the persistent and severe problems plaguing Mexico's prison system, including overcrowding, corruption, and the powerful influence of cartels and gangs behind bars, as noted in previous human rights reports.</p>

          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese aerospace engineers have proposed a significant upgrade for combat drones to improve their survivability. The concept involves fitting small or medium-sized drones with side-mounted rocket boosters, enabling them to perform high-G, last-second maneuvers to evade incoming missiles. According to simulations published in a Chinese defense journal, this 'terminal evasion' system could dramatically increase a drone's survival rate to nearly 90%. The innovation aims to counter increasingly sophisticated air defense systems that threaten drone operations on the modern battlefield.</p>

          <p>Hamas has stated its readiness to allow the Red Cross to deliver aid to hostages in Gaza, provided Israel permanently opens humanitarian corridors. However, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum responded with deep skepticism, calling the announcement a ploy by a 'terrorist organization.' The forum reiterated its demand for the immediate release of all hostages, stating that Hamas is obligated to care for them and will be held responsible for any deaths. This exchange follows the release of videos showing hostages in an emaciated state.</p>

          <p>Renowned economist Jeffrey Sachs has warned that aggressive rhetoric and policies from the U.S. toward China risk becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy of military conflict. In an interview, Sachs argued that the U.S. initiated the current trade war and needs to act with more prudence. He advised that China should pivot its export focus toward developing markets in Asia, Africa, and Latin America rather than relying on the increasingly hostile and untrustworthy U.S. and European markets for future growth.

          <p>Rescuers have found the body of the fifth and final miner who was trapped in Chile's El Teniente copper mine, confirming all five are deceased. The tunnel collapse occurred following a 4.2 magnitude tremor, which also killed one other worker at the time of the incident, bringing the total death toll to six. The state-run mining company Codelco has suspended operations in the affected area and announced an investigation involving international experts to determine the cause of the tragedy.

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume miles into the sky. The eruption occurred just days after a massive 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck the region. Seismologists suggest the quake may have triggered the volcanic activity by shaking the underground magma system of a volcano that was already near an eruptive state. The sparsely populated area is not under immediate threat, and authorities have issued an aviation alert as a precaution.</p>

They stated that the discovery is not an isolated incident and are calling for more effective action to address the increasing rat population.

          <p>In an unusual arrangement, the U.S. government has secured what President Trump termed a 'golden share' as part of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel. This agreement grants the government special governance rights, including veto power over certain operational decisions like factory closures, to safeguard national security interests. While not a traditional golden share involving an equity stake, the deal gives the U.S. an unprecedented level of control over the private company's operations, reflecting a broader trend of reviewing business transactions for national security implications.

          <p>A new podcast series from NPR's Embedded delves into the contentious history of sex testing in sports, as World Athletics recently mandated genetic testing for athletes competing in the female category. The report highlights that such policies are not new, having been used from the 1970s to the 1990s, and often target women with natural biological variations. The series questions the scientific basis and fairness of these rules, which affect both cisgender women with differences in sex development and transgender athletes, raising complex questions about inclusivity and protection in sports.</p>
