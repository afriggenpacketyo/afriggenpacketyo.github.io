          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 14:31:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>University of Chicago professor Robert Pape describes the current era as one of "violent populism," characterized by increasing political violence and growing public support for it on both the right and left. He cites recent assassinations and survey data showing a significant percentage of both Democrats and Republicans justifying the use of force for political ends. Pape argues the root cause is not the internet, which is merely an accelerant, but rather a profound demographic shift as the U.S. transitions towards a white-minority democracy, creating social and political tension. He concludes that while the future is not predetermined, political leaders must step up to condemn violence and de-escalate rhetoric to prevent the situation from worsening.</p>

          <p>The final stage of the Vuelta a España cycling competition in Madrid was abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters breached the course, knocking down barriers and occupying the road. The disruption led organizers to declare Jonas Vingegaard the overall winner of the tour. The protests were directed at the Israel-Premier Tech team, which had faced demonstrations throughout the multi-stage race, forcing modifications to their jerseys and raising safety concerns among riders. Following the cancellation, clashes continued between some protesters and the more than 1,000 police officers deployed for the event.</p>

During a concert at London's Wembley Stadium, Coldplay's Chris Martin paused the show to ask the audience to send love to Kirk's family, as well as to other people suffering around the world. Country music stars Morgan Wallen and Jason Aldean also honored Kirk during their respective performances, with Aldean decrying political violence and praising Kirk's work with Turning Point USA. These tributes from the entertainment world highlight the widespread reaction to the activist's killing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a joint television appearance, Democratic Senator Chris Coons and Republican Senator James Lankford discussed the rising political extremism in the U.S. following the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Both senators agreed that the internet and social media algorithms act as an accelerant, pushing people towards more extreme and angry content, though it is not the sole cause of the division. They highlighted the increasing threats against public officials and their families, which they believe weakens the nation's ability to have robust debates. The senators advocated for bipartisan solutions, such as the Kids Online Safety Act, to mitigate online harms and called for leaders to model calmer, more respectful political discourse.</p>

          <p>The Venezuelan government has accused the United States of a "direct provocation" after alleging that a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Jason Dunham, illegally seized a Venezuelan fishing boat in its exclusive economic zone.

Venezuela claims the action is part of a U.S. effort to escalate tensions and justify military action in the Caribbean. The incident occurs amid heightened strain between the two nations, following Washington's deployment of warships to the region for counter-narcotics operations.</p>

          <p>This article explores the modern theme park industry, using the opening of Universal's new $7 billion Epic Universe as a case study for how these destinations engineer overwhelming and immersive fun. To compete with the endless entertainment available on smartphones, parks are creating meticulously detailed worlds and physically intense rides that push the limits of the human body. From strategically placed landmarks that guide crowds to managing hours-long queues with in-line bathrooms, every aspect of the visitor experience is micromanaged. The goal is to create a perfect, if artificial, reality that provides a powerful, if expensive, escape from the real world.</p>

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has stated that Prince Andrew needs to be fully investigated over allegations that he sexually abused her. In a BBC interview, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, said that despite the prince being stripped of titles and publicly shamed, it is not enough, and he should be held to the fullest extent of the law. Giuffre alleged Epstein introduced her to the prince, who she said abused her on three occasions when she was a minor. Prince Andrew has consistently denied the claims and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 without any admission of liability.</p>

          <p>In municipal elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of Chancellor Friedrich Merz is projected to finish first. However, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) saw a massive surge in support, tripling its share of the vote from 5.1% in 2020 to a projected 16.5%. The results are seen as a key test for the national government and indicate a continuing shift toward the right in German politics. In contrast, the Green Party suffered heavy losses, seeing their support drop significantly compared to the previous local election.</p>

          <h2>Banks and Credit Card Companies Grow Wary of "Buy Now, Pay Later" Services</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 12:04:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rapid growth of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is posing a significant challenge to traditional banks and credit card companies. These services, which allow consumers to split purchases into interest-free installments, are diverting transactions that would have previously gone onto credit cards, reducing key revenue streams for legacy financial institutions. A major concern for banks is that BNPL usage is often not reported to credit bureaus, creating a "giant black hole" in a consumer's credit profile. This lack of visibility makes it difficult for lenders to accurately assess a borrower's total debt load and overall financial risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's visit to Israel is being framed as an effort to conduct diplomatic damage control following a controversial Israeli missile strike in Doha, Qatar. The attack, which targeted Hamas leadership, has angered Qatar, a key U.S. ally that facilitates negotiations. While Rubio publicly stated President Trump was unhappy with the strike, he also sought to reaffirm the strength of the U.S.-Israel alliance. The visit comes as Israel faces mounting international pressure over its military operations in Gaza and the expansion of settlements, with several U.S. allies expected to recognize Palestinian statehood at the upcoming UN summit.</p>

Starmer affirmed the right to peaceful protest but condemned the violence and intimidation, emphasizing that the flag represents the nation's diversity and tolerance.
