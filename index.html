          <p>New York City beaches opened for the season with 280 certified lifeguards, an increase from last year but still short of the required 1,400. Parks Commissioner Sue Donoghue anticipates staffing will increase as students finish classes, with 374 new lifeguards in training and returning lifeguards expected. The city has increased hourly wages and offered signing bonuses to attract more lifeguards, and lifeguard stations have been upgraded. Beachgoers expressed relief at seeing lifeguards present, though some have grown accustomed to being more vigilant due to past shortages, and city officials are emphasizing the importance of water safety. The optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine exchanged hundreds of prisoners, with each side bringing home 307 soldiers, following a large-scale missile and drone attack on Kyiv. This swap is part of a larger deal to exchange 1,000 prisoners from each side and is seen as a moment of cooperation amidst the ongoing conflict. Kyiv faced heavy attacks, resulting in injuries and damage to residential buildings, with Ukrainian forces reportedly intercepting a significant number of missiles and drones. Despite the prisoner exchange, fighting continues along the front line, and diplomatic efforts to reach a ceasefire remain complex, with European leaders accusing Putin of stalling for battlefield gains.

          <p>Learners are struggling to afford driving lessons due to rising costs, while instructors argue the prices are justified by increasing expenses. Driving lesson prices have risen, with the most common price bracket being ¬£36 to ¬£40 per hour, and the practical test backlog means learners need more lessons to maintain skills. Some learners are taking lessons less frequently or drawing from savings to pay for them, and instructors cite rising costs for cars, fuel, and insurance as reasons for the price increases. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has acknowledged that waiting times for tests are too long and pledged to reduce the average waiting time for a driving test to no more than seven weeks by summer 2026.

          <p>The US is facing criticism for prioritizing white South African refugees while other refugees remain in limbo. President Trump signed an executive order opening the refugee pathway exclusively to Afrikaners, while thousands of other refugees await processing. Critics argue this is unfair and not based on credible evidence of persecution, and the situation has left many refugees feeling stuck and struggling to find work. Trump has justified his decision by claiming Afrikaners face "a genocide," a claim widely discredited. The optimism score is 35.</p>

          <p>Victims in the trial of France's most prolific known paedophile, Joel Le Scouarnec, are frustrated by the lack of public interest in the case. Le Scouarnec, a retired surgeon, has admitted to abusing nearly 300 people, mostly children, and victims are accusing the government of ignoring the landmark case. They have formed a campaign group to pressure authorities and question why a parliamentary commission has not been set up. Some victims are now revealing their identities to draw attention to the issue, condemning France's "systemic, organised silence" regarding child abuse. The optimism score is 15.</p>

          <p>Young US men are increasingly joining Russian Orthodox churches that promote a virile, unapologetic masculinity, with a priest named Father Moses McPherson championing a form of traditional manliness. Many converts feel modern society is harsh on men and are drawn to the church's conservative values, including prioritizing family over career for women. While the number of Christian Orthodox is small compared to evangelical megachurches, this trend reflects broader political shifts and the digital space plays a key role in attracting new converts. Some converts hold unconventional views, seeing the Russian Church as a rigid, disciplinary, and authoritarian religion. The optimism score is 55.</p>
