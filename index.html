          <p>Glastonbury Festival organizers have expressed they are "appalled" after the punk duo Bob Vylan led chants calling for "death to the IDF" during a performance. The festival and UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting condemned the comments, with the festival stating they "crossed a line" and have no place for hate speech or incitement to violence. The BBC, which broadcast the set live with a warning, announced the performance will not be available on its iPlayer service, and local police are reviewing footage to determine if any criminal offenses were committed.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Sam Tanenhaus's new biography, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," explores the early life and family background of the influential conservative figure. The text details the story of his parents, particularly his father's ventures in the oil industry in Mexico and Venezuela, which led to both financial ruin and immense wealth. This upbringing shaped the family's deep Catholic faith and resilient worldview, culminating in their settlement at a large estate in Sharon, Connecticut, where William F. Buckley Jr. was born into a sprawling and dynamic household.</p>

The cause of the early morning blast is under investigation by multiple agencies, including the fire department, police, and the ATF.

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus posits that William F. Buckley Jr., founder of the National Review, was the architect of the modern conservative movement in America. The article explores how his intellectualism and media presence on shows like "Firing Line" created a political path that led from Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump. While praised for his civility and intellect, Buckley's legacy is complicated by his early opposition to civil rights legislation. The analysis suggests that while their styles differ, Trump's anti-establishment politics echo the cultural critiques Buckley pioneered decades ago.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the United States is dangerously vulnerable to China's control over the global supply of rare earth elements, which are crucial for modern technology and defense. The author contends that China's recent export controls are a geopolitical flex, exposing years of U.S. inaction despite knowing the risks of this dependency. While a recent short-term trade framework offers a reprieve, it requires U.S. firms to share sensitive data, amounting to "competitive surveillance." The article calls for a coherent, long-term U.S. strategy to build a secure supply chain, treating critical minerals as instruments of geopolitical power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has made significant concessions on its flagship welfare reform bill to avert a major rebellion from over 120 of its own backbench MPs. The original plans, aimed at saving Â£5 billion, faced criticism for potentially harming disabled and vulnerable people by making it harder to claim Personal Independence Payment (Pip). Following the backlash, the government reversed course, limiting cuts to new claimants and agreeing to a review of the Pip assessment process. Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged the initial rollout was mishandled but stated the government is now in a "better position" to pass the necessary reforms.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in The Lancet Global Health reveals that a significant number of cancer drugs available in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, and Cameroon are defective. Researchers found that approximately 17% of the tested medications contained incorrect levels of active ingredients, which can lead to treatment failure and disease progression for patients. The issue stems from a combination of manufacturing faults, poor storage, and counterfeit products, compounded by a lack of regulatory infrastructure and testing capabilities in the region. The World Health Organization has expressed concern and is working with the affected countries to address the critical public health problem.</p>

The meeting was prompted by concerns that Lotus's Chinese owner, Geely, was considering moving production of its Emira sports car to the United States to avoid tariffs, a move that would have jeopardized 1,300 jobs. Lotus had paused production in May due to supply chain issues related to U.S. tariffs, but the company insists the UK remains the "heart of the Lotus brand."

He recommends avoiding swimming at dawn and dusk, as well as in "marine-rich environments" like river mouths where sharks naturally hunt for fish. Galante also suggests not wearing shiny jewelry, which can mimic the flash of bait fish, and notes that even the sound of a crunching can could attract a shark's attention. He emphasizes that sharks do not intentionally prey on humans and that a few minutes of research can substantially reduce the likelihood of a negative encounter.</p>

Health Secretary Wes Streeting framed the policy as a collaborative effort to help consumers, noting that a small daily reduction in calorie intake could significantly impact public health.

          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed a key procedural vote to advance President Donald Trump's major legislative package, which extends tax cuts from his first term and increases military and border spending. The bill, a top priority for the administration, cleared the hurdle after lengthy negotiations to win over a few Republican holdouts who were concerned about its impact on the national debt.

          <p>Approximately 12,000 Chinese immigrants in Taiwan are facing a deadline to provide proof that they have canceled their household registration in mainland China or risk losing their Taiwanese residency. The policy, part of a broader push by President Lai Ching-te's administration to counter Chinese influence, has caused distress and uncertainty for many who have lived in Taiwan for decades. Affected individuals, primarily spouses of Taiwanese citizens, must navigate Chinese bureaucracy to obtain the necessary documents, a process some find risky or impossible. While the government has offered an affidavit option for some, it has warned it will not hesitate to enforce the rule.</p>

          <p>This article by a psychologist suggests that many people may be unhappy in their relationships without realizing it, often due to normalizing unhealthy dynamics. To assess one's situation, the author proposes four questions: Do you feel like a team during conflict? Can you be your authentic self? Is your partner curious about your inner world? Do they take accountability for mistakes? Answering "no" to these questions may indicate underlying issues, such as a lack of emotional intimacy, security, and mutual respect. The article advises that healthy partnerships require shared strategies for conflict, room for authenticity, and a commitment to understanding one another.</p>

          <p>BeyoncÃ© is facing a backlash from Indigenous communities and fans after wearing a T-shirt during a Juneteenth performance that contained historically derogatory language. The shirt, honoring the Buffalo Soldiers, included a description on the back that listed "warring Indians" as "enemies of peace, order and settlement" alongside bandits and thieves. Critics argue that promoting this language perpetuates harmful narratives and ignores the role the U.S. army units played in the subjugation and genocide of Indigenous peoples during westward expansion.

          <p>Medical researchers and cancer patients are raising alarms over the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts and layoffs at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Scientists warn that a nearly 40% reduction in NCI funding is creating an "existential crisis" that jeopardizes progress and causes highly trained staff to leave. The article highlights the story of a patient whose participation in a promising clinical trial for an aggressive cancer was delayed due to staff layoffs. This delay proved devastating, as her cancer progressed, disqualifying her from the treatment, illustrating the direct human cost of the funding cuts.</p>

The election is seen as a public verdict on his minority government, which is grappling with inflation and economic uncertainty.

While statistics show they are having less partnered sex than previous generations, they are also the most progressive and diverse generation, with many rejecting traditional, heteronormative definitions of virginity and sex. The article posits that Gen Z's political consciousness, shaped by post-Roe realities and online activism, has led them to infuse sexuality with political meaning.
