          <p>Protests erupted in Makassar, Indonesia, following the death of a motorcycle taxi driver who was run over by a police vehicle. Demonstrators set fire to a local council building, resulting in the deaths of three people trapped inside and injuring at least four others. The incident has escalated tensions, with further protests occurring in the capital, Jakarta, outside the headquarters of the paramilitary police unit involved. President Prabowo Subianto has promised a thorough investigation into the driver's death and urged for calm amid the unrest, which presents a significant early challenge for his administration.</p>

          <p>Star pass rusher Micah Parsons has been traded from the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers, ending a contentious contract stalemate. The Packers secured Parsons with a four-year, $188 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. In exchange, Dallas received two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark. Parsons expressed excitement about joining the historic franchise, aiming to build a legacy similar to Packers legends like Reggie White. The move provides Green Bay with a much-needed elite pass rusher but poses future salary cap challenges.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Tactical Struggles for Manchester United Under Ruben Amorim</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 02:10:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United's recent loss to Grimsby Town has highlighted ongoing difficulties in implementing manager Ruben Amorim's tactical system. The article analyzes Amorim's rigid 5-2-3 positional play, which aims to create numerical overloads but struggles against man-to-man marking. The system relies heavily on specific passing patterns, such as the 'up-back-through,' which can be predictable and neutralized by opposing teams using a similar formation. Defensively, United's pressing triggers can be exploited, leaving them outnumbered in midfield. The analysis suggests Amorim may need to adapt his methods to suit the higher competition level of the Premier League.</p>

          <p>Despite being one of the world's most sanctioned nations, North Korea has significantly increased its importation of Chinese wine. In the first seven months of 2025, North Korea purchased over 157,000 liters of wine from China, more than double the volume from the previous year, making it the second-largest market for Chinese bottled wine by volume. This trend continues from previous years, as China does not restrict wine sales to its neighbor. While the United Nations has banned luxury goods from entering North Korea since 2006, alcohol is not included on the prohibited items list.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 01:59:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has asserted that Russia's frozen assets will not be returned until Moscow pays reparations for the war in Ukraine. Speaking before an EU foreign ministers' meeting, Kallas emphasized that any potential ceasefire or peace agreement would not alter this condition. The EU has frozen approximately €210 billion in Russian assets, and while Ukraine and some member states advocate for their confiscation to support Kyiv, major powers like France and Germany have raised legal concerns. The debate is now shifting towards how these funds could be utilized once the conflict ends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukraine has implemented new regulations allowing men under the age of 22 to leave the country, a change from the previous rule that barred men aged 18 to 60 from departing. The government's stated goal is to provide young Ukrainians with opportunities for education and work abroad, with the hope they will use their experience to aid in the nation's future development. This policy addresses concerns that the previous restrictions were causing a "lost generation" as young men feared returning home. However, some experts worry the move will exacerbate Ukraine's demographic challenges by encouraging more departures rather than returns.</p>

The team's offense struggled, managing only three hits and failing to capitalize on what was considered a favorable part of their schedule. Starting pitcher Blake Snell gave up three runs, including a two-run homer, while battling a noticeable drop in his fastball velocity. Diamondbacks' starter Zac Gallen, who has had a difficult season, pitched six scoreless innings to stifle the Dodgers' bats.

The judge's opinion criticized the government's argument that those who entered illegally are entitled to no process, stating it would put everyone at risk.

This "political arms race" has spread to other states like Missouri, as parties seek to gain an advantage in the U.S. House of Representatives ahead of the midterm elections.

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has terminated a Department of Justice paralegal, Elizabeth Baxter, for making a vulgar gesture and cursing at National Guard members in Washington, D.C. The incident occurred as Baxter was on her way to work, and she reportedly boasted about her actions to security guards. In a statement, Bondi affirmed that disrespect for law enforcement would not be tolerated within the department. The firing comes amid a heightened presence of National Guard troops and federal agents in the capital, a move initiated by the Trump administration to address crime.</p>
