          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing plummeting approval ratings despite securing significant trade deals with the U.S., India, and the European Union. Opinion polls indicate that a majority of the British public, including a substantial portion of Labour voters, hold an unfavorable view of Starmer. While business leaders express satisfaction with the government's economic direction, domestic concerns over cost-of-living pressures and tax increases overshadow these international achievements. Critics suggest that Starmer's leadership style lacks charisma, hindering his ability to connect with voters despite his competence in securing trade agreements.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay, a writer reflects on her obsession with zombie fiction, particularly the HBO series "The Last of Us," and how it serves as a distraction from real-world anxieties. She finds that immersing herself in a fictional apocalypse provides a temporary escape from the pressing issues of 2025. Drawing from a personal experience with grief, she explains how horror movies can offer a unique perspective and a sense of control. The author concludes that while terrifying, these alternate realities provide a necessary reprieve from the relentlessness of the real world.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that work-related stress in dog owners can transfer to their pets, leading to increased anxiety in dogs. Researchers found that dog owners who frequently ruminate about work problems after hours have dogs that exhibit more stress-related behaviors. This connection is attributed to emotional contagion and changes in care routines. The study emphasizes the importance of separating work from home life to protect the well-being of pets.</p>
