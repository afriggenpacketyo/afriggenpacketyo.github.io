          <p>Target's CEO, Brian Cornell, cautioned about the potential for significant cost increases due to tariffs, indicating that raising prices would be a last resort. The company reported a sales decline in its recent quarter, attributing it to consumer anxieties about tariffs and a boycott related to adjustments in their diversity, equity, and inclusion policy. Cornell expressed concerns about declining consumer confidence and uncertainty regarding the impact of tariffs on consumers. While a recent U.S.-China trade agreement eased some tariffs, others remain in place, and Target anticipates continued top-line pressures in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite pledges to halt funding for fossil fuels, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas projects, particularly liquefied natural gas (LNG) development. Japanese investments in overseas LNG projects totaled $56 billion between 2013 and 2024, far exceeding investments in clean energy. Japan benefits from LNG access and resales, shifting from consumer to exporter. While promoting the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) for net-zero emissions, many projects focus on natural gas and carbon capture storage, which critics view as greenwashing due to LNG's high emissions. The article highlights Indonesia as an example, where Japan helped shape the country's energy plan to create gas demand, potentially hindering renewable energy transition.</p>

          <p>South Africa's government aims to "reset" relations with the U.S. during President Ramaphosa's working visit, addressing unfounded allegations made by the Trump administration. These allegations include claims of a "genocide" against white farmers and land theft due to a new expropriation law. Afrikaner lobby groups have actively engaged with Trump, advocating for action against the South African government. Despite concerns, agricultural experts assert that farm murders are a serious issue but do not equate to genocide, urging the South African government to acknowledge the problem and collaborate on preventative measures.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's amended Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) is under scrutiny for allegedly silencing critical voices, particularly journalists, through strict regulations on online content. The law criminalizes the dissemination of false information that could incite fear or unrest, leading to arrests and charges against journalists reporting on sensitive issues like the military's role in the country. Critics argue the government did not consult press freedom groups before enacting the law, which they see as a tool to control the state narrative and suppress dissent.

          <p>Three days after Israel declared it would ease its blockade of humanitarian aid to Gaza, desperately needed food, fuel, and medicine appeared not to have reached Palestinians. Dozens of trucks with supplies crossed into Gaza at the Israeli-controlled border crossing of Kerem Shalom, but the United Nations has so far been unable to move any trucks from Kerem Shalom to warehouses inside Gaza, according to two U.N. officials. The delays suggest that distributing aid across Gaza was likely to take time, even as Israel threatens a major ground offensive that could upend the process.

While some states mandate school-day bans, others require districts to set their own policies, and there are exceptions for medical needs and special education plans.

          <p>Israel declared this week that it was expanding its ground offensive in Gaza, vowing to seize large areas of the enclave in an effort to force the surrender of Hamas after more than 19 months of war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said Israeli troops could effectively take control of all of Gaza as part of the offensive, which could take place gradually and in stages. The threat came during a new and intense round of cease-fire negotiations and as the Trump administration presses both sides to agree to a truce. Britain, France, and Canada issued a rare public reprimand of Israel this week, demanding that it cease its widening military offensive in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has indicated that a "fundamental regime change" may be occurring in financial markets as investors reassess the riskiness of U.S. assets due to trade tariffs.

Speaking before the Security Council, he advocated for the appointment of a Special Representative for Hostage Affairs to pressure groups like Hamas and ensure families are not forgotten.

          <p>The case of a brain-dead woman in Georgia, kept on life support to maintain her pregnancy, has ignited a debate over the state's abortion law and fetal personhood. Doctors at Emory University Hospital cited Georgia's law banning most abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected as the reason for maintaining her organs. The state's Attorney General stated that removing life support is not an action to terminate a pregnancy, but the hospital has not addressed this legal opinion. The situation has raised questions about medical ethics and the interpretation of fetal personhood laws in the post-Roe era, with concerns about the potential for unintended consequences.</p>
