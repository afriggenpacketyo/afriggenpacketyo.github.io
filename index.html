          <p>An operational issue at an Amazon Web Services (AWS) data center in its US-EAST-1 region caused a significant outage, affecting a wide range of popular websites, apps, and online services. Companies including Disney+, Reddit, United Airlines, and Coinbase reported major disruptions, highlighting the global economy's deep reliance on centralized cloud infrastructure. AWS confirmed it was working on multiple paths to recovery and later reported seeing "significant signs" of service restoration after several hours of downtime. This incident underscores the fragility of digital systems, echoing a similar large-scale disruption in July 2024 caused by a cybersecurity firm's faulty update.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to users who believe they are communicating with a sentient AI presence within chatbots like ChatGPT, most experts assert that this is extremely unlikely. They explain that large language models (LLMs) are sophisticated pattern-matching systems trained on vast amounts of text, including science fiction, which leads them to mimic conscious behavior to keep users engaged. The article suggests viewing LLMs as actors playing a role, whose perceived memory and personality are often the result of software updates or the model responding to user cues. While the possibility of a profoundly alien form of AI consciousness isn't dismissed, users are advised to remain grounded and not take dramatic actions based on these interactions.</p>

          <p>England defeated New Zealand by 65 runs in their second T20 international match, taking a 1-0 lead in the series. Phil Salt and captain Harry Brook led the charge with a powerful batting partnership, contributing 85 and 78 runs respectively, to help England post a formidable total of 236-4. This score marked the highest ever in a T20 international at Christchurch's Hagley Oval. New Zealand's chase faltered despite a solid start, as they were bowled out for 171, with England's Adil Rashid taking four wickets. The decisive victory puts England in a strong position ahead of the final match of the series in Auckland.</p>

          <p>Members of Congress have expressed outrage over reports that U.S. military veterans have been arrested or injured by federal agents while protesting Donald Trump's policies. The incidents, including some outside an ICE facility in Chicago, involved decorated veterans being physically handled, detained, and in one case held in solitary confinement. Lawmakers like Senator Tammy Duckworth and Representative Jason Crow, both combat veterans, condemned the use of excessive force against individuals exercising their right to protest. The Department of Homeland Security has defended the agents' actions, but critics, including federal judges, have questioned the credibility of the administration's justifications for such force.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in the ancient Lycian city of Olympus, Turkey, have discovered a large and elaborate bathhouse attached to a bishop's private residence, dating back to the 5th or 6th century A.D. The 2,150-square-foot complex is a rare find, as private baths from this period were typically much smaller. Researchers explain that Byzantine bishops of that era often served as civic officials, managing city wealth and providing public services. The bathhouse, which had entrances to both the residence and the street, was likely opened to the public on certain days for free use, reflecting the bishop's dual role as a spiritual and community leader.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Marine Corps live-fire demonstration at Camp Pendleton resulted in a dangerous incident when an artillery round detonated prematurely over Interstate 5, showering an unoccupied California Highway Patrol cruiser with shrapnel. The event, intended to celebrate the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary, had already created controversy over the decision to fire live munitions over the active freeway, leading to a temporary closure. The unexpected mid-air explosion forced an immediate halt to the demonstration after only one of the planned 60 rounds was fired. The incident has intensified scrutiny over the safety protocols and judgment used in planning the high-profile military exercise.</p>

The heist, which took place while tourists were in the museum, was described by officials as a highly professional and non-violent operation completed in just four minutes.

The criminals used a vehicle-mounted lift to reach a balcony, cut through a window, and smash display cases in the Galerie d'Apollon while the museum was open to the public. The entire operation was swift, with the thieves escaping on scooters. The stolen items include historic tiaras, necklaces, and brooches belonging to former French royalty, adorned with thousands of diamonds and precious gems.

The book, titled "Nobody's Girl," reiterates her allegation of having sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions, including once in what she described as an orgy with Epstein and other young women. The memoir provides a grim account of the systematic abuse orchestrated by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. In response to the renewed scrutiny from the book's publication, Prince Andrew has voluntarily decided to stop using his royal titles, though he continues to deny all accusations.</p>

The investigation found that 55% of listed mental health professionals in Medicare Advantage plans and 28% in Medicaid plans were not providing care to members.

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to introduce new vocational qualifications called V-levels for students aged 16 and over, aiming to replace Level 3 BTECs and simplify the post-secondary education landscape. The move is part of a broader effort to elevate vocational training and provide clearer pathways to employment alongside traditional A-levels and newer T-levels. Additionally, a new "stepping stone" qualification will be created to reduce the number of students repeatedly resitting GCSEs in maths and English. Critics have raised concerns that the new V-levels may not adequately fill the gap left by the widely recognized BTEC qualifications.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay showcased his strategic adaptability by shifting his team's offensive scheme to secure a 35-7 victory against the Jacksonville Jaguars. With star receiver Puka Nacua sidelined by injury, McVay abandoned his usual three-receiver formations in favor of a heavy set using three tight ends, a personnel grouping the Rams had barely used all season. The tactical switch proved highly effective, as quarterback Matthew Stafford threw five touchdowns on fewer than 200 passing yards. The performance highlights McVay's ability to tailor his game plan to his available personnel, keeping the Rams' offense potent and unpredictable.</p>

          <p>A relative of author Harper Lee suggests that major unpublished manuscripts, including a potential prequel to "To Kill a Mockingbird," could still be discovered among her papers. Lee's nephew, Dr. Edwin Conner, spoke of a 111-page manuscript titled "The Long Goodbye," which was written before her iconic novel, but its fate remains unknown. Additionally, mystery surrounds a true crime novel called "The Reverend," which Lee researched in the 1970s; while some claim to have seen a finished version, its existence and location are unconfirmed. These revelations emerge as a collection of Lee's previously unseen early short stories is set to be published, offering new insights into her development as a writer.</p>

          <p>In its ongoing trade conflict with the United States, China has begun to adopt tactics from the U.S. playbook, particularly the use of "long-arm jurisdiction." Beijing recently expanded its export rules on rare earths, requiring foreign firms to get Chinese government approval to export products containing China-originated materials, mirroring the U.S. foreign direct product rule. This is part of a broader strategy developed since 2018, which includes creating an "Unreliable Entity List" and an anti-foreign sanction law, both analogous to U.S. policies. Analysts note that Beijing is learning from Washington's methods to build a toolkit for economic retaliation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A collection of newly discovered short stories by Harper Lee, written before "To Kill a Mockingbird," is being published, providing insight into the development of her iconic characters and themes. Found in one of her New York apartments after her death, these "apprentice stories" feature early versions of characters like Jean Louise Finch (Scout) and are set in the fictional town of Maycomb. Lee's relatives believe she would be delighted by their publication, as she had initially sought to have them published in the 1950s. The collection reveals the early genius of the celebrated author and explores her evolving perspective on the racial dynamics of the American South.</p>

          <p>While many EU economies face stagnation, Poland has maintained robust and consistent growth, establishing itself as one of the bloc's most dynamic members. With a GDP growth rate of nearly 3% in 2024, significantly outpacing the EU average and larger economies like Germany and France, Poland's success is attributed to strong domestic consumption, low unemployment, and effective use of EU integration funds. The country's large domestic market has helped shelter it from external shocks. Analysts consider Poland a model of successful EU integration, having doubled its real GDP since joining in 2004, though it now faces fiscal challenges from increased welfare and defense spending.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the United States could severely damage the British film industry, which is heavily dependent on American investment. In 2023, 65% of the UK's total film production spending came from U.S. studios and streaming platforms. Industry leaders and politicians warn that such a tariff would jeopardize thousands of jobs and billions in economic contributions, crippling the UK's ability to produce its own films. While some believe the complexity of modern international co-productions makes the tariff impractical, the threat alone creates significant uncertainty for one of Britain's key creative sectors.

          <p>Satellite imagery reveals the recent construction of a nearly 2,000-meter airstrip on Zuqar Island, a strategic volcanic island in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen. While no group has claimed responsibility, the project is likely linked to forces opposing the Houthi rebels, potentially with support from the United Arab Emirates, which has funded similar projects in the region. The airstrip could enhance aerial surveillance over critical shipping lanes where Houthis have been attacking vessels. Analysts suggest the base may be intended to help interdict weapons smuggling to the Houthis, whose supply lines are facing increasing pressure from anti-Houthi forces.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Secretary has launched an independent inquiry into systemic failures at the maternity units of Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, following reports of potentially avoidable deaths of at least 56 babies and two mothers over five years. The investigation was prompted by a BBC report and pressure from bereaved families who described traumatic care and a "blame culture" at the trust. The Care Quality Commission had previously downgraded the trust's maternity services to "inadequate," citing risks of avoidable harm. The inquiry aims to uncover the root causes of what the Health Secretary described as "catastrophically wrong" practices at the hospitals.</p>
