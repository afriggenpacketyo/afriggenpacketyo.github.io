          <p>Gold prices are surging as investors seek safe havens amid ongoing trade tensions, particularly those stemming from U.S. trade policies. The traditional inverse relationship between Treasury yields and gold has broken down, with gold's inflation-hedging quality making it particularly attractive. Analysts suggest a waning trust in U.S. assets due to economic and geopolitical uncertainties is also contributing to gold's appeal, as it carries no credit risk and is not tied to the trajectory of a single nation. J.P. Morgan expects the yellow metal to average $3,675 per ounce by the fourth quarter of 2025, and reach $4,000 by the second quarter of 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ofcom has announced new regulations requiring tech firms to implement age verification checks and adjust algorithm recommendations to protect children from harmful online content. Social media platforms and websites will face potential fines for failing to protect children from accessing inappropriate material, such as pornography or content promoting self-harm. The regulations also mandate streamlined reporting systems, faster action on harmful content, and the appointment of a designated individual accountable for children's safety. While some critics argue the measures don't go far enough, others view them as a positive step toward ensuring a safer online environment for children.</p>

          <p>China has updated its market access negative list, reducing the number of sectors with restrictions on private firms, signaling a further liberalization of the business environment. The latest list features 106 restricted areas, down from 117 in the previous version issued in 2022, and eliminates several national-level restrictions, streamlining entry procedures for television production, pharmaceutical sales, and other sectors. The updated list also strengthens regulatory oversight in emerging fields like auto-driving aircraft operation and the sale of novel tobacco products.

          <p>European officials are expressing optimism about reaching a trade deal with the U.S., but warn that imposing tariffs would significantly harm both economies. Negotiations between the EU and the U.S. are ongoing to avoid U.S. tariffs on EU goods and EU countermeasures, with the EU insisting that trade in goods and services is reasonably balanced. The IMF has warned that President Trump's announced trade tariffs pose major headwinds for the U.S. and global economy in 2025, forecasting reduced growth for both the U.S. and the Eurozone.</p>

          <p>A wildlife trafficking ring involving queen ants has been uncovered in Kenya, with seizures valued at up to $1 million if sold in Europe. Two Belgian teenagers, along with a Vietnamese man and a Kenyan national, were arrested for attempting to smuggle queen ants, which are highly valued by ant enthusiasts for maintaining colonies in formicariums. Experts warn that trafficking can jeopardize colonies critical to Kenya's wildlife ecosystem, with the case signaling a shift in biopiracy trends from large mammals to lesser-known species. The Kenya Wildlife Service considers this case to represent far more than insect smuggling.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating trade tensions and tariff implementations by the Trump administration, concerns about a potential US recession are rising. Various economic indicators, including an inverted yield curve, declining consumer confidence, and pessimistic business forecasts, suggest a heightened risk of economic downturn. Prediction markets are placing increased odds on a recession in the coming year, while nowcasts indicate a potential slowdown in GDP growth. However, official confirmation of a recession typically comes months after it has begun, making it challenging to navigate the uncertain economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing scrutiny for his handling of a military campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen. The operation, aimed at stopping Houthi attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea, has involved significant military spending and has not yet restored regular traffic through the sea lane. The U.S. military is amassing firepower in the region, and Hegseth shared sensitive details about the mission in a second unsecured conversation on Signal. The campaign has also resulted in civilian casualties and the loss of U.S. military assets.</p>
