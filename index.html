          <p>Jerry Ye, CEO of Whale, an AI startup backed by Temasek, discusses the impact of U.S.-China tensions on global AI opportunities, emphasizing that business remains business and their customer base is global. He notes that while the U.S. and China are the largest markets, AI applications will differ, with China focusing on marketing and sales and the U.S. on niche sectors. Ye highlights that China does not face a shortage in AI computing power, as on-device chips become increasingly capable, and that AI's immediate financial impact for businesses will be in marketing and sales due to easily calculable ROI. He also addresses challenges such as complying with local data privacy needs and the importance of real-life videos over generative AI for conveying emotions. </p>

          <p>China has introduced an ambitious plan to upgrade its information technology (IT) manufacturing sector, aiming for self-sufficiency in critical technologies like semiconductors and AI, while circumventing U.S. tech restrictions. The 18-point plan emphasizes AI integration and the cultivation of industry service providers by 2027, targeting over 85% computer numerical control usage in key manufacturing processes. By 2030, China intends to establish a core industrial database to facilitate breakthroughs and advance to the high end of the global value chain. This initiative, led by multiple ministries, arrives as the "Made in China 2025" initiative nears completion, underscoring IT manufacturing's role as the backbone of China's industrial system.</p>

Other Japanese players, including Seiya Suzuki and Tomoyuki Sugano, also contributed to their respective teams, with Suzuki reaching his 50th RBI of the season.

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law mandating 300 to 400 major companies to participate in a carbon emissions trading system, set to begin in fiscal year 2026. The revised law targets firms producing 100,000 tons of CO2 or more annually, encompassing industries like steel and car manufacturing, which collectively account for approximately 60% of Japan's domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Under the system, companies receive a maximum emissions allowance and must purchase carbon credits for emissions exceeding this limit from companies with a surplus, creating an incentive for emissions reduction. While designed to lower emissions, the system may lead to increased consumer prices as companies pass on decarbonization costs.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration aims to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly considering military action against Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities. This tension has led to discussions between President Trump and Netanyahu, with Israel expressing concerns that the U.S. might allow Iran to maintain uranium enrichment capabilities in a deal. Israel, not involved in the U.S.-Iran negotiations, believes Iran's vulnerability presents an opportunity for attack, while Trump favors negotiation backed by military threat. Israeli officials have signaled they are preparing for a strike, even without U.S. assistance, although the effectiveness of such an operation remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read trial, a crash expert testified that data from Read's Lexus SUV placed her at the scene of John O'Keefe's death during his final movements. The expert, Dr. Judson Welcher, matched data from Read's vehicle to O'Keefe's cellphone activity, indicating a rapid acceleration and reversing of Read's SUV near O'Keefe's location. Welcher's testimony also addressed the lack of collision data in the black box, explaining that it typically only registers car-to-car impacts. Additionally, Welcher presented findings from his own experiment, suggesting that scratches on O'Keefe's arm were consistent with contact from Read's vehicle's taillight, further supporting the prosecution's timeline.</p>

          <p>A British think tank, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), warns that a People's Liberation Army (PLA) attack on Taiwan is "unlikely in the near future" but "not impossible," particularly given the risks of misperception and miscommunication with the U.S. under President Donald Trump. The IISS report highlights strained US-China relations, characterized by deep distrust and a lack of dialogue mechanisms, setting the tone for potential conflict. While the Biden administration saw some tactical improvements, the report cautions that these are unlikely to significantly alter the strategic direction of the two great powers during Trump's second term.</p>

While Circle has not provided a specific reason for this decision, it may be due to venture capital firms seeking liquidity after a period of meager returns.

          <p>PDD Holdings, the Chinese owner of online shopping platform Temu, reported a near 50% drop in profit, attributed to U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies and challenges in the Chinese market. Shares of the e-commerce giant fell sharply after the announcement, reflecting the impact of the Trump administration ending the "de minimis" exemption, which previously allowed parcels under $800 to enter the U.S. without import duties. Additionally, PDD has been engaged in a price war with competitors like Alibaba and JD.com amidst weak consumer spending in China.</p>

Police have a person of interest in custody and believe the shooting was not a random act of violence. The gunman, armed with a semi-automatic pistol, prompted shoppers to seek cover inside stores. Connecticut's Governor Ned Lamont called the incident a tragic mass shooting and expressed gratitude to law enforcement for their swift response, while the investigation remains ongoing with local, FBI, and ATF involvement.</p>
