          <p>Three young sisters, aged nine, eleven, and seventeen, tragically drowned in an overcrowded rubber boat in the central Mediterranean, according to German rescue charity RESQSHIP. The vessel, which departed from Libya, was repeatedly swamped by waves, leading to the sisters' deaths amidst the chaos. Rescuers saved approximately 65 people, including the girls' mother and brother, many of whom suffered severe chemical burns. This incident underscores the extreme dangers faced by migrants seeking safety, with over 700 people having died this year on this treacherous route, highlighting an urgent humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>On Ukraine's Independence Day, President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed continued resistance, asserting Ukraine is a "fighter" seeking a just peace determined by its people. He dismissed Russian claims of drone attacks on energy facilities as propaganda. The day also featured a prisoner swap involving 146 soldiers and a kidnapped journalist. International support was strong, with Canada pledging a $2 billion military aid package and Norway offering air defense systems. Sweden also committed to joint defense production, reinforcing global solidarity with Ukraine's sovereignty and its ongoing struggle against the invasion.</p>

          <p>Former CIA Director Gen. David Petraeus expressed skepticism about a peace meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, identifying Putin as the primary "obstacle to peace" unless he gains additional territory. Petraeus urged the U.S. to significantly increase aid to Ukraine, lift weapon restrictions, seize $300 billion in frozen Russian reserves, and impose more sanctions, including on Gazprom bank. He believes these actions are crucial to alter the conflict's dynamics and accelerate an end to the three-and-a-half-year war, emphasizing that current efforts have not swayed Putin's intentions for continued conflict.</p>

          <p>Tiny homes expert Levi Kelly constructed a remarkably small, livable house, measuring just 19.4 by 4 feet, in his Ohio yard for approximately $5,000. Utilizing an old utility trailer and existing materials, the month-long build resulted in a functional space, despite its compact size. The house includes an AC/heating unit, a tilting bed, a portable toilet, an outdoor shower, and a mini-kitchen, all powered by solar panels. Kelly, who has successfully tested the structure in a snowstorm, demonstrates that creative design can yield practical living solutions with minimal square footage, challenging conventional notions of home size.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts and law enforcement are alarmed by a terrifying rise in "nihilistic violence," acts lacking clear ideological motives and driven by a desire for destruction. Psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert describes this as violence born of emptiness, a perverse attempt to transform inner despair into outward impact. The Global Terrorism Index indicates a significant increase in such ideologically confused acts, complicating counterterrorism efforts. A recent New York City office shooting, which left four dead, is cited as an example, highlighting the challenges of preventing seemingly random attacks that erode the public's sense of safety and predictability.</p>

While the grand prize remains unclaimed, tickets sold in Maine, Massachusetts, and South Dakota won $1 million or $2 million by matching five white balls.

          <p>Israel is intensifying aerial and tank assaults on Gaza City, preparing for a planned offensive that increases pressure on nearly a million Palestinian residents. Reports indicate uninterrupted explosions in northern and eastern parts of the city, with troops returning to the Jabaliya refugee camp. The Hamas-run health ministry reports 64 killed and nearly 300 injured in the past 24 hours, bringing total fatalities to 62,686. With 60,000 reservists called up, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to defeat Hamas, defying international criticism and escalating concerns about a "horrific humanitarian impact" from the impending ground operation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retirees may face a challenging 2026 Social Security Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA), as recent economic data indicates rising inflation, potentially leading to a COLA that fails to keep pace with increased costs. The COLA, determined by third-quarter inflation, is now predicted by the Senior Citizens League to be 2.7%, up from an earlier 2.1% forecast. Historically, COLAs often lag inflation, causing a compounding loss of purchasing power for retirees, with average benefits in 2024 worth only 80 cents on the dollar compared to 2010. This trend suggests continued financial strain for many retirees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government plans a significant overhaul of its asylum appeals system to reduce reliance on hotels for migrants awaiting decisions. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced a new body with independent adjudicators to expedite appeals, which currently average over a year with 51,000 pending cases. This initiative responds to growing pressure and protests over the policy, with ministers committed to ending hotel use. However, the Refugee Council argues that reducing appeals primarily requires accurate initial decisions, as about half of original rulings are overturned due to flaws, highlighting ongoing challenges in the system.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has abandoned his conciliatory approach to Donald Trump, adopting an aggressive, "no-holds-barred" fighting strategy against federal actions targeting California. Newsom's counter-offensive includes a redistricting proposal to boost Democratic House seats, social media trolling mimicking Trump's style, and multiple lawsuits. This shift reflects Newsom's belief that the moment demands a more forceful political brawler. While this approach has energized Democrats and boosted his approval, it also raises questions about compromising traditional Democratic principles, such as independent redistricting, in an all-out political war, highlighting a new era of state-federal confrontation.</p>

The "performative male" joins other suspicious archetypes, reflecting a broader societal distrust in dating.

          <p>A Vanguard analysis reveals that while 86% of workplace retirement plans offered Roth 401(k) contributions in 2024, only 18% of eligible investors participated. This low adoption is partly due to plans defaulting to pre-tax contributions, requiring active choice. Roth contributions, made with after-tax dollars, allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, and unlike pre-tax funds, the original account owner is not subject to required minimum distributions (RMDs). Understanding these tax advantages is crucial for long-term financial planning, especially for younger or higher-income investors, to maximize retirement savings potential.
