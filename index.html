          <p>HSBC announced a $3 billion share buyback despite reporting a 29% plunge in second-quarter profit, which fell short of analyst expectations. The bank attributed the decline primarily to impairment charges and increased operating expenses related to technology investment and restructuring. The CEO flagged significant structural challenges to the global economy, including trade disruptions and fiscal vulnerabilities, which are creating greater uncertainty for the market. The bank warned that lending demand would likely remain subdued for the rest of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has agreed to a $6 million settlement with Jewish students and a professor who sued the university over pro-Palestinian protests in 2024. The lawsuit argued their civil rights were violated when protesters blocked their access to campus facilities, including classes. This settlement follows a Department of Justice finding that UCLA acted with "deliberate indifference" in creating a hostile environment. As part of the agreement, the university will ensure equal campus access for all students and faculty.</p>

          <p>A new documentary suggests that missing pages from a manuscript written by Moors murderer Ian Brady could reveal where his final victim, 12-year-old Keith Bennett, was buried. The incomplete autobiography, titled "Black Light," was found in the archive of Brady's late biographer and contains detailed descriptions of other burial sites. Bennett's brother is calling for any missing material to be given to the police, as it may hold vital information in the nearly 60-year search for his remains.</p>

          <p>While returning from a trip, President Donald Trump commented on his connection to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Epstein had "stole" young female staffers from his Mar-a-Lago club. When asked by a reporter, Trump confirmed that one of the workers he was referring to was Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's most prominent accusers, whom he believed worked at the spa. The comments come amid ongoing scrutiny of the administration's handling of records related to the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>A gunman opened fire at the Grand Sierra Resort casino in Reno, Nevada, killing three people and injuring three others before being shot and critically wounded by police. Authorities said the suspect, 26-year-old Dakota Hawver, fired approximately 80 rounds from a handgun in the valet and parking lot areas. The attack appears to be random, as there is no known connection between the shooter and the victims, one of whom was a casino security guard who confronted him.</p>

          <p>In India's remote Ladakh region, the ancient way of life for yak herders is under threat due to the impacts of climate change. Generations of herders have relied on a stable environment, but rising temperatures and unpredictable precipitation are diminishing the high-altitude pastures their animals depend on. This environmental pressure, combined with younger generations seeking opportunities in other industries, is leading to a decline in the yak population and the potential collapse of a unique culture and ecosystem.</p>

Critics, however, have condemned the action as a result of irresponsible and unsustainable breeding policies, arguing that healthy animals should not be killed to manage zoo populations.</p>
