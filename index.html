            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) criticized El Salvador President Nayib Bukele and former President Donald Trump, accusing them of staging a setup dubbed "margarita-gate" to defame him and Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a US citizen wrongfully deported to El Salvador. Van Hollen claimed that Salvadoran officials placed filled margarita glasses on the table during his meeting with Abrego Garcia, insinuating they were consumed, which he denies. He asserts this was a diversion from the US government's failure to comply with a Supreme Court order to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. The senator emphasized the importance of protecting the constitutional rights of all US residents.</p>

The character's creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, imbued Superman with values that resonate across different faiths and cultures. Despite not being overtly religious, Superman's narrative provides a portal to the sacred, embodying themes of self-sacrifice and doing good without seeking recognition. His appeal lies in his ability to transcend religious boundaries, offering a sense of belonging to something larger than oneself.</p>

            <p>Ocado issued an apology to Mumsnet for citing "hateful political views" when withdrawing from a commercial partnership due to Mumsnet's stance on the definition of sex in the Equality Act. Mumsnet founder Justine Roberts reported that several companies had pulled their advertising over discussions on gender issues. Ocado stated that the comments were made by a temporary contractor who has since left the company and emphasized that they are not representative of Ocado's views. The apology followed a Supreme Court ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex under the Equality Act.</p>
