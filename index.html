          <p>The UK Prime Minister has condemned as "the wrong decision" a move to prohibit Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters from attending a Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham. The ban was recommended by a city safety group and supported by West Midlands Police, who cited the fixture as "high-risk" based on intelligence and previous incidents of violence. This decision has sparked a political debate about antisemitism and public safety, with critics arguing it sends a shameful message about the safety of Jewish people in Britain. The controversy highlights the complex intersection of sports, politics, and security concerns amid wider geopolitical tensions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three major U.S. labor unions have initiated a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that monitoring the social media of visa holders violates their First Amendment rights. The complaint argues that the government program, which uses AI to search for specific viewpoints, unlawfully targets individuals critical of U.S. and Israeli government policies. This legal action follows the recent revocation of several visas based on social media comments, creating what the unions describe as a chilling effect on free expression. The lawsuit contends that this surveillance has harmed the unions' ability to organize and advocate for their members, who now fear immigration-related repercussions for their online activities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. semiconductor firm Micron Technology is set to discontinue the supply of server memory chips to data centers located in China. This decision follows a 2023 Chinese government ban on Micron's products in critical infrastructure, from which the company's business has not recovered. The move is seen as a consequence of the ongoing U.S.-China tech rivalry, where Beijing has also targeted other American chipmakers like Nvidia and Intel over security concerns. Micron will reportedly continue its sales to China's automotive and smartphone sectors, as well as to Chinese companies with significant data center operations outside the mainland.</p>

          <p>The head of Greene King, a major UK pub and brewing company, has identified cafes and food delivery apps as significant new competitors for consumer leisure time and spending. CEO Nick Mackenzie stated that as a growing portion of the population, particularly younger people, reduces alcohol consumption, pubs must adapt to stay relevant. The industry is shifting towards offering better food, credible coffee options, and creating more comfortable environments to attract a wider clientele. This evolution reflects a broader trend in hospitality where traditional pubs are evolving to compete with the convenience of delivery services and the social appeal of coffee shops.</p>

          <p>Indonesia is actively working to establish a direct export channel for its fresh durians to China, aiming to significantly increase profits by bypassing intermediary countries like Malaysia and Thailand. Currently, these neighboring nations assist with the necessary phytosanitary approvals and cold-chain storage required by Chinese authorities. By developing its own certification processes and improving logistics, Indonesia hopes to capture a larger share of the massive Chinese durian market, which consumes over 90% of the world's supply. This strategic move is intended to enhance the economic returns for Indonesian growers and strengthen the country's position in the global agricultural trade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study published in the journal Nature reveals that Shanghai is confronting the severe dual challenges of land subsidence and rapidly rising sea levels. The research indicates that the majority of urban sinking is caused by human activities, with some localized subsidence rates far exceeding the global average sea-level rise. As a major city built on soft sediment in a delta region, Shanghai is naturally susceptible to sinking, a vulnerability now dangerously compounded by climate change. This combination of factors poses a significant and escalating threat to the coastal metropolis and its infrastructure.</p>

          <p>South Korea's primary stock index, the KOSPI, achieved a new record high for the third day in a row, driven by optimism surrounding ongoing trade negotiations with the United States.

The downturn in the broader region was influenced by concerns over the U.S. banking sector and renewed trade tensions. The resilience of the South Korean market highlights investor confidence in the country's specific economic outlook despite wider regional instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An immigration barrister in the UK is facing a potential disciplinary investigation after a judge determined he used an AI tool like ChatGPT for legal research, which resulted in citing non-existent cases.

The judge concluded that the barrister likely used generative AI to formulate his arguments and then attempted to conceal this fact during the hearing.

After the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's coalition partner withdrew support, Takaichi has been forced to seek alliances with other parties, notably the right-leaning Japan Innovation Party. While this new alignment might support her goals of fiscal stimulus, the lack of a strong consensus risks stalling crucial legislation needed to address Japan's deep-seated issues like labor shortages and an aging population.

          <p>In their sole debate, Virginia's incumbent Republican Attorney General, Jason Miyares, and his Democratic challenger, Jay Jones, clashed over violent text messages sent by Jones. Miyares heavily criticized Jones for the texts, which included a message saying a former Republican House Speaker should get "two bullets to the head," arguing it disqualifies him from office. Jones apologized for his words, calling them shameful and embarrassing, but also deflected by pointing to extreme rhetoric used by former President Trump, whom Miyares supports. The contentious issue has become a central focus of the competitive statewide race.</p>

          <p>China has introduced sweeping new restrictions on its rare earth exports, a move that tightens its control over the global supply of these critical minerals and escalates trade tensions with the United States. The new rules require foreign companies to obtain government approval for exporting products containing rare earths, which are vital for manufacturing everything from smartphones to advanced military hardware. This action is seen as a strategic power play by Beijing, reminding Washington of its significant leverage in the ongoing trade dispute. In response, U.S. officials have threatened further tariffs and condemned the move as a threat to global supply chains.</p>

This long-acting shot, cabotegravir, offers an alternative to daily oral pills, known as PrEP, and is expected to help the UK meet its goal of ending new HIV cases by 2030. The treatment is considered a game-changer for individuals at high risk for whom taking daily medication is difficult or impractical. Experts hope the new option will improve access and adherence to HIV prevention therapy, particularly among vulnerable populations.</p>
