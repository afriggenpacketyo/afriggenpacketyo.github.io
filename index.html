          <p>A small plane carrying skydivers crashed shortly after takeoff at Cross Keys Airport in New Jersey, resulting in injuries to all 15 people on board. While some injuries were reported as severe, officials expressed amazement that there were no fatalities, attributing the effective emergency response to recent mass casualty training at the same airport. The pilot had reported engine trouble and was attempting to return to the airport when the crash occurred. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, noting the same aircraft was involved in a previous landing incident in 2023.</p>

          <p>After hours of delay caused by internal Republican disagreements, the House of Representatives passed a key procedural vote to advance President Trump's major tax and spending bill. The legislation, which extends tax cuts and increases spending on defense and border security, faced pushback from both moderate and conservative Republicans over changes made by the Senate. President Trump was reportedly directly involved in pressuring holdouts to secure the 219-213 vote. The bill now moves to a final debate and vote on the House floor, with GOP leaders aiming for passage before the July 4th holiday.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger has pleaded guilty to the 2022 stabbing murders of four University of Idaho students, avoiding a potential death penalty. During the hearing, the lead prosecutor detailed how investigators used cell phone tracking, surveillance video, and crucial DNA evidence from a knife sheath left at the scene to identify Kohberger. A key piece of evidence was a Q-tip retrieved from his parents' trash that linked his father's DNA to the crime scene. While the plea deal brings legal closure, the victims' families are divided on the outcome, and questions about Kohberger's motive remain unanswered.</p>

However, he was acquitted of the more severe charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which could have resulted in a life sentence. The trial was a significant public spectacle, drawing large crowds of fans and media. Combs, who appeared to kneel in gratitude upon hearing the verdict, will remain in custody pending his sentencing hearing.

The piece dismisses anti-Trump protests as misguided, suggesting that Trump's actions are in line with the foundational principles of the country.

          <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is set to launch a new program allowing for the adoption of some of its laboratory animals, including zebrafish and rats. This initiative follows the Trump administration's plans to drastically cut the agency's research and development arm and eliminate a significant number of scientist positions. While the adoption program offers a new life for some of the 20,000 animals used in testing, environmental and science advocacy groups criticize the underlying budget cuts. They warn that abandoning long-term research will make the EPA more reliant on industry-funded science and hinder its ability to assess environmental risks.</p>

          <p>According to policy experts and budget analysts, the major Republican budget bill championed by President Trump would inflict the most financial harm on low-income Americans. The legislation pairs over $3 trillion in tax cuts, which primarily benefit wealthy households and corporations, with significant cuts to social programs like Medicaid and food assistance. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the lowest-earning households would see a net financial loss, while the top 10% would receive a substantial income boost. Critics argue this represents a betrayal of the working-class voters Trump promised to support. (not investment advice)</p>

The indictment alleges her body, found in a shallow grave, was moved there after decomposing elsewhere, suggesting it was moved at least twice. Furthermore, toxicologists found a mixture of animal tranquilizers in her bone marrow, a substance Barry Morphew had access to and admitted using on deer. These new findings led to his second arrest for her murder after initial charges were dismissed, adding more layers to the complex and high-profile investigation.</p>

          <p>The United States and Vietnam have finalized a trade agreement that imposes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports, significantly lower than a previously threatened rate. A key provision of the deal is a 40% duty on products transshipped through Vietnam from other countries, a practice often associated with China to evade trade barriers. Analysts suggest this agreement may set a precedent for future U.S. trade negotiations with other emerging Asian economies like Thailand and Malaysia. However, the deal does not necessarily indicate a smoother path for trade talks with the European Union, which face different challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

Investors, who had feared Reeves might resign, reacted positively to the show of stability, believing her departure could weaken fiscal discipline. This market reassurance helped the pound regain some lost ground, demonstrating the financial community's preference for political stability and consistent fiscal policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Colombian navy has intercepted the first-ever unmanned semi-submersible vessel equipped with a Starlink satellite antenna off its Caribbean coast. Although the drone vessel was not carrying drugs at the time, authorities believe it was a trial run by the powerful Gulf Clan drug cartel and had the capacity to transport 1.5 tons of cocaine. This seizure highlights a significant technological advancement by trafficking organizations, using autonomous systems to evade detection and eliminate the risk of crew capture. The use of such sophisticated technology presents a new and challenging threat for international law enforcement agencies.</p>

          <p>In a significant decision, the Wisconsin State Supreme Court has ruled that a law from 1849 does not prohibit abortion in the state, thereby preserving legal access to the procedure. The ruling clarifies the legal landscape that had been uncertain since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The court determined that the 175-year-old statute, originally targeting feticide, was not intended to apply to consensual medical abortions performed before a fetus is viable. This decision provides a crucial victory for abortion rights advocates and healthcare providers operating within Wisconsin.</p>

The club is reportedly pursuing primary striker targets like RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko and Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres, with deals proving complex and potentially costly. In the midfield, players like Real Madrid's Rodrygo and Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze are on the radar, but high transfer fees could be a barrier.

          <p>A report from His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary has found that historical child grooming investigations in Greater Manchester were significantly delayed because Manchester City Council provided heavily redacted evidence. In some cases, pages of documents given to police had only a few words visible, making it impossible to assess their value. This practice particularly affected inquiries into child sexual exploitation from the early 2000s. While the report noted that the police, council, and prosecutors have since agreed on a more efficient information-sharing process, the past failures eroded trust among victims.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's presidency, despite its disruptive style, ultimately represents a continuation of the long-standing American political doctrines of neoliberalism and neoconservatism. The author points to the recently advanced "big, beautiful bill," with its tax cuts for the rich and welfare cuts for the poor, as a classic neoliberal policy. Simultaneously, the recent military strike on Iran is framed as a revival of reckless neoconservative foreign policy. The author concludes that Trump has blocked a true departure from this dead consensus, doubling down on the very policies his rise seemed to repudiate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea is experiencing a significant and growing ideological divide between its young men and women, a trend reflected in recent elections. Many men in their 20s and 30s, feeling disadvantaged by intense economic competition and the rise of feminism, are increasingly supporting conservative politicians who claim structural sexism no longer exists. This contrasts sharply with their female counterparts. Experts attribute this polarization to a combination of socioeconomic pressures, a hypercompetitive job market, and the rapid collapse of traditional marriage dynamics, creating a generational and gender-based political rift.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department is grappling with a surge of 911 calls from residents reporting kidnappings that turn out to be federal immigration enforcement actions. These incidents, often involving plainclothes or masked agents in unmarked vehicles, have sown fear and confusion in the community. Critics and some city leaders are questioning the LAPD's role, particularly when officers provide crowd control that appears to protect ICE agents. In response, the department has created new protocols requiring supervisors to verify agents' identities, but maintains it lacks authority to interfere with federal operations.</p>

          <h2>Fact-Checking Key Claims About Donald Trump's Proposed 'Mega-Bill'</h2>

          <p>An examination of key claims surrounding President Trump's major legislative bill reveals discrepancies between political rhetoric and independent analysis. Contrary to White House statements, multiple studies, including from the Congressional Budget Office, conclude the bill would increase the national deficit by trillions over the next decade. The bill would also make significant cuts to future Medicaid spending, potentially causing millions to lose health insurance. While the bill extends tax cuts, its overall financial impact is projected to worsen the country's debt situation rather than reduce it, despite any short-term economic boost.

          <p>The Shandong, China's second aircraft carrier and its first to be built domestically, represents a significant milestone in the country's naval ambitions. With a displacement of 70,000 tonnes, the vessel is a key instrument for Beijing's long-range power projection beyond the first island chain in the Western Pacific. Commissioned in 2019, the Shandong operates with the PLA Navy's Southern Theatre Command, primarily in the South China Sea. Its development and deployment are central to President Xi Jinping's massive overhaul of the Chinese military and its goal of creating a formidable blue-water navy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several women in County Durham, England, have become seriously ill, with one left fighting for her life, after receiving injections of an illegal Botox-type product. The beautician administered Toxpia, an unlicensed anti-wrinkle treatment from South Korea, which caused the women to develop botulism, a rare but life-threatening condition. One victim required resuscitation after she stopped breathing. The beautician has apologized to her clients but claimed it was a nationwide issue with the product. A public health investigation is now underway, with officials urging caution and thorough research before undergoing cosmetic procedures.</p>
