          <p>The United States and the European Union have finalized a trade deal, establishing a 15% tariff on most EU goods exported to the US. This agreement averts a threatened 30% tariff that was set to be imposed by the Trump administration. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to a $600 billion investment in the US and the purchase of $750 billion in American energy, including liquified natural gas, oil, and nuclear fuels. Both US President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen praised the agreement for fostering stability and strengthening economic ties. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent stock decline following a positive earnings report, this article argues for retaining Honeywell shares, citing the company's long-term potential. The analysis points to the upcoming split of the conglomerate into three distinct companies, a strong aerospace division, and its advanced quantum computing business as key value drivers. The author attributes the stock's underperformance to market impatience and a lack of understanding of the company's complex structure, which the split aims to rectify. The author expresses conviction that the market has overreacted and that the company's fundamentals remain strong, drawing parallels to past missed opportunities with companies like Oracle and Emerson.

          <p>Bubba Wallace secured a historic victory at the Brickyard 400, becoming the first Black driver to win on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's oval track. The win, his third in the NASCAR Cup Series, snapped a 100-race winless streak for the 23XI Racing driver. Wallace expertly managed his fuel and held off a late charge from Kyle Larson through two overtime restarts to claim the title. The significant victory at one of NASCAR's premier events provides a major boost for the team co-owned by Michael Jordan and Denny Hamlin.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the American musician and satirist renowned for his darkly humorous and politically charged songs from the 1950s and 1960s, has passed away at the age of 97. A Harvard-trained mathematician, Lehrer gained fame for witty tracks like "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park" and "The Elements," which blended clever lyricism with catchy tunes. Despite a relatively short-lived performance career, his work had a lasting influence on comedy and music, and he later taught at the University of California. In 2020, he placed all his work in the public domain, allowing it to be used freely by all.</p>

The article notes that President Trump's personal involvement was key to finalizing the deal, which rebalances a trade relationship he has long criticized as unfair. However, questions remain about the timeline and specifics of the EU's investment, and the deal sets the stage for upcoming trade negotiations between the US and China. (not investment advice)</p>

The incident led to widespread commentary and mockery online, with critics pointing to it as another example of his questionable sportsmanship. This is not the first time Trump has faced such allegations, with a book and numerous anecdotes from fellow players and caddies having previously detailed similar behavior.</p>

          <p>England defender Lucy Bronze revealed after the team's Euro 2025 victory that she played the entire tournament with a fractured tibia. The 33-year-old Chelsea full-back was a crucial part of the Lionesses' successful title defense, playing nearly 600 minutes despite the significant injury. Her toughness was particularly evident in the quarter-final against Sweden, where she scored the winning penalty, and in the final against Spain, where she played 105 minutes before being substituted. Manager Sarina Wiegman praised Bronze's "crazy mentality," highlighting her resilience as an inspiration to the entire squad.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns that the absence of Marvel Studios would diminish the experience, many attendees at this year's San Diego Comic-Con found the event as engaging as ever. While the famed Hall H programming lacked its usual blockbuster film panels, fans took the opportunity to explore other presentations, artist alleys, and exclusive merchandise without facing overwhelming crowds. The shift allowed other properties, such as the "Alien" franchise and the anime "Demon Slayer," to take center stage. This year's convention highlighted a potential shift in fan culture, demonstrating that the event's appeal extends far beyond major Hollywood announcements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House Budget Director Russell Vought has suggested that President Trump's recent criticism of the Federal Reserve is driven by a desire for lower interest rates, not by the conservative Project 2025 policy blueprint. In an interview, Vought, a key author of the project, claimed he didn't even know what the chapter on the Fed contained, asserting the president's agenda is his own. Project 2025 calls for a significant overhaul of the central bank to limit its mandate to price stability. Vought's comments come as the Trump administration escalates pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell over both interest rates and building renovations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Aid deliveries, including airdrops from Jordan and the UAE, have resumed in parts of Gaza after Israel announced a daily "tactical pause" in military operations to facilitate humanitarian corridors. However, the World Health Organization has warned that malnutrition in the Strip has reached "alarming levels" and is on a "dangerous trajectory." Despite the pause, medics reported that Israeli fire killed nine people near an aid convoy route in central Gaza. The UN and other international bodies welcomed the increased aid access but stressed that land routes are the only sustainable solution to reverse the catastrophic humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Downing Street has indicated there are no plans to announce a public bank holiday to celebrate the England women's football team's victory at Euro 2025. This decision aligns with the precedent set after the Lionesses' previous Euro win in 2022 and the men's World Cup victory in 1966. While Prime Minister Keir Starmer has previously supported the idea of a celebratory day off for such an achievement, the government is likely considering the economic cost, previously estimated to be over £1 billion. Instead of a holiday, the team's historic win will be marked with an open-top bus parade in central London.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Thailand and Cambodia are set to meet in Kuala Lumpur for peace talks aimed at ending deadly border clashes that have killed at least 34 people and displaced around 200,000.

Both nations have agreed to pursue an immediate ceasefire, though artillery exchanges reportedly continued over the weekend. The conflict has inflamed nationalist sentiments, prompting the Thai government to warn its citizens against violence towards Cambodians living in the country.</p>

This development follows a visit by Russia's foreign minister to North Korea, where he encouraged tourism to the country's new Wonsan-Kalma beach resort. The flights represent a gradual reopening of North Korea's borders, which were heavily restricted during the pandemic, as it seeks to boost its struggling economy through tourism.</p>

          <p>The US and EU have announced a trade deal after a tense 40-minute meeting at Donald Trump's golf resort in Scotland, averting a potential trade war. The agreement sets a 15% baseline tariff for most EU exports, though a punitive 50% tariff on steel remains. In return, the EU will purchase $750 billion in US energy products and invest $600 billion in the US. The deal notably creates a trade division on the island of Ireland, as Northern Ireland will benefit from a lower 10% tariff rate, raising diplomatic questions about the Good Friday agreement's economic stability guarantees.

          <p>The American Medical Association (AMA) has voiced "deep concern" over reports that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to overhaul the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. This non-partisan panel provides evidence-based recommendations on which preventive services, like cancer screenings, should be covered by insurance. The move is reportedly because Kennedy views the panel as too "woke." The AMA's letter urged the administration to retain the current members and process, emphasizing the task force's critical role in public health and disease prevention, which aligns with the administration's "Make America Healthy Again" initiative.</p>
