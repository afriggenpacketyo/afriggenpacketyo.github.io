            <p>The Supreme Court issued a late-night order halting the Trump administration from removing Venezuelan immigrants without due process, suggesting a potential shift in the court's tolerance of procedural tactics designed to evade judicial review. The ACLU argued the government was defying a previous order by rushing deportations without providing a meaningful opportunity for immigrants to challenge their removal, a claim the court's order seems to address. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, though the full reasoning is not yet clear. This move indicates the court may be less willing to accept malicious half-compliance with its decisions, particularly regarding the rights of immigrants facing deportation.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has reached its lowest point amid widespread dissatisfaction with his handling of tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a recent CNBC survey. While his Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents have become increasingly pessimistic about the economy's direction. The survey reveals significant disapproval of Trump's tariff policies and concerns about a potential recession. These negative sentiments regarding the economy do not appear to be translating into potential gains for the Democratic party, with congressional preference remaining relatively stable.

The findings, published in Science Advances, involved laser pulses fired into the eyes of participants to stimulate specific retinal cells. While some experts remain skeptical, describing the new perceived colour as a "matter of interpretation", the research team believes the results could potentially further research into colour blindness. The team is studying the findings to see what it could potentially mean for colour blind people, who find it difficult to distinguish between certain colours.</p>

            <h2>New Populism Fueled by Wealth, Not Poverty, Analysis Suggests</h2>

            <p>An analysis suggests that a growing segment of voters, financially secure baby boomers, are driving the new populism by supporting right-wing policies that prioritize individual wealth and reduced social responsibility. This shift is attributed to a desire to protect their financial gains and a detachment from the struggles of less fortunate individuals. The analysis contrasts this with the inclusive capitalism of the past, where the wealthy recognized the benefits of supporting those less fortunate. The experiment of Truss and Trump's tariffs may be a turning point.</p>

            <p>The Menendez brothers' hope for freedom has been further delayed as a judge postponed their resentencing hearing until next month. Erik and Lyle Menendez were convicted of murdering their parents in 1996 and sentenced to life in prison. The hearing was meant to review their request for resentencing and determine whether they have been rehabilitated. The delay comes amid disputes between the defense and prosecution, as well as changes in the District Attorney's office.</p>

Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska expressed fear of retaliation for using her voice, highlighting a pervasive atmosphere of intimidation. Governing is supposed to take place by politics, by persuasion, by debate. Authoritarianism is by intimidation, by threat, by violence in some cases.</p>
