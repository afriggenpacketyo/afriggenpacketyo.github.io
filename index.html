          <p>In a recent interview, United CEO Scott Kirby discussed the recent radar outages at Newark International Airport and assured the public that flying in and out of Newark is safe, citing backup procedures and pilot training. Kirby mentioned that United has proactively reduced flights to accommodate ongoing runway construction and to ensure on-time arrivals. He also addressed concerns about potential ticket price increases due to reduced supply, stating that demand is down due to safety concerns, and United is using larger planes to maintain seat capacity. The CEO emphasized that safety and customer satisfaction are the airline's top priorities, even if it means taking a financial hit, and expressed optimism about the future improvements to the FAA's air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>As Democrats look ahead to the 2028 presidential election, the party must first decide which state will kick off the nominating calendar. Following President Biden's decision to elevate South Carolina in 2024, traditionally early-voting states like Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada are vying for the top spot. The decision is complicated by questions about the party's direction and the need to engage a diverse electorate. Potential 2028 candidates are already visiting early states, signaling their interest in shaping the nominating process. Iowa Democratic leaders are emphasizing their focus on the 2026 election, while also hoping to be considered as an early state in 2028.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is scaling back its efforts to promote democracy abroad, raising concerns among experts about the future of freedom and representative government. The Trump administration has significantly reduced funding for the Agency for Global Media, restructured the State Department, and cut resources for the U.S. Agency for International Development. This shift is seen as a retrenchment from the U.S.'s historical role in spreading democratic ideals and could create a vacuum for authoritarian governments to expand their influence. Experts warn that these moves could accelerate anti-democratic trends around the world, undermining stability and cooperation.</p>

          <p>The article presents the poem 'Infant Longing' by Li-Young Lee, which delves into themes of loss, memory, and the profound connection between individuals. The poem uses the imagery of a mother finding her own among the slaughtered and feeding her child longing at both the beginning and end of the world. Through kisses, the speaker seeks to both seal and open the mouth, eyes, and soul, ultimately finding an infinite longing that transcends time and space. The poem suggests that in moments of deep connection, the boundaries of self and other blur, revealing a shared human experience.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vladimir Putin has proposed direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul, but without an immediate ceasefire, leading to speculation about his motives. This offer comes after European leaders issued an ultimatum for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face more sanctions and military assistance for Ukraine. The Kremlin's move is viewed by some as an attempt to play for time, prolong the war, and potentially split the Western coalition backing Ukraine. While Putin claims to want peace, it is likely only on Russia's terms, and the offer is a signal to the White House that he is a man of peace.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to end care worker recruitment from abroad as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that firms will be required to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country. The government aims to cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers coming to the UK over the next year. The threshold for skilled visas is expected to be increased to graduate level. There will also be a narrower list of exceptions to the rules for temporary shortage visas in some industries.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva for high-stakes trade negotiations aimed at easing tensions stemming from President Trump’s trade war. The talks have major implications for the global economy, which has been disrupted by tariffs imposed by both countries. The Trump administration has accused China of unfairly subsidizing key sectors and flooding the world with cheap goods. China has maintained it will not make trade concessions in response to Trump’s tariffs. The meetings were intended to set the stage for broader economic negotiations, but economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a quick deal.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump continues to criticize the US media as "fake news," despite evidence that some news organizations have seemingly compromised journalistic independence to stay in his good graces. Several outlets have settled frivolous lawsuits or faced interference from wealthy owners to avoid upsetting Trump. The owner of CBS News is said to be considering settling a $10 billion lawsuit brought against the network over the editing of a Kamala Harris interview. Experts say these actions are driven by the owners' bottom lines and a desire to avoid trouble for their other business enterprises.</p>

          <p>Many American parents struggle to balance raising children with maintaining friendships, leading some to create intentional communities with their friends. One example involves three couples who moved into adjacent townhouses to share child-care responsibilities and create a supportive village. This arrangement reflects a broader historical trend of children being raised with the help of adults who aren't their biological parents, known as alloparents. While such arrangements require coordination and compromise, they can provide much-needed support and deeper friendships for parents. This article explores different models of raising children alongside friends, including co-housing communities and shared homes.</p>

          <p>A university-level investigation into doomsday-prepping kits reveals that preparing for adverse events is becoming a mainstream American cultural phenomenon. FEMA's 2023 results indicate that about half of Americans are engaged in some kind of preparedness for some sort of adverse event. The reasons include fears of nuclear war, societal collapse, and extreme weather events coupled with an inadequate government response. This has created a neoliberal condition of American political life where individuals feel they can't rely on the government and must take responsibility for their own preparation through consumption choices. While some ultra-rich people are buying private islands and building bunkers, many middle-class Americans are also engaging in prepping by purchasing shelf-stable food and other supplies.</p>

          <p>Sevilla's first team players and staff were forced to spend the night at their training facility after being met with "violent attacks" by supporters following a 3-2 loss to Celta Vigo. The club strongly condemned the "organized vandalism" at the Jose Ramon Cisneros Palacios training complex. Footage on social media showed supporters chanting outside the facility and tearing down the gate to the entrance. Sevilla is currently 16th in La Liga, six points above the relegation zone with three games left to play.</p>

          <h2>British Plane Parts 'Exempted from Trump Tariffs' as US Trade Deal Progresses</h2>

          <p>British plane parts are expected to be exempted from US import tariffs as part of a trade agreement with the Trump administration. Engines from Rolls-Royce and similar plane parts would be able to enter the US market without tariffs, providing certainty to a £40bn sector that supports 450,000 jobs in the UK. The deal would also benefit the US, as Boeing imports Rolls-Royce engines for its commercial airliners. The agreement follows relief for the car and steel industries, with car tariffs expected to decrease from 27.5% to 10% on at least 100,000 vehicles a year and steel tariffs reduced to zero.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that Russia's willingness to talk is a "positive sign" but "far from sufficient," following his first trip to Kyiv. Merz emphasized that European allies support a 30-day truce, which Ukraine has agreed to without reservation. He urged Moscow to agree to a ceasefire to allow real talks to take place, stating that discussions can only begin once the weapons are silenced. Merz was responding to Russian President Vladimir Putin's offer to hold direct talks with Ukraine in Turkey from Thursday.</p>

          <p>South Korea's upcoming presidential election features Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo, representing opposing sides of a country polarized over the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee, a former sweatshop worker, leads in pre-election surveys, promising to end the old era of insurrection and regression. Kim, Yoon’s former labor minister, has veered further to the right, warning that Lee would make South Korea more friendly toward China and North Korea at the cost of its alliance with the United States. The election is seen as a referendum on Yoon and his right-wing People Power Party.</p>

          <p>Following a US-mediated ceasefire between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, diplomats from both countries express cautious optimism but acknowledge that long-term peace will be difficult to achieve. Experts suggest that the US, Saudi Arabia, and Iran played crucial roles in mediating the ceasefire. While the de-escalation marks the end of the worst military confrontation in 25 years, deep-seated distrust and unresolved issues, including terrorism and water security, continue to pose challenges. Analysts believe the ceasefire will hold in the short term due to international pressure and recognition of the costs of escalation.</p>

          <p>An article examines General Motors' (GM) debt levels, noting that while the company does carry a significant amount of debt, it also has cash reserves to offset some of it. The article points out that GM's liabilities outweigh its cash and near-term receivables by a substantial margin, which could pose a risk to the company. It uses ratios like net debt divided by EBITDA and interest cover to assess the debt levels relative to earnings. It is concluded that shareholders need to closely monitor GM's debt situation.</p>

The basketball courts, built shortly after the end of segregation, are popular among a diverse group of players, and protesters fear that converting them to pickleball will erase a community tradition. While the developers claim the change is based on pickleball's broader appeal, critics argue that it will "whiten" the beach and exclude minority residents who rely on the courts.</p>

          <p>This article presents a brief excerpt from a review of Ron Chernow’s biography of Mark Twain, suggesting that the book paints Twain as a “born sucker” who embraced the crackpot theory that Francis Bacon wrote Shakespeare’s plays. The excerpt contrasts this with Northrop Frye’s wry observation about the limited biographical information known about Shakespeare, leading to the conclusion that he was “clearly an idiot.” This article is very short, but is included because it has no duplicate coverage with the other articles.</p>

          <p>The new German government, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, has begun implementing stricter border controls and turning away asylum seekers. In the first two days of the policy, 19 people who had applied for asylum were rejected at the border. The government cites the presence of safe European Union states as justification, arguing that migrants should apply for refuge upon first landing in Europe. The move has drawn criticism from politicians and neighboring EU countries, while also sparking debate over the treatment of vulnerable individuals.</p>
