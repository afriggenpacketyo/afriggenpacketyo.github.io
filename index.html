          <p>Several individuals, disguised as construction workers, executed a daring daylight robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris, stealing at least nine pieces of jewelry from the Napoleon and French Crown Jewels collections. Valued as "inestimable heritage and historical value," the items, including crowns and necklaces, were taken in a seven-minute operation involving a freight elevator and angle grinders. French authorities have launched an investigation, with President Macron vowing to recover the stolen works and bring perpetrators to justice. The museum closed temporarily following the incident, which security experts called an "audacious crime" against one of the world's most secure institutions.</p>

          <p>China's economy is projected to have experienced a slowdown in the third quarter, with Reuters analysts forecasting a gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 4.8% from July to September, a decrease from the 5.2% recorded in the previous quarter. Estimates also suggest minimal expansion in fixed-asset investment and a deceleration in retail sales and industrial production for September. Despite these anticipated declines, official data for September has shown unexpected resilience in China's exports. The upcoming official data release on Monday is highly anticipated for a clearer picture of the economic trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a powerful reinterpretation of American history, 18 decommissioned Confederate monuments, including a melted-down statue of General Robert E. Lee, are now part of an art exhibit in Los Angeles. The exhibit, titled "Monuments," aims to confront the "Lost Cause" ideology by highlighting the figures' association with white supremacy and slavery. Curator Hamza Walker emphasized that the statues, once symbols of division, are being transformed to spark dialogue about the nation's past. This initiative contrasts with calls from some political figures to reinstall such monuments, showcasing a contentious debate over historical memory.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged Mahmoud Amin Ya'qub al-Muhtadi, a Louisiana resident, with participating in Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel and entering the U.S. on a fraudulent visa. Al-Muhtadi, allegedly part of the National Resistance Brigades, is accused of coordinating armed fighters to cross into Israel and seeking ammunition. His phone records place him near a kibbutz during the attack. He later allegedly submitted a false visa application denying terror ties and specialized skills. This case highlights international terrorism connections reaching U.S. soil.</p>

          <p>During a U.S. Marine Corps live-fire exercise at Camp Pendleton, metal shrapnel from a prematurely detonated artillery round struck a California Highway Patrol (CHP) vehicle. The incident occurred shortly after Vice President JD Vance's protective detail had escorted him to the event, which celebrated the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary. No injuries were reported, but the shrapnel caused minor damage to a patrol car and motorcycle. The CHP, which had ordered a freeway closure for the event, called the situation "unusual and concerning" and recommended a review of safety protocols for future demonstrations.</p>

          <p>Lakers center Jaxson Hayes sustained a minor wrist sprain during a preseason game but is expected to be ready for the regular season opener. The injury occurred from a hard fall after catching a lob pass from Luka Doncic. Hayes and other new bigs, like Deandre Ayton, are still adjusting to Doncic's distinctive passing style in the pick-and-roll. This ongoing learning curve highlights the challenge of building team chemistry with a new point guard. Hayes is also pursuing Slovenian citizenship, with Doncic's support, to potentially join the national team.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new vocational V-levels for 16-year-olds, aiming to simplify England's "confusing landscape" of post-GCSE qualifications. These V-levels are intended to replace Level 3 BTecs and other technical qualifications, focusing on practical skills and employment pathways. Ministers also propose an alternative qualification to reduce the number of students resitting maths and English GCSEs. While some warn V-levels may not fully fill the gap left by BTecs, the initiative seeks to offer clearer routes for students, potentially allowing them to combine V-levels with A-levels.</p>

          <p>Liu Qian, founder of Wusawa Advisory and former managing director of The Economist Group in Greater China, provides insights into Chinese innovation, the US-China rivalry, and gender equality.

Qian emphasizes that the rivalry extends beyond trade into technology and ideologies, posing risks for global stability. As a prominent advocate for gender equality, she also highlights the critical importance of women's voices in policymaking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amidst a partial US government shutdown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Ambassador Jamieson Greer accused China of wielding an "economic coercion" by expanding export controls on critical rare earth minerals. They labeled this a "Chinese chokehold" on the world, impacting high-tech goods and AI. This accusation comes as the Trump administration's own tariff policies create global trade disruption, with the US economy seemingly insulated by a tech wealth boom.

Two distinguishing factors are highlighted: nuclear weapons making total war irrational, and technological interdependence creating immense costs for systemic rupture.

The book details her alleged sexual assaults by Prince Andrew on three occasions, including one with Epstein and other young women. Prince Andrew, who settled a civil case with Giuffre in 2022 and recently relinquished royal titles, has consistently denied the accusations. The memoir further exposes sinister details of Epstein's sex trafficking, including demands for "childlike" appearances and instances of physical abuse, underscoring a horrific pattern of exploitation.</p>
