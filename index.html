          <p>President Trump requested Representative Elise Stefanik withdraw her nomination for UN ambassador due to concerns about a potential special election in her district.  House Speaker Johnson invited Stefanik to return to the House leadership team, and Trump expressed hope for her future inclusion in his administration.  The decision leaves the UN ambassador position vacant and avoids a potentially challenging special election for House Republicans.</p>
