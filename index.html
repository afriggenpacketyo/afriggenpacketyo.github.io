The company also issued an optimistic forecast for the upcoming fiscal year, projecting adjusted earnings and revenue in line with or slightly above consensus estimates. A significant highlight was the growth in AI infrastructure orders, which surpassed $2 billion for the fiscal year, more than doubling the company's initial goal. This performance indicates strong demand in networking and a strategic focus on the expanding artificial intelligence market. (not investment advice)</p>

It explores the 1867 sale of the Alaskan territory from Russia to the United States for $7.2 million. The piece notes that this historical transaction remains a point of contention for some in Russia, who still question the legitimacy of American sovereignty over the region. This background provides a unique perspective on the geopolitical setting of the high-stakes diplomatic summit.</p>

          <p>The FBI is now investigating a physical altercation that occurred on a Breeze Airways flight from Virginia to California, forcing it to divert to Colorado. An intoxicated male passenger reportedly became agitated, shouted racial slurs, and waved a skateboard at airline staff and other passengers. Despite being restrained twice, the man broke free, leading to minor injuries for a flight attendant and another guest. Upon landing, the disruptive passenger was taken into custody by local police at the direction of the FBI.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Authorities in Juneau, Alaska, report that newly installed temporary barriers have successfully prevented widespread damage from a record-setting glacial outburst flood. The Mendenhall River crested at a new record high after an ice dam at the Mendenhall Glacier released a massive surge of water. While some minor flooding occurred, the 10,000 'Hesco' barriers protected over 460 properties, a significant improvement over previous years which saw hundreds of homes inundated. Scientists attribute the increasing intensity of these annual floods to the effects of climate change on Alaska's rapidly melting glaciers.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to withhold billions of dollars in congressionally approved foreign aid can proceed. The 2-1 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals was based on procedural grounds, stating that only the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has the standing to challenge the withholding of funds under the Impoundment Control Act. This ruling is a significant blow to humanitarian organizations that sued to restore the funding, which includes aid for global health programs like HIV/AIDS prevention. The decision sidesteps the constitutional question of separation of powers.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Leagues Cup has sparked debate over whether it accurately measures the strength of Major League Soccer versus Mexico's Liga MX, despite MLS teams showing statistical dominance. The analysis points out that the tournament's format heavily favors MLS, as all games are played in the United States, forcing Mexican clubs to endure constant travel. While MLS teams have won more games and the last two titles, the article notes that Liga MX has historically dominated in the more balanced CONCACAF Champions Cup. Coaches and analysts suggest the home-field advantage and travel fatigue significantly impact the results.</p>

          <p>A new study predicts that global reindeer populations could decline substantially by the end of the century, with North American caribou facing the highest risk of an 80% drop. Researchers from the University of Adelaide and the University of Copenhagen used ancient DNA and computer models to reconstruct population changes over the last 21,000 years. They found that while reindeer have survived past warming periods, the current rate of climate change poses a more severe threat. The decline could also have cascading ecological effects, including reduced plant diversity and less carbon storage in Arctic soils.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services (EWS), the parent company of the payment app Zelle, which is co-owned by seven major U.S. banks.

The lawsuit claims that design flaws, such as a quick registration process and lack of verification, made the network a prime target for fraudulent activity.

These potential acquisitions are part of a significant summer spending spree for the club, which has already seen bids for other high-profile players.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced he will seek a "long-term" extension of federal control over the Washington, D.C. police department to combat crime in the nation's capital. This follows his recent declaration of a public safety emergency, which temporarily placed the city's law enforcement under federal oversight for 30 days. Trump stated he will ask Congress for the extension, arguing that 30 days is insufficient to address the city's issues. Critics have raised concerns about the move, while the administration maintains it is a necessary step to restore safety.</p>

          <p>Missouri health officials have confirmed a rare and dangerous infection from the Naegleria fowleri amoeba, commonly known as the brain-eating amoeba. The unidentified patient is currently in intensive care. While the source is still under investigation, the patient had been water skiing at the Lake of the Ozarks days before becoming ill. This type of infection, called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), is extremely rare but almost always fatal. It occurs when contaminated freshwater is forced up the nose, allowing the amoeba to travel to the brain.</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining approximately 2% in a single session, bucking the trend of declining megacap technology stocks.

Lower interest rates are expected to particularly benefit smaller companies, which often rely on borrowed capital for their operations and expansion. Despite the recent gains, the small-cap index has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 since late 2022. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite criticism from President Trump, Goldman Sachs is not alone in its prediction that U.S. consumers will face higher inflation due to tariffs. Economists across Wall Street largely concur, expecting that as pre-tariff inventories are depleted and higher duty rates take effect, companies will increasingly pass these costs on to customers. While no one is forecasting runaway inflation, many predict a steady rise in prices that could push the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure into the low- to mid-3% range. This potential inflation is not expected to deter the Fed from cutting interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>
