        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study found that 60% of workers in Singapore are living paycheck to paycheck, a figure notably higher than the Asia-Pacific average. This trend is attributed to a combination of macroeconomic factors, including high inflation and expensive housing, which have eroded real income growth since the pandemic. Experts also point to a cultural shift among younger generations who are prioritizing lifestyle experiences and instant gratification over traditional long-term savings, further straining personal finances. This situation is compounded by the easy availability of 'buy now, pay later' schemes. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the origins of the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which clarifies the procedures for presidential succession and disability. It highlights the efforts of lawyer John Feerick, who recognized a critical gap in the Constitution following President Eisenhower's health scares and before John F. Kennedy's assassination. Feerick championed the cause, leading to the amendment's ratification, which provides a clear framework for what happens if a president is unable to serve. The discussion provides essential context for understanding the continuity of power in the United States government.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy grew by a surprising 0.3% in the second quarter, exceeding economists' expectations of a 0.1% expansion. This growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in the services sector, particularly in computer programming and health, alongside an increase in construction. Despite this positive data, economists express caution, suggesting the momentum is unlikely to continue due to a softening labor market and persistent inflation pressures. The Bank of England recently cut interest rates to 4% in a finely balanced decision reflecting these competing economic signals. (not investment advice)</p>

According to the agency, Jimmy Anderson Ayala Mayuri was stopped in his food truck and responded by presenting a large butcher knife, motioning that he would harm himself. After briefly barricading himself inside the vehicle, he was apprehended and will be held pending a deportation decision.

The court found that both versions are based on a traditional American children's camp chant that is in the public domain. Pinkfong's "Baby Shark" has become a global phenomenon, amassing over 16 billion views on YouTube.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than 115 education scholars have signed an open letter denouncing the Harvard Education Publishing Group's decision to cancel a special issue of the Harvard Educational Review focused on Palestine. The scholars label the move as censorship and an act of anti-Palestinian discrimination, aimed at silencing academic examination of the ongoing conflict. The publisher had demanded an unprecedented legal "risk assessment" of the articles, and when authors protested, the entire issue was scrapped, citing concerns over the review process and quality. Critics argue this is an example of the "Palestine exception" to academic freedom amid political pressure.</p>

          <p>Former England football star Wayne Rooney stated he was "really disappointed" by what he considers "very unfair" comments from NFL legend Tom Brady about his work ethic. The remarks were made in a documentary about Birmingham City, a club where Brady is a part-owner and where Rooney had a brief, unsuccessful 83-day tenure as head coach. Rooney suggested Brady, having only visited the training ground once on a lighter day, did not fully understand the demands of football compared to the NFL.

          <p>A coalition of over 100 humanitarian organizations, including Oxfam and Médecins Sans Frontières, has called on Israel to stop what they term the "weaponization of aid" into Gaza. In a joint letter, the groups state that new Israeli regulations introduced in March are severely hindering their ability to deliver lifesaving supplies, leaving hospitals without basics and deepening starvation. The rules allow aid groups to be banned if they "delegitimize" Israel, a condition the organizations argue compromises their independence.

          <p>A federal trial has concluded over Governor Gavin Newsom's lawsuit challenging President Trump's deployment of the California National Guard to Los Angeles. The state argues the deployment for immigration enforcement support violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits domestic use of the military. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer questioned the Justice Department's arguments, expressing concern about the apparent "absence of any limits to a national police force" under the president's authority. The case centers on the constitutional separation of powers and the legal recourse a state has when a president federalizes its National Guard without gubernatorial consent.</p>

The plaintiffs argue the facility, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," was built without the required environmental impact assessment under federal law, harming protected species like the Florida panther and the area's water quality. A key issue in the case is determining who has control over the site—the state of Florida or the federal government—as this dictates whether federal environmental laws apply.

          <p>A New York man has been federally charged with cyberstalking a family member of Brian Thompson, the UnitedHealthcare CEO who was fatally shot in December 2024. Prosecutors allege that 40-year-old Shane Daley left multiple threatening voicemails for the relative in the days following the murder. In the messages, Daley allegedly expressed glee over the killing, stating it was justified and that Thompson's children and the family member deserved a similar fate. Daley was arrested and released with GPS monitoring, facing up to five years in prison if convicted of the charges.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at easing the regulatory process for commercial rocket launches in the United States. The order directs the Department of Transportation to expedite or eliminate certain environmental reviews for launch licenses issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The White House stated the goal is to remove outdated and restrictive rules to encourage investment and innovation, bolstering the competitiveness of U.S. space companies like SpaceX. However, environmental groups have criticized the move, warning it could put people and wildlife at risk from rocket launch activities.</p>

          <h2>Gallup Poll Shows American Alcohol Consumption at a Record Low</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new Gallup poll, the percentage of Americans who consume alcohol has dropped to 54%, a record low since the firm began tracking the data in 1939. This decline corresponds with a growing public perception that even moderate drinking is unhealthy, a view particularly prevalent among younger adults aged 18 to 34. Experts suggest that increased awareness of health risks, the social acceptability of not drinking, and financial pressures are contributing factors. The poll also noted a significant drop in alcohol use among women and differing preferences for beer and wine between genders.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning that sunscreen products in mousse form may not provide effective protection against harmful UV rays. The agency sent warning letters to five companies, including popular brands Supergoop! and Vacation Inc., stating their products are unapproved drugs that violate federal regulations. The FDA also highlighted a significant safety concern, noting that the products are often packaged in containers resembling whipped cream cans. This packaging could mislead consumers, especially children, into accidentally ingesting the sunscreen, posing a serious health risk.</p>

          <p>China's Xiluodu dam, the country's third-largest hydropower station, has replaced foreign-made programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in its core industrial control systems with domestically produced alternatives. The move to swap out chips from Western companies like Siemens and Schneider Electric reflects growing national security concerns over the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyberattacks. This strategic shift is part of a broader effort by Beijing to achieve technological self-sufficiency and secure its industrial systems from potential foreign interference or sabotage, a concern highlighted by past cyberattacks like the Stuxnet virus.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, the family of David Barnes, a Texas man imprisoned in Russia, is hopeful for a prisoner exchange. Barnes has been detained since January 2022 and is serving a 21.5-year sentence on child abuse charges that were investigated and reportedly not found credible in the U.S. His family maintains his innocence and is urging the U.S. government to designate him as wrongfully detained. The meeting between the two leaders is seen as a potential opportunity to negotiate the release of Barnes and other Americans held in Russia.</p>

          <p>The closing arguments in the national security trial of Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai have been postponed due to a typhoon. Lai, a prominent pro-democracy advocate and British citizen, faces a potential life sentence on charges of colluding with foreign forces under Beijing's controversial national security law. His case is widely seen by critics as a key indicator of the erosion of judicial independence and freedom of speech in Hong Kong. International figures, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, have called for the 77-year-old's release, while his son fears a long sentence would be a death penalty.</p>

In a legal letter, her attorney called the assertion "false, disparaging, defamatory and inflammatory," demanding an immediate retraction and apology to avoid legal action. Biden made the comments during a recent interview, attributing the information in part to a journalist's biography. The first lady's legal team states the claim has caused her significant financial and reputational harm, and there is no evidence to support it.</p>

Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of leader Kim Jong Un, stated that Pyongyang has no intention of removing the speakers and has no interest in reviving dialogue with Seoul or Washington. She characterized an upcoming U.S.-South Korea joint military drill as proof of hostility. The statement serves as a cold dismissal of recent hopes from South Korea's president that the alleged removal of speakers could signal a reopening of communications between the two nations.</p>

          <p>This article provides a poignant look at the last American firebombing of World War II, which devastated the Japanese city of Kumagaya on the night of August 14-15, 1945. The raid occurred less than 12 hours before Japan's surrender was announced, killing over 260 people and leaving 75% of the city in ruins. Through the memories of survivors who were children at the time, the piece explores the horror of the attack and the lingering physical and emotional scars. It also grapples with the moral complexities and the perceived futility of a mission carried out in the final moments of the war.</p>

The move, which also federalizes the city's police force, has been sharply criticized by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser as an "authoritarian push." While the White House points to recent arrests as proof of the operation's necessity, crime data from the city's police shows that violent crime has actually been on a downward trend.

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reported a significant rise in cases of the chikungunya virus, with more than double the number of infections in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year. All 73 cases were linked to travel, primarily to the Indian Ocean region where an outbreak is ongoing. The mosquito-borne virus, which is not present in the UK, causes fever and severe joint pain that can persist for years. Health officials are urging travelers to high-risk areas to take precautions like using insect repellent and covering up to prevent mosquito bites.</p>
