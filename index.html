          <p>Bryan Patrick Miller, a local figure known for his 'Zombie Hunter' persona, was convicted and sentenced to death for the brutal murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas in the early 1990s. The cold case, known as the Phoenix canal murders, remained unsolved for over two decades until a breakthrough in genetic genealogy pointed investigators toward Miller. Detectives then conducted an elaborate undercover sting at a Chili's restaurant to surreptitiously obtain his DNA from a water glass, which ultimately matched the evidence from the crime scenes. Miller's defense argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity due to a traumatic childhood, but a judge found him guilty, bringing a long-awaited resolution to the community.</p>

          <p>James Craig, a dentist from Aurora, Colorado, was found guilty of murdering his wife, Angela Craig, by poisoning her protein shakes with cyanide and arsenic. The investigation began after a suspicious package containing potassium cyanide was delivered to his dental office, which was opened by a staff member who became concerned after noticing Angela's symptoms matched those of cyanide poisoning. Authorities uncovered that Craig had conducted online searches for undetectable poisons and was engaged in an extramarital affair, which prosecutors argued was a motive alongside significant financial debts. The case highlights how a seemingly perfect family life concealed a meticulously planned and fatal plot.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russia's rejection of an immediate ceasefire is complicating peace efforts, ahead of his scheduled visit to the White House. Following a summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, Russia reportedly demanded Ukraine cede the entire Donetsk region for an end to the conflict, a condition Kyiv has consistently rejected. Zelenskyy emphasized that meaningful negotiations cannot proceed without a halt in hostilities and plans to coordinate with U.S. and European leaders to address security guarantees and territorial issues. Meanwhile, Russia continued its aerial attacks on Ukraine, launching dozens of drones overnight.</p>

This trend, driven by rising costs in areas like dental care and airline fares, reverses a previous softening and complicates the Federal Reserve's policy decisions. While markets still anticipate an interest rate cut in September due to a weakening labor market, some economists argue the broad-based inflationary pressures warrant caution, or even a rate hike, to prevent inflation from escalating. The data suggests a potential conflict between the Fed's goals of maintaining price stability and ensuring maximum employment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly reaching Category 5 intensity. While it is not expected to make landfall on the U.S. mainland, its outer bands are bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, prompting flood watches and warnings. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that Erin will turn north, away from the U.S., but its growing size will generate dangerous surf and rip currents along much of the East Coast. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands, with the storm expected to cause hazardous conditions in the Bahamas and Bermuda as well.</p>

          <p>Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund is expected to be omitted from the squad for the upcoming Premier League match against Arsenal. The decision by coach Ruben Amorim comes amidst intense speculation about the 22-year-old's future with the club. Following the high-profile signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, Hojlund's playing opportunities at United are likely to be significantly reduced. AC Milan is reportedly among the clubs interested in signing the Danish forward, though no formal agreement has been reached. This move signals a potential departure for Hojlund as the club reshapes its attacking lineup.</p>

He emphasized that Putin is only at the negotiating table due to the pressure of U.S. sanctions.

President Trump failed to secure his primary objective of a ceasefire, instead accepting Putin's position that a comprehensive peace agreement must come first. Putin's offer to freeze the frontline in exchange for Ukraine ceding the entire Donbas region is viewed as a strategic trap that puts pressure on Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and creates friction between the U.S. and its European allies. By engaging in bilateral talks, Putin successfully undermined Western efforts to isolate him and bolstered his position in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police force, mayors of other Democratic-led cities are preparing for similar federal interventions. City leaders express concern that Trump is using crime as a pretext to undermine local authority and create political chaos, despite data showing that violent crime is decreasing in many major cities. Mayors from cities like Seattle and Minneapolis are coordinating with their police chiefs, city attorneys, and governors to strategize legal and operational responses to potential deployments of federal agents or the National Guard.

Parts was removed from the team on the same day the NCAA implemented its new policy, which followed a federal executive order on the matter.

They point to the success of violence intervention models in cities like Baltimore and Oakland, which have seen homicide rates drop through targeted community engagement.

The demonstrations occurred after Israel's security cabinet approved plans to seize Gaza City, intensifying the long-running offensive against Hamas. The protests highlight a growing internal division within Israel over the government's handling of the war and the hostage crisis.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been painstakingly renovated into a luxury party destination and is now on the market for £3 million. The new owner, Mike Conner, purchased the abandoned, 1850s-era fortress in 2017 and spent nearly five years and a significant investment to make it habitable, overcoming challenges like having no running water or electricity. The historic, off-grid property now features 40 beds, modern amenities, and its own nightclub. Conner hopes the next owner will utilize its unique potential, possibly as a tourist attraction or an exclusive event venue.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Sparks forward Cameron Brink has revealed that creating vision boards was a crucial part of her mental recovery from a torn ACL. The practice, suggested by teammate Dearica Hamby, helped Brink maintain a positive outlook and visualize her goals during the arduous 13-month rehabilitation process. By focusing on personal aspirations, relationships, and on-court achievements, she was able to combat the doubts and anxieties that accompany a long-term injury. Her successful return to the court, where she made an immediate impact, is seen by her coach and team psychotherapist as a testament to the power of mental rehearsal and a patient, intentional approach to recovery.</p>

          <p>Germany has halted its humanitarian visa program, which for the past three years has provided a safe haven for Russian and Belarusian activists, journalists, and critics of the war in Ukraine. The decision, stemming from a new coalition government's tougher stance on migration, has left approximately 300 applicants, whose visas had already been approved by the Foreign Office, unable to enter the country. Advocacy groups express grave concern, as these individuals face significant risks of persecution, extradition, or abduction if they remain in neighboring post-Soviet states. The Interior Ministry stated the program is under review, with exceptions possible only in urgent cases.</p>

          <p>Germany's ruling coalition is at odds over how to expand the country's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, to meet NATO targets. The center-left Social Democrats (SPD), led by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, favor an enhanced voluntary service model, while their center-right CDU/CSU partners argue that relying on volunteers is insufficient given the current security climate and advocate for a return to conscription. A proposed law would make military service more attractive and require all 18-year-old men to complete a questionnaire about their willingness to serve. However, critics from the CDU/CSU argue the plan lacks urgency and clear deadlines for increasing troop numbers.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued by a helicopter crew after spending two days trapped in a cave behind a powerful waterfall in California's Tulare County. The man, an experienced rappeller, was descending the 'Seven Teacups' waterfalls when extreme water hydraulics pushed him off his lines and into the hidden space. After he was reported missing, search teams used a drone to locate him behind the cascade of water. He was found conscious and suffering only from dehydration and minor injuries, marking what the local sheriff's office called a "stunning survival story."</p>

          <p>As the cost of higher education approaches $100,000 per year at some elite institutions, a small number of U.S. colleges offer a completely tuition-free experience for all admitted students. These nine schools, which include Berea College, College of the Ozarks, and all five U.S. military service academies, typically have rigorous academic standards and unique requirements. In exchange for free tuition, students may participate in mandatory work programs or commit to several years of military service after graduation. While highly selective, these institutions provide a viable path to a debt-free degree for students willing to meet their demanding criteria.</p>

          <p>Within just three years of ChatGPT's launch, generative AI has become a ubiquitous and transformative tool on college campuses, fundamentally altering the student experience. For the current graduating class, AI has been a constant presence, used for everything from summarizing readings to completing assignments, driven by academic pressure and the desire for efficiency. While many professors seem unaware of the extent of its integration, some are adapting by reverting to in-class, handwritten assignments, though students desire more innovative, real-world-oriented learning. This rapid technological shift presents a profound challenge to traditional higher education, forcing both students and faculty to redefine the nature of learning and academic integrity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its oversight of university admissions by requiring all federally funded institutions to submit detailed applicant data. This move aims to enforce the 2023 Supreme Court ruling that ended race-based affirmative action, with the administration suspecting that universities are using 'racial proxies' to maintain diversity. Amid this scrutiny, the concept of class-based affirmative action, which gives a leg up to economically disadvantaged students of all races, is gaining traction as a legal alternative. However, some fear the administration may also target these class-based systems if they result in increased racial diversity, potentially creating a political challenge for a party whose base includes many working-class families.</p>
