          <p>Haas F1 team is requesting a review of the FIA's decision to disallow Oliver Bearman's final qualifying lap at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, which was deleted due to a red flag caused by Franco Colapinto's crash. Haas believes Bearman completed the lap before the red flag was indicated, and are seeking an explanation and strategy to prevent similar incidents in the future. Despite television footage and live-timing data suggesting Bearman crossed the line before the red flag, the FIA stood by its original decision, citing that orange 'abort lap' lights were activated. Bearman expressed his frustration, deeming the decision unfair and claiming the red light on his dash appeared after he crossed the line.</p>

          <p>Atmos Space Cargo, a European startup, has successfully completed the first orbital test flight of its Phoenix 1 re-entry space capsule, marking a significant milestone in European space logistics. Launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the mission demonstrated Europe's capability to develop and operate advanced return technology. The Phoenix 1 completed one full trip around Earth before a timed de-orbit maneuver sent it back, deploying an inflatable heat shield during reentry and transmitting data to ground stations. This achievement positions Atmos as a key player in the space return market, opening doors for increased collaboration and competition in commercial space logistics.</p>

          <p>Surgeons at UCLA and USC have successfully performed the first human bladder transplant, offering a potentially life-changing procedure for patients with debilitating bladder conditions. The recipient, a 41-year-old man who had lost bladder capacity due to cancer treatments, is showing positive results. The surgeons plan to conduct four more bladder transplants as part of a clinical trial, assessing outcomes such as bladder capacity and graft complications. This innovative surgery could provide a new option for thousands suffering from chronic pelvic pain, inflammation, and recurrent infections, potentially avoiding complications associated with traditional bladder reconstruction using bowel tissue.</p>

This ongoing tension diverts India's resources and attention from its aspirations as a diplomatic and economic power, especially as it competes with China.

          <p>Malcolm X, born 100 years ago, remains an influential figure in the Black civil rights movement, advocating for self-confidence and resistance against oppression 'by any means necessary.' His message resonated deeply with African Americans facing discrimination, challenging the 'American dream' and exposing the 'American nightmare' of racism. After joining the Nation of Islam, he denounced 'white devils' before later evolving his views following a pilgrimage to Mecca, seeking an alliance of oppressed people of color. His assassination in 1965 did not diminish his impact, as his legacy has been renewed through hip-hop and Spike Lee's film, continuing to inspire critical reflection on racism and social justice.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that modifying brick stacking techniques in Bangladesh could significantly reduce air pollution. The study found that implementing a zig-zag pattern for improved airflow and ensuring consistent coal delivery can lower fuel use by 23% and reduce carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions by 20%. The changes also improve worker conditions and boost profits for kiln owners, with savings of nearly $40,000 per season. The research team is now collaborating with the Bangladeshi government to expand training and promote the adoption of these low-cost interventions.</p>

The poll revealed that 55.1 percent of respondents disapprove of the Cabinet, with a significant majority supporting consumption tax cuts to address the cost-of-living crisis. However, a similar percentage expressed concern about potential declines in social security services if the consumption tax is reduced. The survey also indicated widespread skepticism regarding favorable outcomes from ongoing Japan-U.S. tariff negotiations.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, known for avoiding market trends, has his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio significantly invested in three companies leveraging artificial intelligence (AI). Amazon utilizes AI in its e-commerce platform and AWS cloud services, Coca-Cola employs AI for marketing and product development, and Apple integrates AI into its devices and operating systems. While Buffett may be stepping down as CEO, his investment strategy focusing on long-term value and strong management teams is expected to continue. These investments highlight the potential of AI to enhance established businesses, rather than being a trend to chase. (not investment advice)</p>

Sergei Loznitsa's 'Two Prosecutors' portrays the disillusionment of the Stalin era, and Oliver Laxe's 'Sirât' depicts a fractured family amidst a raver apocalypse.

          <p>A new internal survey by the Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences claims that less than 1% of German soldiers harbor consistent right-wing extremist attitudes. While the study offers some relief, it also reveals problematic chauvinist and xenophobic views among soldiers, and some experts remain skeptical about the safeguards in place. Concerns persist regarding the normalization of right-wing attitudes in wider society and the potential difficulty of maintaining rigorous checks during increased recruitment efforts. Despite anti-extremism measures, critics argue that the Bundeswehr needs to do more to address the complexity of modern right-wing mindsets.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly utilizing public-private partnerships (PPPs) to fund infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans through the Belt and Road Initiative. This model grants Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing. Kenya's Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) extension and Zambia's Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway are examples of this financing shift, where Chinese companies are expected to recoup their investments through toll fees and exclusive operating rights.

          <p>Romania's presidential election, held in May, was marred by a far-right candidate, Sławomir Mentzen, campaigning on anti-immigration, anti-EU rhetoric. The previous election was annulled due to irregularities in financing and organization. Alleged electoral violations included the activation of thousands of previously inactive social media accounts to spread pro-Georgescu messaging as part of an "aggressive Russian hybrid attack," which Moscow denies. The rerun was closely watched as a test of anti-immigration sentiment in Europe.</p>
