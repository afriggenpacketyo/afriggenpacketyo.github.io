          <p>A DeKalb County police officer was killed following a shooting incident near the campuses of the CDC and Emory University in Atlanta. The suspect, who had fired multiple rounds at the CDC building, was later found deceased from what may have been a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The fallen officer, David Rose, was responding to the initial reports of gunfire when he was fatally shot, leaving behind a pregnant wife and two children. No civilians were physically injured during the event, though a daycare on the CDC campus was locked down and several people were treated for stress-related issues.</p>

Before his agency leadership, Webster was a U.S. Navy lieutenant in two wars, a federal judge, and a U.S. Attorney.

          <p>The UK government has reformed its civil service summer internship program, now restricting applications to individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy aims to make the civil service more representative of society, but it has created a division among students. Some, like a student from Newark, feel the change gives them a fair chance against more privileged applicants. Others, like the daughter of a nurse and a town planner, feel unfairly excluded despite considering themselves working-class, arguing the new criteria are too narrow and discouraging.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have successfully synthesized high-purity hexagonal diamonds, a rare structure first discovered in a meteorite in 1967. This variant, known as lonsdaleite, is believed to form under the extreme heat and pressure of meteorite impacts and has a different atomic arrangement than common cubic diamonds. The research team produced crystals up to 100 micrometres in size, a significant achievement that provides definitive proof of the material's existence on a macroscopic scale. This breakthrough could pave the way for new applications leveraging the unique properties of hexagonal diamonds.</p>

          <p>China's consumer price index (CPI) showed no year-on-year change in July, while producer prices continued to decline, indicating ongoing weakness in domestic demand. This flat reading slightly exceeded market expectations of a minor decline and followed a 0.1% rise in June. Statisticians noted that policies aimed at expanding domestic demand contributed to a month-on-month CPI increase of 0.4%. While service prices and some goods saw increases, food prices fell by 1.6%, highlighting the mixed and fragile nature of the economic environment amid trade uncertainties.

Mayor Shiro Suzuki spoke of an "existential crisis" driven by a "vicious cycle of confrontation and fragmentation." Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reiterated Japan's commitment to its three non-nuclear principles but did not comment on the country's refusal to sign the UN's nuclear weapon prohibition treaty. For the first time since 1945, twin bells from the Urakami Cathedral, one of which was recently restored, rang together to commemorate the tragic event.</p>

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is on the rise, as people spend on small, affordable luxuries and larger, memorable experiences to boost morale during uncertain economic times. This phenomenon expands on the classic "lipstick effect," where consumers buy small treats when they cannot afford major purchases. Analysts note that in the current climate, consumers may cut back on daily expenses but will splurge on items like concert tickets or collectibles for a sense of joy and enrichment. This shift is partly driven by changing life milestones, with many people celebrating smaller "inch-stones" rather than traditional achievements like home ownership.</p>

          <p>A Bay Area man has been charged with stealing rare Chinese manuscripts, valued at over $216,000, from the UCLA library in a sophisticated scheme. The suspect, Jeffrey Ying, allegedly used fake aliases and a flawed library system to check out valuable antique books, some dating to the 13th century. He would then reportedly replace the authentic manuscripts with low-value "dummy books" before leaving with the originals. An FBI investigation uncovered the alleged scheme, and Ying was arrested before a planned attempt to fly to China, where authorities suspect he may have been selling the stolen items.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano and Disney have settled the lawsuit she filed after being fired from the show "The Mandalorian" in 2021 over her controversial social media posts. This article argues the settlement was the right decision, characterizing her firing as an overreaction to posts that were ignorant rather than malicious. It notes that while social media outrage led to her termination, the company's decision to settle, and even express hope for future collaboration, represents a reasonable resolution. The author suggests the initial firing, not the settlement, was the real capitulation to pressure.</p>

          <p>The political standoff over Texas redistricting has intensified, with fleeing Democratic lawmakers gaining vocal support from California leaders. Governor Gavin Newsom hosted a delegation of the Texas Democrats, vowing to counter the GOP's efforts by potentially redrawing California's own congressional map to favor Democrats. Meanwhile, in Texas, Republicans are escalating pressure with legal and financial threats, including a lawsuit from the Attorney General to vacate the seats of 13 absent lawmakers. The Democrats, who have faced bomb threats and financial penalties, remain defiant in their effort to block the redistricting.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Krinsky, a market technician at BTIG, has warned that the stock market is showing signs of a potential 5% pullback. He argues the S&P 500 has broken a key technical level and is likely to retest the 6,100 support level, which could provide a buying opportunity. Krinsky points to several factors, including weakness in consumer discretionary stocks, the historical underperformance of semiconductors in late summer, and the risk of widening credit spreads. He also notes that even after strong earnings reports from tech giants, investor enthusiasm has been muted, suggesting profit-taking may be on the horizon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have suffered a major blow with offensive tackle Rashawn Slater rupturing his patellar tendon, an injury that will require season-ending surgery. Coach Jim Harbaugh described the loss of the cornerstone lineman as a "gut punch" that takes the wind out of the team. Slater's absence forces a reshuffle of the offensive line, with Joe Alt moving to left tackle and Trey Pipkins III likely stepping into the right tackle spot. The team is now exploring the free-agent market to add depth to the position following the significant setback.</p>

          <p>The Ford Transit, one of the world's most recognizable commercial vehicles, is celebrating its 60th anniversary since first rolling off the production line in 1965. Originally a collaboration between Ford's UK and German engineers, its versatility, space, and comfort made it a revolutionary vehicle for tradespeople and even rock bands. Despite production moving from the UK to Turkey in 2013, the van's design and engineering heritage remains rooted in Britain. As the brand faces a competitive modern market, Ford is now focusing on electric and software-defined versions to continue the Transit's legacy.</p>

          <p>The UK's advertising watchdog has seen a notable increase in complaints about models appearing "unhealthily thin" in high-street fashion ads, leading to warnings of a return to the "super skinny" trend. Adverts from major retailers like Zara, Next, and M&S have been banned recently, not because the models were deemed unhealthy, but because styling and poses made them appear so. Activists and industry experts express concern that this signals a resurgence of the harmful "heroin chic" aesthetic of the 1990s, pushing back against the body positivity movement and potentially harming public health.</p>

Trump indicated that a deal is getting closer and would involve a "swapping of territories to the betterment of both." This development follows reports that Putin is willing to consider a ceasefire if Ukrainian forces withdraw from the Donbass region, a condition Kyiv has consistently rejected. The proposed summit has been described as a diplomatic victory for Moscow by some European observers, who worry about decisions being made without Ukraine's direct involvement.</p>
