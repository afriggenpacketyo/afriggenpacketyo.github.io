          <p>Alaska Airlines experienced a nationwide IT outage on Thursday evening, leading to a temporary ground stop that stranded thousands of passengers. The airline announced the disruption on social media, advising travelers to check their flight status due to numerous delays and cancellations, including 82 delays and 17 cancellations at its Seattle-Tacoma hub. This incident marks the second time in recent months that Alaska Airlines has faced significant operational issues due to IT problems, following a similar three-hour grounding in July. The airline confirmed it is actively working to restore full operations and address the technical difficulties, which also affected its website and mobile app, causing widespread inconvenience for customers.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for New York Attorney General Letitia James have sharply criticized interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, accusing her of an "unusual and improper" conversation with a journalist regarding James's bank fraud case. James's legal team plans to file a motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing Halligan's appointment was unlawful, a challenge also raised in former FBI Director James Comey's case. Halligan allegedly sent unsolicited messages to a Lawfare editor, criticizing coverage and potentially violating court rules and Justice Department policies against disclosing grand jury information. James maintains her innocence, asserting the charges are politically motivated retribution after her successful civil suit against former President Trump.</p>

          <p>The FBI has launched an investigation after a driver allegedly rammed an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) vehicle during an attempted traffic stop in Avondale, Arizona, on Thursday morning. Authorities state the suspect initially fled the scene but later returned to a residence, where they intentionally collided with the ICE vehicle occupied by two officers. While officials have not yet disclosed the driver's identity, whether arrests have been made, or if any injuries were reported, the FBI will refer its findings to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for a charging decision. This incident follows a similar ramming event in San Diego involving federal officers and an individual allegedly in the country illegally.</p>

          <p>A sweeping federal investigation has led to the nationwide arrest of dozens of individuals, including current NBA player Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, in connection with illegal sports betting and organized crime. The FBI and federal prosecutors announced charges related to two distinct cases: one involving a sports betting ring where players allegedly faked injuries to influence betting odds, and another concerning high-stakes poker games operated by organized crime families. Charges include wire fraud, money laundering, and extortion, with authorities emphasizing the involvement of prominent crime syndicates. The NBA has placed Rozier and Billups on leave, cooperating fully with the ongoing federal inquiry.</p>

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey has issued a stark warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin, declaring, "We're hunting your submarines," amidst a 30% increase in Russian naval activity near British waters. This heightened presence in the North Atlantic, now mirroring Cold War levels, is attributed to growing Russian aggression across Europe. The Royal Air Force and Royal Navy have intensified their surveillance, utilizing advanced P-8 maritime patrol aircraft equipped with sophisticated cameras and sonar to track both surface vessels and submarines. Germany, deepening its defense cooperation with the UK, is also acquiring P-8 aircraft to bolster joint efforts against Russia's hybrid warfare threats, including potential attacks on critical undersea infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Several U.S. states, including Texas, California, Missouri, North Carolina, and Utah, are engaging in rare mid-decade redistricting efforts that could significantly reshape congressional representation. This push, initiated by Republicans aiming to maintain or expand their narrow House majority, involves redrawing district maps to create more favorable electoral outcomes, often sparking legal challenges over alleged gerrymandering. While Texas Republicans have created new GOP-friendly seats, California Democrats are also working to redraw maps to counter these gains. Experts caution that despite technological predictions, the political environment is volatile, making outcomes uncertain as new candidates and districts emerge, and civil rights groups file lawsuits challenging these maps.</p>

The fire, which tragically killed 12 people and destroyed over 6,800 structures, is believed to have originated from a smaller blaze Rinderknecht allegedly started on January 1, which then reignited and spread. Investigators presented compelling evidence, including 911 calls, geolocation data from Rinderknecht’s phone placing him at the fire's origin, and his ChatGPT logs containing questions about arson and AI-generated images of burned cities. His defense attorney, however, questioned the fire department's failure to fully suppress the initial Lachman fire.</p>

Court records, including security footage, showed guards pepper-spraying Moore multiple times and his head striking the ground during an altercation. Moore, a 57-year-old with no criminal history and "mentally unwell" at the time, was left without medical attention for nearly two hours after the incident.</p>

This case exposes significant systemic flaws, including the lack of restrictions on fraudsters changing names and the absence of mandatory licensing for builders in the UK.

Textile exports plummeted nearly 10% year-on-year in September, leaving manufacturers with unsold inventory and idle machines. The industry is desperately hoping for a trade deal to reduce tariffs, as current levels are deemed catastrophic.

          <p>Anthony Boyd, convicted of a 1993 murder, was executed by nitrogen gas in Alabama, marking the eighth use of this controversial method in the U.S. Boyd maintained his innocence in his final words. The U.S. Supreme Court denied a stay of execution, prompting a scathing dissent from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who cited "mounting and unbroken evidence" that nitrogen hypoxia constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Witness accounts from previous nitrogen executions in Alabama and Louisiana described inmates writhing and convulsing for extended periods, raising profound ethical and human rights concerns about the method's potential for inflicting extreme pain and terror of suffocation while still conscious.</p>

Key member states, including Belgium, expressed a need for more reassurances regarding the legal and financial risks involved.

The scheme enlisted "face cards," including NBA coach Chauncey Billups and former player Damon Jones, to lure "unwitting victims" into illegal, high-stakes games across multiple U.S. cities.
