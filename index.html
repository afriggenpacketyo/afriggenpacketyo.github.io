        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that China's economic problem of "involution," characterized by intense internal competition for diminishing returns, is driven by issues on both the supply and demand sides. The author contends that while authorities are trying to curb overproduction, the root cause is a lack of viable alternative investment opportunities for local governments and enterprises. This self-defeating rat race, where profit margins approach zero, stifles new investment and signals deeper structural problems within the Chinese economy that need to be addressed beyond simply managing supply.</p>

Trump stated that after this bilateral meeting, he would join for trilateral talks, framing it as a significant step toward peace. This development came after Trump reversed his previous stance, suggesting that a ceasefire is not a necessary precondition for a peace deal, a position that contrasts with the views of European allies who are pushing for an immediate halt to the fighting.</p>

The first victim, a 79-year-old man, reportedly lost consciousness while snorkeling, while the second, a 74-year-old woman, lost consciousness while swimming in a pool a few hours later. Lifeguards responded to both emergencies and attempted CPR, but both individuals were pronounced dead. The Royal Bahamas Police Force is investigating the circumstances surrounding each death.</p>

The decisive moment came late in the game when Lukas Nmecha converted a controversial penalty, awarded for a handball by Everton's James Tarkowski. Despite dominating the first half, Leeds struggled to score from open play but ultimately secured the win through defensive resilience and the late spot-kick. The victory provides a crucial and optimistic start to their campaign to remain in the top flight.</p>

          <p>In response to Republican-led redistricting efforts in states like Texas, California Democrats have initiated a plan to redraw their own state's congressional districts. The proposed ballot measure, if approved by voters in a special election, would create new maps for the 2026, 2028, and 2030 elections, aiming to increase the number of Democratic lawmakers in Congress. Proponents argue this is a necessary countermeasure to protect democracy from what they call attempts by former President Trump to "rig" the midterms, while Republicans accuse them of a partisan power grab.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Atlantic examines the escalating federal and military presence in Washington, D.C., a week after former President Trump initiated a "federal takeover" of the city. The author notes the deployment of National Guard troops from other states and the lack of a clear, achievable mission for the operation, which was ostensibly to "liberate" D.C. from crime. The article raises concerns that this action, with no defined endpoint, could be an improvisational power grab to intimidate residents and potentially serve as a precedent for similar interventions in other Democrat-run cities.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from Bankrate indicates that despite wage increases, the average American worker's pay has lagged behind the rise in the cost of living by 1.2 percentage points over the last four years. This purchasing power gap helps explain persistent public dissatisfaction with the economy, as many households feel their income is not keeping up with higher prices. The study found that some professions, particularly in education, have fallen further behind, while jobs in high-demand sectors like leisure and healthcare have seen wage growth outpace inflation.

          <p>City officials in Anaheim, California, have issued a public warning about a recent increase in federal immigration enforcement actions, describing them as the "most significant and disruptive" in weeks. The warning followed several weekend raids, including one at a car wash and another outside a Home Depot, which have heightened fear and uncertainty within the community. Officials condemned the raids, stating they destabilize families and the local economy without improving public safety, and noted that the city has joined a lawsuit challenging the federal government's enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal is said to involve an initial 60-day truce during which Hamas would release about half of the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. In parallel, negotiations for a permanent ceasefire would take place. Israel's response remains uncertain, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously stated that any deal must include the release of all hostages at once, amid intensifying Israeli military operations in Gaza City.</p>

          <p>The organizers of the Polari Prize, an award for LGBTQ+ literature, have canceled this year's event following a controversy surrounding longlisted author John Boyne. Several other nominated authors withdrew from the prize in protest of Boyne's inclusion, citing an article he wrote defending J.K. Rowling's views on trans issues. After a judge also resigned, organizers decided to pause the prize for the year to review their governance and increase representation of trans and non-conforming judges, stating the event had been "overshadowed by hurt and anger."</p>

This charm offensive included personal gestures, such as delivering a letter from his wife to Melania Trump, signaling a deliberate effort to build rapport and navigate the delicate diplomatic relationship more effectively.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction to stop the Federal Trade Commission from investigating the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters for America. The probe was initiated after Media Matters published a report alleging that antisemitic content on the social media platform X appeared alongside major brand advertisements. U.S. District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan ruled that the FTC's investigation was a likely violation of the group's First Amendment rights, stating that it appeared to be a form of government retaliation for constitutionally protected speech.</p>

He stated that an executive order is being drafted to enact these changes, despite legal experts affirming that the U.S. Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to regulate federal elections. This move represents a significant escalation of his challenges to the U.S. electoral system and is expected to face immediate and substantial legal opposition from various states and voting rights groups.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin fell significantly after hitting a new all-time high of over $124,000 last week, dropping to around $115,000. The broader crypto market also saw a downturn, with analysts attributing the slide to profit-taking and renewed macroeconomic concerns following higher-than-expected inflation data. The sell-off triggered over $500 million in forced liquidations of long positions, amplifying the price drop.
