          <p>French authorities are investigating a possible arson attack that caused a significant power outage in southeastern France, disrupting the final day of the Cannes Film Festival. The outage affected approximately 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes area, impacting traffic, businesses, and screenings. Power was restored hours before the closing ceremony, which proceeded as planned due to the Palais des Festivals switching to an independent power supply. Authorities are working to identify and apprehend those responsible for the damage to electrical infrastructures.</p>

          <p>An East African crowned crane named Alice escaped from a Washington state zoo and spent nearly three days on the loose before being safely retrieved.

          <p>Jafar Panahi's film, "It Was Just an Accident", a revenge thriller, won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, marking a significant moment for the Iranian director who had previously been banned from leaving Iran.

          <p>According to Newt Gingrich, Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump successfully passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill" after overcoming numerous challenges and criticisms. Gingrich claims that their collaboration and strategic planning enabled them to achieve this legislative victory, which he believes will be a defining product of Trump's second term. Johnson's ability to unite the GOP caucus and Trump's engagement with various factions were crucial to the bill's passage. Gingrich suggests that Johnson's methodical approach complements Trump's dealmaking style, making them a formidable team in Washington.</p>

          <p>A new food aid system in Gaza, presented as neutral, was conceived and largely developed by Israelis aiming to undermine Hamas's control, according to The New York Times. This initiative involves foreign contractors and newly formed private organizations, displacing experienced aid agencies like the United Nations. The plan, first discussed in late 2023, seeks to distribute aid from Israeli-controlled areas, preventing it from falling into the hands of militants or the black market. U.N. officials warn that the plan could restrict aid to limited parts of Gaza and potentially facilitate displacement of civilians.</p>

          <p>An Israeli strike in Khan Younis, Gaza, killed nine children of a doctor couple, according to Gaza's civil defense agency. The Israeli military stated it struck suspects operating from a structure near its forces and is reviewing the claim of harm to uninvolved civilians. The incident has prompted increased criticism of Israel's military operations, with Germany's antisemitism chief questioning the proportionality of Israel's actions in Gaza. The health authorities in Gaza say nearly 54,000 people have died in the Gaza Strip amid Israeli attacks.</p>
