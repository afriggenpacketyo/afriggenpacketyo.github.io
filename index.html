          <p>Over 90 European companies urged the European Commission to establish a sovereign infrastructure fund to enhance technological independence and counter reliance on non-European technologies.  The letter emphasizes the need for public sector 'Buy European' policies and private sector incentives to foster competition and investment in key sectors like quantum computing and chip manufacturing. This initiative aims to address Europe's lagging position in the digital space and mitigate security risks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Americans generally favor a smaller federal government, public perception of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is mixed.  Polls reveal support for downsizing but opposition to the large-scale job cuts and spending reductions implemented by DOGE.  Musk's personal approval ratings are also low, indicating a disconnect between the desired goal of smaller government and the methods employed by DOGE.</p>

          <p>Retail sales increased by 0.2% in February, a less robust result than anticipated, suggesting a slowdown in consumer spending.  While the control group, a key indicator for GDP, showed a better-than-expected 1% rise, overall sales fell short of forecasts amid economic uncertainty and rising inflation.  This underperformance adds to concerns about potential economic slowdown and the impact of ongoing trade disputes.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump claimed that President Biden's pardons were invalid due to the use of an autopen, a claim unsupported by evidence and contradicted by legal precedent.  Trump's assertion followed a report by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.  The claim centers on the pardons issued to members of the January 6th committee and others.</p>
