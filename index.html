          <p>President Trump held a two-hour phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the war in Ukraine, expressing optimism that negotiations toward a ceasefire would begin immediately. Trump also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who emphasized the need for stronger sanctions against Russia if it doesn't cease hostilities. Pope Leo XIV has reportedly expressed interest in hosting the negotiations. Trump indicated that Russia is interested in large-scale trade with the U.S. once the conflict ends, while Zelenskyy urged the U.S. not to distance itself from peace talks, underscoring the importance of U.S. involvement to prevent Putin from benefiting from a weakened alliance.</p>

          <p>The market for Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) is experiencing a resurgence, driven by President Trump's associates and crypto entrepreneurs. Key executives from Trump Media & Technology Group are involved in pitching SPAC deals targeting cryptocurrency and blockchain companies. These investment vehicles allow companies to raise money without a clear business plan, acquiring a business within two years or returning the funds. The stock market's upswing, demand for crypto, and small investors seeking quick gains contribute to the renewed interest. Cantor Fitzgerald, led by Brandon Lutnick, is a prominent player in this market, having taken multiple SPACs public this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A viral TikTok trend suggests that a combination of Coca-Cola and large fries from McDonald's, dubbed the 'McMigraine,' can alleviate migraine symptoms. Dr. Brintha Vasagar explains that the caffeine and carbonation in Coca-Cola can constrict blood vessels and settle the stomach, while the sodium and carbohydrates in fries can correct electrolyte balance, dehydration, and settle the stomach. The article notes that the psychological benefit of comfort food may also contribute to the perceived relief.

He has since repaid the money and surrendered his peace officer certification, leading to the dismissal of felony charges against him.

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for approximately 350,000 Venezuelan migrants while legal proceedings continue. This decision lifts a lower court's injunction that had blocked the termination of TPS, potentially leading to the loss of work permits and deportation protections for Venezuelans. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented. The Trump administration argued that continuing the program was contrary to the national interest, while TPS beneficiaries claimed that ending the protections would cause significant harm and force them to return to a dangerous country.</p>

          <p>Moody's recent downgrade of the United States' credit rating, citing congressional gridlock and the potential enactment of a Republican fiscal plan, has bolstered fiscally conservative Republicans who oppose increasing the federal debt. These lawmakers are demanding deeper cuts to federal programs before supporting the tax and spending cut package, which is projected to add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. Representative Thomas Massie used the downgrade to argue that the bill would make bond buyers realize the U.S. is not fiscally responsible.

The inmates, facing charges including murder and armed robbery, escaped through a hole in a cell wall, leaving behind a taunting message. The jail, under a federal consent decree since 2013, has a history of overcrowding, understaffing, and lax oversight. Governor Jeff Landry has demanded answers and attributed the escape to broader failings of the criminal justice system. The escape has heightened security concerns in the city and prompted calls for residents to remain vigilant.</p>

          <p>The Who has once again parted ways with drummer Zak Starkey, with the band citing the need for a change and Starkey pursuing new projects. Starkey, however, disputes the band's announcement, claiming he was asked to falsely state that he was leaving to pursue other endeavors. He emphasized his love for The Who and his commitment to the band, noting that his other musical commitments have never interfered with his duties. The band cited their upcoming retirement and Starkey's need to focus on his own projects as reasons for the split.</p>

Users find AI therapists helpful for coping strategies and constant availability, particularly when facing long wait times for traditional therapy. However, experts warn of potential biases, lack of safeguarding, and data security risks associated with AI-driven mental health support. The technology is not meant to replace human therapists, but it could serve as a stopgap for those on long waitlists. While some have had positive experiences, the long-term effectiveness and ethical implications remain under scrutiny.</p>

Third, China is focusing on domestic demand and trade diversification to mitigate the impact of tariffs. These policies aim to stabilize growth and reduce vulnerability to external pressures.</p>
