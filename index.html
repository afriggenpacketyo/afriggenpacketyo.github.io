          <p>During a House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee hearing, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the deployment of National Guard personnel and Marines to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. Representative Betty McCollum questioned the training of Marines for domestic missions, but Hegseth insisted that all units on the ground were fully trained. General Eric Smith, Commandant of the Marine Corps, stated that the Marines sent to Los Angeles were trained in crowd control and would support law enforcement in protecting federal property, while Senator Richard Blumenthal expressed concerns about the use of combat-trained units domestically. Hegseth maintained that ICE should be able to conduct operations in any state and jurisdiction, comparing the situation to the 2020 George Floyd protests, emphasizing the need to enforce immigration law. The article outlines the administration's justification for the deployment amidst growing tensions. </p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a Â£14.2 billion investment in the Sizewell C nuclear project, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasizing the project's role in creating 10,000 jobs and ensuring energy security for the country. The project aims to reduce reliance on foreign energy sources, particularly in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has driven up global gas and oil prices. However, the project faces opposition due to potential costs and environmental impacts, with completion expected in the mid-2030s. The government hopes the investment will attract further private funding, essential for the project to proceed, as part of a broader strategy to stimulate economic growth and tackle climate change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump federalized the California National Guard without Governor Gavin Newsom's request, marking an unprecedented move in response to protests against ICE raids in Los Angeles. This decision, exercising Title 10 authority, bypassed the governor's authority over his own Guard. Historically, National Guard deployments during urban unrest or natural disasters have occurred at the request of the state's governor, highlighting the unusual nature of Trump's action. The deployment has raised concerns about the appropriateness of using the military to quell protests and the potential for escalating tensions. </p>

          <p>A relationship expert suggests couples can improve their relationships by creating a "relationship bank account," where they make "deposits" through actions that prioritize their partner's happiness. This involves identifying what makes each partner feel loved and appreciated, and then consistently acting on those insights. A positive balance in the account reflects a sense of security and allows couples to handle disagreements more effectively, while a negative balance can lead to escalating conflicts. The goal is to make more deposits than withdrawals, leading to less intense and frequent arguments, fostering a healthier and more enjoyable relationship. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles is preparing for a fifth day of protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, with the U.S. military activating approximately 700 active-duty Marines to support the National Guard. Tensions escalated as protesters blocked freeways and set self-driving cars on fire, leading to the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by law enforcement. California has sued the Trump administration over the deployment of the National Guard without consulting Governor Newsom, who called the move "illegal and immoral." The LAPD is facing criticism for its response to the unrest, with Chief Jim McDonnell emphasizing the department's compliance with California's sanctuary city ordinance. </p>

          <p>UK companies are holding back on hiring, leading to a decrease in job vacancies, according to official figures. The number of available jobs fell by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, the highest in almost four years. This trend is attributed to factors such as increased National Insurance contributions paid by employers and a rise in the minimum wage. Economists predict that businesses will continue to reduce headcount and slow hiring activity, potentially causing the unemployment rate to increase further in the coming year. </p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials are continuing trade talks in London for a second day, seeking to address ongoing tensions and potentially de-escalate the trade war between the two countries. Discussions are focusing on issues such as Chinese exports of rare earth minerals, U.S. access to high-end technology, and China's commitment to purchasing more American goods. Relations between the two countries have deteriorated since a tentative truce in Geneva, with both sides accusing the other of violating agreements. Analysts remain cautious about the prospects for significant progress, given the deep-seated disagreements on technology and trade practices. </p>
