          <p>Investors are showing a preference for short-term Treasury investments due to current economic uncertainties and market volatility. The 3-month T-Bill is yielding over 4.3% annually, which is attracting investors to the ultrashort end of the market. ETF flows this year indicate that the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL) are among the top ETFs, accumulating over $25 billion in assets. Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, has also increased its ownership of T-bills, now holding 5% of all short-term Treasuries, aligning with the trend of favoring shorter durations.

          <p>An Israeli attack near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip has reportedly killed over 30 Palestinians and wounded many more, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Witnesses claim Israeli forces fired upon crowds awaiting food, while the Israeli military denies targeting civilians near the site, citing an initial inquiry. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) asserts it delivered aid without incident and dismisses reports of chaos, although previous GHF distributions have been marred by violence. This incident occurs as ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas falter, with both sides trading blame for the lack of progress.</p>

          <p>Ukraine launched a large-scale drone attack deep into Russian territory, allegedly destroying 40 military bombers, as talks to explore a ceasefire are set to resume in Istanbul. A Ukrainian security official claimed the operation took over a year and a half to execute and was personally supervised by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The White House was reportedly unaware of the attack, which comes as Kyiv announced a Russian military strike killed at least 12 soldiers at an army training site. Explosions also caused two bridges to collapse and derailed two trains in western Russia overnight.</p>
