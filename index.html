          <p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has elected Sanae Takaichi, a conservative former Economic Security Minister, as its new leader. This decision positions the 64-year-old to become the country's first female prime minister, a significant development in a nation with low gender equality rankings. Takaichi, a protege of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, aims to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance and address domestic challenges like rising prices. Her leadership is seen by the party as a way to regain public trust following recent election losses.</p>

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, was diagnosed with the disease after persistently requesting early screening. Despite having no symptoms, a breast MRI revealed two suspicious masses, leading to a diagnosis of early-stage invasive ductal carcinoma. Her oncologist credits her self-advocacy for the early detection, which significantly improves the prognosis, as the five-year survival rate is 99% for this stage. The case highlights the importance of individuals, especially those with higher risk factors, proactively managing their health and discussing screening options with doctors.</p>

          <p>A public dispute between a celebrity influencer and a major restaurant chain in China has ignited a nationwide debate over the use of pre-made and frozen ingredients in the catering industry. The controversy began when influencer Luo Yonghao criticized the Xibei chain for serving what he called "disgusting" pre-made food at high prices, sparking widespread consumer scrutiny. This debate comes as China's restaurant sector faces slowing growth, adding pressure on establishments that rely on cost-saving measures.

          <p>The late conservationist Jane Goodall, who died at 91, adopted a plant-based diet over 50 years ago, a decision central to her ethical and environmental activism. She famously stopped eating meat after seeing a pork chop on her plate and connecting it to the fear and death of an animal. Goodall cited the cruelty of factory farming and the significant environmental damage caused by meat production as her primary motivations. She also noted feeling physically better after the change, a sentiment supported by research linking red meat consumption to higher risks of cardiovascular disease and cancer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long-held belief that prestige is the most valuable asset of elite universities like Harvard and Yale is being challenged by shifting market forces and parental priorities. With soaring tuition costs and a difficult job market, families are increasingly prioritizing practical outcomes such as career placement and internship opportunities over brand recognition. This trend has allowed regional schools like NYU and Northeastern to rise in prominence by focusing on tangible benefits like co-op programs. As families become more cost-conscious and outcome-oriented, the traditional hierarchy of higher education may be facing a significant transformation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has offered federal funds to nine elite universities, including MIT and Dartmouth, in exchange for signing a "Compact for Academic Excellence" that would enforce a MAGA-aligned agenda. The nine-page document demands significant control over university policies on admissions, hiring, free speech, and curriculum, threatening the loss of federal benefits for non-compliance. Critics describe the proposal as an unconstitutional power grab and a form of mafia-style protection racket, aiming to bring higher education under ideological dominance.

An iconic moment of trust, when a chimp she named David Greybeard gently took her hand, symbolized a connection that transcended species.

This policy shift, announced on the eve of the party conference, is seen as a response to pressure from the right-wing Reform UK party.

In contrast, they argue that Chinese speculative fiction can offer alternative visions of the future.

          <p>The fashion industry is increasingly turning to artificial intelligence to predict future trends by mining vast amounts of data from social media, runway shows, and consumer behavior. Companies like Heuritech use AI algorithms to detect early signals of emerging styles, such as the recent rise of dotted prints and the color yellow, months before they hit the mainstream market. While AI can efficiently process data and generate visualizations, industry experts emphasize that human expertise remains essential. Forecasters must interpret the data to distinguish between fleeting online entertainment and genuine commercial viability.</p>

          <p>British police have arrested six individuals on suspicion of terrorism offenses in connection with a deadly attack on a synagogue in Manchester. The attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, was shot dead by police after killing two congregation members, Melvin Cravitz and Adrian Daulby, during Yom Kippur services. Authorities are investigating whether Al-Shamie, who was out on bail for an alleged sexual assault, acted alone and may have been influenced by extremist ideology. The attack has heightened concerns about rising antisemitism in the U.K., which has increased sharply since the start of the war in Gaza.</p>

Analysts at Standard Chartered noted that Bitcoin has been trading in response to "US government risks" this year. The bank anticipates the cryptocurrency will soon set a new record high and potentially reach $135,000. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As voting concludes in the Czech Republic's parliamentary election, opinion polls indicate a likely victory for the right-wing populist ANO party, led by former Prime Minister Andrej Babis. Babis, a self-described "Trumpist," has campaigned on a "Czech first" platform and opposes continued military aid to Ukraine, a position that could shift the country's foreign policy. A win for ANO could align the Czech Republic more closely with Hungary and Slovakia in challenging EU policies, particularly regarding support for Kyiv.

          <p>Chinese director Lou Ye's new film, "An Unfinished Film," has garnered international acclaim for its portrayal of a film crew quarantined near Wuhan during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. While censored in China, the movie is praised for its courage in honestly depicting the confusion and confinement of the early lockdown. However, this article argues the film remains incomplete, as it acknowledges the subsequent anti-lockdown protests but conspicuously omits the tsunami of infections and deaths that followed the abrupt end of "zero-COVID" policies. The film reflects a broader societal reticence to confront the full, unprocessed trauma of the pandemic's final chapter.</p>

          <p>Rail operator Great Western Railway (GWR) has been fined £1 million for health and safety breaches that led to the death of Bethan Roper, 28, in 2018.

The Office of Rail and Road prosecuted GWR for failing to act on a risk assessment conducted two months prior that had identified these windows as a significant danger.

          <p>Analysis of the first-ever rock samples returned from the far side of the moon by China's Chang'e-6 mission suggests a significant thermal difference between the moon's two hemispheres. A team of scientists from China and Britain found that minerals from the far side likely formed in lava that was about 100 degrees Celsius cooler than the lava on the near side. This discovery provides new insights into the moon's long-standing asymmetry in topography and volcanic activity.

In a farewell note, Ben’Ary stated his termination appeared to be based on a single false post that linked him to a former Biden administration official involved in investigating Donald Trump. He expressed alarm that leadership was more concerned with punishing perceived political enemies than protecting national security. At the time of his firing, Ben’Ary was leading the prosecution of a suspect in the 2021 Kabul airport bombing.</p>

          <p>The composition and tone of the White House press corps have significantly changed during Donald Trump's second term, with an influx of reporters from MAGA-aligned media outlets. These reporters often ask fawning, softball questions that allow the president to avoid accountability and promote his own narrative. The administration has facilitated this shift by controlling which reporters are in the press pool for Oval Office sessions, often excluding wire services in favor of supportive voices. This infiltration by sycophantic questioners blunts the efforts of traditional journalists and emulates tactics used by authoritarian leaders to suppress a free press.</p>

The column argues that objecting to a Spanish-language performance ignores America's multilingual history and the global nature of modern culture.
