        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the American food supply by the end of next year. The FDA aims to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and collaborate with the food industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic dyes used in various products. Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary cited studies linking petroleum-based synthetic dyes to health conditions, including ADHD, obesity, and cancer. The FDA is also taking steps to authorize four new natural color additives, pushing the food industry to transition to natural alternatives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Six leading U.S. automotive industry groups are jointly lobbying the Trump administration to reconsider the planned 25% tariffs on auto parts, set to take effect by May 3. The groups, representing automakers, suppliers, and dealers, warn that the tariffs could severely disrupt U.S. automotive production. They argue that many auto suppliers are already struggling financially and would be unable to absorb the additional costs, potentially leading to production stoppages, layoffs, and bankruptcies. The unified message underscores the industry's deep concern about the potential economic fallout from the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while American society faces serious imbalances, US President Donald Trump can draw inspiration from China's efforts to restore harmony after decades of economic growth. The author suggests that Trump's immediate priority should be to stabilize America, but his approach has been polarizing. The "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) vision resonated with working-class voters but alienated university-educated voters concerned about rights and freedoms.</p>
