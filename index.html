        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that parents in Europe generally find more meaning in life compared to those without children, but they experience lower life satisfaction. This disparity is particularly pronounced for mothers and varies significantly across countries, with Scandinavian countries showing less difference between parents and non-parents due to supportive family policies. Factors such as childcare availability, financial support, and gender equality play crucial roles in influencing parental satisfaction. The study emphasizes the importance of societal support for parents, viewing children as a community responsibility rather than solely a parental one.</p>

          <p>Turkey is experiencing a significant increase in obesity rates, with experts linking the trend to factors such as poverty, malnutrition, and the consumption of highly processed foods. A substantial portion of children in Turkey primarily consume bread and pasta, contributing to nutritional imbalances and obesity. The Health Ministry has launched a national campaign to combat obesity, but critics argue that it overlooks broader economic struggles and the inaccessibility of healthy foods. Experts advocate for measures such as a nationwide free school meal program and stricter regulation of unhealthy food production.</p>

          <p>The Football Association's ban on transgender women playing in women's football has taken effect, preventing 28 registered transgender women from participating in FA-affiliated leagues.
