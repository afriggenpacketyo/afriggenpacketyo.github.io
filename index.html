          <p>The European Commission's plan to phase out Russian gas, nuclear energy, and LNG imports by 2027 has been met with resistance from some Eastern European nations. Slovakia and Hungary, which maintain close ties with Moscow, have criticized the plan, calling it "economic suicide" and a threat to the region's energy security. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico expressed concerns about the impact on energy prices and accused the EU of building a new Iron Curtain. The EU aims to achieve full energy independence from Russia following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, although some member states remain reliant on Russian energy supplies.</p>

          <h2>British Film Industry Fears Devastation from Potential US Tariffs</h2>

          <p>The British film and TV industry is expressing concerns over President Trump's proposal to impose tariffs on films made in "foreign lands," fearing it could devastate the sector. The industry, still recovering from pandemic shutdowns and Hollywood strikes, relies heavily on American productions. Industry leaders are worried that the tariffs could lead to studios becoming empty again, and they are urging the government to take action. While the British government is engaging in discussions with the U.S. administration, trade experts question the feasibility of enforcing tariffs on increasingly international film productions.</p>

          <p>An ongoing Israeli military operation in the West Bank has displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians, leading to concerns that Israel may be preparing to annex the territory. The operation, targeting Hamas and Islamic Jihad, has resulted in the destruction of homes and infrastructure, particularly in Jenin and Tulkarm. The extended Israeli presence is undermining the Palestinian Authority, and some Palestinians fear a second nakba. While Israel claims the operation is aimed at restoring security, Palestinians worry about the long-term implications and potential annexation.</p>

          <p>An avatar of the late author Agatha Christie is "teaching" an online writing course, raising ethical questions about the use of AI to resurrect deceased figures. The course, offered by BBC Maestro, uses a digital prosthetic built with AI to represent Christie, drawing on her writings and archival interviews. While Christie's family has approved the project and maintains that it uses only her words, some critics argue that it is a deepfake that puts words in her mouth without her consent. The debate highlights broader concerns about the ethics of AI and its potential impact on artistic expression and historical representation.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read trial, a second smartphone forensics expert, Jessica Hyde, testified that Jennifer McCabe's Google search about hypothermia occurred after John O'Keefe's body was discovered, contradicting the defense's claim that it happened beforehand. Hyde stated with scientific certainty that the search took place at 6:24 a.m., not 2:27 a.m. as the defense argued. The testimony supported previous expert testimony and involved technical details about phone data extraction and interpretation. The defense questioned Hyde's methodology and brought up a previous case, but the judge limited the scope of the cross-examination.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are utilizing powerful Earth-based radar, including the worldâ€™s largest radio telescope, to search for water ice at the moonâ€™s south pole. The study estimates that ice makes up no more than 6% of the material within the top 10 meters of lunar soil in the region. The findings could aid in selecting landing sites for future lunar missions and inform the design of a proposed China-led research base on the moon.

          <p>Tarek Bazrouk, 20, has been charged with federal hate crimes for three separate assaults on Jewish protesters in Manhattan. The assaults occurred at demonstrations related to the war in Gaza, where Bazrouk allegedly kicked and punched victims wearing religious attire or carrying Israeli flags. Prosecutors said that Bazrouk demonstrated a pattern of supporting antisemitic terrorist organizations, with a search of his cellphone revealing pro-Hamas propaganda and messages where he identified himself as a "Jew hater". The charges come amid increased scrutiny of pro-Palestinian demonstrations and accusations of antisemitism.</p>
