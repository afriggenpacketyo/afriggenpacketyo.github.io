            <p>John Henry Anderson, a 19th-century Scottish magician, is credited with inspiring Harry Houdini, despite their never having met. Anderson, known as "The Great Wizard of the North," popularized tricks like pulling a rabbit from a hat and achieved global fame. Houdini, deeply influenced by Anderson's reputation, visited and maintained his grave in Aberdeen. The Aberdeen Magical Society is celebrating its upcoming centenary by highlighting Anderson's contributions to the world of magic.</p>

            <p>Alaska's lawmakers are facing challenges in crafting a state budget due to market volatility, influenced by President Trump's tariffs and fluctuating oil prices. The uncertainty has intensified debates over allocating funds between the oil-wealth fund dividend and essential services like education. The state's reliance on oil revenue makes it susceptible to price swings, with each dollar change in oil price affecting state revenue by millions. Some hope Trump's tariffs might encourage countries to invest in Alaska's liquefied natural gas project. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's recent reversal on tariffs has created confusion and uncertainty in the global market, leading economists to question his dealmaking abilities. Despite initial claims that tariffs would boost US manufacturing and tax the world, the administration abruptly paused the measures after facing market turmoil and warnings of widespread disruption. Experts argue that Trump's erratic policymaking and disregard for established norms are creating long-term economic costs. The trade war with China intensifies fears of stagflation, as increased costs and uncertainty impact both consumers and businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A Los Angeles County judge has ruled that the resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez can proceed, despite opposition from the District Attorney's Office. The Menendez brothers, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, have spent over 30 years in prison. Former DA George Gascón had filed a motion to reduce their sentences, but current DA Nathan Hochman sought to withdraw the motion.
