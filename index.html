          <p>Actor and director Ben Stiller's new documentary, "Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost," delves into the complex marriage and comedic partnership of his late parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. The film uses archival footage and newly discovered secret audio recordings made by his father to explore their professional tensions, personal struggles, and the balance between their public personas and private family life. Through this process, Stiller confronts his own experiences as a parent and the challenge of breaking generational patterns, making the film a deeply personal examination of family dynamics.</p>

          <p>Following a recent policy speech by Taiwanese President William Lai, whom Beijing has labeled a "troublemaker," the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has not conducted any major military exercises near the island. According to Taiwan's defense ministry, daily PLA sorties have remained relatively low, numbering between seven and 27 in the week after the address. This level of activity is significantly less intense than previous large-scale drills, such as one in April that involved 76 sorties, which Beijing described at the time as a "serious warning" to pro-independence forces.</p>

          <p>In a "60 Minutes" interview, Jared Kushner, a key negotiator of the recent Israel-Hamas peace deal, stated that the agreement's success hinges on creating a viable governing alternative to Hamas in Gaza. He warned that Hamas will likely use violence to try and reassert control, and that preventing this requires the establishment of the interim governing body outlined in the 20-point plan. Kushner believes that if Israel and its international partners can successfully implement this new governance structure, Hamas will ultimately fail and Gaza will no longer pose a threat.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stood by his characterization of the nationwide "No Kings" anti-Trump protests as "hate America" rallies. In an interview, he clarified that his criticism was aimed at the message of the protesters, which he described as containing violent rhetoric, rather than the individuals themselves. When questioned about linking anarchists and pro-Hamas elements to the modern Democratic Party, Johnson defended his remarks by pointing to what he perceives as a rise of Marxism within the party, citing the political alignment of New York City's mayoral candidate.</p>

          <p>The fragile U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza is under significant strain after Israel's military conducted strikes in southern Gaza, stating its soldiers were attacked with a rocket-propelled grenade and sniper fire. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed the military to take "strong action" against what he called a "bold violation" of the truce. Hamas denied any involvement in clashes in the Rafah area, reaffirming its full commitment to the ceasefire and stating that it had lost contact with its remaining groups in the Israeli-controlled zone, raising fears of a return to wider conflict.</p>

Both were believed to have been killed during the October 7, 2023, attack, with their bodies subsequently taken into Gaza.

These funds would only be released to the federal government once it ceases punitive actions, such as politically motivated funding cuts and military deployments, thereby using fiscal leverage to force a constitutional confrontation over states' rights.</p>

          <h2>Autistic Advocates Criticize Trump Administration's Focus on Unproven Causes of Autism</h2>

          <p>Autistic researchers and advocates are expressing frustration with the Trump administration's focus on investigating unproven links between autism and substances like acetaminophen. They argue that this approach is a misallocation of resources and a distraction from the community's actual needs. Instead of searching for causes, advocates are calling for increased federal funding for support services, research into quality-of-life issues, and the protection of programs like Medicaid, which they say would genuinely improve the lives of autistic people and their families.</p>

          <p>An investigation by The Guardian and Fieldnotes reveals that major soft-drink and snack-food corporations are funding a campaign to oppose public health efforts aimed at curbing the consumption of soda and ultra-processed foods. The industry is reportedly using a network of Republican-tied political strategists, pollsters, and social media influencers to frame these health initiatives as an attack on consumer choice that betrays Donald Trump's voter base. This strategy aims to create a political conflict between Trump's "Make America Great Again" movement and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" agenda.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Tax Policies Could Eliminate Federal Income Tax for Millions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent changes to the U.S. tax code under the Trump administration could result in millions of American families paying zero in federal income tax. By leveraging a combination of expanded deductions and tax credits, certain households may be able to completely eliminate their federal tax liability. However, the article cautions that this does not mean a total tax bill of zero, as families will still face federal payroll taxes as well as state and local income, sales, and property taxes. Additionally, increased import tariffs could offset some of the income tax savings for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The growing popularity of pickleball has been accompanied by a significant rise in related eye injuries, according to a new study published in JAMA Ophthalmology. Researchers estimate that from 2021 to 2024, the number of injuries like corneal abrasions and lacerations increased by approximately 405 cases each year, with adults aged 50 and older accounting for 70% of incidents. In response to the "alarming" trend, the study's authors are calling for the development and adoption of standardized eye protection guidelines for the sport to improve player safety.</p>

          <p>The case of Roman Surovtsev highlights the complexities of U.S. immigration policy, as he faces deportation despite being effectively stateless. Brought to the U.S. as a refugee from the former Soviet Union at age four, he is now being detained by ICE for a second deportation attempt after a teenage criminal conviction revoked his green card. His lawyers argue the detention is unconstitutional because neither Ukraine, his birthplace, nor Russia can confirm his citizenship, making his removal to either country impossible and a potential violation of his rights.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police in London has confirmed it is "actively" reviewing media reports alleging that Prince Andrew attempted to use his police protection detail to obtain personal information about his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. According to the claims, the prince asked an officer to investigate her shortly before a newspaper published a photo of them together in 2011. This development adds to the scrutiny surrounding the prince's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and comes just after he announced he would voluntarily relinquish his royal titles and public duties.</p>

          <h2>Neuroscientist Explains Why Our Common Understanding of Memory Is Flawed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 06:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to neuroscientist Dr. Charan Ranganath, memory functions less like a factual filing cabinet and more like a dynamic resource for shaping our life's narrative. In an interview about his book "Why We Remember," he explains that memory's primary purpose is to help us understand the present and plan for the future, not to perfectly record the past. The article delves into why forgetting is essential, how emotions prioritize what we recall, why traumatic memories persist, and how our malleable memory system constructs our sense of self.</p>
