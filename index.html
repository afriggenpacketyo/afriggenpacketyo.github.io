          <p>The US dollar's recent weakness, stemming from global trade system instability under President Trump, has created an opportunity for the Euro to attract investors. While market turmoil eased last week, European officials remain skeptical about the long-term predictability of US trade policy. They believe Europe's stability and respect for the rule of law are attracting stronger investor interest in Euro-denominated assets. This shift could potentially challenge the US dollar's long-held status as the world's safest financial asset.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to hinder the wind energy sector, the industry is experiencing a "repowering" era as older turbines reach the end of their lifecycles. This involves upgrading or replacing aging turbines with newer, more efficient models, increasing electricity output. The repowering trend is creating new business opportunities for key players like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa. While new onshore wind farm growth has slowed, the U.S. is poised to surpass 160 GW of wind capacity in 2025.</p>
