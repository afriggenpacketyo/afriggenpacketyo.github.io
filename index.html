          <p>An armed man was arrested outside the Arizona stadium hosting a memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The individual, identified as Joshua Runkles, was reportedly exhibiting suspicious behavior and falsely claimed to be a law enforcement officer when confronted by the Secret Service. He was found to be carrying a weapon and was booked for impersonating an officer, though he was later released on bond. The incident occurred ahead of the high-security memorial, which is designated a top-level special event and will be attended by President Trump and other high-ranking officials.</p>

          <p>A football player for the University of North Texas, Keviyan Huddleston, performed a celebration inspired by wrestling legend "Stone Cold" Steve Austin after recovering a fumble. On the sideline, Huddleston was given a championship-style belt and smashed two cans together in a manner reminiscent of the famous wrestler. The tribute was particularly fitting as Steve Austin himself played football for the same university before his wrestling career. The Mean Green went on to win the game against Army in overtime, maintaining their undefeated record for the season.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applications, a program heavily utilized by the technology and finance industries to employ skilled foreign workers. The sudden policy change has caused significant disruption, with major companies like Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Microsoft advising their H-1B visa holders to remain in the U.S. and avoid international travel. Foreign governments, particularly India, have expressed concern over the "humanitarian consequences" for families affected by the new rule. The White House stated the fee aims to prioritize American workers and prevent abuses of the visa system. (not investment advice)</p>

The incident began after the suspect allegedly shot a woman and stole her SUV, leading to a multi-agency police pursuit. The chase ended when the suspect stopped the vehicle, exited, and began firing at officers, who returned fire and fatally wounded him. The dramatic shootout caused panic among restaurant patrons, who were seen taking cover as the events unfolded in the early morning.</p>

          <p>At the Liberal Democrat party conference, former leader Tim Farron made a theatrical call for the party to "reclaim patriotism" from nationalist groups. Draping himself in an England flag, he urged members to embrace national symbols with pride and reject the "poison of nationalism" used to divide the country. This new strategy aims to position the party as the true patriots, directly challenging figures like Reform UK's Nigel Farage.

          <p>Attorneys for Luigi Mangione, accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are seeking to prevent federal prosecutors from pursuing the death penalty. They argue that public statements by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi calling for capital punishment have prejudiced the case and violated Mangione's constitutional rights. The defense also criticized the highly publicized "perp walk" as a spectacle that tainted the legal process. This legal challenge comes after state-level terrorism charges against Mangione were dismissed, though he still faces murder charges in both state and federal court.</p>

          <p>The Department of Defense has issued new restrictions requiring journalists covering the Pentagon to sign a pledge limiting their access and reporting. The memo states that reporters must not disclose any information, including unclassified material, that has not been formally authorized for release, or they risk losing their credentials. The rules also require official escorts for journalists in many parts of the building, a significant change from previous policies. Press freedom advocates have condemned the move as a "direct assault on independent journalism" that prevents the public from receiving unfiltered information about the military.</p>

She identifies a lack of respect as a major red flag that can damage a partner's self-esteem and sense of self over time. Disrespect can manifest in subtle ways, like one partner consistently walking ahead of the other, or in more significant ways, such as devaluing a partner's priorities or identity.

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene devastated parts of the southeastern U.S., a resident of Leicester, North Carolina, is building his dream house from the storm's rubble. John Saunby salvaged materials like porch posts and floorboards from the widespread debris that was otherwise destined for a landfill. He is using the reclaimed items, along with unique natural elements like Black Locust bark siding, to construct a creative and personal home. The project represents a story of resilience and resourcefulness in the face of natural disaster, turning destruction into a source of treasure.</p>

          <p>England has advanced to its seventh consecutive Women's Rugby World Cup final after a hard-fought 35-17 victory over France. Full-back Ellie Kildunne was instrumental in the win, scoring two tries in her return from a concussion. Despite an early lead for England, a stubborn French side kept the contest close, trailing by only two points at halftime. The Red Roses pulled away in the second half with tries from their dominant forward pack before a final score sealed the victory. England will now face Canada in the final at a sold-out Allianz Stadium.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has reiterated her call for a "national divorce" between red and blue states. In a social media post, Greene claimed the political left celebrated the killing and that the country is too divided to remain united safely. Political scientists have warned that such a separation would not be peaceful, citing the American Civil War as a historical precedent. Experts emphasize that while political polarization is severe, the solution lies in finding common ground, not in pursuing a dangerous and violent division.</p>

          <p>Following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the Trump administration's response, including the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show, is being analyzed as part of a broader crackdown on dissent. Political commentators note that the administration has escalated threats against "the radical left" and is considering classifying some groups as domestic terrorists. This reaction is seen by critics as an attempt to leverage the tragedy to silence political opponents and erode free speech. The discussion highlights a growing concern over the administration's use of state power against its perceived enemies.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece critiques the new, thinner iPhone Air as a symbol of a "miserable minimalist era" in technology, design, and culture. The author argues that the relentless pursuit of making things smaller and sparer, from phones to interior design and even theater productions, has led to a bland and hollow aesthetic. The article contrasts this with the bold, colorful designs of past technology, like the original iMac, suggesting that modern minimalism is a form of control that masks a chaotic world. It posits that this trend values a clean appearance over substance, risk, or humor.</p>

Smith is documenting her experience living in the Japanese countryside on social media to show a different side of life in Japan beyond the bustling image of Tokyo.

          <p>Three Russian MIG-31 fighter jets violated the airspace of Estonia, a NATO member, for approximately 12 minutes before being escorted away. An Estonian military official stated that the Russian pilots ignored signals from Italian F-35 jets that were scrambled as part of NATO's Baltic Air Policing mission. Russia's Defense Ministry has denied the incursion, but Estonia insists it was confirmed by radar and visual contact. The incident has prompted Estonia to request formal consultations with its NATO allies under Article 4 of the treaty, escalating concerns about Russian aggression on the alliance's eastern flank.</p>

          <p>An analysis piece argues that President Trump and his allies are exploiting the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to advance a political campaign of vengeance against their opponents. Critics fear that Kirk's upcoming memorial will be used to frame him as a martyr for the MAGA movement and to justify a crackdown on dissent. The administration has escalated threats against "the radical left," even though there is no evidence linking any organized groups to the shooting. This strategy is viewed by some as a classic authoritarian tactic: using a tragedy as a pretext to consolidate power and suppress opposition.</p>

          <p>A cyberattack targeting a widely used software provider has caused significant disruptions at several major European airports, including those in London, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack on Collins Aerospace's MUSE system forced airlines to revert to manual check-in and boarding procedures, leading to long queues and flight delays. While the company is working to resolve the issue, the incident highlights the vulnerability of the interconnected aviation industry to supply-chain attacks. Cybersecurity experts noted that such third-party platforms are increasingly attractive targets for criminals seeking to cause widespread disruption.</p>
