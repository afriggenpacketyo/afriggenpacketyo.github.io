          <p>Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederick Nielsen firmly stated that the island is not for sale in response to repeated suggestions from Donald Trump about the U.S. acquiring the autonomous Danish territory. Nielsen emphasized that Greenland desires a strong partnership with the U.S. based on mutual respect, while also affirming the need for closer ties with Denmark amidst evolving foreign policy dynamics. Trump's interest in Greenland stems from its strategic importance for national security and potential mineral resources, despite widespread opposition from Greenlanders who favor independence from Denmark but not integration with the U.S.</p>

          <p>A recent Army Black Hawk helicopter crash near Ronald Reagan National Airport, which resulted in multiple fatalities, involved a practice called 'visual separation,' where the pilots take responsibility for navigating around other aircraft. After being alerted to a nearby passenger jet, the crew requested and received permission to use visual separation. Aviation experts have long warned about the risks associated with visual separation when not properly executed. The investigation into the crash is ongoing, focusing on the specific circumstances that led to the mishandling of this procedure.</p>

          <p>China's coastguard has reportedly seized a small sandbank, Sandy Cay, in the South China Sea, heightening tensions with the Philippines, which also claims the territory.

The White House expressed deep concern over the seizure, warning that such actions threaten regional stability and violate international law. The U.S. has reaffirmed its commitment to its alliance with the Philippines amid ongoing territorial disputes in the South China Sea, where China claims a significant portion of the area.</p>

Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer argues that the guidance puts trans people at risk of discrimination and contradicts Britain's tradition of tolerance, while Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey raises concerns about enforcement.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended President Trump's trade negotiation strategy, describing it as 'strategic uncertainty' to create leverage with trading partners. Bessent stated that he was unsure whether President Trump was directly communicating with Chinese President Xi Jinping, despite their reportedly good relationship. He estimated that a trade deal with China could take months to finalize but suggested that 'good behavior' from negotiating countries could prevent tariffs from reaching maximum levels. Bessent also addressed concerns about investor confidence in the U.S. economy, attributing recent market fluctuations to potential statistical or market noise.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered that numerous non-antibiotic drugs, such as those used to treat cancer, diabetes, and depression, can also kill bacteria, offering potential new strategies to combat antibiotic resistance. A new machine learning method developed by scientists has identified how these drugs target bacteria, revealing that they often use different mechanisms than traditional antibiotics. This could lead to the development of new antibiotics that circumvent existing resistance mechanisms. The research also found that some non-antibiotics target a specific bacterial protein not typically targeted by current antibiotics, highlighting a promising avenue for drug discovery.</p>

          <p>Fifty years ago, President Gerald Ford made the morally courageous decision to welcome 130,000 South Vietnamese refugees and asylum-seekers into the United States, despite significant public opposition and economic concerns. Ford's actions were driven by a sense of 'profound moral obligation' to those who had supported the U.S. and faced persecution in their homeland. These refugees, initially reliant on public assistance, went on to become successful contributors to American society, demonstrating the strength that diversity brings to the nation.

While new onshore wind farm growth has slowed, the U.S. is expected to surpass 160 GW of wind capacity in 2025.

          <p>President Trump's recent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has provided a glimmer of hope for Ukrainians who are skeptical of the administration's approach to the war with Russia. Trump questioned why President Putin would continue attacks while the U.S. is trying to broker peace, suggesting a potential shift in his stance towards Russia. This comes after Trump criticized a Russian missile attack on Kyiv and floated the possibility of new sanctions against Russia, signaling a potential departure from a peace plan that was seen as favoring Moscow.</p>

The therapist suggests that expressing needs clearly, giving without expecting anything in return, and listening with the goal of understanding are key to building a reciprocal, loving partnership.
