Japan's WE League, launched in 2021, aims to empower women through football but currently relies heavily on subsidies.

          <p>Dawn Staley, now a successful coach at South Carolina with three national titles, reveals in her new book that she initially turned down an offer from Alabama in 2005. While impressed with the athletic director and campus, Staley couldn't envision living in Alabama, ultimately choosing South Carolina due to its storied legacy in women's basketball within the SEC. The move also allowed her to reunite with her mother and siblings, making it a full-circle moment given her family's history with the state. Staley has become a beloved figure in Columbia, with the city honoring her with a statue.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded Biden-era guidance that required hospitals to perform abortions in emergency situations, even in states where the procedure is illegal. The guidance, issued in 2022, was based on the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which ensures emergency patients receive necessary treatment regardless of their ability to pay. The rescission reflects the Trump administration's stance on abortion access, drawing criticism from abortion rights groups. The Biden administration's guidance had faced legal challenges, including a ruling that Texas hospitals were not required to perform emergency abortions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's relaxation of EPA regulations is raising concerns about potential environmental and health impacts in Houston, particularly for low-income, minority communities. The administration has been rolling back pollution-fighting rules and reducing EPA staff, leading to worries about increased emissions from facilities like coal-fired power plants. A study indicates that pollution from a specific plant contributes to premature deaths, and exemptions from mercury emission regulations could exacerbate health risks. Critics argue that renewable energy sources offer a more reliable and less polluting alternative to coal.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is facing scrutiny as critics label it an attempt to dismantle parts of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) without explicitly repealing it. The legislation, which has passed the House and is moving to the Senate, seeks to reduce Medicaid spending and modify ACA enrollment processes. Experts estimate that nearly 9 million more people could lose health insurance by 2034 if the bill becomes law, and that number could rise to 14 million if enhanced premium subsidies for Obamacare plans are not extended. The bill includes provisions that would shorten the annual open enrollment period and create new paperwork hurdles for enrollees.</p>

From the use of oxygen in mountaineering to advanced shoe technology and pacing in running, athletes and organizers grapple with the ethics of using new tools to achieve extraordinary feats. The article references historical examples, like Edmund Hillary's use of oxygen on Everest and Roger Bannister's paced four-minute mile, to highlight the ongoing debate. The piece explores how perceptions of innovation are shaped by their introduction and accessibility, and how these advancements can create both excitement and resentment.</p>

          <h2>Pornhub Blocks Access in France to Protest Age Verification Regulations</h2>

          <p>Pornhub is blocking access to its site in France to protest new regulations requiring porn sites to verify users are 18 or older. The company argues that age verification should occur on devices rather than websites, citing privacy concerns and ineffectiveness. France's government defends the regulations, emphasizing the need to protect minors from inappropriate content. France's digital and audiovisual communication regulator Arcom, says some 2.3 million minors access porn websites every month in the country, which is 12% of France's total number of porn users.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination" and blaming it for increasing the budget deficit. Musk's comments reflect wider tensions within the Republican Party over the bill, which includes tax breaks and increased defense spending. The bill is facing opposition in the Senate, with some Republicans vowing not to support it. The comments mark his first public disagreement with Trump since leaving government, after having previously called the plan "disappointing."</p>

          <h2>IDF Declares Roads to Gaza Aid Centers 'Combat Zones' as Sites Close</h2>

          <p>The Israeli military (IDF) has declared roads leading to aid distribution centers in Gaza as "combat zones," leading to the closure of these sites. This decision follows multiple incidents of violence near the centers, including a deadly shooting that killed at least 27 Palestinians. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a US-backed aid network, has temporarily suspended operations for safety reasons. The UN has criticized the GHF's aid distribution model, describing it as a dangerous and unacceptable approach that puts civilians at risk of starvation.</p>
