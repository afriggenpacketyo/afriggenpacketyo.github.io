          <p>Legal scholars from across the political spectrum have assessed President Trump's actions during his second term, particularly those impacting constitutional law. The scholars identified actions such as executive orders on birthright citizenship and immigration enforcement as potentially unlawful or exceeding presidential powers. Their analysis highlights a trend of the executive branch assuming increased lawmaking authority, with concerns raised about the strain on the judicial system due to numerous legal challenges. The scholars also offer insights into the administration's strategic priorities and potential long-term impacts on the balance of power within the government.</p>

The U.K. government has announced initiatives to reduce knife crime, including bans on certain types of weapons and tougher sanctions for tech platforms hosting harmful content.

          <p>Chinese e-tailer Temu has begun adding "import charges" of approximately 145% in response to President Trump's tariffs, significantly increasing the cost of many items. These charges, which cover customs-related processes and costs, can more than double the price of a typical order. This move erodes the value proposition that made Temu popular, potentially aligning its prices more closely with U.S. competitors like Amazon and Walmart. Temu's online ad spending has decreased sharply, and its app ranking has declined since the tariffs were announced.</p>

These actions are sparking fears of a crackdown and concerns about "backdoor family separation."

Critics argue that these operations are primarily enforcement actions disguised as welfare checks.</p>

          <p>Experts predict that home equity loan interest rates will likely hold steady in the near term, largely due to the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to further rate cuts. While rates may drop later in the year if the Fed decides to lower rates, they are expected to remain relatively stable for the time being. Some experts suggest that HELOCs may be a better deal due to their lower rates, but borrowers should be mindful of the variable interest rates and plan for active repayment.

          <p>A Brazilian study has found a link between high intakes of ultraprocessed foods and increased rates of premature death. The study analyzed data from eight countries and found a linear relationship between the amount of dietary energy derived from ultraprocessed foods and mortality risk. Countries with stronger food cultures that have resisted infiltration by ultraprocessed foods tend to have lower premature death rates. The study suggests that public policy improvements, including sugar taxes and incentives for fresh food production, are crucial to improving long-term health outcomes.</p>

One roommate heard strange noises and saw a masked figure, leading to a lockdown and eventual discovery of the crime. Bryan Kohberger, accused of the murders, had his attempt to block survivor testimony denied by the judge, though some portions were deemed inadmissible hearsay.</p>

          <p>Edward Spencer, 19, has been sentenced to two years in a youth offenders institution for causing the deaths of three teenagers in a car crash near Shipston-on-Stour. Spencer, who had a history of "showing off" at the wheel, admitted to causing the deaths by careless driving and causing serious injury to the occupants of another vehicle. The crash occurred six weeks after he passed his driving test.  Bereaved mothers are supporting graduated driver licensing and black box technology to prevent dangerous driving.</p>

          <p>The FA Cup semi-final between Nottingham Forest and Manchester City saw empty seats at Wembley Stadium, despite its 90,000 capacity. Manchester City's frequent appearances at Wembley may have contributed to lower attendance. Other factors, such as Nottingham Forest's remarkable season and Crystal Palace's London base, may have influenced ticket sales for the four semi-finalists. The logistics of distributing unsold tickets to the local area pose challenges.</p>

          <p>Cicadas from Brood XIV are poised to emerge in the spring of 2025, bringing billions of bugs to neighborhoods across the eastern United States. The insects will likely be concentrated in Kentucky and much of Tennessee, and are also expected to show up in parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. The huge groups of cicadas emerge when the soil reaches about 64 degrees Fahrenheit, and typically remain in a given area for 4 to 6 weeks after they first emerge.</p>
