            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed the measles outbreak in Texas is flattening, but data from the Texas Department of State Health Services indicates cases are still increasing. Public health specialists are skeptical of Kennedy's claim, believing the actual number of cases is likely higher than reported. Experts are concerned that suggesting the curve is flattening may dissuade people from getting tested or treated. Kennedy has also promoted catch-all treatments not intended for all measles cases.</p>
