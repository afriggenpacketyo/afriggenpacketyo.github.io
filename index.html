        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy staffers outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, questions are being raised about the adequacy of security measures at the event. Experts suggest that routine security, especially with diplomats in attendance, should be robust. Attorney General Pam Bondi denied any security lapse, while Mayor Muriel Bowser noted the event was not categorized as a "special event" requiring additional resources. The FBI is investigating writings attributed to the suspect, who yelled "Free, free Palestine" during his arrest, to determine their authenticity and potential motives behind the attack. </p>

He assured staff that Social Security is "not going away" and addressed concerns about potential staff reductions, stating he has no intention to implement reductions in force at this time.

          <p>President Trump is hosting a private dinner at his Virginia golf course for top holders of his cryptocurrency tokens, a move criticized by Democrats and some Republicans as unethical. Protesters gathered outside the event, denouncing it as a form of corruption, while lawmakers demanded transparency regarding the guest list.

          <p>Voice of America's prospects appear grim after an appeals court order dashed hopes of staving off near-total dismantlement by the Trump administration, led by senior adviser Kari Lake. Lake has slashed the workforce, canceled contracts with news services, and sought to replace coverage with far-right sources. The Voice of America website hasn't posted new stories in more than two months. While a lower court had ordered the administration to restore the network, the appeals court has allowed Lake to proceed with her plans, leaving the future of the broadcaster in doubt. </p>

          <p>Following the murders of two Israeli Embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington, D.C., this article reflects on the dangerous political climate and the potential consequences for peace in Gaza. The author argues that the incident endangers the chances for peace in Gaza by changing the domestic politics on Israel-Palestine, making it less likely for the U.S. government to restrain Israel. It is argued that extremist rhetoric within the pro-Palestine movement has contributed to a climate where violence targeting American Jews becomes more likely, and that the attack is likely to abet Israel's actions in Gaza. </p>

          <p>Corey Oâ€™Connor won the Democratic primary for mayor of Pittsburgh, signaling a potential turn away from the progressive policies championed by the current mayor, Ed Gainey. O'Connor's victory is reminiscent of his father's, Bob O'Connor, who also won the primary for mayor in 2005. Voters chose O'Connor, who has been controller for Allegheny County since 2022, over Gainey, favoring a manager promising a smooth-running city rather than a leader with a grand vision. His win represents a notable turn for the city and the party, four years after Ed Gainey rode a wave of pandemic-fueled progressivism to defeat two-time incumbent Bill Peduto in the Democratic primary. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by ending its ability to enroll foreign students, citing concerns over violence, antisemitism, and coordination with the Chinese Communist Party. The Department of Homeland Security stated that existing foreign students must transfer or lose their legal status in the United States. Harvard has condemned the move as unlawful and retaliatory, threatening serious harm to the university and undermining its academic mission. The administration's decision follows previous actions, including cutting federal grants and threatening to revoke the university's tax-exempt status. </p>

Justin Sun, founder of the TRON blockchain, is among the attendees, despite facing regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. The event has drawn criticism from Democratic senators, who describe it as a blatant example of "pay to play" corruption.
