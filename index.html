          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has condemned the United States' attempts to ban Chinese-made chips as protectionism and a violation of international laws, threatening legal repercussions for organizations or individuals who enforce or assist in implementing Washington‚Äôs measures. This warning comes in response to new guidelines released by the US Bureau of Industry and Security, restricting the use of some Chinese chips globally and limiting the use of US chips to train Chinese artificial intelligence models. Beijing has vowed to closely monitor the situation and take actions to defend its interests under the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law passed in 2021, which stipulates prosecution and compensation for those implementing sanctions against China.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned following public criticism of his remarks about never having to buy rice due to receiving it as gifts from supporters, which struck a nerve amid rising rice prices. The resignation comes as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government faces low approval ratings ahead of an Upper House election and ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. Japan has been struggling with soaring rice prices due to inclement weather and policies protecting local farmers, while demand has increased due to high tourist footfall. The government has been releasing stockpiles to curb prices with little effect, as consumers and businesses are panic-hoarding amidst rising inflation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent satellite analysis reveals that tropical forests were destroyed at the fastest recorded rate in 2024, with fires overtaking land clearances from agriculture as the main cause, especially in the Amazon due to record drought. The loss of 67,000 sq km of old-growth forests released 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases, equivalent to the emissions of the European Union. Researchers warn that some forests, like parts of the Amazon, may be approaching a tipping point, leading to irreversible decline and savannization. South East Asia bucked the trend with reduced forest loss due to government and community efforts to enforce "no burning" laws, indicating that consistent protection policies are essential.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans for the "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, an ambitious project to expand the country's air defense system, with the goal of completion by the end of his term. U.S. officials claim it is necessary to protect against catastrophic attacks, though experts cite logistical and financial hurdles. The project, reminiscent of Ronald Reagan‚Äôs ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù initiative, aims to intercept missiles from any location, including space, but faces skepticism regarding its feasibility and cost, estimated between $161 billion and $542 billion by the Congressional Budget Office. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth hailed the project as a ‚Äúgame changer‚Äù and a ‚Äúgenerational investment in the security of America.‚Äù</p>

          <p>Malaysia, a key player in the global semiconductor industry, is caught in the crosshairs of President Trump's trade policies, which threaten its ambitious plans to build high-tech chips for artificial intelligence. The article discusses how tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Malaysian exports, including semiconductors, are creating uncertainty for companies operating there. Despite Malaysia's efforts to attract investment and develop its chip design sector, the potential for blanket levies on semiconductor imports could undermine these efforts. Companies are closely monitoring the tariff situation, with concerns that higher costs will be passed on to American consumers.</p>

          <p>California and the US are experiencing a shortage of veterinary professionals due to high turnover rates, rising student debt, and increased pet ownership.

The trade surplus with the U.S. narrowed, and economists anticipate that net exports will remain a drag on GDP growth.

          <p>A federal court ordered the Trump administration to maintain custody of migrants on a deportation flight reportedly headed to South Sudan, raising concerns about potential violations of an injunction against deporting immigrants to dangerous countries. During a chaotic hearing, administration officials claimed they could not disclose the flight's location or destination, citing classified information. The judge expressed concerns that the administration had violated his order and warned of potential criminal sanctions for officials involved in the deportations.</p>
