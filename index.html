          <p>Gizmo, the second eaglet of Big Bear eagles Jackie and Shadow, successfully took her first flight from the nest. After a brief initial attempt, Gizmo soared into the air, joining her sister Sunny, who fledged earlier in the week. The eaglets, born in March, had been practicing for their first flights by flapping their wings and jumping between branches. Although it is unclear where Sunny and Gizmo will go, young eagles tend to return to the nest soon after their first flight.</p>
