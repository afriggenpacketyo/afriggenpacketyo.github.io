        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jonathan Peter Brooks, a plastic surgeon, received a life sentence with a minimum term of 22 years for attempting to murder a colleague, Graeme Perks, who was a witness against him in disciplinary proceedings. Brooks broke into Perks's home armed with a crowbar, petrol, matches, and a knife, and stabbed him, leaving Perks with life-threatening injuries. The judge emphasized that Brooks's life was "falling apart" due to anticipated job loss and blamed Perks for his difficulties. Perks survived due to quick action and surgical skill, and he expressed no ill feeling towards Brooks, wishing his family well despite the attack and its lasting health impacts. The legal proceedings were significantly delayed by Brooks's repeated refusal to cooperate with the court. Optimism is low given the violent nature of the crime and the long-lasting effects on the victim.</p>

          <p>A senior U.S. delegation, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, met with Chinese representatives in London to address trade tensions threatening global growth. The talks follow a phone call between President Trump and China's leader Xi Jinping, with both sides claiming breaches of previous agreements. Key issues include Chinese exports of rare earth metals and Beijing's access to U.S. technology like computer chips. While previous talks in Geneva reduced tariffs, broader issues remain unresolved, and the inclusion of Lutnick is seen as a positive step given his role in export controls. The discussions aim to find mutually acceptable outcomes amidst ongoing disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he would support the arrest of California Governor Gavin Newsom for allegedly obstructing federal immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, a comment made after Newsom announced California would sue Trump over the National Guard deployment. Newsom accused Trump of illegally federalizing the National Guard and acting unilaterally. In response, Newsom criticized Trump's statement as a step towards authoritarianism, emphasizing the unprecedented nature of a president calling for the arrest of a sitting governor. Meanwhile, federal prosecutors charged labor leader David Huerta with felony conspiracy to impede an officer during a protest in L.A., adding to the escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, his former co-star in the 2024 film *It Ends with Us*. The legal battle between the two actors has been ongoing for several months, with a trial initially scheduled for the following year. Baldoni's countersuit included allegations of extortion and defamation, which the judge dismissed on Monday. The lawsuit originated after Lively filed a complaint accusing Baldoni of sexual harassment and initiating a smear campaign against her.

          <p>An inquest into the death of Rhianan Rudd, a 16-year-old who was groomed and charged with terrorism offenses before taking her own life, concluded that authorities missed opportunities to help her. The coroner cited a "systems failure" by counter-terror police and Derbyshire County Council for not referring Rudd earlier as a potential victim of modern slavery. Rudd had been groomed and sexually exploited online by an American neo-Nazi and became fixated on Adolf Hitler. The inquest also found missed opportunities by the council to provide mental health support sooner, but determined no single organization was to blame for her death. The tragic circumstances highlight the complexities of dealing with vulnerable individuals involved in extremism.</p>

          <p>Republican leaders in Congress and the White House are urging lawmakers to swiftly support President Trump's legislative agenda, citing the ongoing immigration protests in Los Angeles as a reason to secure additional border security resources. House Speaker Mike Johnson emphasized the bill's essential funding for border security, while White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called for reversing the "invasion" of unvetted individuals. The legislation, which includes $46.5 billion for the border wall and funding for additional ICE and Border Patrol personnel, is now in the Senate after passing the House. Disagreements among Republicans over spending cuts and opposition from Elon Musk have posed challenges to the bill's progress.</p>

          <p>An Italian referendum aimed at expediting citizenship for immigrants and bolstering labor rights failed due to insufficient voter turnout, following calls for a boycott by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and other right-wing political parties. The referendum sought to reduce the naturalization period from 10 to 5 years, benefiting second-generation Italians born to non-EU citizens. Economists argued that the change could address Italy's aging population and low birthrate, but right-wing parties opposed the measure, advocating for reduced immigration and a blood ancestry-based definition of Italian identity. With voter participation falling far below the required 50%, the referendum was declared void, highlighting a crisis of democracy according to trade union leader Maurizio Landini.</p>

          <p>A medical tribunal has determined that a doctor's failings in the care of Martha Mills, who died from sepsis, amounted to "gross negligence" and were "particularly grave." Martha's death led to the implementation of Martha's Rule in numerous hospitals, granting parents the right to seek an urgent second opinion. The tribunal found that consultant Prof Richard Thompson failed to recognize the severity of Martha's condition and did not examine her in person or send her to intensive care. The tribunal concluded that Prof Thompson's fitness to practice is impaired, with potential sanctions pending.</p>

          <p>A new study in JAMA Pediatrics reveals a significant increase in firearm-related deaths among children and teens in the U.S. following a 2010 Supreme Court decision that granted states greater authority over gun laws.

Researchers analyzed over two decades of data, comparing trends in gun-related deaths before and after the legal shift, adjusting for other factors like motor vehicle accidents and cancer.

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban has taken effect, barring nationals from 12 countries and partially restricting those from another seven, primarily affecting nations in Africa and the Middle East. Trump announced the policy following a firebombing attack in Colorado, asserting it is necessary for national security. The ban targets the visa application process and includes exceptions for lawful permanent residents and individuals whose entry serves U.S. national interests. While legal challenges are anticipated, scholars note that this ban differs from the 2017 ban and may be less vulnerable in court.</p>

          <p>Wall Street strategists are increasingly optimistic about stocks despite signs of a potential summer slowdown and softening economic data. Several strategists have defended their S&P 500 year-end targets, suggesting that a moderate slowdown is already priced into the market. They point to the fact that stocks and equity market internals tend to move ahead of lagging economic data. Goldman Sachs' analysis indicates that soft economic data, like consumer surveys, typically bottoms out before hard data, supporting the idea that the S&P 500 will follow the upward trend of soft data even if hard data weakens.

She argued that the Court appears to have abandoned the requirement of showing "irreparable harm" before granting shadow docket relief, applying a different standard to Democratic administrations.

The initial reform aimed to reduce the number of eligible pensioners and save Â£1.4 billion annually, but the reversal will now provide payments to approximately 9 million pensioners. The government claims the new system will still save Â£450 million, although some analysts believe the net savings could be lower due to increased pension credit claims.
