          <p>Following the recent Gaza ceasefire and the release of all living Israeli hostages, a wave of disinformation has spread across social media. The DW Fact Check team investigated several viral claims, finding them to be false or misleading. These included incorrect assertions about the survival of female hostages, the use of old footage to depict ceasefire celebrations, and fabricated stories about booby-trapped toys being used by Israeli forces. The article highlights the importance of verifying information during sensitive geopolitical events to combat confusion and polarization.</p>

Abbott stated that his troops are well-trained to handle civil unrest and are there to ensure federal officials can perform their duties safely.

          <p>The IRS has confirmed that the ongoing government shutdown does not alter the October 15 tax filing deadline for those who requested an extension. While many IRS operations are closed and staff are furloughed, taxpayers are still required to submit their returns and pay any owed taxes. The agency noted that extensions provide more time to file, not to pay, and penalties for late filing will still apply unless a reasonable explanation is provided. Some taxpayers in disaster-affected areas, such as parts of Arkansas and Tennessee, have been granted a later deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece highlights her roles from "Annie Hall" to her later comedies, noting that her on-screen confidence inspired audiences to embrace their own quirks.

          <p>The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) has postponed a vote on whether to allow Israel to participate in the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest, citing recent developments in the Middle East. The decision, which was scheduled for a virtual meeting in November, will now be discussed at an in-person assembly in December. Several countries, including Spain, Ireland, and the Netherlands, have considered boycotting the event if Israel takes part due to the war in Gaza. The delay comes shortly after a ceasefire was established and all living Israeli hostages were released.</p>

          <p>Following the release of all living Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, the next phase of the Gaza peace plan faces significant challenges. Mediated by Egypt and Qatar, the deal's initial steps have been met, but future negotiations will tackle more contentious issues. These include the governance of postwar Gaza, Israel's demand for Hamas to disarm, and Palestinian calls for statehood, all of which face opposition from one or both sides. The plan also outlines the need for an international security force and billions in aid for reconstruction.</p>

          <p>This article revisits Orson Welles' infamous 1938 radio broadcast of "The War of the Worlds," which simulated a Martian invasion and reportedly caused widespread panic. It explores how the event became a historical touchstone for discussions on media credibility and the public's susceptibility to misinformation, a lesson that remains highly relevant in the age of social media and AI-generated deepfakes. The broadcast was an intentional assault on the blind trust people placed in radio, aiming to teach listeners to be more skeptical of what they hear.
