          <p>Amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and India following a deadly terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, Pakistan's army chief, General Syed Asim Munir, has adopted a more assertive stance. General Munir has emphasized Pakistan's commitment to Kashmir, describing it as the country's "jugular vein," and has warned against any military misadventures by India. Analysts suggest that General Munir's hard-line approach reflects his long-held views on India and his need to project strength amid domestic political and economic challenges.

          <p>A change in U.S. tax policy, ending a loophole for inexpensive imports, is forcing apparel makers in Guangzhou, China, to reconsider their business models. The combination of tariffs and the new tax on cheap imports has cut deeply into their businesses, making it impossible for some to continue selling on platforms like Amazon. Many factory owners are considering relocating their operations to cheaper locations, either in other provinces of China or in countries like Vietnam.

          <p>As high tariffs reduce U.S. orders for Chinese goods, China is striving to help exporters divert sales to the domestic market, a move that could worsen deflation. Local governments and major businesses are supporting this effort, with e-commerce giants like JD.com offering discounts of up to 55% on goods originally intended for U.S. buyers. However, this influx of discounted goods could erode companies' profitability and weigh on employment, contributing to weak consumer demand. The consumer price index has already slipped into negative territory, and deflation in wholesale prices is expected to deepen.</p>
