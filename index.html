          <p>A package of cryptocurrency regulation bills, publicly endorsed by former President Donald Trump, was unexpectedly blocked in the House of Representatives. The procedural motion failed in a 196-223 vote, with thirteen Republicans joining Democrats in opposition, citing issues like the lack of a ban on Central Bank Digital Currencies. This legislative setback, occurring during a "Crypto Week" on Capitol Hill, prompted an immediate downturn in crypto-related stocks such as Coinbase and Circle. The failure underscores the significant political challenges confronting the digital asset industry's push for clear U.S. regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Severe flash floods struck New Jersey, leading to the deaths of two individuals whose car was swept away in Plainfield. This tragedy brings the city's recent storm-related death toll to four, prompting the mayor to express deep sorrow and commit to improving emergency response. In a neighboring town, authorities rescued approximately 40 people from chest-high water, while the extreme weather caused major disruptions across the Northeast, including in New York City and Virginia. Governor Phil Murphy has declared a state of emergency as the region braces for continued flood threats and heavy rainfall.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate is preparing to vote on a White House rescissions package that seeks to cancel $9.4 billion in previously approved funding. The proposal primarily targets foreign aid programs, including the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and would also eliminate federal funding for public broadcasters NPR and PBS. The move faces resistance from some moderate Republicans concerned about the impact of the cuts, forcing leadership to consider amendments. With a tight deadline approaching, the effort highlights deep partisan divisions over government spending and could impact future bipartisan budget negotiations.</p>

          <p>Arizona's Attorney General, Kris Mayes, has warned of the increasing use of drones by Mexican drug cartels to transport fentanyl and other illicit substances across the border. This evolving tactic poses a significant security risk, prompting the state to pass a new law allowing law enforcement to disable or shoot down these drones. While officials note a decrease in migrant crossings, the flow of drugs remains a major concern, with Mayes calling for more federal resources to combat the cartels' technological advancements.

          <h2>US Announces Preliminary Trade Deal with Indonesia, Awaiting Confirmation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 14:29:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. has reached a preliminary trade agreement with Indonesia, which he claims includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian imports and a commitment to purchase billions in American goods. According to Trump, the deal also grants U.S. exports tariff-free access to the Indonesian market. However, as of the announcement, officials from Jakarta had not yet confirmed these terms, leaving some uncertainty about the finality of the agreement. This follows a similar pattern to a recent trade deal announced with Vietnam, where the U.S. president's description of the terms was reportedly met with surprise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charles Collins and Brian Boles, who were convicted of a 1994 murder in Harlem as teenagers, have been exonerated after spending decades in prison. The Manhattan District Attorney's office stated that a reinvestigation found their coerced confessions were contradicted by exculpatory evidence, and DNA proved their innocence. The two men, now in their late 40s, were emotional as a judge overturned their convictions, a moment of justice that cannot return the years they lost. The case highlights ongoing efforts by the DA's Post-Conviction Justice Unit to prevent and rectify wrongful convictions.</p>

          <p>The Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) is advising its members, particularly its large contingent of Latino players, to carry their legal documentation with them at all times. The guidance comes in response to ongoing federal immigration raids being conducted across the country. Union chief Tony Clark stated that they have retained immigration lawyers and are working with the league to ensure players are protected and can focus on their jobs without disruption. The league commissioner confirmed discussions with the Trump administration, which reportedly offered assurances that players with valid visas would not be affected.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia has officially rejected former President Trump's demand for a ceasefire agreement in Ukraine to be reached within 50 days, labeling the proposal an "unacceptable" ultimatum. A top Russian diplomat stated that while a diplomatic path is preferred, the military operation will continue until its objectives are met. The Kremlin's response came after Trump threatened to impose 100% secondary tariffs on Russia's remaining trade partners if a deal was not signed within the specified timeframe. This sharp rejection signals that a near-term diplomatic resolution to the prolonged conflict remains highly unlikely, despite increased U.S. pressure.</p>

The event aims to position the state as a leader in AI, powered by its fossil fuel reserves. However, the plan has drawn sharp criticism from environmental and community groups, who argue that boosting planet-heating energy production will have severe consequences for the climate and local health. The summit also highlights a contradiction, as many tech leaders have stressed the need for cheap, clean energy for AI growth.</p>
