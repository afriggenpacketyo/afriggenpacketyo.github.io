          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's shares experienced a slight decline following Warren Buffett's announcement to step down as CEO, marking the end of his 60-year tenure. Greg Abel, the vice chairman of non-insurance operations, is set to succeed Buffett on January 1, 2026, a decision unanimously approved by the board. Despite the transition, Buffett will remain as chairman, providing mentorship to Abel and offering his expertise in capital allocation. The move signals a transparent transition for the conglomerate, valued at nearly $1.2 trillion, with businesses spanning insurance, railroad, retail, manufacturing, and energy.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay for the New York Times, Jack Goldsmith, a former assistant attorney general, argues that Donald Trump's second term has revealed the full extent of presidential power, building upon the excesses of previous administrations. Goldsmith contends that Trump's actions, such as using emergency powers for tariffs and claiming untouchable national security authority, echo strategies employed by presidents like Richard Nixon and George W. Bush. He calls for substantial limitations on the presidency, advocating for a return to when Congress played a vital role in domestic policy and when law and norms checked presidents from grabbing everything they could in the short run. The article emphasizes the need for reform to prevent further erosion of constraints on executive power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. crude oil prices experienced a drop after OPEC+ members agreed to increase production for the second consecutive month. The decision to raise output by another 411,000 barrels per day in June followed a similar increase in May, leading to concerns about oversupply in the market. President Trump's tariffs have heightened fears of a recession, further dampening demand and contributing to the price decline. Analysts anticipate continued weakness in the oil market, with forecasts suggesting lower average prices for U.S. crude and Brent crude this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A World War II-era Philippine navy ship, intended as a target for a joint U.S.-Philippine military exercise, sank unexpectedly due to rough seas hours before the drill. The decommissioned BRP Miguel Malvar, formerly the USS Brattleboro, was being towed off the coast of Zambales when it took on water and sank. The ship was to be used in a live-fire exercise near the disputed Scarborough Shoal, a point of contention between the Philippines and China. While the ship-sinking drill was cancelled, other live-fire maneuvers proceeded as planned, focusing on the defense of Philippine sovereignty in the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>Midwives in Chad are expressing concerns over potential job losses due to the cancellation of USAID contracts, impacting their ability to provide critical maternal care to vulnerable women. The funding cuts come at a time when Chad is facing a humanitarian crisis, with a high maternal mortality rate exacerbated by the influx of Sudanese refugees. Midwives like Ernestine Nedjoumbaye play a crucial role in providing safe deliveries and prenatal care, often serving as a lifeline for women who lack access to healthcare facilities. The loss of U.S. funding threatens to undermine these efforts, potentially leading to increased maternal deaths and limited opportunities for midwives to advance their education and skills.</p>

          <p>This article critiques the Trump administration's potential pronatalist policies, arguing that they should embrace diverse family structures rather than narrowly focusing on traditional marriage. It highlights the changing landscape of American households, with fewer people having children and more unmarried couples and single individuals starting families. The article suggests that if the goal is to raise fertility rates, the administration should focus on lowering barriers for all people hoping to start families, including subsidizing assisted reproductive technologies and extending family-leave policies to anyone responsible for taking care of a family member.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made outside the United States, citing concerns about the decline of the American film industry. Trump argues that other countries offer incentives to attract filmmakers, posing a "National Security threat" to the U.S. The move has sparked concerns within the film industry, with warnings that it could deal a "knock-out blow" to the sector and its freelancers. The details of the proposed tariffs remain unclear, including whether they would apply to American production companies filming abroad and films on streaming services.</p>

Temu is transitioning to a local fulfillment model, with all sales in the U.S. now handled by locally based sellers and fulfilled from within the country.

The study suggests that psychotherapy is becoming more accessible and that telehealth and the inclusion of licensed counselors and social workers have expanded access to mental health care.

Despite the layoffs, some workers remain confident in Trump's vision, hoping that short-term pain will lead to long-term change.
