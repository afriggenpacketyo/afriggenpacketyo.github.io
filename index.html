        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent polls indicate a decline in Americans' confidence in Donald Trump, even among Republicans, regarding key issues. A majority of those surveyed described Trump's second term as "scary," with poor ratings on the economy and immigration policy. Only 24% believe Trump is focusing on the right priorities, and his approval rating is historically low for this point in a term. These negative reviews come as Trump approaches 100 days in office, suggesting voter fatigue after global market downturns and deportations.</p>

          <p>During Pope Francis's funeral at the Vatican, Donald Trump reportedly had a revelation about Russia's intentions in Ukraine after a conversation with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump posted on Truth Social questioning Putin's recent missile strikes on civilian areas, suggesting that Putin may not want to end the war. The meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy, facilitated by the funeral, offered a glimmer of hope for renewed intervention, although Trump's mercurial nature makes any lasting change uncertain. The symbolic meeting occurred amidst tensions between the US and Europe, with the funeral itself highlighting divides over migration and social issues.</p>

          <p>Russian security forces have apprehended a Ukrainian spy accused of orchestrating a car bomb attack that killed a senior Russian general in Moscow's suburbs. The FSB claims the suspect, Ignat Kuzi, planted explosives in a vehicle to assassinate General Yaroslav Moskalik. The FSB alleges that Kuzin remotely detonated the bomb from Ukraine. Moskalik was the deputy head of the main operational directorate of the military's General Staff.</p>

          <p>Analyst Craig Moffett questions the feasibility of Apple's plan to move iPhone assembly to India, suggesting it won't effectively reduce costs associated with tariffs. Moffett argues that since iPhone components will still be made in China, tariffs will remain a significant issue. He also notes potential backlash against Apple in China due to U.S. tariffs, which could negatively impact sales. Furthermore, carriers are unwilling to absorb tariff costs, potentially leading to decreased consumer demand and slower upgrade rates. (not investment advice)</p>
