          <p>An Italian man was allegedly kidnapped and tortured for weeks in a New York City home by two cryptocurrency investors attempting to obtain the password to his Bitcoin wallet. The suspects allegedly threatened to kill the man's family unless he complied, luring him to New York with the promise of returning his Bitcoin. During his captivity, the man was reportedly shocked with electric wires, hit with a gun, hanged over a ledge, cut with a saw, forced to smoke crack cocaine, and urinated on. The victim escaped after promising to provide the password, leading to the arrest of the suspects and an internal investigation into two NYPD detectives who provided private security for them.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk concluded his tenure as a special government employee, leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with President Trump praising his efforts. While Musk promised to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget, DOGE achieved roughly $170 billion in savings, although some analyses suggest the initiative could cost the government $135 billion due to lost productivity. Musk defended DOGE's work and predicted it would achieve its $1 trillion goal over time. He also publicly disagreed with Trump's domestic policy package, stating it increases the budget deficit and undermines DOGE's work.</p>

          <p>A recent kidnapping and torture case in New York City involving cryptocurrency has highlighted the increasing trend of "wrench attacks," where criminals combine cybertheft with physical violence. These attacks target individuals with crypto holdings, often identified through social media, to coerce them into revealing their account passwords. The surge in Bitcoin's value has made crypto owners lucrative targets, and the lack of third-party financial institutions in crypto transactions makes it easier for criminals to steal assets. The article suggests measures crypto investors can take to protect themselves, such as requiring permissions from multiple people to access a wallet.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's tenure with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is ending, with the team claiming to have identified $175 billion in savings. While this is a small fraction of the federal government's spending, it highlights ideologically driven spending that should be cut. The author argues that Congress needs to enact the DOGE cuts into law and address entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security to rein in the national debt. The author suggests that both Republicans and Democrats must work together to achieve fiscal sustainability.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have announced plans to investigate former President Joe Biden's cognitive abilities while in office, claiming they want to know who was running the country during his perceived decline. The hearing will focus on what Republicans allege was a media cover-up of Biden's mental fitness. The announcement follows the release of a book making claims about Biden's health and the former president's recent diagnosis of prostate cancer. Top Democrats have largely avoided defending Biden, while some have admitted they were wrong about his fitness during the 2024 campaign.</p>

          <p>A salmonella outbreak linked to recalled cucumbers has sickened nearly four dozen people across 18 states, leading to at least 16 hospitalizations. The recalled cucumbers, grown by Bedner Growers Inc., were sold at Bedner's Farm Fresh Markets locations in Florida and distributed to stores and restaurants in multiple states. Health officials advise consumers to discard cucumbers if they cannot determine their origin and to wash surfaces that may have come into contact with the produce. Symptoms of salmonella infection include diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps.</p>

          <p>Anthony Weiner asserted that female politicians are judged more harshly than men, suggesting this contributes to qualified candidates like Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton losing elections while figures like him and Donald Trump survive scandals. Weiner made these remarks during his run for a New York City council seat, years after his sexting scandal led to his resignation from Congress. He also addressed his past scandals and claimed to be in "recovery" after sexually messaging a teenaged girl, which resulted in an 18-month prison sentence.</p>
