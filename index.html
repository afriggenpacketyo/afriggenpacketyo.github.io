          <p>Authorities have discovered human remains at the location of a significant explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The incident, which occurred at Devastating Pyrotechnics, left seven individuals unaccounted for. Investigations revealed the business was operating without necessary local licenses on agricultural property, which is owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant. The federal ATF is assisting local agencies in the investigation, while the community grapples with the aftermath and awaits identification of the remains.</p>

          <p>In a demonstration of solidarity with the local Latino community, major LA Galaxy supporter groups, including the Angel City Brigade, staged a protest during a match. They walked out at the 12th minute and displayed banners opposing recent ICE raids, criticizing the team's administration for its silence on an issue affecting many of its fans. The groups also organized a fundraiser for pro-immigrant organizations, emphasizing their commitment to social action beyond the stadium. This follows a history of fan activism, including a successful boycott that led to a change in team presidency.</p>

          <p>Despite attracting over a million attendees, Pride in London and similar LGBTQ+ events across the UK are facing a precarious future due to significant drops in corporate sponsorship and volunteer numbers. A survey by the UK Pride Organisers Network revealed that over 85 organizations have seen reduced funding, forcing some to cancel, scale back, or introduce admission fees. Organizers attribute the decline to corporations, particularly those with US headquarters, cutting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion budgets. Despite the challenges, organizers remain resilient, affirming the movement's importance and vowing to find new ways to continue.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have made a significant advance in regenerative medicine by successfully restoring damaged outer ear tissue in mice. Their research, published in the journal *Science*, identified a "genetic switch" that can be reactivated to promote organ regeneration. The key was discovering that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative. By reactivating this pathway, they achieved complete tissue restoration, offering hope that similar mechanisms could one day be harnessed for human organ repair.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the media and political uproar over punk band Bob Vylan's "Death to the IDF" chant at Glastonbury serves as a deliberate distraction from the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The author critiques the immediate framing of the chant as antisemitic, suggesting it conflates the Israeli military with all Jewish people and silences legitimate criticism of military actions. The piece contrasts the widespread front-page coverage of the band with the lack of attention on the high death toll in Gaza. It concludes that this is a strategy that is losing its effectiveness as public opinion shifts.</p>

The event was monitored by police, but remained peaceful as participants expressed their opposition to current immigration enforcement tactics.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their most lopsided home loss in the history of Dodger Stadium, falling 18-1 to the Houston Astros on Independence Day. Former Astro Jose Altuve and former Diamondback Christian Walker, both longtime antagonists for Dodgers fans, led the offensive onslaught with multiple home runs and RBIs. The game spiraled out of control during a disastrous sixth inning where the Dodgers' bullpen surrendered ten runs, the most the team has allowed in a single inning since 1999.

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te's administration is facing a dilemma over its portrayal of World War II history, as it seeks to emphasize Taiwan's distinct identity. Critics argue that by honoring the Republic of China's (ROC) wartime victory against Japan, the government is acknowledging a historical legacy rooted in mainland China, which contradicts the Democratic Progressive Party's typical stance. The ROC, founded on the mainland in 1912, relocated to Taiwan in 1949 after the civil war. President Lai's approach attempts to navigate this complex history while downplaying the island's pre-1949 connection to the mainland.</p>

          <p>The massive tax and spending bill signed by President Trump contains a wide range of policies, centered on making the 2017 tax cuts permanent. Key provisions include new work requirements and eligibility checks for Medicaid, over $46 billion for border wall construction, and an increase in the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000. The legislation also terminates many green energy tax credits from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, imposes new work requirements for food stamp recipients, and raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.
