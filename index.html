          <p>Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi is warning that Iran's government is intensifying its crackdown on citizens, particularly activists, following its recent conflict with Israel. Speaking from Tehran, she asserts the regime is using the war to deflect from internal issues and is escalating arrests and executions to instill fear. Mohammadi highlights the dire conditions in prisons like Evin, which was struck by Israel, and calls for international attention to the worsening human rights situation. Despite facing personal threats and the seizure of her Nobel prize money, she remains committed to advocating for democracy and an end to the current theocratic system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Staffing reductions at the National Park Service (NPS) are creating safety risks for summer visitors, exemplified by the lack of lifeguards at Maryland's popular Assateague Island National Seashore. The cuts, part of a broader Trump administration hiring freeze and budget reduction, have resulted in a 24% loss of permanent staff since the start of the term. An independent advocacy group attributes the lifeguard shortage directly to this policy, warning that the situation is a symptom of chaos within the agency. Local officials express fear for public safety, stating that every day without lifeguards puts visitors in jeopardy.</p>

          <h2>MLB Investigates Cleveland Guardians Pitcher Over Potential Gambling-Related Pitches</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 20:23:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cleveland Guardians pitcher Luis Ortiz has been placed on paid leave amid a Major League Baseball investigation into potential gambling activities. The probe is reportedly focused on two specific wild pitches thrown by Ortiz in June games, which were flagged by a betting integrity firm for unusual wagering patterns. The bets, placed in multiple states, were on the pitches being a ball or a hit batsman, and in both instances, Ortiz threw pitches that were far from the strike zone. While the league investigates, Ortiz will remain on leave through the All-Star break, and the Guardians have stated they will respect the confidential process.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives has passed a massive legislative package central to the Trump administration's second-term agenda, featuring significant tax and spending cuts alongside increased funding for defense and immigration enforcement. The bill, which passed by a narrow 218-214 vote, overcame internal Republican dissent after intense pressure from party leadership and the president himself. The legislation extends tax cuts and introduces new ones, but also makes deep cuts to social programs like Medicaid and food assistance. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has placed 139 employees on paid administrative leave after they signed a public letter criticizing the agency's direction under the Trump administration. The letter, signed by over 170 employees, argued the EPA is failing its mission to protect human health and the environment by weakening regulations and cutting funding for key scientific research. The EPA accused the dissenting employees of "unlawfully undermining" the administration's agenda and has initiated an administrative investigation.

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that most Americans who display the U.S. flag do so out of patriotism and to show support for the military, rather than to make a political statement. However, many believe that others often use the flag for political purposes, with a plurality associating its display with a conservative viewpoint. The survey also found that Republicans are more likely than Democrats to fly the flag for patriotic or political reasons. Despite these differences, a large majority of Americans believe it should be illegal to burn the flag in protest and feel that one can patriotically fly the flag of their family's heritage alongside the American flag.</p>

For decades, Combs was a titan of the music industry, shaping hip-hop and R&B and building a business empire.

With over 1.18 million people having applied through this route, the committee criticized the Home Office for not gathering basic information and showing "little curiosity" about its operation.

The analysis covers the economy, where growth has been minimal, and immigration, where net migration has fallen but small boat crossings have increased. On the foreign policy front, the government has managed its relationship with the U.S. and reset ties with the EU, but faces criticism for being too cautious on Russia and China. Domestically, progress on teacher recruitment and NHS waiting lists has been modest, while major U-turns on welfare reform have raised questions about the government's priorities and authority.

          <p>Meta's newly formed advanced AI research lab, MSL, has hired a significant number of researchers educated in China, drawing attention both in the U.S. and their home country. Publicly listed hires show that seven of the eleven new researchers are graduates of top Chinese universities like Tsinghua and Peking University, all of whom later pursued careers in the United States. The lab's mission is to develop next-generation AI models and deliver "personal superintelligence." This hiring trend occurs amid heightened competition for top AI talent, with rivals like OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman recently criticizing Meta's aggressive and lucrative recruitment tactics.</p>

The move is part of a broader authorization for up to 700 military personnel to assist ICE in several states, reflecting the administration's strategy to increase immigration arrests and enforcement across the country.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Interior Department to increase entrance fees for foreign visitors at U.S. national parks. The White House stated the additional revenue will fund conservation and maintenance projects, arguing that U.S. taxpayers currently subsidize foreign tourists. The order also mandates that permitting and reservation systems prioritize U.S. residents over international visitors.

          <p>In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can remove eight noncitizens who were being held at a U.S. military base in Djibouti. The ruling clears the way for their deportation to South Sudan, a country with which they have no ties. The men had been in legal limbo after a lower court judge blocked their removal, but the Supreme Court lifted that injunction. This decision represents a significant victory for the administration's policy of deporting certain migrants to third-party countries. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented, with Sotomayor writing that the administration appears to have the court "on speed dial."</p>

Despite previously vowing to oppose harmful cuts, Valadao supported the bill, citing negotiated concessions for rural hospitals and agriculture. Democrats have vowed to make his vote a central issue in the 2026 election for his highly competitive seat, accusing him of betraying his district to support tax breaks for the wealthy.
