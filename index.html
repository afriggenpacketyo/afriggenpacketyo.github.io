          <p>Brian Goldstone's book, "There Is No Place for Us," highlights the often-overlooked homeless population living in extended-stay motels or precarious housing situations.  His work challenges the common narrative linking homelessness solely to unemployment and reveals the systemic issues contributing to this hidden crisis.  The book underscores the need for a fundamental shift in how America addresses housing insecurity.</p>

          <p>China and Japan are reviving economic dialogue and strengthening cooperation in various sectors. This move is partly driven by global uncertainty stemming from President Trump's policies. While strengthening ties, Japan is unlikely to significantly alter its close relationship with the United States. The strengthened cooperation shows both sides wanted to use trade to stabilise their relationship as a safeguard against the uncertainties caused by Trump.</p>
