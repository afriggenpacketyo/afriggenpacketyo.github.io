            <p>As major tech companies like Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia gear up for first-quarter earnings, uncertainty looms large due to President Trump's tariff policies. These tariffs are causing market chaos and impacting revenue and earnings for American companies that rely on imports, potentially leading to reduced ad spending and consumer spending. The article breaks down the key issues each company faces, from Tesla's supply chain disruptions to Meta's exposure to ad pullbacks from Chinese e-commerce giants and Nvidia's reliance on tariff exemptions for AI infrastructure. Investors are keen to understand how these companies plan to navigate the increased costs and manage inventory amid these fluctuating trade conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>With the Ukraine war's fog lifting, Russia nears control of Kursk and key Ukrainian regions. Despite UN condemnation and reliance on Iranian weapons, Russia gains ground. Ukraine faces significant losses, including potential NATO membership and refugee returns. China could play a role in European security as the US potentially retreats. Russia's gains are Pyrrhic, but Ukraine's situation remains dire. Zelensky's legacy is tragic, as Ukraine accepts Russian occupation in practice.</p>

            <p>A Michigan woman lost $17,500 after scammers convinced her to deposit cash into a bitcoin ATM to "secure" her money. The con artists, posing as representatives from Apple and her credit union, instructed her to withdraw cash and deposit it into a bitcoin ATM. This scam highlights the growing trend of criminals using bitcoin ATMs to defraud consumers, with millions of dollars lost to crypto ATM fraud. Authorities warn consumers to be cautious of requests to deposit money into cryptocurrency ATMs, as the transactions are often irreversible.</p>

            <p>Harvard University has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging a freeze on $2.2 billion in federal grants, arguing that the White House is attempting to "punish Harvard for protecting its constitutional rights." The suit alleges that Trump's cuts to Harvard's funding are unconstitutional and will jeopardize the institution's medical research. Harvard argues that universities must be allowed to "fulfill their essential role in society without improper government intrusion." The university is seeking a court order to halt and declare the funding freeze "unlawful."</p>

            <p>President Trump is considering invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 to address immigration concerns at the US southern border, potentially allowing the use of active-duty military personnel for law enforcement duties. The act grants the president broad authority to mobilize troops for domestic operations, including quelling civil unrest and detaining migrants. This move is part of Trump's efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, despite border crossings reaching a quarter-century low. The Insurrection Act has been used sparingly throughout American history, including during the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
