          <p>The ongoing Israeli military offensive in Gaza has resulted in nearly 300 deaths in three days, bringing the total casualties to over 63,000 since October 2023, according to Hamas-run health officials. This surge follows accusations of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity by global genocide scholars, citing the maiming of thousands of children and Israeli leaders' rhetoric. Israel's Foreign Ministry dismisses these claims as based on Hamas's lies, while human rights bodies continue to raise alarms. The offensive in Gaza City displaces residents, who face a dire choice between staying in a declared "dangerous combat zone" or fleeing to overcrowded southern areas.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 11:04:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Phantom energy, also known as vampire energy, refers to electricity silently consumed by devices left plugged in but not actively in use, accounting for 5% to 10% of household energy. This wasted power contributes to climate change by increasing demand for emissions-producing electricity sources. Experts recommend simple actions like unplugging chargers and unused appliances, or disabling smart features on devices like internet-connected TVs, to reduce this drain. Such individual efforts, when multiplied across the country, can significantly decrease U.S. carbon emissions and save money on utility bills.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Washington D.C. grand juries have recently rejected at least four Justice Department requests for indictments, a highly unusual occurrence that has surprised former federal prosecutors. One notable case involved a woman accused of threatening President Trump on Instagram, which a D.C. grand jury declined to indict. Critics, including a D.C. U.S. Attorney, suggest these rejections indicate a politicized jury system or a breakdown in credibility, while others argue grand juries are acting as a vital constitutional safeguard against prosecutorial discretion. The reasons for these rejections are not explicitly known, but they underscore a potential shift in how federal cases are being reviewed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields, including the benchmark 10-year and 30-year bonds, fell on Wednesday after the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) reported fewer available positions than anticipated. The 30-year yield briefly touched 5% overnight due to tariff uncertainty and concerns over the Federal Reserve's independence, before retreating. Investors are also wary of potential political influence on the Fed, particularly after President Trump's attempts to remove a Fed governor, which could impact the central bank's inflation-fighting credibility. The bond market remains sensitive to upcoming economic reports, including Friday's crucial jobs report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actress Demi Moore has publicly defended Emma Heming Willis, wife of her ex-husband Bruce Willis, against criticism regarding her caregiving decisions for the actor, who is battling frontotemporal dementia. Moore emphasized the lack of a roadmap for such a diagnosis and praised Emma's dedication to self-care, recognizing its importance for caregivers. Emma Heming Willis recently faced backlash for moving Bruce into a separate home with professional caregivers, which she addressed by highlighting the judgment caregivers often face. Moore also shared her personal struggle of seeing Bruce's decline and the importance of meeting individuals with dementia where they are, without expectations.</p>

          <p>Amazon is discontinuing its Prime Invitee program, which allowed members to share free shipping benefits with non-household individuals, effective October 1. Instead, the company is encouraging these users to purchase their own Prime subscriptions, offering a one-year discounted rate of $14.99. The Invitee program is being replaced by "Amazon Family," which permits sharing a broader range of Prime benefits, including Prime Video and Music, but only with one other adult within the same household, alongside up to four teens and children profiles. This move aims to nudge non-household users into full Prime memberships following a 2022 price increase.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, defended his agency's handling of a recent measles outbreak in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, portraying it as a success for a science-driven CDC. This defense comes amidst significant turmoil at the CDC, including the abrupt firing of its director and subsequent resignations of senior officials. Critics, including former CDC head of immunization Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, claim Kennedy has not been briefed by CDC experts on key health issues like measles or COVID-19. Over a thousand current and former HHS employees have signed a letter demanding Kennedy's resignation, accusing him of politicizing public health and endangering Americans.</p>

          <p>A fact-check analysis debunks President Trump's repeated claims that Democrat-governed cities inherently experience higher crime rates, asserting that such a link is not supported by data. While most large U.S. cities are led by Democrats and tend to report higher crime rates than rural areas, correlation does not imply causation. Research from Harvard, MIT, and Boston University, spanning three decades and 400 cities, found no detectable impact of a mayor's political affiliation on crime rates or policing. The article emphasizes that crime rates are influenced by complex socioeconomic, geographic, and cultural factors, not a mayor's party, and that national violent crime has largely decreased over the past 30 years despite public perception.</p>

Hegseth, who watched the "precision" strike live, emphasized that this action signals a new, offensive approach to drug smuggling in the hemisphere.

HELOCs offer flexible access to credit with interest-only payments during a draw period, but variable rates mean payments can change.

Although no injuries were reported, high levels of volcanic gas, including 55,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, are expected to linger, creating volcanic smog that can cause respiratory issues.

          <p>Alphabet shares jumped 9% after a U.S. District Judge ruled against the most severe breakup proposals in Google's antitrust case, a decision viewed favorably by investors. While Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search, the judge rejected the Justice Department's request to divest its Chrome browser and Android operating system. Google will also retain the ability to pay companies, like Apple, to preload its products, provided these are not exclusive contracts. This outcome is seen as a significant win for Google, reducing a major overhang on its stock and bolstering confidence in the long-term durability of its search business, especially as it invests heavily in AI with Gemini.

          <p>Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) criticized the Trump administration's decision to acquire a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel for $8.9 billion, labeling it "a step towards socialism." Paul, a conservative lawmaker, argued that government ownership in private companies is a "bad idea" and expressed concern that the free market movement within the Republican Party is diminishing. President Trump, however, lauded the investment as a "great Deal for America, and, also, a great Deal for INTEL." This move is part of a broader trend of the Trump administration taking a more active role in the private sector, drawing support from some, like Senator Bernie Sanders, but raising alarms among free-market advocates.

          <p>As high mortgage rates deter downsizing, reverse mortgages are gaining appeal for older homeowners seeking to convert home equity into cash, but experts advise caution due to unique risks. While monthly payments are not required, borrowers must maintain their home, insurance, and property taxes, all of which are experiencing significant cost increases. Falling home prices in some areas can reduce available equity or make qualification difficult, though government-backed HECMs offer protection against owing more than the home's value. Furthermore, reverse mortgages can deplete inheritance for heirs, and high upfront fees may not be justified for those planning short-term occupancy. (not investment advice)</p>
