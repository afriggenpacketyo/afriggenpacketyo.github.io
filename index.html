          <p>Erin has rapidly intensified to become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, now a powerful Category 5 storm with winds up to 160 mph. While the storm is projected to remain hundreds of miles off the U.S. East Coast, it is expected to generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents from North Carolina to Virginia between August 20 and 27. Tropical storm watches are active for several Northern Leeward Islands, which are anticipated to receive heavy rainfall. The storm's path is being steered away from the mainland by a cold front, but coastal erosion remains a significant concern.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying the review process for legal immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship by expanding the definition of "good moral character." U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has directed officers to conduct a more holistic assessment, considering factors beyond the absence of criminal offenses, such as community involvement, family ties, and even minor traffic infractions. This policy shift requires a deeper look into an applicant's adherence to societal norms and positive contributions. Critics argue the move is designed to create more grounds for denial and discourage applications, while the administration states it aims to restore integrity to the immigration system.</p>

A royal source indicated the move offers an opportunity to leave behind unhappy memories and begin a new chapter.

          <p>In Phoenix, architect Brian Stark is addressing the affordable housing crisis by transforming old shipping containers into sustainable shelters for the city's unhoused population. His "X-WING" shelters consist of four containers joined in an 'X' shape, creating five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyards. The units, which are topped with solar panels, can be constructed in just one week, offering a rapid and environmentally friendly housing solution. Stark's next project is a 105-unit apartment complex for low-income seniors, furthering his goal of using existing materials to create dignified living spaces.</p>

Brave's batter, Adam Hose, suffered a dislocated right ankle while fielding and was subsequently hospitalized, causing a 10-minute delay in the game. Despite being a player down in the chase, the Rockets were led by Tom Moores' impressive 55 runs from 30 balls and Tom Banton's 49 from 38. The victory elevates the Rockets to a position level with the league leaders, Northern Superchargers.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data shows a 13% decrease in arrests nationwide during July, following a sharp increase in June. While ICE has not commented on the reasons for the dip, immigration rights activists believe their efforts may be contributing to the slowdown. In states like Oregon, a 'rapid-response' hotline system alerts legal aid groups to recent arrests, allowing them to file petitions that can sometimes prevent detainees from being transferred out of state. Combined with local 'sanctuary' laws, these strategies create significant logistical challenges for federal immigration authorities in certain regions.</p>

In a social media post, Kennedy affirmed his loyalty to President Trump and the administration's agenda, suggesting that the rumors are being spread by the "swamp" to create a divide between him and the president.

          <p>President Trump's recent pivot from demanding an immediate ceasefire to advocating for a direct peace agreement with Russia has sparked significant concern in Kyiv and among European allies. This shift appears to align with Russia's long-held position that a ceasefire can only occur as part of a broader settlement, a stance Ukraine views as a demand for capitulation. While the Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin concluded without a concrete deal, Trump's new rhetoric effectively gives Russia more time to press its military advantage. The development complicates diplomatic efforts and underscores Ukraine's reliance on U.S. backing for its security.</p>

          <p>As an antidote to the pressures of intensive parenting, the concept of a "Lighthouse Parent" is gaining traction for promoting child independence and confidence. This approach encourages parents to act as a steady, guiding presence, offering safety and clarity when needed without controlling every aspect of their child's life. While the instinct to solve a child's problems is strong, constantly intervening can be exhausting for adults and detrimental to a child's development. By being a reliable beacon rather than a constant supervisor, parents can help their children learn to navigate their own challenges.</p>

By halting military aid to Ukraine, easing sanctions, and undermining U.S. agencies, the administration has diminished its ability to pressure Moscow, allowing Vladimir Putin to largely ignore American diplomatic efforts. The article argues that Trump's desire to be seen as a peacemaker is ineffective without credible threats or incentives.

          <p>A group of four masked thieves executed a swift robbery at Menashe and Sons Jeweler in Seattle, stealing approximately $2 million worth of merchandise in just 90 seconds. The suspects used hammers to smash through the front door and display cases during the brazen daylight incident. They were armed with a Taser and bear spray, which they used to threaten employees, though no one was injured. The stolen items include high-value Rolex watches and a $125,000 emerald necklace. Police are currently investigating and searching for the suspects, who fled in a getaway car.</p>

          <p>A new wave of book removals is sweeping through Florida schools, with hundreds of titles being pulled from shelves as the academic year begins. The trend follows a warning from the state board of education to the Hillsborough county school district, which led to the removal of over 600 books to avoid potential legal action. Fearing similar repercussions, at least nine other districts have proactively removed books, including classics by Maya Angelou and Kurt Vonnegut. Critics describe the removals as state-driven censorship aimed at erasing LGBTQ+ voices and honest discussions of race and sexuality.</p>

          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is helping students transitioning from the foster care system to college by providing them with essential supplies for their dorm rooms. Many of these students arrive on campus with minimal belongings and are often unaware of what they need, from bedding and towels to lamps and toolboxes. The non-profit aims to level the playing field, ensuring these students feel prepared and equal to their peers on their first day. By allowing students to choose their own items, the program also gives them a sense of ownership and identity in their new living spaces.</p>

          <p>Sadie Salazar, a therapist and COO, emphasizes the importance of a consistent morning ritual to ground herself and set a positive tone for the day. Her one non-negotiable rule is to wake up early when her alarm goes off, no matter what, to ensure she has personal time before work and family obligations begin. Instead of a rigid schedule, she uses this extra hour flexibly for activities like reading, listening to a podcast, or walking her dog. This approach allows her to start the day feeling rejuvenated and creative rather than rushed or as if she has already failed at a strict routine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent U.S. Census Bureau paper reveals that a smaller percentage of young adults are reaching key life milestones traditionally associated with adulthood, such as moving out, securing a job, getting married, and having children. Compared to 1975, when nearly half of young adults had achieved all four, less than a quarter have done so today. The study attributes this shift to increased economic barriers, including the rising cost of living, and changing societal attitudes toward family formation. Economic stability and educational attainment are now often prioritized over marriage and starting a family.</p>

          <p>The ceremonial welcome given to Russian President Vladimir Putin during his summit with President Trump in Alaska has drawn a cold reaction in Ukraine. The spectacle, which included a red carpet and a military flyover, was viewed by many Ukrainians as an inappropriate legitimization of a leader responsible for an ongoing war of aggression. Political analysts and citizens in Kyiv expressed feelings of being crushed and called the pageantry an irrational act of deference. While relieved that the summit did not result in major concessions to Russia, the optics of the warm reception have struck a deeply sour note.</p>

          <p>Samsung is narrowing the gap with Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share increasing significantly from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined. This shift is partly driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, which offer new form factors compared to the traditional design of the iPhone. While Apple still holds the top spot, its recent slip suggests a renewed competition, prompting speculation that it may release its own foldable device by 2026 to stay competitive. This article discusses market trends shaping the rivalry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Columbia-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests three powerful steps to develop emotional endurance, which is the ability to withstand stress without being overwhelmed by negative emotions. First, she advises using a visual aid to remind yourself that learning and growth occur in the often-uncomfortable space between not knowing and knowing. Second, engage in positive self-talk to reframe struggles as part of the process. Finally, she recommends taking on small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which builds tolerance for discomfort and boosts confidence over time.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has endorsed efforts to redraw the state's congressional maps mid-decade, a move that could significantly favor Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections. Bolstered by a recent Florida Supreme Court ruling that approved his previous redistricting in the northern part of the state, DeSantis is now eyeing districts in South Florida. Democrats have decried the plan as a partisan power grab designed to silence voters and gerrymander the state to secure more Republican seats in the U.S. House. Critics suggest the move is also an attempt by the lame-duck governor to reassert his national political influence.</p>
