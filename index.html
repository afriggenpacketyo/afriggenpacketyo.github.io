          <p>Pop icon Debbie Gibson is reflecting on her career in her new memoir, "Eternally Electric: The Message in My Music." At 17, she became the youngest female artist to write, produce, and perform a Billboard No. 1 hit with "Foolish Beat" in 1988, a record she still holds. Gibson credits her late mother, Diane, who acted as her manager, for fighting for her creative control in a male-dominated industry. After walking away from major labels to record independently, she feels she is thriving more than ever by connecting directly with her audience through social media.</p>

          <p>Two 17-year-olds have been arrested and will be charged as adults for the murder of 21-year-old congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym. Tarpinian-Jachym, an intern for Rep. Ron Estes, was killed by stray bullets in a shooting on June 30. Authorities are still searching for a third juvenile suspect in connection with the crime. The U.S. Attorney for D.C., Jeanine Pirro, stated that Tarpinian-Jachym was an innocent bystander and used the announcement to criticize the D.C.

          <p>British tennis number one Emma Raducanu has withdrawn from Great Britain's team for the Billie Jean King Cup Finals. She has instead accepted a wildcard to play in the Korea Open, prioritizing the WTA Tour event to aid the long-term development of her game and her new partnership with coach Francisco Roig. The decision is a significant setback for the British team, as Raducanu was instrumental in their run to the semi-finals last year, winning all three of her singles matches. Her absence will require team captain Anne Keothavong to bring in additional players for the finals in Shenzhen.</p>

He completed the 12,388-foot ascent accompanied by his family and friends, having previously set the record at age 96. Akuzawa undertook rigorous training for three months prior to the climb, overcoming previous health issues to achieve the feat. Despite finding the climb more challenging than before, he credited the support of his companions for his success on the iconic mountain.</p>

          <p>UK Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary Angela Rayner has resigned from her government and party roles following a tax controversy. An ethics inquiry concluded she breached the ministerial code by failing to pay sufficient tax on the sale of a flat, a mistake she attributed to not seeking specialist advice. Rayner's departure has triggered a significant cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, with David Lammy appointed as the new deputy prime minister. The event is a major blow to the Labour government and initiates a new deputy leadership election within the party.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has seized over 40,000 pounds of cocaine and apprehended 36 suspected smugglers in the Eastern Pacific Ocean over the last month. The seizures were part of Operation Pacific Viper, a surge of forces aimed at disrupting cartels and criminal organizations transporting illicit narcotics from South America. The operation involves coordination with international partners using cutters, aircraft, and tactical teams. This success follows a recent record haul in the Caribbean, where the Coast Guard offloaded over 38 tons of cocaine and marijuana in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</p>

The party's manifesto proposed saving £30 billion annually by scrapping net zero carbon emission policies, a figure disputed by independent forecasters who note most of that sum comes from lost fuel duty revenue, not spending cuts. The party's proposed £88 billion in annual tax cuts, combined with £53 billion in new spending, would rely on £50 billion in unspecified government 'waste' reduction, a sum experts believe is unrealistic without significant cuts to public services.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Powerball jackpot reaches an estimated $1.8 billion, the potential tax implications for a winner are substantial. The lump-sum cash option is approximately $826.4 million, which would immediately be subject to a mandatory 24% federal tax withholding, reducing it by nearly $198.3 million. However, since the winnings push the recipient into the highest federal income tax bracket of 37%, a significant additional tax bill would be due. State taxes could further reduce the take-home amount, varying widely depending on where the winning ticket was purchased. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Powerball jackpot at a historic $1.8 billion, an analysis shows that a winner's location significantly impacts their after-tax prize. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery winnings, allowing a winner to take home the most money after federal taxes are deducted. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, would see the lowest annuitized payout, totaling around $939 million compared to over $1.1 billion in a no-tax state. This disparity highlights the crucial role state tax policy plays in the ultimate value of a massive lottery win. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The once-booming industrial warehouse sector is experiencing a significant slowdown, with quarterly demand falling for the first time since 2010. According to a report from NAIOP, net absorption of industrial space dropped by 11.3 million square feet in the second quarter, a stark reversal from the highs seen during the pandemic-driven e-commerce surge. The decline is attributed to economic uncertainty caused by tariff policies and high inflation, which has led businesses to pause expansion plans. While a rebound is projected for 2026, the sector faces a period of flat growth for the remainder of this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage told party members at their conference that they must be ready for a general election as early as 2027. He cited the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner as a catalyst for a potential "big rift" and civil war within the ruling Labour Party. Farage used the speech to rally supporters, promising to stop illegal immigration, scrap net zero policies, and implement zero-tolerance policing. He also announced the creation of a new policy department to prepare the party for government, signaling a shift from protest movement to a party aspiring for power.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates in the United States have continued their downward trend, with the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage falling to 6.50%, its lowest point since October 2024. This decline is largely attributed to market anticipation of an imminent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, as well as a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. For prospective homebuyers, the lower rates may increase competition for limited housing inventory. Experts advise buyers to act strategically by checking their credit, getting pre-approved for a loan, and calculating their budget based on current rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida has become the first state in the U.S. to announce a plan to eliminate all vaccine mandates for schoolchildren.

For decades, school mandates have been a critical tool for maintaining high vaccination rates, which protect vulnerable populations. The move comes as vaccine exemption rates for non-medical reasons are rising nationally, contributing to a decline in overall childhood immunization coverage and recent outbreaks of once-rare diseases.</p>
