While Ukrainians acknowledge the likelihood of ceding territory as part of an armistice, they are unwilling to permanently relinquish Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. Experts note that a formal surrender would require constitutional changes and a nationwide vote, potentially leading to accusations of treason. Despite the political complexities, Ukrainian soldiers remain committed to fighting until all Ukrainian lands are liberated.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court will hear a case involving Trina Martin, whose Atlanta home was mistakenly raided by FBI agents in 2017, leading to a lawsuit against the government. The key issue is the extent to which individuals can sue the federal government for law enforcement misconduct. Martin's attorneys argue that Congress intended to allow such lawsuits, while government lawyers contend that courts should not second-guess law enforcement decisions. The incident left Martin, her boyfriend, and her son traumatized, prompting a legal battle over accountability.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's job approval rating has reached the lowest point for any president in the past 80 years, according to a recent poll, with only 39% of respondents approving of his performance.

Majorities disapprove of Trump's handling of various issues, including the economy, foreign relations, and tariffs. Despite this, Trump maintains trust over Democrats in Congress to handle the nation's problems, and his supporters largely remain loyal.</p>

          <p>Australia is contemplating placing caps on the number of international students to address the country's unaffordable housing crisis. Politicians argue that reducing international student intake will decrease demand for rentals and starter homes, thereby lowering prices. This shift marks a significant change for Australia, which has historically viewed international education as a major economic driver. Critics worry that limiting international students could negatively impact the country's research and innovation sectors.</p>
