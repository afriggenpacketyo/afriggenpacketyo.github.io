          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 15:12:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that a significant slowdown in hiring presents a growing risk to the U.S. economy, suggesting the central bank may implement two more interest rate cuts this year. Speaking to the National Association of Business Economics, Powell noted that despite a government shutdown affecting data, the outlook for employment has weakened, shifting the balance of risks. He stated that while tariffs have increased inflation, there are no broader price pressures, allowing the Fed to focus more on supporting the job market. This has led to market expectations of rate reductions in the upcoming October and December meetings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Hamas, stating that if the militant group does not voluntarily disarm, "we will disarm them." The comments were made following the release of the final 20 living Israeli hostages after more than two years in captivity, a key part of the first phase of a ceasefire agreement. The deal stipulates that Hamas must disarm in the second phase, which Trump indicated has now begun. While Trump did not specify the actions he would take, he affirmed his support for Israel's military objectives in Gaza if Hamas fails to comply with the disarmament terms.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown extends into its 14th day, House Speaker Mike Johnson has adopted a firm stance, stating he has "nothing to negotiate" with Senate Democrats regarding the House-passed funding measure. He defended the Trump administration's decision to reallocate Pentagon funds to ensure military personnel receive their paychecks, challenging Democrats to legally contest the move. Johnson continues to blame Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for the impasse, while the shutdown has reportedly led to over 4,000 federal employee layoffs, according to a federal workers union.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is making an aggressive strategic pivot to control its entire business stack, from software to hardware, through a series of major deals. The company is partnering with Broadcom to co-develop custom AI accelerators, similar to previous agreements with Nvidia and AMD, to create an infrastructure optimized for its models. This vertical integration strategy, part of a campaign called Stargate, aims to achieve greater efficiency, performance, and cost-effectiveness. The moves position OpenAI to compete not just on model capability but as a complete AI ecosystem, controlling the hardware, developer platform, and user experience.</p>

          <p>U.S. air traffic controllers, who are required to work without pay during the government shutdown, have received only partial paychecks and risk missing their next one entirely if the impasse continues. The union representing the controllers highlighted the immense stress this adds to an already demanding job, with some employees taking on second jobs to cope. The situation exacerbates an existing shortage of trained controllers, which has previously caused flight disruptions. This financial pressure on essential aviation personnel raises concerns about the stability and safety of the national airspace system as the shutdown drags on.</p>

          <p>The announcement of the 2026 Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) has been delayed due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. The Social Security Administration confirmed that the release of September's consumer price index data, which is used to calculate the COLA, has been pushed from October 15 to October 24. While the announcement is postponed, the agency assured the approximately 75 million beneficiaries that their January payments will not be delayed. Experts project the 2026 COLA to be between 2.7% and 2.8%, which would be a notable decrease from the high adjustments seen in recent post-pandemic years.</p>

Unlike Certificates of Deposit (CDs), these accounts provide liquidity without requiring savers to lock their money away for a fixed term.

          <p>The recently brokered Gaza peace deal, which secured a ceasefire and the release of all living hostages, faces an uncertain future due to its inherent vagueness. This ambiguity was crucial for getting both Israel and Hamas to agree, as it postponed contentious issues like Hamas's disarmament and the future governance of Gaza. However, this same lack of specificity now presents a significant weakness, as evidenced by ongoing violence and disagreements over aid access. The analysis in this article suggests that while the deal successfully halted the immediate conflict, its long-term stability depends on sustained diplomatic pressure to resolve the core issues it deliberately left unaddressed.</p>

He emphasized that this move is intended to ensure sufficient liquidity in the financial system and does not signal a change in the Fed's broader interest rate policy.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed a bill that would have banned the sale of cookware and other consumer products containing PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals." While acknowledging the legislation was well-intentioned, Newsom expressed deep concern that the ban was too broad and would negatively impact the availability of affordable cooking products in the state. The bill had support from environmental groups but faced opposition from celebrity chefs and industry figures who argued that responsibly manufactured nonstick cookware is safe. PFAS are linked to various health issues and their prevalence in the environment is a growing concern.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.K. government is set to introduce tougher new rules requiring some migrants to demonstrate English language proficiency equivalent to an A-level standard. Effective January 2026, the change will affect applicants for skilled worker and scale-up visas, raising the required competency from the current GCSE-equivalent level. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the policy is designed to ensure migrants can fully contribute to national life. The move is part of a broader government strategy to reduce net migration levels, which have fallen significantly from a record high in 2023 but remain a key political issue.</p>

          <p>Leading U.S. news organizations, including The New York Times, CNN, and The Associated Press, have rejected a new Pentagon policy that restricts journalists from reporting any information without official authorization. The policy requires reporters to sign an agreement acknowledging that even unclassified information must be approved for release, a move media outlets argue is an unprecedented violation of press freedom. Reporters who refuse to sign by the deadline must surrender their credentials. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the changes as necessary for national security, stating that Pentagon access is a privilege, not a right.</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown is causing significant financial anxiety for military families, many of whom live paycheck to paycheck and fear a disruption in their income. Although the Trump administration has stated it identified funds to pay service members on schedule, the uncertainty is creating stress for households already facing financial strain. According to a survey by the advocacy group Blue Star Families, one in six active-duty military families already experienced food insecurity before the shutdown. For these families, who often rely on a single income due to frequent relocations, a missed paycheck could have a devastating financial and psychological impact.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that while the recent ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza is a significant diplomatic achievement, a true and lasting peace can only be built when Israel's right to exist is accepted as a non-negotiable fact by all parties. The author contends that the conflict's core is the irreconcilable position between Israel's existence and its enemies' goal to erase it, often masked by the term "anti-Zionism." The article criticizes international bodies and media outlets for, in its view, perpetuating a narrative that treats Israel's survival as provisional. It concludes that only after this fundamental issue is resolved can practical negotiations on borders and Palestinian rights succeed.</p>

In a recent interview, Kang and co-director Chris Appelhans argued that the film's unique tone, comedy, and fantastical elements are best suited for the animated medium. They believe a live-action version would feel too grounded and stilted, losing the expressive freedom that allows the characters to be goofy comedians one moment and high-flying demon fighters the next.

This disconnect means only about 2% of Gen Z job seekers share the core priorities of their potential bosses.

A Connecticut jury and judge awarded the record-breaking sum in 2022 after finding him liable for defamation and infliction of emotional distress.
