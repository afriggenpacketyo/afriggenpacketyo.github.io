          <h2>Trump to Nominate Mike Waltz as UN Ambassador Amidst Controversy</h2>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to nominate Mike Waltz, the current National Security Advisor, as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, following reports of Waltz's departure due to controversy surrounding a Signal messaging app thread. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as interim national security advisor. The controversy stems from Waltz's creation of a Signal chat used by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to share U.S. military plans. This nomination comes after Trump withdrew Elise Stefanik's nomination for the same role, citing the slim Republican majority in the House.</p>

          <p>McDonald's reported lackluster quarterly earnings, with CEO Chris Kempczinski citing "heightened anxiety" over potential price increases due to Trump's tariffs, raising concerns about overall consumer health. This report serves as a potential warning for other portfolio stocks like Texas Roadhouse and Starbucks, as it highlights how consumer spending may soften, impacting demand for discretionary purchases. While Starbucks is defended due to CEO Brian Niccol's turnaround expertise, Texas Roadhouse faces risks from commodity inflation due to tariffs.

          <p>President Trump announced that any country or person purchasing oil or petrochemicals from Iran will face secondary sanctions, barring them from doing business with the United States. This declaration is part of Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran, aimed at halting the country's oil exports, which he claims are used to finance militant groups in the Middle East. The announcement led to a rise in U.S. crude oil and global benchmark Brent prices. The administration believes Iran is trying to develop a nuclear bomb, an allegation that Tehran has denied.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have proposed a new plan, the Student Success and Taxpayer Savings Plan, to overhaul how millions of Americans repay their student debt. The plan would consolidate the current 12 repayment options into two: fixed payments over 10 to 25 years, or an income-driven repayment plan called the "Repayment Assistance Plan." Under the RAP plan, monthly bills would be a percentage of a borrower's income, ranging from 1% to 10% depending on earnings. The GOP aims to tout savings for President Trump's tax cuts through this overhaul.</p>

          <p>With rising borrowing costs and increased financial struggles, settling debt for less than what's owed can be a viable option. Successful debt settlements typically involve paying 30% to 50% less than the original balance, but the specific percentage depends on factors like financial hardship and the creditor's policies. While negotiating on your own is possible, working with a debt relief expert can offer advantages such as professional negotiation skills and existing relationships with creditors, ensuring the settlement agreement is properly documented.</p>

          <p>Federal forest officials began clearing a large homeless encampment in the Deschutes National Forest near Bend, Oregon, affecting over 100 residents living in vehicles. The action follows a Supreme Court ruling upholding bans on sleeping outdoors in public places, even when shelter beds are unavailable. Residents faced fines and potential jail time for trespassing after the deadline, leading to frantic efforts to repair vehicles and move belongings. The U.S. Forest Service cited fire mitigation as the reason for the closure, while aid groups and local officials express concerns about where the displaced individuals will go.</p>

          <p>Savers with CD accounts maturing in May 2025 face a unique interest rate climate with inflation nearing the Federal Reserve's target and potential stock market volatility. Researching options like high-yield savings accounts and short-term CDs with rates of 4% or more is crucial, but high-yield savings accounts have variable rates subject to change. Consider the affordability of long-term CDs, despite lower rates, for their extended interest-earning potential. Contact your bank before maturity to discuss options and avoid automatic rollover into a lower-rate CD.</p>

          <p>Kohl's Corporation terminated CEO Ashley Buchanan for cause after an investigation revealed he violated the company's conflict-of-interest policies. Buchanan reportedly conducted business with a vendor with whom he had a personal relationship and failed to disclose the connection, resulting in his dismissal and forfeiture of equity awards. The termination was not related to the company's performance or financial reporting. Michael Bender, the board chair, has been appointed as interim CEO.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has halted $1 billion in funding for mental health services in schools, citing concerns that the programs, funded by a bipartisan law aimed at addressing gun violence, were no longer in the government's best interest. The Education Department claims grant recipients used the funding for race-based actions and discriminatory hiring practices. Democrats condemned the decision, arguing it undermines efforts to support students' mental health and violates congressional intent, while Republicans defended the move as necessary to ensure taxpayer dollars support effective, evidence-based practices.</p>

          <p>British vets could face price caps on medicines, prescriptions, and other services like cremations, as the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) considers changes to the veterinary sector. The investigation found treatment prices grew by 60% between 2015 and 2023, significantly higher than general inflation. The CMA is also considering a ban on bonuses linked to specific treatments and pushing for more transparency in pricing, including online displays and informing owners of cheaper options. The regulator expects to release a provisional report this summer, with a final decision by November.</p>

Firms like EAB and Ruffalo Noel Levitz (RNL) gather extensive data on prospective students to offer precision-guided discounts, described as "financial aid optimization." This process involves tracking teenagers' digital interactions and using sophisticated algorithms to set individual prices.

While the deal provides economic incentives for the US and includes language condemning Russia's invasion, it doesn't guarantee ongoing protection or signal a shift in Trump's relationship with Putin. The agreement's significance is limited, but it may encourage Trump to feel a political investment in the crisis, urging Putin to act more carefully.
