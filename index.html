          <p>NASA has introduced its newest class of 10 astronaut candidates, notable for being the agency's first to include more women than men. Selected from a pool of over 8,000 applicants, the diverse group includes pilots, engineers, a geologist, and a former SpaceX launch director who will now undergo two years of rigorous training. These new astronauts are preparing for future missions to the International Space Station, the Moon, and potentially Mars, joining the agency amidst challenges related to budget uncertainties and the ambitious Artemis program.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order officially labeling the decentralized anti-fascist movement known as antifa a "domestic terrorist organization." The order directs officials to investigate and disrupt alleged antifa operations, citing the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk as justification, although authorities have not publicly linked the suspect to the group. Legal experts have questioned the order's practical impact, noting the U.S. lacks a specific domestic terrorism statute and that antifa is considered a loose affiliation of activists rather than a structured organization.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is significantly reducing federal funding for medical research involving animals, canceling nearly $28 million in grants as part of a broader phase-out. This move is supported by an unusual coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan politicians who criticize the high cost and ethical implications of such experiments. However, the decision has sparked a fierce debate, as many crucial medical breakthroughs, including vaccines and therapies for severe illnesses, have historically relied on animal testing, leaving some patient groups concerned about the future of developing life-saving treatments.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced that the FDA will advise physicians about a potential association between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and an increased risk of autism, urging women to limit their use of drugs like Tylenol. This announcement, championed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was met with significant pushback from medical experts and Tylenol's manufacturer, who state there is no proven causal link. Major health organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, maintain that acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter pain reliever for pregnant women when used as directed.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the airwaves just days after being suspended indefinitely. The late-night show was pulled following comments Kimmel made regarding the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which drew sharp criticism and pressure from the FCC chairman. In its statement, Disney explained the suspension was intended to de-escalate a tense national situation but decided to reinstate the show after discussions with Kimmel, marking a significant moment in the ongoing debate over free speech and media accountability.</p>

          <p>With a government shutdown deadline fast approaching, President Trump is scheduled to meet with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. The meeting comes after competing Republican and Democratic funding proposals failed in the Senate, creating an impasse over the federal budget. Democratic leaders have insisted on negotiations to address their healthcare priorities and have warned that Republicans will be responsible for any shutdown. The outcome of the meeting could determine whether federal agencies remain open past the September 30 deadline.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case concerning President Trump's power to dismiss officials from independent federal agencies, a move that could reshape the executive branch's authority. The decision comes after the court allowed Trump to fire Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter while her legal challenge proceeds. This case will revisit a 1935 precedent, Humphrey's Executor, which has long protected commissioners from removal except for misconduct. The ruling could have significant implications for the independence of agencies designed to be insulated from political interference.</p>

          <p>In a series of recent actions, the Trump administration has intensified its campaign against political adversaries and First Amendment protections. These moves include directing the Attorney General to prosecute opponents, labeling antifa as domestic terrorists, and having the FCC chairman suggest punitive measures against critical media outlets. This pattern of using governmental power to target Democrats, liberal groups, and journalists has raised concerns among legal scholars and historians.

Citing the case of a pregnant U.S. citizen who was shackled during a raid, the petitioners argue that domestic legal channels have failed to provide recourse, necessitating international intervention to scrutinize the conduct of U.S. immigration agents.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas has created significant confusion, leading immigration attorneys to advise caution. While the White House clarified the fee applies only to new applicants and not renewals, lawyers point to ambiguities in the proclamation's text that could affect current visa holders who travel abroad. In response, some major tech companies have reportedly advised their H-1B employees to return to the U.S. immediately. Attorneys are advising clients with H-1B status to avoid international travel until the administration provides more detailed guidance on the policy's implementation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched a new immigration pathway, the "Trump Gold Card," which offers permanent residency to wealthy foreigners in exchange for a $1 million "unrestricted gift" to the Department of Commerce. This program effectively allows applicants to purchase an EB-1 or EB-2 visa, which are typically reserved for individuals with extraordinary abilities or advanced degrees. Unlike the existing EB-5 investor visa program, which requires investment in U.S. businesses, the Gold Card funds will be used more broadly, with the President stating they will help pay down national debt.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the 2012 Salmonella outbreak linked to Sunland, Inc. peanut butter, which was sold at major retailers including Costco and Trader Joe's. The contamination led to 42 illnesses across 20 states and a massive recall of over 400 products. The FDA ultimately took the unprecedented step of revoking the food facility registration for Sunland's New Mexico plant, citing a history of health violations. This action effectively halted the company's operations, and despite later regaining authorization, the financial damage was too severe, leading the nation's largest organic peanut butter producer to file for bankruptcy and cease operations in 2013.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is introducing a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if their condition does not improve after three visits. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer after her symptoms were repeatedly misdiagnosed as long Covid. The guidance encourages doctors to take further action, such as ordering more tests or seeking a second opinion, to prevent avoidable deaths from delayed diagnoses. The goal is to make this "three strikes and rethink" approach standard practice across the country.</p>

          <p>China is in the process of drafting its 15th five-year plan, which will guide the nation's economic and social development from 2026 to 2030. This long-term planning is a cornerstone of Beijing's governance and is considered crucial for achieving its goal of becoming a "moderately developed country" by 2035. As officials prepare for discussions at the upcoming fourth plenary session, the plan is expected to address rising uncertainties, including domestic economic challenges and a turbulent global landscape. Experts suggest the new plan may prioritize qualitative goals over rigid quantitative targets to allow for greater flexibility.</p>

          <p>A potential school shooting at a Northern California high school was thwarted after an anonymous tip was submitted through the "Say Something" reporting system. The tip line, created by the Sandy Hook Promise organization, alerted police in Menlo-Atherton to concerning online posts by a former student. Law enforcement quickly located the student and recovered weapons from their home, preventing a planned attack. This marks the 19th credible school attack the system has helped prevent since its 2018 launch, highlighting the critical role that community vigilance and anonymous reporting can play in ensuring school safety.</p>

Shedeur, once considered a potential first-round pick, was ultimately selected in the fifth round by the Cleveland Browns.
