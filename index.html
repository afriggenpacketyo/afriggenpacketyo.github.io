          <p>The U.S. Navy is evaluating the possibility of renaming several naval ships, including the USNS Harvey Milk, a replenishment oiler named after the gay rights leader and Navy veteran. Documents suggest this proposal aligns with the Trump administration's goal of "reestablishing the warrior culture" within the military, reversing efforts to honor civil rights leaders. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi criticized the potential name changes as a "shameful, vindictive erasure" of those who fought for equality. The USNS Harvey Milk, christened in 2021, symbolized inclusivity within the armed forces, but the Navy's move signals a shift in priorities. The ship's namesake, Harvey Milk, faced a court martial for participating in a "homosexual act" and resigned his commission in 1954 with an "Other Than Honorable" discharge.</p>

          <p>Antonio McDowell, after serving 28 years, has been fully exonerated following a judge's decision to overturn his wrongful conviction. McDowell was framed for murder by retired Chicago Police Detective Reynaldo Guevara, who has been accused of coercing false confessions in numerous cases. McDowell, who was initially a shooting victim, was framed after he refused to falsely identify Guevara's chosen suspect. McDowell is the 51st person to be exonerated in a case investigated by Guevara, who has never been charged with misconduct. The Exoneration Project and Loevy and Loevy represented and supported McDowell for years, leading to the dismissal of both his murder and carjacking convictions.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Donald Trump's tax-and-spending-cut bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" that will significantly increase the federal budget deficit. Musk, who previously supported Trump and even worked with his administration on the DOGE initiative to cut government spending, expressed his disappointment on social media. The White House dismissed Musk's criticism, while some Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Thomas Massie and Sen. Mike Lee, echoed Musk's concerns about the bill's impact on the national debt. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the budget package will raise the deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next decade, leading to broader debate within the Republican party.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Smoke from Canadian wildfires has spread across the Upper Midwest, prompting air quality alerts in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and parts of Nebraska and Michigan. These alerts advise vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, children, and individuals with respiratory issues, to remain indoors or limit outdoor activities to minimize exposure to the harmful pollutants in the air. The smoke is expected to persist for several days, impacting visibility and potentially causing respiratory problems for residents in the affected areas, with officials monitoring the situation closely and providing updates as conditions evolve. The situation underscores the far-reaching impacts of wildfires and the importance of heeding air quality warnings to protect public health. The air quality is expected to improve over the next few days as the weather patterns change. </p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging continued surveillance of norovirus outbreaks due to the emergence of a new strain, GII.17, which disrupted the typical seasonal pattern last year. The previous year's norovirus season started earlier than usual, driven by the GII.17 strain, raising concerns about whether this pattern could repeat. Researchers are uncertain if GII.17 will remain the dominant strain or if the traditional GII.4 strain will regain prevalence. Shifts in norovirus strains occur when new variants evade existing immunity, potentially leading to more frequent outbreaks earlier in the season.</p>

Thibodeau, who had been the Knicks coach since 2020, led the team to the postseason in four of his five seasons, including their first conference finals appearance since 2000. The decision, reportedly made by team president Leon Rose with approval from owner Jim Dolan, comes despite Thibodeau's success in revitalizing the franchise.

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing conservative and EU skeptic, has won the Polish presidential election, raising questions about the future of EU-Poland relations. Nawrocki's victory has been met with congratulations from right-wing leaders like Giorgia Meloni and Viktor Orban, while others, including Emmanuel Macron, have called on Poland to champion a Europe that respects the rule of law. While the Polish president has limited direct influence on EU policy, Nawrocki could obstruct the government's agenda by vetoing laws related to EU policy implementation. Observers anticipate potential clashes over issues such as the rule of law, abortion, migration, and climate policy.</p>

          <p>California will appeal a judge's decision to dismiss its lawsuit challenging Donald Trump's tariffs, arguing that the case should have been filed in a specialized trade court in New York. The ruling did not address the merits of California's lawsuit, which claims that Trump lacked the authority to impose the tariffs without congressional input. California argues that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, cited by Trump, does not authorize tariffs. The lawsuit challenges Trump's tariffs on imports from most U.S. trading partners, as well as tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada.</p>

The letters led to the arrest of Morales-Reyes by federal authorities, but prosecutors now say Scott wrote the letters himself.
