        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to ban employers from using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to prevent employees from reporting workplace sexual misconduct or discrimination. An amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will void confidentiality clauses used to conceal such allegations, a practice highlighted by cases involving Harvey Weinstein and Mohamed Al Fayed. Campaigners have lauded the move as a significant step toward protecting victims and addressing power imbalances. The legal change aims to align the UK with countries like Ireland and the US, which have already implemented similar prohibitions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has put forward a draft bill that would allow the government to reinstate military conscription during a national defense emergency. The plan is a compromise, designed to rapidly expand the armed forces in response to the changed security landscape in Europe, particularly Russian aggression. The bill aims to make voluntary service more attractive with higher pay, hoping to double the number of reservists to 200,000. This move comes as Germany seeks to meet new NATO troop requirements, which call for a total of 460,000 soldiers in a conflict scenario.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has agreed to a £55 million deal with Nottingham Forest to acquire Swedish winger Anthony Elanga. The 23-year-old is being brought in to bolster Newcastle's attacking capabilities as the team prepares for its return to the Champions League. Elanga had a successful 2024-25 season, contributing six goals and eleven assists for Nottingham Forest. The transfer represents a significant profit for Forest, who originally signed the player from Manchester United for £15 million in 2023, where he had progressed through the youth academy.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia has unexpectedly held its policy rate at 3.85%, diverging from economists' predictions of a rate cut. The central bank stated it needs more time to assess incoming data and confirm that inflation is sustainably on track to its 2.5% target. This decision comes despite inflation falling to a four-year low and the country experiencing a growth slowdown. Australia's Treasurer expressed disappointment with the decision, while some economists believe a rate cut is necessary to build economic momentum ahead of potential global tariff challenges.

Petro highlights actions taken by countries like Colombia, which suspended coal exports to Israel, and South Africa's case at the International Court of Justice.

          <p>This opinion article from Fox News argues that President Trump has experienced a series of significant successes, including a military strike on Iran's nuclear sites and a brokered ceasefire between Israel and Iran, yet continues to face negative media coverage. The author contends that many journalists denigrate his achievements due to personal animosity, reframing positive outcomes as incomplete or problematic. The article also touches upon a legal settlement with Paramount's parent company and the passage of a major bill, suggesting these wins were downplayed or criticized unfairly. It concludes by noting that while Trump's rhetoric can be divisive, the media's consistently critical stance is a long-standing pattern.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has announced a 15.1% drop in sales for the three months ending in June, attributing the decline partly to the threat of US tariffs. The company temporarily paused shipments to the United States in April after the Trump administration announced new tariff plans, impacting its performance in the North American market. The sales dip was also influenced by the planned discontinuation of older Jaguar models as the brand shifts its focus to a new lineup of electric vehicles.

          <p>The recent White House meeting between President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu is being viewed by some analysts as more of a public relations event than a substantive policy summit. While the leaders celebrated recent military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, they appeared to make little public progress on a Gaza ceasefire or a long-term plan for the region. Netanyahu expressed strong resistance to a two-state solution, a key component of U.S. regional strategy, creating a difficult balancing act for the Israeli leader. Analysts suggest that while Trump wants to claim a victory over Iran and de-escalate, Netanyahu remains focused on Iran as a long-term existential threat.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in Philadelphia's Grays Ferry neighborhood has left three men dead and nine other people, including two teenagers, injured. Police are searching for three suspects captured on surveillance video in connection with the early morning attack. Investigators recovered nearly 140 pieces of ballistic evidence from the scene and believe a weapon modified for automatic fire was used. The incident was part of a violent Fourth of July weekend in the city, prompting the police commissioner to vow that the city would not return to the high homicide rates of previous years.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices have recently formed a "golden cross," a technical chart pattern where the 50-day moving average rises above the 200-day moving average. This event, also observed in the MSCI World Index for the first time since January 2023, is often interpreted by analysts as a signal of a potential long-term bull market. Historical data suggests that this pattern has frequently preceded periods of significant market gains, with the S&P 500 rising in the following year 88% of the time since 1975.

          <p>President Trump has announced that the U.S. will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine, stating the country must be able to defend itself against intense attacks from Russia. This decision comes just days after the White House confirmed it had paused some weapons shipments as part of a broader review of U.S. military stockpiles. The President mentioned he was "not happy with President Putin at all" following a recent phone call. The Pentagon confirmed it is sending the additional weapons at the President's direction to ensure Ukraine can defend itself while the U.S. works toward a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Singapore is emerging as an increasingly popular destination for Chinese students seeking overseas education, as the United States loses some of its appeal. Some Chinese students currently in the U.S. cite difficulties adjusting to cultural differences and parental safety concerns as reasons for considering a move to Singapore for postgraduate studies. The island nation's cultural similarities, safe environment, and economic openness are significant draws. Industry insiders predict that Singapore's universities may see a rise in applications from China due to the growing uncertainty and instability perceived in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) appears to be phasing out the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screenings at some U.S. airports. Sources confirmed the change, which has been observed at airports including Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, and Philadelphia, with reports of the same policy at LAX and LaGuardia. The rule, which does not affect TSA PreCheck members, was officially implemented nationwide in 2006 following the failed 2001 "shoe bomber" attempt. The TSA stated it is always exploring ways to enhance the passenger experience while maintaining strong security.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost 9-1 to the Milwaukee Brewers, marking their fourth consecutive defeat, after starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto had the shortest outing of his MLB career. Yamamoto gave up five runs in a disastrous first inning, recording only two outs before being pulled from the game after 41 pitches. A combination of poor pitch execution, questionable defensive plays, and a three-run homer by newly acquired Brewer Andrew Vaughn contributed to the collapse. The shorthanded Dodgers lineup was unable to mount a comeback against Brewers' All-Star pitcher Freddy Peralta.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has voted to permanently amend a rule to protect tenants from "renovictions," where landlords evict residents under the guise of substantial remodels to charge higher rents. The new ordinance will prevent landlords from using a remodel as a "just cause" for eviction unless they have an official order from a government agency to vacate the unit for safety reasons. The city is also developing rules to require landlords to provide and pay for comparable temporary housing for displaced tenants during legitimate renovations, ensuring they can return to their original unit afterward.</p>

          <p>China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa in an effort to boost its economy and tourism sector. The move has led to a noticeable increase in foreign visitors, with travel companies reporting a surge in bookings, particularly from European countries included in the new policy. While most visitors are still domestic tourists, tour guides are preparing for a larger influx of international travelers. The policy notably excludes major African nations and offers a more restrictive transit option for citizens of the US, UK, and Canada.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has projected a 56% drop in its second-quarter operating profit, falling significantly short of analyst expectations. The South Korean tech giant is struggling to meet the demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, a critical component for AI processors dominated by market leader Nvidia. The disappointing forecast is attributed to operating losses in its foundry business and the muted performance of its HBM division, as it has reportedly faced delays in getting its latest chips certified by Nvidia. This has put Samsung behind competitors like SK Hynix and Micron. (not investment advice)</p>
