          <p>President Trump announced on social media that Israel and Iran have agreed to a complete ceasefire, set to begin around midnight EDT, involving two 12-hour periods. The announcement came two days after the U.S. launched strikes on Iranian nuclear targets in response to Israel's initial strikes. Prior to the ceasefire announcement, Iran fired missiles targeting Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, raising concerns about escalation, but a U.S. official said the missiles were intercepted with assistance from Qatar. Trump congratulated both countries on having the stamina, courage, and intelligence to end what he called 'THE 12 DAY WAR.'</p>

          <p>Officials reported that eight people died after a 27-foot Chris-Craft boat capsized on Lake Tahoe due to a large swell near D.L. Bliss State Park. The Coast Guard initially reported six adults dead, two rescued, and two missing, later recovering the bodies of the missing individuals. ALERTCalifornia cameras captured a storm system moving through the area, bringing snow and 40-45 mph winds. Coop Cooper, a marina manager with Coast Guard experience, emphasized the importance of preparedness, including having a radio, wearing life vests, and taking a boating course, especially given the rapidly changing weather conditions in the area.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston issued an injunction, blocking the Trump administration from implementing a plan to bar foreign nationals from studying at Harvard University. The injunction extends a previous temporary order preventing the administration from enforcing a proclamation citing national security concerns.

The university has filed lawsuits seeking to unfreeze funding and prevent the administration from blocking international students, citing free speech rights.</p>

          <p>Chongqing, China's largest inland city, has evolved into a hub for international trade, driven by two cross-border rail networks connecting to Europe and Southeast Asia. These routes offer faster and more reliable access to global markets, positioning Chongqing as a central node in the global economy. The city aspires to become a rail-based "Suez Canal," facilitating trade between Asia and Europe. Shipping goods from Asean to Europe via Chongqing is reportedly 10 to 20 days faster than traditional sea transport, highlighting the city's strategic importance amid rising geopolitical risks.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the federal government will fund Florida's effort to establish immigration detention centers, including a proposed site in the Everglades dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz."

          <p>Florida officials have petitioned the Supreme Court to allow the state to enforce a new immigration law criminalizing unlawful entry into Florida. Attorney General James Uthmeier argues that the law is necessary to protect Florida's citizens from the harms of illegal immigration. A federal judge previously blocked the law, deeming it likely unconstitutional, and found Uthmeier in contempt for challenging the judge's order. The state's law aims to assist the Trump administration in curbing illegal immigration and aligns with federal immigration law.</p>

          <p>The dollar fell, while the Australian and New Zealand dollars rose following President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. The risk-sensitive Aussie and kiwi currencies benefited from the news, which sparked a risk rally across markets. Dovish comments from Federal Reserve policymaker Michelle Bowman, suggesting the U.S. central bank should consider interest rate cuts soon, also contributed to the dollar's decline. Markets are pricing in a higher chance of a Fed rate cut in July. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear sites have sparked bipartisan efforts in Congress to reassert its power to declare war. House Speaker Mike Johnson suggests the push is now irrelevant due to the announced ceasefire between Israel and Iran, though neither country has commented. Democrats are seeking more information from the White House regarding the rationale behind the strikes. A war powers resolution has been introduced, requiring Congress to authorize force against Iran, but its chances of passage are uncertain.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran launched missiles against the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. In addition to U.S. air bases, Iran's potential responses include attacking U.S. military assets, closing the Strait of Hormuz, and conducting asymmetric warfare. The U.S. operates military bases in several Middle Eastern countries, including Qatar, Bahrain, and Iraq. Closing the Strait of Hormuz could cause global economic and energy disruption, while terror and cyber attacks pose long-term threats.
