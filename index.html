          <p>The funeral of Pope Francis is drawing world leaders together, presenting an opportunity for informal diplomatic discussions. While formal meetings are unlikely due to the solemn nature of the occasion, leaders may engage in brief 'brush-by' conversations on the sidelines. Attention is focused on potential talks between Presidents Trump and Zelensky regarding the conflict in Ukraine, although seating arrangements might keep them apart. The funeral also provides a neutral ground for leaders who may be subject to European travel sanctions to attend.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's actions against the media, including banning reporters and attempting to defund public broadcasters, have sparked legal battles over press freedom. Courts have ruled in favor of organizations like Voice of America and the Associated Press in lawsuits against the White House. Free speech advocates warn that these freedoms require active defense, especially with potential future actions against media outlets. The administration is expected to block federal funding for NPR and CBS, raising concerns about government control over messaging.</p>

          <p>The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has issued interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining 'woman' and 'sex' as biological.

In schools, pupils who identify as trans girls should not be permitted to use the girls' toilets or changing facilities, and vice versa. A consultation is planned to seek views from stakeholders.</p>

          <p>The US and Iran have engaged in a third round of talks, in an effort to create a new accord to avert another conflict in the Middle East. President Trump abandoned a previous nuclear deal with Iran in 2018, saying it was a flawed agreement. The talks have the potential to reshape regional and global security by reducing the chance of a U.S.-backed Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities and preventing Iran from producing a nuclear weapon.</p>
