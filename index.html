            <p>Sarah Palin's libel lawsuit against The New York Times, stemming from a 2017 editorial, is set for a retrial after an appeals court cited flaws in the initial proceedings. Palin alleges the editorial falsely linked her campaign rhetoric to a mass shooting, damaging her reputation. The Times acknowledges inaccuracies but claims they were quickly corrected as an honest mistake. The retrial occurs amid heightened scrutiny of media outlets by political figures, including former President Trump, adding further complexity to the case.</p>

The sketch, which parodied Wood's role in "The White Lotus," featured exaggerated prosthetic teeth, which Wood found misogynistic and a form of "punching down." Wood expressed that she was open to being made fun of when it's clever and in good spirits, but the sketch's focus on her teeth felt cheap and lacked nuance.

Noboa, who assumed office in November 2023, has focused on a tough military crackdown on criminal gangs. His left-wing challenger, Luisa González, has disputed the results and claimed fraud. Noboa's victory gives him a mandate to continue his "war" on drug gangs, including militarizing streets and prisons, and constructing maximum-security facilities.</p>

            <p>China's exports experienced a significant surge in March, but analysts suggest this may be a temporary "final hurrah" before the impact of increased tariffs from the United States takes effect. Outbound shipments rose significantly, but imports declined, resulting in a large trade surplus. The looming tariff increases from the US are expected to disrupt global trade and create uncertainty for businesses, potentially leading to a decline in Chinese exports in the coming months.</p>
