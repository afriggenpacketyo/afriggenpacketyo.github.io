          <p>HSBC, Europe's largest lender, reported first-quarter results that surpassed estimates, driven by strong performance in its wealth business and corporate and institutional banking segment. The bank announced a share buyback of up to $3 billion, planned for completion before the announcement of its 2025 interim results. While pre-tax profit declined 25% year-on-year, it surged nearly 317% from the previous quarter, with CEO Georges Elhedery expressing confidence in the bank's ability to meet its targets despite macroeconomic uncertainties and protectionist trade policies. DBS Bank analysts anticipate that HSBC's restructuring will yield positive cost-saving impacts, although potential headwinds from tariffs and global recession concerns may emerge in subsequent quarters.</p>

          <p>A company controlled by controversial millionaire Doug Barrowman administered Prince Andrew's business asset, Pitch@Palace Global, for two years. This revelation adds to the scrutiny surrounding Prince Andrew's finances and business associates, especially after his Newsnight interview in 2019. Barrowman and his wife, Baroness Michelle Mone, previously faced controversy for their involvement with a company that secured substantial government contracts during the Covid-19 pandemic. The National Crime Agency is investigating suspected criminal offenses at the firm, though both Barrowman and Mone deny any wrongdoing, raising questions about the prince's financial dealings and associations with controversial figures.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal party have won the Canadian federal election, defeating Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, though it is unclear if they will secure a majority. The election was significantly influenced by U.S. President Donald Trump's threats of tariffs and calls to make Canada the 51st state, which boosted support for the Liberals. Carney, who took over from Justin Trudeau shortly before the election, ran on a platform of defending Canada's sovereignty and economy against Trump's actions. The Liberal victory marks a turnaround for the party, which had faced declining popularity before Trudeau's resignation.</p>

The party, led by Nigel Farage, is capitalizing on public frustration over struggling public services, high costs of living, and cultural divisions. Gold attended a Reform U.K. rally in Birmingham, noting the party's adeptness at channeling public outrage and offering a platform for those who feel left behind by mainstream politics. The party's chaotic nature and controversial figures raise questions about its long-term viability, but its ability to tap into real anger suggests a potential shift in the British political landscape.</p>

          <p>Despite Donald Trump's campaign promise to end the Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours, a peace deal remains elusive after his first 100 days in office. While the U.S. has initiated discussions with both Russia and Ukraine, progress has been limited, and Washington has threatened to withdraw from negotiations without imminent signs of compromise. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized the critical nature of the coming week for ceasefire talks. The possibility of Ukraine ceding territory, such as Crimea, as part of a deal has emerged, though European diplomats remain skeptical of Russia's genuine desire for peace.</p>

Other priorities include a promised tax cut for middle-class Canadians and streamlining approval processes for key energy and mining projects.

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberals secured victory in Canada's federal election, largely driven by a backlash against Donald Trump's policies and rhetoric. Trump's tariff threats and undermining of Canadian sovereignty shifted the campaign focus to leadership and economic survival, allowing Carney to position himself as a defender of Canada against American aggression. This strategy proved effective in reversing the Liberals' previously unfavorable polling numbers. The election outcome highlights the significant impact of international relations on domestic politics and the challenges facing the Conservative opposition in a political climate dominated by anti-Trump sentiment.</p>

          <p>Families of Japanese nationals abducted by North Korea decades ago are planning to meet with U.S. government officials and lawmakers to seek support for the victims' early return. Takuya Yokota, the brother of Megumi Yokota, and others will travel to Washington to convey their desire for the abduction issue to be addressed in negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea. With the international situation fluid, the families hope the U.S. will prioritize the issue, especially given President Trump's stated relationship with Kim Jong Un.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "border czar" Tom Homan defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, claiming it was not a mistake despite a prior withholding order protecting him from removal. Homan asserted that the facts surrounding the order had changed, labeling Abrego Garcia a "terrorist" due to alleged MS-13 affiliation. However, Abrego Garcia's attorneys deny any gang membership and note his lack of a criminal record. The incident has sparked controversy, with El Salvador's president refusing to send Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. and a federal judge setting a deadline for the Trump administration's response.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to announce measures to ease the impact of tariffs on imported cars and car parts, providing automakers more time to relocate production to the United States. While tariffs of 25 percent on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, they will be modified to avoid stacking with other tariffs, such as those on steel and aluminum. Automakers will also be reimbursed for a portion of the tariffs on imported components, phased out over two years. Despite these changes, substantial tariffs will remain, potentially increasing prices for new and used cars.</p>
