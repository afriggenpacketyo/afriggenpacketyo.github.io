          <p>The UK's Labour government is grappling with significant internal dissent over proposed changes to disability benefits, particularly the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). Despite holding a large majority, Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces a potential rebellion from 40 to 50 of his own MPs who are concerned the reforms will harm vulnerable people. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall's attempts to reassure backbenchers have been met with skepticism. The controversy highlights a deep ideological divide within the party regarding fiscal responsibility versus social welfare protections.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting a 'vote-a-rama,' a lengthy series of amendment votes, on President Trump's massive domestic spending bill. Republicans are pushing to pass the legislation before a self-imposed July 4 deadline, while Democrats are using the process to force votes on controversial provisions. The bill includes increased spending on border security and defense, offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. The process has been marked by procedural delays and partisan maneuvering, with the final outcome depending on a handful of potential Republican holdouts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has identified a naturally occurring compound, betaine, as a key factor in how long-term exercise slows the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine is produced in the kidneys during exercise and works by inhibiting an enzyme linked to inflammation and organ aging. This discovery provides a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the health benefits of physical activity. It also suggests potential for future anti-aging strategies that could simulate the effects of exercise.</p>

The article follows the personal stories of officers like Maj. Kara Corcoran, who face the end of their long careers and potential loss of benefits.

          <p>A major spending bill proposed by the Trump administration is causing concern among Americans who rely on programs facing significant cuts. The legislation aims to offset tax cuts by reducing funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid, potentially affecting millions. The article highlights the fears of individuals who depend on these benefits for food and healthcare. Simultaneously, the bill's phasing out of green energy tax incentives has small business owners in the solar industry worried about having to lay off employees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health suggests that practical obstacles are a primary cause for declining childhood vaccination rates in the UK. Rather than vaccine hesitancy, parents face challenges such as difficulty booking appointments, lack of reminders, and limited access to clear information. This decline has led to a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough. Experts are calling for improvements, including better use of NHS apps for booking and more accessible vaccination services, to meet public health targets.</p>
