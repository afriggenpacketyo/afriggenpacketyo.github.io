          <p>The Trump administration is widening its immigration crackdown by targeting workplaces that rely on immigrant labor, leading to protests. Industries dependent on immigrant labor are facing increased scrutiny and workplace raids. Some raids have sparked public demonstrations against the administration's policies. The administration's actions aim to enforce immigration laws and deter the employment of undocumented workers, but critics argue these measures disrupt the economy and instill fear in communities. Optimism in the face of the government's heavy handed policies is low.</p>

          <p>Millions of people in the Southern United States, from Texas to the Carolinas, are under threat from severe storms, with over 40 million Americans in the potential impact zone.

The severe weather pattern is expected to continue into Sunday and Monday, posing risks of damaging wind gusts, large hail, and isolated tornadoes in areas from Louisiana to South Carolina; the level 4 out of 5 threat indicates a "moderate risk" has now been issued for portions of southern Oklahoma and northern Texas, including Lawton, Oklahoma and Wichita Falls, Texas.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty triumphed over Journalism in the 157th Belmont Stakes held at Saratoga Springs, New York, marking a repeat of their Derby finish. Sovereignty, with 2-to-1 odds, won the race in muddy conditions, skipping the Preakness Stakes between the Derby and Belmont, a first for any horse. Journalism, the Preakness winner and heavy favorite, finished second, while Baeza secured third place, mirroring the Derby's top three. Jockey Junior Alvarado, who also rode Sovereignty to victory at the Derby, was his mount on Saturday, despite a previous fine and suspension for his use of the riding crop in the Derby, which he is appealing.</p>

Journalism, who won the Preakness, was the morning-line favorite for the Belmont but ultimately finished second. The Belmont was held at Saratoga Race Course instead of Belmont Park due to ongoing renovations, shortening the race to 1 1/4 miles.</p>

          <p>The conflict between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has amplified concerns about NASA's budget, which is facing significant cuts that could affect numerous science missions. The proposed budget would reduce funding for science projects by nearly half, potentially leading to the shutdown of forty science missions. Trump has threatened to withdraw federal contracts from Musk's SpaceX, a critical partner for NASA in resupplying the International Space Station and developing rockets for lunar and Martian missions. Experts warn that this uncertainty could have a chilling effect on the human space program, which relies on long-term planning and cooperation.</p>

          <p>Families of Ukrainian civilians held captive in Russian prisons fear that peace talks will not prioritize their loved ones' release. Nearly 16,000 Ukrainian civilians are estimated to be in Russian captivity, with no clear mechanism for their return under the Geneva Convention. There are growing concerns that these civilians could be forgotten or lost amid progress towards peace negotiations. Ukrainian officials acknowledge the lack of a legal framework for securing the release of civilian detainees.</p>
