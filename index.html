          <p>A federal workers union has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that the Department of Education forced civil servants to include partisan messages in their out-of-office emails during the government shutdown. The lawsuit claims this action violates employees' First Amendment rights by compelling them to advocate for a political agenda. Legal experts suggest these messages, which blamed "Democrat Senators" and the "Radical Left" for the shutdown, may also breach federal ethics laws like the Hatch Act. This unprecedented use of government communications for political messaging has drawn widespread concern from federal workers and prompted a congressional investigation request.</p>

          <p>Russell Martin has been sacked as Rangers FC head coach after just 17 games, following a chaotic period marked by poor results and fan animosity. Despite securing the role after an impressive interview, Martin's team struggled significantly, including a 9-1 aggregate loss in the Champions League play-offs and an 11-point deficit in the Premiership. Fans consistently called for his removal, leading to an unseemly police escort after a recent draw. Martin's perceived tendency to blame others for the team's failures, coupled with unpopular decisions and a substantial transfer budget that yielded little success, contributed to his early departure.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is gradually restarting some production this week, beginning with its Wolverhampton engine factory, after a major cyberattack forced a complete shutdown of its global operations in August. The incident, which paralyzed manufacturing and parts distribution, is estimated to have cost the company at least £50 million weekly. The resumption offers relief to JLR's supply chain, including small businesses that faced immense financial pressure, prompting a £1.5 billion government loan guarantee. However, full operational capacity is weeks away, and experts warn of lasting impacts on the supply chain due to the extensive disruption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates widespread concern among Americans over the government shutdown, primarily due to its potential economic impact. Few believe either party's stance justifies the shutdown, resulting in low approval ratings for President Trump, congressional Democrats, and Republicans regarding their handling of the crisis. While Democrats are often described as "weak," Republicans are labeled "extreme," highlighting a general dissatisfaction with both parties. The public also feels the Trump administration is not sufficiently focused on lowering prices, and many believe his policies are costing jobs.</p>

          <p>Gisèle Pelicot, a victim of mass sexual assault, returns to court to face one of her attackers appealing a previous conviction where 51 men were found guilty of sexually assaulting her. Her public stance initially galvanized the fight against sexual violence in France, but optimism is waning due to perceived governmental inaction and a rise in "sexual assault culture ideas." Despite a tripling of sexual assault complaints, conviction rates remain flat, and a scathing Senate report criticized the government's lack of a strategic compass. However, recent arrests and convictions, including that of Gérard Depardieu for sexual assault, offer intermittent jolts of hope for campaigners.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump addressed service members during the U.S. Navy's 250th anniversary, pledging that they would receive "every last penny" of their pay and an "across-the-board" raise once the government shutdown concludes. While active-duty troops continue to work without immediate pay, and thousands of civilian War Department employees are furloughed, Trump sought to alleviate financial uncertainty. He reiterated his administration's stance, blaming Democrats for the shutdown and its impact on military families and support programs. This assurance comes as the shutdown enters its fifth day, causing significant financial strain for many federal workers.</p>

          <p>Veteran journalist Lesley Stahl shared her experience interviewing the "band" Spinal Tap on the set of their sequel, "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues." Expecting to speak with the actors, Stahl found herself immersed in an improvised encounter with Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer, who remained in character. Director Rob Reiner explained the film's unique mockumentary style, where dialogue is entirely improvised from an outline, making the editing process akin to a jigsaw puzzle without a picture. This approach, pioneered by the original "This is Spinal Tap," has influenced modern comedy, showcasing the actors' natural comedic gifts.</p>

          <p>Two semitrucks carrying over $1 million worth of Santo Tequila, co-founded by Guy Fieri, vanished last year in a sophisticated online cargo theft operation. International crime groups used fake trucking company profiles, spoofed GPS signals, and unsuspecting drivers to divert the shipment, highlighting a growing new crime called "double brokering." CargoNet, a company aiding law enforcement, reported over $230 million in goods stolen last year, with California being a prime target. While the masterminds remain at large, the LAPD's Cargo Theft Unit successfully recovered 11,000 bottles of the special tequila, offering a partial happy ending to the costly incident.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has strengthened in the Pacific Ocean and is expected to intensify further, posing a threat to Mexico's southwestern coast and the Baja California peninsula. Although its center is forecast to remain offshore, tropical storm conditions, including powerful winds and heavy rainfall, are anticipated through early next week. Rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches could lead to flash flooding, particularly in higher terrain areas. Additionally, Priscilla is expected to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along coastal regions. Authorities have issued tropical storm watches, urging residents to prepare for severe weather.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced his intention to sue the White House after President Trump ordered 300 California National Guard members to Portland, Oregon. This move follows a federal judge's temporary block on Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard, citing a lack of evidence for significant violence in Portland. Newsom condemned Trump's actions as a "breathtaking abuse of the law and power," accusing the administration of ignoring court orders and blurring the lines between civil and military rule. The Pentagon confirmed the deployment, stating it was to protect federal assets and personnel.</p>

A probable cause affidavit reveals security footage from two hotels corroborated the 69-year-old truck driver's account, who claimed Sanchez, smelling of alcohol, confronted him and repeatedly tried to enter his truck. The situation escalated when the driver, fearing for his life, pepper-sprayed Sanchez and then stabbed him multiple times in self-defense. Both men were hospitalized, with Sanchez in critical condition, and the prosecutor emphasized that such an incident should never have escalated to violence.</p>
