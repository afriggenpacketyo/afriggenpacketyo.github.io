          <p>A Chinese national, Haoxiang Gao, who was charged with illegal voting at the University of Michigan in October 2024, has fled the United States, according to the FBI. Gao admitted to registering and casting a vote on campus, and was subsequently charged with unauthorized elector attempting to vote and making a false affidavit. Despite a judge ordering him to surrender his passport and remain in Michigan, Gao boarded a flight to Shanghai using a different passport. The case highlights rare instances of non-citizens voting in federal elections, with analysis indicating only 30 suspected cases out of 23.5 million votes cast in reviewed jurisdictions. Optimism regarding the integrity of the American voting process remains moderate in light of this incident.</p>

          <p>As the Senate prepares to consider President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Republicans are divided over its potential impact on the national debt. While the bill aims to reduce outlays by over $1.5 trillion, it is projected to add about $3.1 trillion to the debt, leading to opposition from fiscal hawks like Rand Paul and Ron Johnson. The White House defends the bill, citing a $1.6 trillion savings, but faces criticism from scorekeepers. The Senate's changes to the bill must be approved by the House, creating further complications for its passage.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic discusses the recent violent attacks targeting Jewish communities in the US, framing them as acts of "performative intimacy" intended to inflict horror on a specific community. The attacks, such as the one in Boulder, Colorado, and the shooting in Washington, D.C., are seen as attempts to make all Jewish Americans feel vulnerable. The author argues that pervasive antisemitism enables attackers to believe they are striking back at Israel by targeting any Jew, and calls for the delegitimization of such acts and a clear distinction between Israel's actions and the identity of Jewish people.</p>
