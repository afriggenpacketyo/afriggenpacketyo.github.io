          <h2>Government Considers Extending Sugar Tax to Milkshakes and Lattes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 04:09:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government is considering extending the sugar tax to include milkshakes and pre-packaged lattes, aiming to reduce sugar consumption, particularly among children. This proposal involves reducing the maximum sugar content allowed in drinks before the levy applies, potentially affecting a large portion of milk-based drinks on the market. While the government argues that the health benefits of these drinks do not justify the excess sugar, critics contend that the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families. The consultation period will run until July, with industry bodies already expressing their views on the matter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists at Morgan Stanley predict that the US and China will engage in trade negotiations, leading to a gradual reduction in tariffs on Chinese imports by the end of the second quarter. Comprehensive talks later in the year could further reduce tariffs, reflecting the removal of fentanyl-related tariffs. However, significant damage has already been inflicted on the economic cycle due to the existing trade disruptions. Washington has imposed tariffs totaling 145 percent on Chinese imports, while Beijing's levies on US goods have risen to 125 percent.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party is expected to secure enough seats to form a government in Canada, fueled by a backlash against President Trump's policies and rhetoric. While the Liberals are leading in seat projections, it remains uncertain whether they will achieve a majority. The Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, are positioned to remain the opposition, with both major parties experiencing a rise in their national vote share at the expense of smaller parties. Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic Party, lost his seat.</p>

          <p>Following the Liberal Party's projected victory in the Canadian election, Prime Minister Mark Carney is emphasizing the need for national unity in the face of trade threats and potential tariffs from US President Donald Trump. Carney presented himself as the most experienced leader to navigate this crisis, warning that Trump "is trying to break us, so America can own us." While the Liberals secured a victory, they may not have a clear majority, requiring them to work with other parties to govern effectively. The close vote share between the Liberals and Conservatives indicates divisions within the country.</p>

          <p>Sophie Power's experience as an ultrarunner, particularly a viral photo of her breastfeeding during a race, has led to significant changes for women in sports. After being made redundant, she signed up for an ultramarathon, which evolved into a passion that promoted change for women in sport. The photograph highlighted the lack of support for mothers in athletic competitions, prompting events like the London Marathon to implement pregnancy deferral policies. Power's work has been central to this positive change.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party achieved a notable victory in the Canadian election, significantly influenced by Donald Trump's actions. The US president's consistent criticism of Canada and suggestions of annexation coincided with a dramatic shift in the Liberal Party's prospects. Carney focused on the perceived threat from the US, warning that Trump aimed to exploit Canada's resources and sovereignty. While Trump's stance against Trudeau differed from his approach to Carney, the political and policy divergence between the two countries is expected to persist.</p>

          <p>Four former Hong Kong lawmakers have been released from prison after serving over four years for national security convictions. Claudia Mo, Gary Fan, Jeremy Tam, and Kwok Ka-ki were part of the "Hong Kong 47" group charged with conspiracy to commit subversion for participating in an unofficial primary poll in 2020. Critics argue that the lawsuit was part of a broader effort by Beijing to suppress rights and democracy in Hong Kong. The national security law, imposed in 2020, has significantly altered Hong Kong's political landscape.</p>

Analysts attribute the city's performance to a high baseline from the previous year and unique pressures from the trade war and industrial transition.

          <p>Mark Carney has declared victory in the Canadian election, stating that Canada will "win this trade war" with the US. Opposition leader Pierre Poilievre conceded defeat, although his party gained more than 20 seats. The election was significantly influenced by US President Donald Trump's statements about making Canada the 51st US state, which were widely condemned by Canadian politicians. Carney's success marks a comeback for the Liberals, who had suffered declining popularity before Justin Trudeau's resignation.</p>
