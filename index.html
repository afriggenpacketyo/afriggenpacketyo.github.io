          <p>The Israeli military has escalated its operations in Gaza, conducting intense airstrikes and mobilizing forces for a further ground incursion, aiming to dismantle Hamas and retrieve hostages. These actions have prompted civilian displacement and dire warnings from international bodies regarding famine risks due to aid blockades. Despite ongoing efforts by mediators, including the Trump administration, to negotiate a truce, Hamas insists on a permanent ceasefire and Israeli withdrawal as preconditions for hostage release.

          <p>As the Trump administration intensifies efforts to collect on student loans, borrowers facing delinquency or default need to take immediate action to protect their finances. Delinquency occurs after missing a payment, potentially leading to credit score drops and higher borrowing costs, while default, after 270 days of non-payment, triggers severe consequences such as wage garnishments and seizure of tax refunds. The article advises borrowers to contact their loan servicers promptly to request retroactive forbearance and enroll in affordable repayment plans, including income-driven options, to avoid these adverse outcomes.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously overturned a federal appeals court's decision in a police violence case, Barnes v. Felix, emphasizing the need to consider the 'totality of the circumstances' when evaluating excessive force claims. The case involved a fatal police shooting during a traffic stop, and the Fifth Circuit Court had narrowly focused only on the moment of the shooting, disregarding preceding events. The Supreme Court's ruling requires the lower court to reconsider the case, taking into account all relevant factors leading up to the incident, which could impact how courts assess police conduct in similar situations.</p>

          <p>Hungary's ruling Fidesz party, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has introduced a controversial 'transparency law' that critics say mirrors Russian tactics to suppress dissent. The law would allow the government to monitor, restrict, and potentially ban organizations, including media outlets, deemed threats to national sovereignty based on vague criteria such as negatively portraying Hungarian constitutional values. Opponents argue this legislation will criminalize criticism of Orban's regime, stifle independent media, and undermine democratic institutions, further aligning Hungary with authoritarian practices.</p>

          <p>A new book, 'Original Sin' by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, examines President Biden's alleged cognitive decline, describing him as frail and forgetful while his inner circle attempts to conceal his condition. The authors suggest that Biden's decision to run for re-election, despite signs of diminished capacity, and the subsequent efforts to hide his symptoms, constitute a disservice to the American people. The book also delves into the dynamics within the White House, where a small group of advisors exert significant control, raising questions about transparency and leadership.</p>

          <p>Growing reports of German tourists being detained and scrutinized by U.S. immigration authorities have led to a significant decline in travel to the United States, particularly after the Trump administration's intensified immigration crackdown. Incidents of strip searches, detentions, and denied entry have created a climate of fear among potential German visitors, causing many to reconsider their travel plans. This decline in tourism is raising concerns about the economic impact, especially in states like California, which are popular destinations for German tourists.</p>

The justices sent the case back to a lower court to consider whether the law can be used to deport the immigrants, directing it to examine claims by the migrants that they could not be legally deported under the Alien Enemies Act, the centuries-old wartime law invoked by the Trump administration. The justices said the appeals court should also examine what kind of notice the government should be required to provide that would allow migrants the opportunity to challenge their deportations.</p>

Japan's third-biggest automaker by volume said earlier this week it will shut seven vehicle plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally after logging a net loss of 670.90 billion yen ($4.6 billion) for fiscal 2024. The two plants are Nissan's main Oppama plant in Yokosuka, where the company pioneered electric vehicle production, and the Shonan plant of its subsidiary Nissan Shatai Co. in Hiratsuka, which builds commercial vehicles. Together, they account for about 30 percent of Nissan's domestic production capacity.</p>
