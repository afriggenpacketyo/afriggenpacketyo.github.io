          <p>China's exports grew by 7.2% in July, surpassing forecasts, while imports saw their largest increase in a year, rising by 4.1%. This strong performance has provided significant support to the Chinese economy, driven partly by businesses front-loading shipments ahead of a potential escalation in US-China trade disputes. Despite the overall positive numbers, exports to the United States continued to decline for the fourth consecutive month, falling by 21.7%, a drop offset by increased trade with Southeast Asia and the European Union.

          <p>The Trump administration has officially implemented new tariffs of 10% or higher on goods from over 60 countries and the European Union. While the White House anticipates this will boost domestic manufacturing and bring in revenue, economists express concern over potential negative consequences. Early data since the initial tariff announcements in April suggest a stall in hiring, rising inflation, and a decline in home values, indicating potential self-inflicted economic harm. Critics, including former administration allies, argue the policy lacks clear rationale and could lead to sustained economic erosion rather than a sudden shock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US has increased tariffs on Indian goods to 50%, citing India's oil trade with Russia as the reason for the additional 25% levy. While the move could cost India's economy billions, analysts suggest the immediate impact may be more symbolic, as the new duties have a 21-day implementation window, potentially allowing for negotiations. Sectors like gems, jewelry, textiles, and chemicals are considered most vulnerable to the tariffs, whereas key exports like IT services and pharmaceuticals are not currently targeted.

          <p>New US tariffs have been enacted, affecting over 90 countries with varying rates, as part of a broader strategy to reshape global trade. President Trump also announced a 50% tariff on India for purchasing Russian oil and threatened a 100% tariff on foreign-made computer chips to encourage domestic production. While some major partners like the EU, UK, and Japan have negotiated lower rates, others like Laos and Myanmar face levies as high as 40%. The implementation provides some clarity after months of uncertainty, though the long-term economic impacts remain a significant concern for global markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor reported an 11% drop in its quarterly operating profit, directly attributing a 450 billion yen loss to the impact of US tariffs. Despite the profit decline, the company experienced strong global sales, but was forced to revise its full-year operating income forecast downward. The situation reflects a broader trend among Japanese automakers, who have been absorbing higher tariff-related costs to maintain their market share in the United States. A recent US-Japan trade deal is expected to lower auto tariffs from 25% to 15%, which may help stabilize earnings in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

In contrast, some analysts are expressing greater concern over the United States' debt challenges, which are concentrated at the federal level. This gives Beijing more flexibility to intervene and support local governments, a tool less available to Washington for its national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major funding freeze by the Trump administration is severely disrupting scientific research at Harvard University, with an estimated $2.6 billion in federal grants cut off. The action is part of a broader conflict where the administration accused the university of tolerating antisemitism and demanded sweeping changes, which Harvard resisted, calling it a retaliatory campaign. Prominent researchers are now forced to lay off staff and shelve years of work on critical topics like multiple sclerosis, cancer, and opioid addiction. While the university has pledged its own funds to mitigate the damage, scientists warn that the interruption could set their research back by years.</p>

Analysts suggest China's larger trade volume with the US and its control over rare earth minerals give it more bargaining power.

A specific vulnerability in the Camaro's onboard data port makes it relatively easy to steal for those with the right technology and knowledge.

Researchers found that depleting lithium in mice accelerated brain changes associated with aging and Alzheimer's, while maintaining normal levels was protective. The study proposes that beta-amyloid plaques, a hallmark of the disease, bind to and deplete the brain's available lithium, creating a downward spiral of degeneration. While the findings could lead to new treatments, scientists caution against self-medicating with lithium supplements until human trials confirm the results.</p>

This 'stick' approach marks a significant departure from the 'carrot' strategy of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which used subsidies and tax credits to incentivize domestic production. The tariff could raise the cost of numerous consumer goods, from electronics to cars, but the administration is betting it will force a long-term shift in global supply chains.

          <p>A new government campaign to recruit agents for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has drawn attention from both actor Dean Cain and the animated show 'South Park.' Cain, known for playing Superman in the 1990s, posted a video encouraging people to join ICE, while the Department of Homeland Security used an image from an upcoming 'South Park' episode in its own recruitment post on social media. 'South Park,' which has recently been critical of the Trump administration, responded satirically. The article highlights the starkly different cultural framings of the agency amidst a push to hire more agents with promises of large signing bonuses.</p>

          <p>NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore is retiring just months after returning from the first crewed test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, a mission that was extended from eight days to over nine months. The mission was plagued by technical issues, including thruster outages and gas leaks, which led NASA to deem a return on the Starliner too risky. Wilmore and his crewmate Suni Williams ultimately returned to Earth aboard a SpaceX capsule. Throughout the extended stay, Wilmore maintained he was prepared for the uncertainties of a test flight and his retirement follows a 25-year career with NASA.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article uses the recent scientific discovery of microplastics in human and canine testicles to issue a provocative call to action against plastic pollution. The author sarcastically questions why this specific finding hasn't triggered 'genital theft panic' and mobilized a patriarchal society that is otherwise obsessed with protecting male virility. The piece argues that while environmental and female health impacts of plastic have been overlooked, the threat to male fertility should be an undeniable catalyst for change. It criticizes petrochemical lobbies for obstructing a global plastic pollution treaty and urges men to recognize that the fossil fuel industry, not feminism, is the real threat to their reproductive health.</p>

          <p>Honda has reported a significant quarterly operating profit loss, citing the high costs of its electric vehicle development and the financial impact of US tariffs. The company took a one-time charge of approximately $780 million related to its EV struggles, with an executive admitting they are not 'optimistic' about the future of the sector. Honda has been heavily incentivizing its Prologue and ZDX EVs to drive sales and is struggling to compete in China's fierce EV market. The automaker also lost about $861 million to US tariffs but expects some relief from a new US-Japan trade deal that lowers the levy from 25% to 15%. (not investment advice)</p>

His explosive piano technique and knack for collaboration defined his career, which spanned decades and earned him a Jazz Master Fellowship from the NEA in 2013. Palmieri was celebrated as an elder statesman of Latin jazz, known for his warmth, spirit, and deep understanding of the music's history.</p>

          <p>Louisiana officials have canceled a landmark $3 billion coastal restoration project, the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion, which was designed to rebuild the state's rapidly disappearing wetlands. The project would have used the Mississippi River's own sediment to naturally create 17,000 acres of land over 30 years, providing a critical buffer against hurricanes. The cancellation, directed by Governor Jeff Landry, came after strong opposition from local oystermen and community members who feared it would destroy their fishing industry. Environmental scientists argue that scrapping the project is a major setback, as alternative efforts are only temporary fixes for the state's systemic land loss crisis.</p>

The land-based weapon, which can travel at over five times the speed of sound and strike targets more than 2,700km away, was used as part of a military exercise. A US commander called the deployment a 'major milestone' demonstrating the ability to rapidly deploy advanced capabilities in support of allies.

          <p>UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has given China two weeks to provide unredacted plans for its proposed new mega-embassy near London's financial district. The request for information comes amid growing security concerns that the embassy's location could pose an espionage risk by allowing China to tap into sensitive financial data. The plans for the massive complex, which would be Europe's largest embassy, were previously rejected by the local council but have been taken over by the central government. Pro-democracy campaigners also fear the site could be used to harass or detain political opponents living in Britain.</p>

          <p>A new scientific study has concluded that this year's deadly monsoon rains in Pakistan were likely made more intense by the effects of climate change. The report from World Weather Attribution found that rainfall was 10% to 15% heavier due to a warmer atmosphere, which holds more moisture. The floods and related incidents have killed at least 300 people, with many victims living in fragile, makeshift homes in flood-prone urban areas. The findings underscore Pakistan's extreme vulnerability to climate change, coming just a few years after catastrophic floods in 2022 killed over 1,700 people.</p>

Some London boroughs, such as Camden and Westminster, could see their funding fall by up to 12% after accounting for inflation. The proposed changes, set to begin in 2026, aim to redirect funds to more deprived areas and those with a higher share of lower-band council tax properties. While urban areas outside the capital like Nottingham and Slough are set to benefit, the plan has been criticized as 'robbing Peter to pay Paul.' (not investment advice)</p>
