          <h2>Study Reveals Mummification Practices in Southern China Predate Ancient Egypt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 05:00:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new archaeological study suggests that large-scale mummification was practiced in southern China and Southeast Asia as early as 12,000 years ago. Researchers examining pre-Neolithic burials found evidence that many bodies were smoke-dried and arranged in specific postures. This timeline places these mortuary practices thousands of years before the earliest known mummification attempts in ancient Egypt and Chile, offering new insights into the rituals of the region's ancient hunter-gatherer societies.</p>

          <p>With enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies set to expire, the Trump administration is expanding eligibility for "catastrophic" health insurance plans. These plans feature lower monthly premiums but have very high deductibles, often exceeding $10,000 for an individual before most coverage begins. The move is a response to the potential for massive premium increases for millions of Americans if Congress does not extend the COVID-era financial assistance, creating an alternative for those who may lose their subsidies.

          <p>Following a series of recent high-profile shootings, experts analyze the broader context of gun violence in the United States, noting a rise in politically motivated attacks and incidents on school grounds since the pandemic. While mass shootings that capture national headlines are more frequent than 50 years ago, they represent a small fraction of overall gun deaths, with many incidents linked to domestic violence. Data indicates that a significant portion of the population has been personally affected by gun violence.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the history of the "zarf," an ornate holder for small, hot coffee cups, which was a symbol of luxury and ritual during the Ottoman Empire. Often crafted from precious metals and adorned with jewels, zarfs were a functional piece of art used in the traditional Turkish coffee ceremony, which itself is recognized by UNESCO for its cultural significance. While the term is sometimes anachronistically applied to modern cardboard coffee sleeves, purists argue the zarf represents a rich cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is actively challenging the established checks on presidential power by firing officials from independent government agencies, such as the Merit Systems Protection Board. These actions are part of a broader effort to assert more direct control over the executive branch, leading to over 300 lawsuits, some of which are heading to the Supreme Court. The core legal debate centers on the President's authority to remove executive officers, potentially reshaping the civil service system. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve is poised to implement its first interest rate cut of the year, likely a quarter-percentage point reduction aimed at bolstering a weakening job market. This anticipated move follows signs of an economic slowdown, with U.S. employers adding only 22,000 jobs in August. The decision is also set against a backdrop of intense pressure from President Trump, who has sought to exert influence over the central bank's board, raising concerns about its political independence.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a $15 billion lawsuit against The New York Times, accusing the newspaper of defamation and acting as a "mouthpiece" for the Democratic Party. The suit is unusual as it does not cite specific factual inaccuracies in a recent article, but rather alleges a decades-long pattern of biased and negative coverage aimed at interfering with his political campaigns. The New York Times has dismissed the lawsuit as meritless and an attempt to stifle independent reporting.</p>

          <p>Renowned football manager José Mourinho is reportedly in advanced talks to take over as the new manager of Portuguese club Benfica. The move comes after the club sacked its previous manager, Bruno Lage, following a disappointing loss in the Champions League. If appointed, it would mark a return to the club where Mourinho began his illustrious managerial career in 2000, though his initial tenure lasted only ten games due to a dispute with the club's president.</p>
