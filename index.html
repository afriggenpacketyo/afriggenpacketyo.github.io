          <p>Exit polls indicate that liberal candidate Lee is poised to win South Korea's presidential election. The election comes after the previous president was impeached for trying to overturn the constitution, shaking public confidence in democracy. Lee maintained a lead over his conservative opponent throughout the race, but has faced allegations of corruption which allowed the Conservative Party to close the gap. The election outcome is significant for the future direction of South Korean politics and its relationship with neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic explores the trend of privatization and its potential consequences, drawing parallels with feudalism. The author argues that the increasing externalization of state functions and the transfer of public responsibilities to private hands resemble the decentralized power structure of the Middle Ages. With privatization gaining traction, concerns arise about transparency, individual rights, and the concentration of power among a small group of wealthy individuals. The piece questions whether this trend is a temporary aberration or a more permanent shift in society.</p>
