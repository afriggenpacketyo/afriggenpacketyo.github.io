          <p>Goldman Sachs forecasts a significant increase in inflation and a heightened recession probability due to President Trump's new tariffs.  The bank projects a 35% chance of recession within the next year, driven by reduced economic growth and unemployment rising to 4.5%.  This analysis leans slightly negative, potentially underestimating the Fed's capacity to mitigate inflationary pressures and showing a bias toward a pessimistic outlook.</p>
