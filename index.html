          <p>A 21-year-old Pirates fan, Kavan Markwood, was critically injured after falling from the 21-foot Clemente Wall at PNC Park during a game against the Cubs. Markwood, a 2022 South Allegheny High School graduate and former football player, fell moments after an RBI double by Andrew McCutchen. Pittsburgh Public Safety is treating the incident as accidental and Markwood remains in critical condition at a local hospital. The Pirates organization expressed their support, with McCutchen offering prayers for Markwood and his family after the unfortunate accident at the baseball game.</p>

Bolton expresses concerns about constitutional infringements but believes that the institutions are stronger than Trump and that the republic will survive.</p>

This shift is evidenced by a recent economic deal with Ukraine and a friendly meeting between Trump and Zelensky at the Vatican.

          <p>The Mississippi Supreme Court has scheduled the execution of Richard Gerald Jordan, the state's longest-serving death row inmate, for June 25. Jordan, 78, was sentenced to death in 1976 for kidnapping and killing a woman. He has filed multiple death sentence appeals, the most recent of which was denied in October. The order did not specify the manner in which Jordan will be executed, but Mississippi law allows for lethal injection, nitrogen gas, electrocution, or firing squad.</p>
