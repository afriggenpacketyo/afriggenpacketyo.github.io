The address comes amid significant political pressure from the Trump administration, raising questions about the central bank's independence and its long-term policy trajectory. Analysts will be closely watching Powell’s characterization of the labor market and inflation, as well as any potential revisions to the Fed's policy framework. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erik Menendez, convicted alongside his brother for the 1989 murders of their parents, was denied parole by California officials. The parole board determined he still poses an unreasonable risk to public safety, despite arguments that he has been rehabilitated and claims that the murders were in self-defense after years of abuse. Menendez, who was under 26 at the time of the crime, became eligible for parole under a youth offender law but must now wait at least three years for another hearing. His brother Lyle's parole hearing is scheduled for the following day.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration and Florida officials from expanding a controversial immigration detention facility known as "Alligator Alcatraz." The ruling, which cites environmental concerns and potential harm to the Everglades, prohibits new construction and the transfer of additional detainees to the site. This decision represents a significant setback for Florida's efforts to support federal hardline immigration policies. The order stems from a lawsuit filed by the Miccosukee tribe and environmental groups who argued required environmental reviews were not completed.</p>

Zelenskyy emphasized that if Russia is not prepared to meet, he expects a "strong reaction" from the United States to the diplomatic refusal. The statement highlights the ongoing U.S. effort to mediate a peace agreement, though the path forward remains uncertain as both sides have not publicly agreed on potential concessions. President Trump recently met with both leaders separately.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service has removed a large-scale illegal marijuana farm from a remote area of Sequoia National Park. The 13-acre site contained nearly 2,400 plants, miles of illegal trails, and about 2,000 pounds of trash, causing significant environmental damage. Authorities also discovered hazardous chemicals, including a banned insecticide, which had poisoned soil and diverted water from a creek, posing a threat to wildlife and the ecosystem. The operation highlights the ongoing challenge of combating illegal grows run by drug-trafficking organizations in national parks.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, slowed to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% the previous month but still slightly higher than economists' forecasts. The cooling was partly attributed to an easing in the dramatic surge of rice prices that had dominated headlines earlier in the year. The "core-core" inflation rate, a key metric for the Bank of Japan that also excludes energy, held steady at 3.4%. These figures provide critical data for the central bank as it navigates its monetary policy amid sluggish trade numbers. (not investment advice)</p>

The author argues that Dobson's promotion of a harsh, disciplinarian form of Christianity, including advocating for corporal punishment, fundamentally shaped the authoritarian tendencies within today's Republican Party. The article contends that his vilification of LGBTQ people and his political influence were instrumental in overturning Roe v. Wade and fueling current cultural backlashes.

          <p>A fourth-generation Texas cotton farmer, facing mounting debt from years of poor harvests, has found a profitable new venture in solar grazing. Instead of traditional farming, he now rents out his flock of 6,000 sheep to act as natural lawnmowers for large-scale solar energy farms, keeping vegetation from obstructing the panels. This innovative approach, known as agrivoltaics, provides a steady income stream in a volatile agricultural sector. The farmer reported clearing a significant profit last year, a stark contrast to the substantial loss he would have incurred from planting cotton.</p>

          <p>The UK government has instructed baby food manufacturers to reduce sugar and salt levels in their products and to stop marketing snacks for infants under one year old. The new voluntary guidelines also aim to restrict health claims that are not supported by scientific evidence. This action follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given 18 months to comply, after which the government may consider alternative measures if the industry fails to make sufficient changes.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., expressed confusion over the company's stock dropping 4.5% despite what he called an exceptionally strong quarterly performance. The retailer raised its full-year sales and earnings forecast, demonstrating robust topline growth and margin expansion even while absorbing the impact of tariffs. Simon believes investors may have overreacted to a one-time earnings miss caused by non-systemic issues like restructuring costs. He argues that Walmart's ability to attract and retain shoppers with low prices makes the company's outlook strong. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A global race to develop hypersonic weapons—which travel at over five times the speed of sound and are highly maneuverable—is intensifying, with China and Russia currently leading the field. These weapons pose a significant strategic threat because their speed and unpredictable flight paths make them extremely difficult to detect and intercept with current defense systems. While Western nations focused on counter-terrorism for two decades, China and Russia invested heavily in this advanced technology. The U.S. and UK are now working to catch up, developing their own programs and exploring space-based sensors.</p>

          <p>An active shooter alert that caused panic and a massive law enforcement response at Villanova University's campus was a "cruel hoax," according to the university's president. The false report, known as a "swatting" incident, claimed a shooter was present at the law school, prompting a campus-wide lockdown and shelter-in-place order. After a thorough search, police confirmed there was no shooter, no injuries, and no evidence of firearms. The FBI and local authorities are now investigating to find the person responsible for the fake threat, which is a serious crime.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its campaign for the removal of Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, whom officials have accused of mortgage fraud. After Cook stated she would not be "bullied" into resigning, a top Trump official sent a letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell urging him to remove her from the board. The allegations are unconfirmed, and the Fed chair does not have the legal authority to fire another governor. This represents another significant assault on the central bank's independence, part of a broader pattern by the administration.</p>

After a federal court recently issued a temporary halt to the land transfer required for the mine, Trump met with mining executives and criticized the court's decision. The project would create one of the world's largest copper mines but would destroy the sacred site, turning it into a massive crater. The tribe and environmental allies celebrated the court's reprieve in their long-running legal battle.</p>
