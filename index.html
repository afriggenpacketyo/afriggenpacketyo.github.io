          <p>This article recounts the story of Stephanie Fagan and Jessica Pelley, who were childhood friends before the tragic murder of the Pelley family in 1989. Jessica, who survived the murders, was sent to live with relatives and lost contact with Stephanie. For 20 years, Stephanie grieved the loss of her friend and the Pelley family, regularly visiting their graves. The two women eventually reunited through Facebook in 2009 and rediscovered their bond, now considering each other sisters, solving the mystery of missing flowers from the cemetery during Jeff Pelley's trial, as Jessi was the one who took them home as keepsakes.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. According to Trump, the strikes were successful, with all planes returning safely and a full payload of bombs dropped on the primary site, Fordow, which is key to Iran's nuclear program and buried almost 300 feet beneath a mountain. The U.S. reached out to Iran diplomatically to clarify that the strikes were limited and regime change was not planned. This action follows escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, with Iran pledging retaliation if the U.S. joined the Israeli assault.</p>

          <p>Congressional leaders have responded to President Trump's announcement of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites with a mix of support and concern. Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham praised the move as the right call, while others, such as Rep. Tom Massie, questioned the president's authority to act without congressional approval. Democrats, including Rep. Jim Himes, emphasized the importance of congressional consultation before military action, referencing the War Powers Resolution. House Speaker Mike Johnson was briefed ahead of the strikes and endorsed the action, while Senate Majority Leader John Thune was also informed.</p>

          <p>The Israel-Iran war entered its second week with the U.S. launching strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and additional strikes targeting an Iranian nuclear research facility. Iran's foreign minister warned against U.S. intervention, while the U.S. began assisting with evacuations of Americans and green card holders. The conflict has resulted in casualties on both sides, with Israel continuing its military operation to eliminate Iran's nuclear program. The U.S. is considering further military intervention, with B-2 stealth bombers being moved to Guam.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin couple, Paul VanDuyne and Andrea Whitaker, have been charged in a plot to kill two of VanDuyne's former girlfriends using cyanide. Prosecutors allege that VanDuyne contaminated a woman's water bottle with cyanide in a Costco parking lot, and a similar incident occurred with another woman in Rock County, leading to her hospitalization. Investigators discovered messages between the couple discussing different poisons, and at least seven state investigators were hospitalized for possible exposure to the poison. Whitaker's online search history included queries about cyanide, leading authorities to believe the pair were planning the murders together.</p>

          <p>President Trump contradicted his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, stating she was "wrong" about Iran not building a nuclear weapon. Gabbard testified in March that the U.S. intelligence community assessed Iran was not developing nuclear weapons, but the White House claims Iran has the capability to build a nuclear weapon within weeks. Trump dismissed this assessment as he considers joining Israel in its strikes on Iran. Gabbard later insisted that she and the president are on the same page regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The policy change would have capped indirect costs for universities at 15% of direct research costs, potentially stripping them of millions of dollars in funding. Judge Indira Talwani ruled the change was arbitrary and capricious, threatening critical work in fields like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.

Despite Iran's denial of any interest in building nuclear weapons, Israel asserts that Iran is racing towards a nuclear bomb. The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency has declared Iran non-compliant with monitoring efforts, raising concerns about the lack of transparency at Fordo. Experts believe the U.S.-produced GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator could be used to destroy the facility.</p>

          <p>Voting is underway in the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, viewed as a precursor to this summer's House of Councillors race. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) aims to retain its seats despite low approval ratings. Major parties are using social media and street speeches to appeal to voters, particularly unaffiliated ones. Key issues include support for households facing inflation, political funding scandals, child-rearing policies, and measures to prevent heatstroke. 295 candidates are contesting the election in 42 electoral districts.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance visited Los Angeles amid ongoing protests against the Trump administration's immigration policies. Vance toured a multi-agency Federal Joint Operations Center and a Federal Mobile Command Center, receiving briefings from agencies including the DEA, DHS, and ICE. His visit occurred as protests and law enforcement clashed over ICE raids and deportations, a key part of President Trump's agenda. A federal appeals court ruled that Trump can keep the National Guard in Los Angeles to quell protests against his deportation plans.</p>

          <p>Texas will require all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments under a new law, making it the largest state to impose such a mandate. The bill, signed by Governor Greg Abbott, is expected to face legal challenges for potentially violating the separation of church and state. The law requires schools to post a 16x20 inch poster or framed copy of a specific English version of the commandments. Supporters argue the Ten Commandments are foundational to the U.S. judicial and educational systems, while opponents say it infringes on religious freedom.</p>
