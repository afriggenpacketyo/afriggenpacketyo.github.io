          <p>A Democratic National Committee panel has recommended redoing the elections of David Hogg and Malcolm Kenyatta as party vice-chairs due to alleged violations of the party's charter during the February vote. Kalyn Free, who lost to Hogg, challenged the election, claiming the DNC improperly combined questions, giving male candidates an advantage. Hogg contends the move is politically motivated due to his efforts to reform the party, particularly his push to primary some Democratic politicians. The article highlights the internal divisions within the DNC regarding Hogg's leadership and reform efforts.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's CO2 monitoring program, which has been tracking atmospheric carbon dioxide levels since the 1960s, faces potential cuts under the Trump administration's proposed budget. Professor Ralph Keeling, continuing his father's work on the Keeling Curve, warns that these cuts would end decades of unbroken data collection, hindering the nation's ability to project future climate change impacts. The article emphasizes the importance of this continuous data collection for understanding and addressing climate change, comparing the potential program shutdown to "turning off the headlights on a dark street."</p>

          <p>In response to the Biden administration's ban on "junk fees," Ticketmaster announced it will now display the total price of tickets upfront, including all processing and service fees.

          <p>To foster lasting trust and align security interests, China needs to demonstrate openness, consistency, and a commitment to multilateral dialogue with ASEAN countries. Cambodia's recent decision to allow warships from multiple nations, including Vietnam, Russia, and Japan, to access its Ream naval base signals an effort to dispel the notion that it is solely a Chinese outpost. This move aligns with China's stated vision of an inclusive regional security framework, emphasizing peaceful resolution of disputes, particularly in the South China Sea, by directly concerned sovereign states, as articulated in Beijing's Global Security Initiative.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's GDP grew by 3.4% in 2024, marking its highest growth rate in ten years, driven by the oil and gas sector, as well as tech and finance industries, according to a World Bank report. While the World Bank projects continued growth, it also warns of slow growth in the agriculture sector due to insecurity and high input costs. President Bola Tinubu's government has implemented economic reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira, but these reforms have led to a cost-of-living crisis for many Nigerians, with high poverty and inflation rates remaining concerns.</p>

While gold is considered a safe haven asset, experts caution that it is not immune to price fluctuations and major surges have been followed by significant falls. The article explores the reasons behind gold's appeal, including its role as a hedge against inflation and its independence from the banking system, while also warning investors to be wary of potential market bubbles and the risk of losses.</p>
