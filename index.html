          <p>An attack near a Gaza aid distribution center resulted in numerous casualties, with conflicting reports emerging about the source of the gunfire. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry reported over 50 deaths and numerous injuries, while witnesses claimed the fire came from multiple directions, including naval warships, tanks, and drones. The Israeli military denied involvement, citing an initial inquiry that found its forces did not fire at civilians near or within the site. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) also dismissed reports of deaths and chaos around its sites, stating it delivered aid without incident, though U.N. agencies have criticized the GHF's system, and the situation remains unclear. Optimism regarding the situation is low due to the tragic loss of life and the conflicting accounts surrounding the event.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season for 2025, beginning on Sunday. Forecasters estimate a 60% chance of 13 to 19 named storms, with six to 10 expected to become hurricanes, and three to five potentially becoming major hurricanes. The article includes a list of the names assigned to tropical storms and hurricanes for the year, which are rotated annually by the World Meteorological Organization, a United Nations agency. Storm names are retired if a storm is particularly deadly or costly, and the 2024 season saw 18 named storms and hurricanes, with three names retired.</p>

          <p>Ukraine reports completing its largest long-range attack of the war with Russia, claiming to have struck 40 Russian warplanes at four military bases using smuggled drones. Ukrainian security sources say the operation, dubbed "Spider's Web," took a year and a half to organize and was supervised by President Zelenskyy, involving drones hidden in mobile wooden cabins. Meanwhile, Ukrainian authorities reported a massive overnight drone and missile attack on their territory, and Russian and Ukrainian negotiators are heading to Istanbul for a second round of peace talks. The Ukrainian claims have not been independently verified.</p>

          <p>Presenter and campaigner Katie Piper spoke at the Hay Festival in Wales about ageing, comparing it to a bereavement and noting how women age out of the male gaze. Piper, who experienced a life-altering attack at 24, discussed her book, "Still Beautiful: On Age, Beauty and Owning Your Space," where she explores societal judgment and the power women hold beyond youth and conventional beauty standards. She emphasizes the importance of self-acceptance and taking control of one's destiny, viewing ageing as a key to letting go of external expectations, and she also touched on the discrimination she has faced due to her appearance, highlighting the need to recognize the inherent goodness in people.</p>

          <p>Senior officials at the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have reportedly ordered VA physicians and scientists to seek clearance from political appointees before publishing in medical journals or speaking publicly. The directive came after the New England Journal of Medicine published an article co-authored by two VA pulmonologists warning that staff reductions jeopardize veterans' health. The VA press secretary claims the policy requires employees to coordinate with public affairs staff, but VA workers and veterans advocates see it as censorship by the Trump administration and another attack on freedom of speech.</p>

Berkshire Hathaway has also doubled its ownership of T-bills, now holding 5% of all short-term Treasuries, and this trend reflects a preference for stability and lower volatility in the current economic climate (not investment advice).</p>

Bessent emphasized the administration's goal is to de-risk, not decouple, from China, and he also defended the trade stance as essential for national and economic security (not investment advice).</p>
