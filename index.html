The victims include the 64-year-old bartender and three male patrons aged 59, 70, and 74. A manhunt is currently underway for the suspect, 45-year-old Michael Paul Brown, a former U.S. Army soldier who lived next door to the establishment. Authorities believe he is still armed, dangerous, and likely in the area, urging residents to remain vigilant as the search involves local, state, and federal agencies.</p>

          <p>The final Test match between England and India at The Oval is set for a dramatic conclusion, with the game finely balanced heading into the last day. England requires just 35 more runs to secure a series victory, but only has four wickets remaining after a late collapse. Centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root had put England in a commanding position to chase a record-breaking target of 374. However, a spirited comeback from India's bowlers, who took three quick wickets before bad light stopped play, has left the outcome on a knife-edge.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is defending the controversial firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a weaker-than-expected jobs report. Officials like National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett cited significant downward revisions to previous months' data as justification, while President Trump claimed the numbers were "phony." The move has drawn sharp criticism from economists and former officials, including Trump's own former BLS commissioner, who called the firing groundless and warned it undermines the credibility of vital government economic data. This action is viewed by critics as part of a broader pattern of challenging institutions that produce unfavorable information.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz detailed the Trump administration's plans for Medicaid, emphasizing an investment of over $200 billion into the program. He defended the implementation of work requirements, arguing that new technology will streamline the process for beneficiaries to report their engagement in work, education, or community service. Dr. Oz also addressed high drug costs, stating the administration is pressuring pharmaceutical companies to lower prices for Americans, asserting that the U.S. should not pay significantly more than other nations for the same medications. He framed these changes as necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability and effectiveness of the program.</p>

Governor Lujan Grisham stated that the $50 billion rural healthcare fund is insufficient to cover the estimated $900 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade. She contended that states are being set up for failure, which will ultimately harm local economies and vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale died in New Jersey's Barnegat Bay after being struck by a boat on Saturday. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center reported that the collision was severe enough to throw a passenger overboard, though they are believed to be unharmed. The whale was initially spotted in the bay, and officials were observing it when the incident occurred. Due to tidal conditions, the whale's carcass will remain on a shallow sandbar until Monday, when crews can tow it for a necropsy to determine the full extent of its injuries and cause of death.</p>

          <p>The United States and Canada have failed to reach a new trade agreement by their self-imposed deadline, leaving businesses in a state of uncertainty amid an ongoing tariff war. Despite recent intense negotiations, significant hurdles remain, compounded by President Trump's criticism of Canada's foreign policy regarding Palestinian statehood. While both countries face economic pressure to resolve the dispute, Canadian negotiators are prioritizing a quality deal over a rushed one. A pre-existing trade agreement, CUSMA/USMCA, provides a buffer by allowing nearly 90% of Canadian exports to cross the border duty-free, giving Canada some leverage in the ongoing talks.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami star Lionel Messi left Saturday's Leagues Cup match against Necaxa in the opening minutes after suffering an apparent hamstring injury. The 38-year-old forward went down after a challenge, and after being attended to by trainers on the pitch, he was substituted in the 11th minute and walked directly to the locker room. Coach Javier Mascherano stated that Messi felt a "pull" and will undergo tests to determine the severity of the injury. The incident raises concerns about his availability for upcoming matches, as the team has been carefully managing his workload amid a packed schedule this season.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has publicly downplayed a trade request from star defensive end Micah Parsons, characterizing it as a standard part of contract negotiations. Parsons, who is entering the final year of his rookie contract, posted on social media requesting a trade amid a breakdown in extension talks. Jones insisted that the dispute is not unusual and that an agreement framework had been reached in the spring, which Parsons then "took off" the table. Despite the public friction and support for Parsons from teammates, Jones urged fans not to worry, expressing confidence that the situation will be resolved.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has sparked widespread condemnation after visiting and openly praying at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem. This action violates a long-standing "status quo" agreement that permits non-Muslims to visit the holy site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount, but not to pray there. The visit was called an "unacceptable provocation" by Jordan, the site's custodian, and a crossing of "all red lines" by the Palestinian Authority. The Israeli prime minister's office stated there has been no change in policy, but the event has significantly heightened tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>Actor Sydney Sweeney has become a focal point of a culture war debate after it was revealed she is a registered Republican in Florida. The revelation came as her new ad campaign for American Eagle, which uses the pun "Sydney Sweeney has great genes," drew criticism from some for being tone-deaf in the current political climate, while conservatives praised it as a blow against "woke" advertising. The controversy echoes a previous incident where Sweeney faced backlash over photos from a family party. The convergence of her political affiliation and the ad campaign has intensified public discourse around the actor.</p>

          <p>China's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, appears to have conducted its first test of its electromagnetic catapult system, a key milestone for the vessel. Footage aired by state broadcaster CCTV showed what looked like a successful launch of a test aircraft from the carrier's deck. This development is a significant step towards the Fujian becoming fully operational, which is expected to happen this year. The electromagnetic catapults represent a major technological leap for the Chinese navy, allowing for the launch of heavier and more varied aircraft compared to the ski-jump systems on its older carriers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's mental acuity is again under scrutiny following several bizarre public appearances, including unprompted rants about windmills and a factually incorrect story about his uncle and the Unabomber. Experts note that the 79-year-old president frequently drifts off-topic, appears to misremember facts, and engages in what psychologists term "confabulation," where he adds untrue details to stories. While the White House and its allies aggressively defend his sharpness, critics and some mental health professionals point to a pattern of verbal incoherence and tangential thinking as potential signs of cognitive decline, raising concerns about his fitness for office.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Divorce attorneys advise that individuals in a rocky marriage can take steps to protect their finances, even without a prenuptial agreement. The first key step is to gain full transparency into all shared financial accounts, assets, and liabilities while still married, as access becomes more difficult after a separation. Another option is to create a postnuptial agreement, which defines how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided in a divorce. While potentially a difficult conversation, these proactive measures can provide financial security and clarity should the marriage ultimately end.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, handling tantrums effectively involves connection rather than control. The article outlines seven calming phrases that emotionally attuned parents use to soothe and validate a child's feelings during a meltdown, such as "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense." This approach helps a child's nervous system regulate by making them feel safe and understood, rather than punished or shamed. The goal is to model healthy emotional expression and reinforce the parent-child bond, which can reduce the frequency and intensity of future outbursts.</p>

The initiative, which could be operational within weeks, reportedly aims to allow up to 300 children, each accompanied by a guardian, to enter the country for free medical care. This official government scheme follows criticism for previous inaction and comes after a private organization, Project Pure Hope, successfully brought a few children to the UK for treatment.
