The article scrutinizes the claim of saving £30 billion annually by scrapping net zero policies, noting that the Office for Budget Responsibility attributes most of that figure to lost fuel duty revenue, not direct spending. The feasibility of the party's ambitious £88 billion-a-year tax cuts and increased spending pledges is also questioned. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The winner of the estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot faces a substantial tax bill that will significantly reduce the prize's value. Whether choosing the $826.4 million lump sum or the annuity option, the IRS requires a mandatory 24% federal withholding upfront. However, the final tax liability will be much higher, as the winnings will push the recipient into the top 37% federal income tax bracket, with state taxes potentially taking an additional share.</p>

          <p>A legal dispute over the ownership of the painting "A Young Girl" by German expressionist Paula Modersohn-Becker is now before Germany's Advisory Commission. The artwork, held by the Hamburger Kunsthalle since 1958, is the subject of a restitution claim by the heirs of Robert Graetz, a Jewish art collector who was deported by the Nazis. The case highlights the ongoing difficulties in resolving claims for art looted during the Nazi era, especially as Germany transitions its restitution process to new arbitration tribunals.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has fined Google €2.95 billion ($3.47 billion) for violating EU antitrust rules within its online advertising technology business. Regulators found that Google abused its dominant market position by unfairly favoring its own display advertising services, which harmed competing ad-tech providers, advertisers, and online publishers. The EU has ordered Google to end these self-preferencing practices and address its conflicts of interest, though the company has stated it will appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a bill raising the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year, a significant increase from the $10,000 limit established in 2017. This change is expected to provide substantial tax relief to homeowners and high-income earners in states with high property and income taxes, such as New York, New Jersey, and California. However, critics point out that the higher cap is projected to increase the national debt by over $142 billion over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swedish authorities are reporting a disturbing new trend in the country's escalating gang wars, where teenage girls are being recruited as contract killers.

This development highlights the evolving and increasingly ruthless nature of organized crime in Sweden, which is now considered a systemic threat.</p>
