          <p>Alaska Airlines and its subsidiary, Horizon Air, experienced a temporary system-wide ground stop for approximately three hours due to a significant IT outage. The airline confirmed the issue began around 8 p.m. Pacific time and was resolved by 11 p.m., allowing flights to resume. The carrier apologized for the disruption, warning travelers of potential residual delays as it works to reposition aircraft and crews. The Federal Aviation Administration had issued advisories during the event, though the specific cause of the computer failure was not immediately disclosed.</p>

          <p>Investors in China are increasingly turning to bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs), pushing the total assets under management in this category past US$50 billion. This surge is driven by a search for lower-cost, diversified investments in an economic environment marked by deflation and supportive government policies. These ETFs offer better liquidity and lower default risks compared to direct corporate debt investment, appealing to investors hedging against economic uncertainty. The trend highlights a broader shift towards low-risk, fixed-income assets as China's central bank maintains loose monetary conditions while warning against risks from an over-extended bond rally.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with executives from approximately 30 major companies, including Siemens and Deutsche Bank, to encourage new domestic investment and restore economic confidence. The "Made for Germany" initiative aims to counter two years of recession and a bleak economic forecast for 2025. The government has already approved significant tax relief and a €500 billion fund for infrastructure and climate projects. This summit underscores the government's strategy that while public funding is leading the way, private sector participation is crucial for reviving Germany's struggling economy.

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has traveled to Barcelona to complete a season-long loan move to the Spanish club. The 27-year-old player arrived on Sunday after United granted him permission to finalize the deal, which includes an option to buy. This move follows Rashford's expressed desire for a new challenge after being dropped by his coach at United. He is expected to undergo a medical exam early this week and could potentially join Barcelona's pre-season tour in Asia, marking his second consecutive loan spell after a period with Aston Villa.</p>

          <p>China is set to begin importing iron ore from Guinea and Algeria this year, following the completion of critical railway lines and port facilities by Chinese companies. For years, logistical challenges, such as the lack of infrastructure connecting mines to ports, have hindered exports from these African nations. In Guinea, the Simandou project, a joint venture with mining giant Rio Tinto, is expected to start shipments by November. Similarly, a new railway will connect Algeria's Gara Djebilet mine in the Sahara to Mediterranean ports, unlocking a significant new source of iron ore for China.</p>

The situation is attributed to a "broken leasehold system" and a series of management companies that failed to maintain the buildings.

          <p>Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious Ecuadorean gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited to the U.S. to face drug and arms trafficking charges. Fito, leader of the Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after a year on the run from a high-security prison. His gang is blamed for transforming Ecuador into a hub for cocaine trafficking and is suspected in the 2023 assassination of a presidential candidate. The extradition follows a referendum in which Ecuadoreans approved the measure, supporting President Daniel Noboa's vow to crack down on the country's rampant crime.</p>

          <p>A class of popular weight loss drugs known as GLP-1s, including Ozempic and Wegovy, are showing significant potential for treating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Patients in trials and anecdotal reports describe improvements in symptoms like irregular periods, hair loss, and weight gain, which are often linked to insulin resistance, a key feature of PCOS. While there is no standard treatment for the condition, these drugs may help by improving insulin sensitivity and promoting weight loss, which in turn can help regulate hormones. Further research and overcoming insurance hurdles are key next steps.</p>

          <p>A significant contrast is emerging between the U.S. and China regarding their strategies for energy and climate issues, particularly as the demand for electricity grows due to technologies like AI. While China is forging ahead with ambitious renewable energy goals and investments, the Trump administration is moving to cancel tax credits for wind and solar power, labeling them unreliable. This divergence in policy could impact the global tech race, as both nations compete to power the data centers essential for innovation. China's proactive stance on green energy is positioning it to take a lead in this critical sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to obstruct a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in D.C. unless the team reverts to its former name, the "Redskins." In a social media post, Trump claimed there is a "big clamoring" for the name change and that Indigenous people want the name restored, without providing evidence. The team dropped the name in 2020 after years of criticism that it was a racist slur. It remains unclear how Trump could intervene in the project, as Congress has already given the city control over the proposed stadium site.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest flight operating as a Delta Connection service had to perform an abrupt evasive maneuver to avoid a mid-air collision with a B-52 bomber near Minot, North Dakota. The pilot, after landing safely, apologized to passengers for the aggressive turn, explaining it was the safest option after the military aircraft appeared unexpectedly in their flight path. The incident occurred as the passenger jet was on its final approach to Minot, which is home to an Air Force base. Both SkyWest and the Air Force are now investigating the near-miss to determine why the two aircraft came into such close proximity.</p>

          <p>Canada is experiencing its worst measles outbreak since the disease was declared eliminated in 1998, with over 3,800 cases reported in 2025, far surpassing U.S. numbers on a per capita basis. The surge, concentrated in Ontario and Alberta, is linked to low vaccination rates, particularly within some religious communities, and a general rise in vaccine hesitancy following the COVID-19 pandemic. Health officials note that misinformation has played a significant role in depressing MMR vaccine uptake. The outbreak highlights the fragility of herd immunity and the public health challenges posed by the spread of anti-vaccine sentiment.</p>
