          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 14:07:35 EDT</div>

          <p>AI startup Perplexity has made a surprising $34.5 billion bid to buy Google's Chrome browser, a figure exceeding its own valuation but reportedly backed by investors. The offer comes as Google faces pressure from a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust ruling that suggested the company should divest Chrome to level the playing field for search competitors. This move follows Perplexity's recent launch of its own AI-powered browser and a previous, unsuccessful proposal to merge with TikTok, highlighting the startup's aggressive strategy in the competitive AI landscape.</p>

Despite having a minimal prior criminal record, Betro disguised herself with a niqab, but was identified by investigators and has now been convicted on multiple charges, including illegal ammunition importation.</p>

Ford has stated it is unaware of any accidents or injuries related to the defect and will notify owners to have the rear axle shaft assemblies replaced for free.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines' parent company has issued a stark warning, stating there is "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue operations for the next year, causing its stock to plummet. This "going concern" notice comes just months after the budget carrier emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, highlighting its ongoing struggles with adverse market conditions and weak demand for domestic leisure travel. Despite cost-cutting measures like pilot furloughs, the airline says it needs more liquidity and may have to sell aircraft and real estate to stay afloat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A severe heatwave with temperatures exceeding 40°C (104°F) is fueling dozens of dangerous wildfires across southern Europe, leading to mass evacuations and significant health warnings. Countries including Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, and Greece are battling numerous blazes stoked by fierce winds, which have destroyed homes and threatened historic sites. Authorities have deployed thousands of firefighters and military personnel to combat the fires, as scientists warn that global warming is creating hotter, drier Mediterranean summers and more intense fire seasons.</p>

          <p>A British Army service inquiry has concluded that some soldiers stationed at the Batuk training base in Kenya are continuing to engage in "transactional sex" at a "low to moderate level," despite a 2022 ban. The investigation was launched following years of controversy surrounding the base, including the 2012 death of a local woman, Agnes Wanjiru, allegedly killed by a British soldier. While noting the Army has control measures in place, the report's findings have prompted the Chief of Defence Staff to reaffirm that there is no place for sexual exploitation in the military.</p>

          <p>In his weekly advice column, James Parker responds to a reader who struggles with being overly brusque and critical about inefficiencies in their workplace. The reader, a self-described "get-to-the-point kinda gal," questions whether she is the problem and if she should restrain her instincts or leave her job. Parker affirms that she is likely the "common denominator" but advises against restraining critical instincts in the workplace, humorously suggesting that team-wide inadequacies are a standard condition of office life and that it's always a good time to "throw in the towel."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his pressure on the Federal Reserve by threatening to allow a "major lawsuit" against its chairman, Jerome Powell. In a social media post, Trump linked the potential suit to his criticism of the management and cost of renovations at the Fed's headquarters in Washington, D.C. The threat was part of a broader attack in which Trump again demanded Powell cut interest rates, blaming his first-term Treasury Secretary for recommending the "loser" for the position and calling the economic damage he has caused "incalculable."</p>

          <p>The 133-year-old company Kodak has issued a "going concern" warning, indicating significant doubt about its ability to remain in business due to its financial state. The iconic brand, which once dominated the photography industry, is struggling with nearly $500 million in short-term debt and over $200 million in pension liabilities, causing its stock to plunge. This warning marks another critical moment for the company, which filed for bankruptcy in 2012 after failing to adapt to the digital camera revolution and has since been trying to reinvent itself.

          <p>The upcoming meeting in Alaska between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is viewed by experts as a significant opportunity for the Russian president to gain legitimacy on the world stage, even if major breakthroughs are unlikely. Analysts suggest that factors like a weakened Russian economy and the threat of further U.S. sanctions may compel Putin to be more open to a ceasefire. However, Ukraine will not be present at the talks, and some experts believe any potential concession, such as an airspace ceasefire, could primarily benefit Moscow by halting effective Ukrainian counterattacks.</p>

          <p>President Trump's move to take temporary control of Washington, D.C.'s police force is a significant, though not entirely unprecedented, assertion of federal power over the nation's capital. The city was governed by presidentially appointed commissioners for a century before the Home Rule Act of 1973 granted it limited self-governance. Even after home rule, a federally created "Control Board" took over the city's finances in the 1990s due to a fiscal crisis, stripping power from the elected mayor and council, a period that highlights the complex and often fraught history of D.C.'s relationship with the federal government.</p>

CEO Jeremy Allaire attributed the strong performance and positive market sentiment to a growing understanding of how stablecoins and blockchains are fundamentally changing the financial system, with interest from major financial institutions surging since the passage of supportive U.S. crypto legislation.

          <p>For retirees seeking financial security, annuities can provide a guaranteed income stream, but their safety in the current economic climate depends on several factors. This article advises that potential investors should first verify the financial strength and credit rating of the issuing insurance company, as annuities are not FDIC-insured. It is also important to understand the limits of state guarantee associations, the different risk profiles of fixed versus variable annuities, and the long-term threat that inflation poses to the purchasing power of fixed payments.
