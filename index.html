        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York City Democratic mayoral primary is headed for a potentially lengthy ranked-choice voting tabulation process, as no candidate secured over 50% of first-choice votes. Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani held a slight lead over the crowded field, boosted by endorsements from prominent left-wing figures. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who resigned amid sexual harassment allegations, trailed behind Mamdani in initial tallies. Ranked-choice voting, where voters rank up to five candidates, will determine the winner, with tabulations not starting until July 1 due to mail-in ballots. (not investment advice) The outcome could be influenced by factors like a recent heatwave impacting voter turnout. The election is being closely watched due to the scandal involving Cuomo and Mamdani's progressive ideas. The initial results indicate a close contest that could take time to resolve.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An initial classified assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by several months. The strikes sealed entrances to enrichment facilities, but the underground infrastructure remains largely intact. Some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was reportedly moved before the strikes. The White House has disputed the assessment, with the press secretary calling it "flat-out wrong" and accusing intelligence community members of leaking the information. This assessment was based on satellite imagery and signals intelligence. The situation remains tense, with ongoing debate about the effectiveness of the strikes and Iran's future nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>Two young bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park in the U.K. and raided the food store, consuming a week's worth of honey. The bears posed no threat to the public, and visitors were safely escorted to a secure building. Park keepers used recall training to guide the bears back into their enclosure, where they promptly fell asleep. An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the escape, attributed to an "operational error." The wildlife park is taking the situation seriously and is implementing measures to prevent future incidents.</p>

          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee reports that electric car and heat pump adoption is growing, but further increases are needed to meet climate goals. The committee emphasizes the need for government action to lower electricity bills to incentivize the transition to cleaner technologies. While electric car sales are nearly one-in-five of new cars sold, heat pump sales remain below target despite recent growth. The CCC also suggests that electricity costs should be reduced to encourage more people to use electric cars and heat pumps, and this could be achieved by removing charges related to renewable energy projects from household electricity bills.</p>

She had entered the U.S. illegally at 15 and worked in garment factories, contributing to the economy and paying taxes. Now reunited with her mother in Mexico, Higuera expresses happiness at being free from stress but misses her family in the U.S. The situation highlights the emotional toll of immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars born today spin faster than those formed billions of years ago, using data from the Gaia space telescope. The study found that newly formed stars spin up to 10 times faster than older stars. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The research provides direct evidence that the galaxy's star-forming clouds have become more turbulent over time. It offers a new way to study how the galaxy has evolved.</p>

The decision aims to counter threats posed by Russia and China, and reflects a broader effort to prepare for potential direct threats to the homeland.

          <p>UK newspapers highlight the country's acquisition of new fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear bombs, matching China and Russia. The Times also reports on President Trump's profanity-laced warning to maintain peace in the Middle East. Other headlines cover the UK's new National Security Strategy, Labour MPs' opposition to benefit cuts, and the Bezos wedding. The Daily Star references Donald Trump's comments on Iran and Israel after they breached a proposed ceasefire. The articles are covering numerous topics which are currently relevant.</p>

          <p>President Trump reacted furiously after an Israel-Iran ceasefire he brokered was violated, using strong language to criticize both countries. He later called Israel's prime minister to demand a stop to the bombing. The US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities are reported to have only set back the nuclear program by a few months. ICE is continuing to arrest an increasing number of immigrants without any criminal history. The president is trying to maintain control over the global situation.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, but voiced frustration with both countries for violating the agreement. Israel accused Iran of launching missiles after the ceasefire was due to take effect, prompting a final round of Israeli strikes.

Drones also hit bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops. The conflict has been very intense between Iran and Israel.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs declined to testify in his ongoing sexual assault trial, which is expected to conclude this week. Prosecutors rested their case after calling 34 witnesses over 28 days, alleging Combs used his empire to coerce women into sexual activity. Combs' lawyers presented a brief case, arguing the alleged victims consented to the sex parties. The defense rested without calling any witnesses, instead reading text messages from Cassie Ventura expressing love for Combs. The jury is set to return to court to hear closing statements, and deliberations could begin as early as Friday. The trial has been very intense so far.</p>
