          <p>A new book, "Murder in the Dollhouse," examines the case of Jennifer Dulos, a Connecticut mother of five who vanished in 2020 amid a contentious divorce. Authorities believe her estranged husband, Fotis Dulos, attacked her in their garage and disposed of her body, which has never been found. Fotis Dulos died by suicide after being charged with her murder, leaving a note proclaiming his innocence. His girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, was later convicted for her role in the cover-up, adding another layer to the tragic suburban case.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with potential payouts estimated to be under £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while hidden commissions were not broadly unlawful, excessively high commissions could be deemed unfair. The proposed scheme would cover discretionary commission arrangements not properly disclosed and other cases with very high commissions dating back to 2007. The FCA will consult on the details, with the industry expected to cover the full cost. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The final Test between England and India is poised for a dramatic conclusion, with the match extending into a fifth day at The Oval. Chasing a record 374 for victory, England reached 339-6 before bad light and rain stopped play. Centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root had put England in a commanding position, but a late comeback from India's bowlers saw three quick wickets fall, leaving the result on a knife-edge. England needs 35 more runs to win the series 3-1, while India requires four wickets to level it 2-2.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami star Lionel Messi left his team's Leagues Cup match against Necaxa in the opening minutes with an apparent hamstring injury. The 38-year-old fell during a challenge in the eighth minute and, after being attended to by trainers, was substituted and walked directly to the locker room. Coach Javier Mascherano stated that Messi felt a "pull" and will undergo tests to determine the severity of the injury. The incident raises concerns about his availability for upcoming matches, given his packed workload and recent history with leg injuries.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has dismissed star defensive end Micah Parsons' public trade request as a negotiation tactic. Parsons, who is seeking a contract extension that would likely make him the highest-paid defender in NFL history, posted his request on social media amid a standoff with the team. Jones insisted that the dispute is a normal part of the process and expressed confidence it will be resolved, drawing parallels to past contract disputes with other star players. Teammates have publicly voiced their support for Parsons.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has sparked condemnation after visiting and openly praying at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem. This act violates a long-standing "status quo" agreement that permits non-Muslims to visit but not to pray at the holy site. The visit was called an "unacceptable provocation" by Jordan, which is the site's custodian, and drew sharp criticism from Palestinian leaders. The Israeli prime minister's office stated there has been no change to the official policy regarding the sensitive site.</p>

The campaign, which plays on the words "genes" and "jeans," drew criticism from some for what they perceived as echoes of eugenic rhetoric, while conservatives praised it as a rebuke of "woke" advertising. The revelation of her political affiliation, registered in June 2024, has added another layer to the controversy, which follows previous scrutiny over her family's political leanings two years ago.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent public appearances, marked by rambling speeches, factual inaccuracies, and unprompted tangents, have renewed expert concerns about his mental fitness. Analysts point to instances of apparent confabulation, such as a false story about his uncle and the Unabomber, and a tendency to digress from topics incoherently. While the White House dismisses these concerns, some mental health professionals argue that the president's behavior shows signs of cognitive deterioration compared to his past articulateness and warrants serious examination.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Divorce lawyers recommend two key strategies for individuals to protect their finances if their marriage is facing difficulties and a prenuptial agreement is not in place. The first step is to gain a full understanding of all joint financial accounts, assets, and liabilities while still married, as access is easier. The second is to consider a postnuptial agreement, which defines how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided in a divorce. These proactive measures can provide financial security and clarity.</p>

Instead of punishment, the approach focuses on connection and validation, using phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense." This method aims to soothe a child's distressed nervous system, making them feel safe and understood. The goal is to help children process their emotions, which can reduce the frequency and intensity of future outbursts.</p>
