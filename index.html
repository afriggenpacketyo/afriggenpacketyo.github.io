          <h2>Bipartisan Bill Aims to Make Childbirth Free in the US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Supporting Healthy Moms and Babies Act, has been introduced in the Senate to require private insurance companies to fully cover all childbirth-related expenses without co-pays or deductibles, aiming to alleviate the financial burden on families. The bill has garnered support from both reproductive health advocates and anti-abortion groups, reflecting a rare consensus on the issue. The proposed legislation would expand the Affordable Care Act's essential health benefits to include prenatal, birth, and postpartum care. The bill's origins trace back to an Atlantic article challenging the anti-abortion movement to support policies that help families, though questions remain about whether eliminating childbirth costs would actually boost birth rates or reduce abortions. Optimism exists among bill supporters due to converging forces creating a window for bipartisan family policy, though challenges remain regarding fiscal restraint and potential accusations of supporting socialized medicine.</p>

          <p>Tensions are escalating in Angola's Cabinda exclave due to intensifying clashes between the government and separatist groups, with both sides accusing each other of human rights abuses. The Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC-FAC) alleges that the Angolan army is retaliating against civilians following separatist attacks, while the government denies these claims. Cabinda, rich in oil resources, has been seeking independence from Angola for approximately 50 years, citing its distinct cultural and historical identity. The region's living conditions have deteriorated significantly, despite producing a substantial portion of Angola's oil revenue, with calls for Cabinda's independence gaining support from the diaspora. The article notes the conflicting accounts and the long-standing conflict in the region.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has emerged as the frontrunner to sign striker Liam Delap from Ipswich after his Â£30 million release clause was activated following Ipswich's relegation from the Premier League. Delap's decision was influenced by Chelsea's Champions League qualification and the presence of Cole Palmer, along with having the youngest squad in the Premier League. Manchester United, Everton, Nottingham Forest, and Newcastle also expressed interest, but Chelsea's co-owner Behdad Eghbali met with Delap's agent, and head coach Enzo Maresca directly pitched to the player. Delap's next decision involves choosing between playing for England Under-21s or joining his new club for the Club World Cup.</p>

          <p>Adam Riess, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, is challenging the standard model of cosmology, particularly the theory of dark energy, which he helped establish. Riess's work on measuring the expansion rate of the universe has revealed discrepancies, known as the Hubble tension, that suggest the standard model may be flawed. While some cosmologists remain skeptical, Riess believes the Hubble tension will grow more pronounced, leading to a reevaluation of the universe's ultimate fate. Recent data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) hints that dark energy may be weakening, potentially altering the understanding of the universe's future.</p>

          <p>An experimental nasal spray containing a monoclonal antibody is being tested as a treatment to reduce Alzheimer's-related inflammation in the brain, with early results showing a decrease in inflammation in the first patient. The treatment, foralumab, is also being tested in people with other inflammatory diseases and represents a broader effort to address inflammation in the brain, which becomes more pronounced as Alzheimer's progresses. While it remains unclear if the treatment will improve cognitive function, the patient's wife has observed positive signs of increased social engagement. A clinical trial of foralumab for Alzheimer's disease is scheduled to begin later this year.</p>
