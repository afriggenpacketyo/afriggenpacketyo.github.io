          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.9% in August 2025, exceeding July's rate and marking the fastest annual inflation since January.  Economists attribute the increase to higher prices for food, electricity, and goods impacted by tariffs imposed during the Trump administration.  Core commodities, excluding food and energy, also saw a significant rise.  The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates to address the faltering job market, potentially impacting inflation further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nadine Menendez, wife of former Senator Bob Menendez, received a 54-month prison sentence for accepting bribes in exchange for political favors.  The bribes included cash, gold bars, a Mercedes-Benz, and payments for a low-to-no-show job.  Prosecutors sought a longer sentence, while the defense argued for leniency due to her ongoing cancer treatments.  Her husband, Bob Menendez, is also serving an 11-year sentence for his role in the scheme.</p>

          <p>The author reflects on the death of Charlie Kirk, noting his observance of the Jewish Sabbath as a surprising and moving detail amidst political polarization. The article contrasts Kirk's inflammatory statements with the grief felt by his family and supporters. The author draws parallels between the Sabbath's focus on reflection and the Jewish ritual of shiva, suggesting it as a framework for mourning in a divided society, even for those who disagreed with Kirk's political views.</p>
