          <p>A federal judge ruled against the U.S. government's request to break up Google by forcing the sale of its Chrome browser. The decision, stemming from a major antitrust case, concluded that Google maintained an illegal monopoly in the search market. While allowing Google to keep its multi-billion dollar default search engine deals with companies like Apple, the judge ordered the tech giant to share some of its valuable search data with competitors to foster a more level playing field. This ruling is seen as an attempt to curb Google's market power without resorting to more drastic structural remedies.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes former President Donald Trump's repeated assertions that he ended six or seven wars and deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. Foreign policy experts interviewed for the piece state that while Trump helped broker some ceasefires, such as between Israel and Iran, many of the cited conflicts were not full-scale wars and several remain unresolved. The analysis details each conflict, including those involving Armenia and Azerbaijan, and India and Pakistan, concluding that declaring them "settled" is often a premature or exaggerated assessment of the complex geopolitical situations.</p>

          <p>The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has publicly released 33,295 pages of records related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, which were provided by the Department of Justice. The release follows a subpoena issued by Chairman James Comer, and the DOJ has indicated it will continue to produce records while redacting victim identities and sensitive material. However, Democratic committee members have noted that a vast majority of the released files, estimated at 97%, were already in the public domain, with only a small fraction representing new information.</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot climbing to an estimated $1.3 billion, an analysis of lottery data highlights significant variations in take-home winnings based on state taxes. States like Florida and Texas, which do not tax lottery prizes, offer the highest potential payouts, while winners in states with high income taxes, such as New York, would receive considerably less. The article also explores the odds of winning, which stand at 1 in 292.2 million, and identifies the most and least frequently drawn numbers in recent drawings to inform prospective players.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted a "kinetic strike" in the Caribbean Sea, destroying a boat carrying narcotics from Venezuela and killing 11 individuals described as terrorists. The operation adds to rising tensions between Washington and Caracas, with the Trump administration accusing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro of leading a drug cartel. While some of Trump's allies view the naval buildup in the region as a move to oust Maduro, foreign policy experts express skepticism about a full military intervention, suggesting the action may be more of a signal than a prelude to war.</p>

          <p>Investors reacted positively to the federal judge's ruling in Google's antitrust case, which spared the company from a forced sale of its Chrome browser and other severe penalties. Shares of Google's parent company, Alphabet, jumped 8% in after-hours trading, while Apple's stock rose 4%, reflecting relief that the lucrative default search engine deal between the two companies was not banned. The market perceived the required remedies, such as sharing some search data, as manageable consequences, signaling confidence in the tech giants' continued financial stability and market position.</p>

          <p>The 42-story One California Plaza tower in downtown Los Angeles has been placed into receivership after its owners defaulted on a $300 million debt.

Factors contributing to the decline include increased remote work following the pandemic, rising interest rates making refinancing difficult, and tenants relocating to other areas, highlighting a broader financial crisis for downtown office landlords.</p>

Lowell contends the president's true motive is to pressure the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, and that firing Cook threatens the central bank's crucial political independence.</p>

          <p>In a sharply critical open letter, nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have accused Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of endangering Americans' health. They condemn his policies, including restricting vaccine access, cutting research funding, and firing key personnel like former CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez. Kennedy has defended his actions, stating the CDC had strayed from its mission and lost public trust, but the former leaders warn his tenure could jeopardize public safety and risk another pandemic.</p>

          <p>A Houston man has been charged with murder for fatally shooting an 11-year-old boy, Julian Guzman, who was playing a "ding-dong ditch" prank with his cousin. According to police, the suspect, Gonzalo Leon Jr., was "waiting in the shadows" behind a fence and followed the boys as they ran away before opening fire. The incident was partially captured on the victim's phone, and police later found numerous firearms in the suspect's home, describing him as a former Army veteran who appeared to be a gun collector.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his administration will ask the Supreme Court for an expedited ruling to overturn an appeals court decision that found most of his international tariffs illegal. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the power to impose tariffs rests with Congress, not the president. Trump argued that the tariffs are essential for the nation's financial stability, claiming that removing them would be devastating and could turn the U.S. into a "third-world country."

The new union will represent 600 employees, including park rangers, scientists, and first responders, giving them a collective voice to address concerns about staffing, resources, and workplace protections.</p>

Market strategists note that while both gold and Bitcoin are benefiting from geopolitical uncertainty, Bitcoin's performance has been somewhat tempered by a significant rotation of investor capital into Ethereum, which has been a market leader this summer.
