          <p>A gunman attacked a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, during Sunday services, killing four people and injuring eight. The suspect, identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, drove his truck into the building, opened fire, and then set a fire that caused the structure to partially collapse. The gunman was later killed in a shootout with police, and the FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence. The motive remains under investigation, with officials exploring potential connections to recent threats or the death of the church's president.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of "energy vampires," referring to friends who leave others feeling drained, and offers advice on how to manage these relationships. Psychologists identify common signs of such individuals, including a constant need for attention and a tendency to dominate conversations without showing interest in others. To cope, experts suggest setting clear boundaries, such as limiting the time spent together or the topics of conversation. Other strategies include communicating feelings directly to the friend or changing shared activities to something less conversation-focused, like exercising together, to protect one's own well-being.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced he is ending his campaign for re-election, citing fundraising difficulties and persistent media speculation about his political future. His withdrawal reshapes the race, which now primarily features Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, independent candidate and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams' first term was marked by a federal corruption investigation and low poll numbers, which complicated his re-election efforts. His departure has drawn reactions from various political figures, with many acknowledging his public service while focusing on the new dynamics of the mayoral contest.</p>

          <p>More than 100,000 U.S. federal workers are set to formally resign on Tuesday, marking the largest mass resignation in the nation's history. This event is part of a Trump administration program aimed at significantly reducing the federal workforce. The resignations coincide with a potential government shutdown, as the White House has also directed agencies to prepare for large-scale firings if Congress fails to pass a new funding bill. Departing employees have cited months of "fear and intimidation" and a loss of job security and mission focus as their primary reasons for leaving government service.</p>

          <p>For Hong Kong to achieve its ambitions as a green maritime fuel hub, it must establish a reliable supply chain for green methanol, according to Wang Yongxin, president of CM Energy. While the city has made progress with LNG and biodiesel fueling, developing infrastructure for methanol will be critical. The statement was made during a ceremony for the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, the world's first large vehicle carrier capable of running on methanol. The vessel's current fuel mix is one-quarter green methanol, which costs about four times more than traditional fuel, but usage is expected to increase by 2027.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking an expedited review from the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the president's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. After lower courts blocked the order, which reinterprets the 14th Amendment to exclude children of non-citizen parents, the administration is pushing for a definitive judgment by next summer. The executive order, signed on Trump's first day, declares that only newborns with parents who have permanent legal status are eligible for citizenship. This move challenges over a century of legal precedent established in the 1898 case U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark.</p>

          <p>Federal officials have confirmed that the gunman who attacked a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas was acting alone and specifically targeting ICE agents. Notes found at the residence of the suspect, Joshua Jahn, revealed his animosity toward the agency and indicated he had been planning the attack for some time. The shooter used a legally purchased rifle from a nearby rooftop, killing one detainee and critically injuring two others who were inside a transport van.

The report focuses on the Eagle S, a Russian shadow fleet oil tanker that allegedly dragged its anchor for 66 miles, severing vital cables and prompting Finnish special forces to seize the vessel. This incident is one of at least 11 suspicious cable cuts in the region since Russia's war in Ukraine began. In response, NATO has launched "Baltic Sentry" to monitor the shadow fleet and protect the essential data and energy conduits.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Utah Governor Spencer Cox is urging Americans to condemn political violence and engage in more civil debate. Cox expressed his shock and anger over the shooting, which he views as a symptom of a "broken" nation where inflammatory rhetoric is escalating. He blames social media for amplifying division and hate, calling it a "cancer" on society. Through his bipartisan "Disagree Better" initiative with the National Governors Association, Cox advocates for finding ways to have productive disagreements without resorting to violence.</p>

          <p>The picturesque Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, famous for its historic windmills, plans to introduce a €17.50 entrance fee for non-local visitors starting next spring. The measure aims to control the overwhelming number of tourists, which reached 2.6 million last year, compared to a resident population of just 100. Local officials say visitors often disrupt residents' privacy by entering their gardens and homes. While the fee is intended to fund maintenance and new infrastructure, local shop and restaurant owners worry it will deter customers and harm their businesses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The growing popularity of weight-loss injections like Ozempic and Wegovy is creating a two-tier system that benefits the wealthy, according to health experts. While these drugs are effective, strict NHS eligibility criteria and regional disparities mean that over 90% of UK users pay privately, at a cost of up to £350 a month. This raises concerns that access to crucial obesity treatment is becoming a luxury, exacerbating existing health inequalities, as obesity rates are significantly higher in more deprived areas. Experts warn against medicalizing a social issue without addressing the root causes in the food industry.</p>

          <p>The New York Mets have been eliminated from postseason contention following a 4-0 loss to the Miami Marlins on the final day of the regular season. The defeat marks the culmination of a dramatic second-half collapse for the team, which held the best record in the major leagues in mid-June. Despite having the league's highest payroll, the Mets went 38-55 after a key injury to starter Kodai Senga, ultimately losing the final National League wildcard spot to the Cincinnati Reds. The ending is reminiscent of similar late-season collapses endured by the franchise in 2007 and 2008.</p>

          <p>Residents in South Florida are experiencing a rise in encounters with invasive Burmese pythons, which pose a significant threat to native wildlife and ecosystems. Recent incidents required Miami-Dade Fire Rescue to remove large pythons from residential properties, highlighting the species' spread beyond the Everglades. These snakes have no natural predators in the region and have decimated populations of native mammals like raccoons and opossums. State programs encourage the elimination of these pythons, allowing residents to humanely kill them on private land to help control their population.</p>

He defends the varied interpretations of great literary works, asserting that their magic lies in this diversity.
