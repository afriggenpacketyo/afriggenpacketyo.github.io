          <p>Chicago Police Officer Krystal Rivera was fatally shot by a fellow officer during a chase in Chatham. Officers were attempting an investigatory stop when the suspect fled into an apartment building. During the pursuit, a second individual pointed a rifle at the officers, leading to a weapon discharge that unintentionally struck Rivera. The incident is under investigation by CPD and COPA, with concerns raised about body camera usage and protocols during the stop. Rivera, a four-year veteran and mother, was honored for her dedication to saving lives at a march for missing women, and psychologists are concerned about the mental well-being of officers in the 6th District.</p>

          <p>A federal judge approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow US colleges to pay athletes, marking a significant shift in college sports. The settlement permits schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and compensates former players who were previously barred from revenue sharing. This agreement is expected to professionalize college athletics, impacting recruitment and potentially leading to program adjustments at various schools. The settlement also establishes a third-party clearinghouse to review name, image, and likeness (NIL) agreements, which could face legal challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The phone call between the leaders of China and the US could offer a respite for many Asian countries caught in their rivalry, but the detente might also complicate their calculations on how to strike a balance between the two superpowers, according to analysts.

The call marked a “tentative step back from the brink, offering brief respite for Asian neighbours like South Korea”.</p>

          <p>Mykale Baker, an 18-year-old in Dacula, Georgia, helped his Burger King coworkers on his graduation night and was rewarded with significant donations. Baker, still wearing his graduation sash, stepped in to assist his swamped colleagues. A customer, Maria Mendoza, captured the act on video and started a crowdfunding campaign. The campaign raised over $200,000, and the Burger King Foundation surprised Baker with $10,000. Baker plans to use the money to attend trade school and become a master auto mechanic.</p>

Musk posted a poll on X asking if it's time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle. The name bears a resemblance to America PAC, the political action committee founded by Musk last year that was his main vehicle for spending $239 million to help elect Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates in 2024.

New figures released quietly by ministers in recent days show the Home Office plans to spend £2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year - that is only marginally less than the £2.3bn it spent in 2024/25. The money is largely used to cover the accommodation costs of thousands of asylum seekers who have recently arrived in the UK. The Home Office said it was committed to ending asylum hotels and was speeding up asylum decisions to save taxpayers' money.</p>
