          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is set to attend a "Victory Day" military parade in Beijing, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two. This will be his first major international summit in years, where he will join other leaders including Russia's Vladimir Putin. The event is a significant diplomatic opportunity for Chinese President Xi Jinping, reinforcing his geopolitical influence with both leaders amid ongoing discussions with the United States. Kim's presence, alongside the display of China's latest military hardware, underscores a strengthening alliance between the three nations.</p>

          <p>The European Union is experiencing its most severe wildfire season on record, with over one million hectares burned, an area equivalent to half of Wales. Spain and Portugal have been disproportionately affected, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total devastation. Scientists from the World Weather Attribution group have directly linked the increased frequency and intensity of these fires to climate change, which creates hotter and drier conditions. The fires also contribute to a vicious cycle by releasing record amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p>

          <p>A controversial temporary immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," is expected to have zero detainees within a few days, according to a state official. The closure follows a federal judge's order to wind down operations, which she upheld despite an appeal from the Trump administration and Florida officials. The judge was unpersuaded by arguments that the facility was necessary due to overcrowding elsewhere, noting its temporary design. The state is concurrently opening a new detention center called "Deportation Depot."</p>

          <p>A shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a school Mass has left two children, aged 8 and 10, dead and 17 other people injured. The 23-year-old shooter fired a rifle through the church windows before taking their own life. The attacker, identified as Robin Westman, was the child of a former school employee and had posted videos online detailing the planned attack. The incident, which occurred during the first week of school, is being investigated by the FBI as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics.</p>

          <p>To commemorate the 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's brutal murder, his cousin and the last living eyewitness to his kidnapping, Rev. Wheeler Parker, Jr., recreated the fateful train journey from Chicago to Mississippi. The 1955 lynching of the 14-year-old boy, and his mother's decision to hold an open-casket funeral, became a pivotal catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement. The commemorative ride, organized by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, serves as a solemn reminder of the nation's history with racial violence. Parker emphasized the event is about remembering progress and the work that remains.</p>

However, the receptionist testified that she saw the guard cornering a pregnant Cardi B and that the guard was the aggressor, even causing a cut on the receptionist's own forehead.

Experts point to various factors, including the company's overall decline in new car sales and public perception issues.

          <p>Nvidia reported quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street estimates, driven by continued high demand for its artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company also issued a strong sales forecast for the upcoming quarter, projecting revenue growth to remain above 50%. Despite the positive results, the stock price fell in extended trading because its data center revenue, while up 56% year-over-year to $41.1 billion, fell slightly short of analysts' specific expectations for the second consecutive quarter.

          <p>Argentine President Javier Milei was pelted with stones, plants, and bottles while campaigning in the province of Buenos Aires.

          <p>After more than two and a half years in office, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed Steve Kang, President of the Board of Public Works, to serve as the city's chief film liaison.

The appointment is seen as a vital step to help streamline filming in L.A. at a time when the city faces intense competition for production jobs from other locations offering tax incentives and cheaper labor.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that California is facing a growing risk of intense dust storms, known as haboobs, due to factors exacerbated by climate change. Conditions such as widespread drought, water overuse, and wildfires are creating more dry, loose soil, making areas like the Central Valley and Southern California more susceptible. These storms pose significant health risks, as the dust can carry toxic materials like pesticides, heavy metals, and fungal spores that cause valley fever. The particles also reduce visibility and can damage infrastructure like solar panels.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated there is a "real possibility" of introducing the company's advanced Blackwell AI processors to the Chinese market, pending U.S. government approval. This follows a deal where Nvidia received export licenses for its previous-generation H20 chip in exchange for a percentage of sales revenue going to the U.S. government. Huang emphasized the importance of American tech companies leading in the global AI race, arguing that supplying China with modified chips is preferable to forcing them to develop homegrown alternatives.
