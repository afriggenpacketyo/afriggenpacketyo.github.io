        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has resigned following significant pressure from the Trump administration. His resignation came after his office determined there was insufficient evidence to criminally charge New York Attorney General Letitia James, a prominent political adversary of the president. The pressure campaign reportedly involved direct calls for Siebert's removal from President Trump, who publicly stated he wanted the prosecutor "out." This event raises serious concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department and its traditional independence from the White House, marking a notable escalation in the administration's targeting of political opponents.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have rested their case against Ryan Routh, the individual accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at his Florida golf course last year. The prosecution's final witness detailed how Routh allegedly conducted surveillance while living out of a gas station for a month prior to the incident. Routh, who is representing himself in court, is accused of a methodical plan involving a military-grade weapon and burner phones. He faces five criminal charges, including the attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, and is expected to begin his defense case next week.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted a "lethal kinetic strike" on a boat allegedly involved in drug trafficking, resulting in the deaths of three individuals described as "narcoterrorists." This marks the third such publicly announced strike in recent weeks, part of a broader administration effort to crack down on drug cartels in the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility. The action has drawn criticism from some lawmakers who question its legal justification and argue it represents an overreach of presidential authority. The strikes also occur amidst heightened tensions between the United States and Venezuela, which the administration has linked to drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>Recent political pressure on broadcasters has brought the role and authority of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) into sharp focus. This article explains that the FCC, an independent agency, is responsible for issuing licenses to local TV and radio stations, requiring them to operate in the "public interest," but it does not directly regulate national networks or cable channels. The controversy stems from the FCC chairman's suggestion of regulatory action against broadcasters for content critical of the administration, raising questions about government censorship and the First Amendment. While the FCC has the theoretical power to revoke licenses, experts note that such enforcement has become rare since the 1980s.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have reportedly discussed a deal concerning the future of TikTok's U.S. operations, though their public statements suggest differing levels of agreement. While Trump indicated that Xi approved a deal that would see TikTok's U.S. business sold to American investors, Chinese state media characterized the conversation as Beijing welcoming negotiations. The core of the negotiations revolves around the ownership of TikTok's powerful algorithm, a point of contention for U.S. lawmakers concerned about national security and potential influence from the Chinese Communist Party.

          <p>The arrest of Harjit Kaur, a 73-year-old Sikh woman who has lived in California for over three decades, has caused shock and anger within her community. Kaur, whose asylum application was denied years ago, was detained by ICE during a routine check-in, an action her supporters call shameful and inhumane. Despite having no criminal record and faithfully reporting to authorities for 13 years, she now faces deportation to India, a country where she has no remaining family or home. The case highlights the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement, which critics say targets long-term residents who have followed legal processes.</p>

          <p>A short-term government funding bill passed by the House failed to advance in the Senate, leaving no clear path to avoid a shutdown before the October 1 deadline. The Republican-led measure was blocked by Senate Democrats, who opposed the bill due to the exclusion of their priorities, particularly regarding healthcare funding. With Congress now in recess until just before the deadline, the political stalemate intensifies the risk of a funding lapse. President Trump acknowledged the possibility of a shutdown, stating the country could be "closed for a period of time," while leaders from both parties blame each other for the impasse.</p>

While stating he was glad Kimmel was suspended, Cruz warned that using government power to regulate speech sets a perilous precedent that could be used against conservatives in the future.

This "tech bromance" was highlighted during President Trump's state visit, with figures like Nvidia's Jensen Huang expressing extraordinary enthusiasm for the UK's research and development capabilities. While some critics worry about the UK becoming overly dependent on Silicon Valley, the influx of capital is seen as a significant boost for the economy. The investments are expected to sprinkle "Silicon Valley stardust" on the UK's scientific hubs and solidify its role in the global tech landscape.</p>

          <p>Actor Cillian Murphy, who recently won an Oscar for "Oppenheimer," has reflected on his defining role as Tommy Shelby in the hit series "Peaky Blinders." He described playing the character for a quarter of his life as a "gift and a privilege" but emphasized that he is nothing like the "psychopathic gangster" in real life. Murphy confirmed that a "Peaky Blinders" film is forthcoming from Netflix, though he kept plot details under wraps to maintain the surprise for fans. The actor is currently promoting his new film, "Steve," in which he plays the headteacher of a reform school for troubled boys.</p>

          <p>A protest outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Chicago turned chaotic when federal agents deployed tear gas and pepper balls to disperse demonstrators. The group of about 100 protesters, including two Democratic congressional candidates, had attempted to block government vehicles from entering the building during a city-wide immigration crackdown. At least three arrests were made during the clashes, which witnesses described as a violent response to a peaceful demonstration against the administration's immigration policies. The Department of Homeland Security later defended the action, stating that impeding ICE operations sides with criminal organizations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UCLA has released new, formalized rules for campus protests as it faces pressure from the Trump administration to crack down on demonstrations. The guidelines ban unauthorized overnight encampments and prohibit demonstrations in certain areas like Royce Quad, the site of a major pro-Palestinian protest last spring. However, the university has also expanded some free speech zones and will still allow preapproved overnight events, diverging from some of the administration's demands. The policies aim to balance free expression with campus safety, but some student leaders have criticized them as overly broad and susceptible to discretionary enforcement.</p>

The "We Are America" march was organized in response to actions by the Trump administration and aimed to build a nonviolent movement for change.

          <p>In a city with few consistent venues for Latinx comedians, the "Pupusas and Punchlines" comedy show has become a thriving cultural hub. Held weekly at a Salvadoran restaurant in Los Angeles, the show provides a platform for both established and up-and-coming comics to connect with an appreciative audience over food and shared experiences. Creator Justin Alexio started the event to counter the marginalization of Black and brown performers in mainstream comedy clubs. The show's success highlights a strong desire for community-focused entertainment where performers can freely joke about the immigrant experience and build their careers.</p>

          <p>Looking ahead to the next week on Wall Street, investors are advised to monitor key economic indicators and corporate earnings reports. The release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a crucial inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, will be a major focus. Additionally, quarterly results from major companies like Micron and Costco will provide insights into the health of the technology and retail sectors. While some investors remain skeptical about recent market gains, many sectors are expected to continue their rally, driven by ongoing economic dynamics and corporate performance.

          <p>Estonia has formally requested urgent consultations with NATO allies under Article 4 after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace for 12 minutes. The Estonian government condemned the incursion over the Gulf of Finland as a "brazen" and "extremely dangerous provocation." NATO jets from Italy, Finland, and Sweden were scrambled to intercept and escort the Russian aircraft, which had their transponders off and were not in communication with air traffic control. The incident marks a significant escalation of tensions and is seen as a test of the alliance's resolve on its eastern flank.</p>
