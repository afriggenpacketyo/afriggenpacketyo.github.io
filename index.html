        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sony Group shares saw a rise of over 2% amid volatile trading after the company announced a 250 billion yen share buyback and reported operating income that exceeded analyst estimates. The operating income for the last three months of the financial year was 203.6 billion yen, surpassing the LSEG estimate of 192.2 billion yen, though it decreased by 11% from the previous year. Sony also shared details regarding a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of the shares to Sony Group shareholders through dividends. However, Sony's outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was lackluster, forecasting a slight increase in operating profit, with a potential hit from US trade policies, though this may change due to a recent US-China trade deal.

          <p>Family offices, which manage wealth for the ultra-rich, are experiencing rapid growth and are expected to manage $5.4 trillion in assets by 2030. However, these offices face significant challenges in recruiting and retaining qualified money managers, with a potential shortage of advisors looming. Trust is a critical factor in hiring, often outweighing other qualifications, and family offices must compete with banks and private equity firms for top talent. Young employees are sometimes reluctant to work in family offices due to the lack of clear corporate structure and career progression, and European family offices are increasing compensation packages to attract and retain talent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British businesses are expressing concerns that the UK government's plans to tighten immigration rules on foreign workers will lead to labor shortages in key sectors. The new proposals include stricter English-language requirements and higher skill thresholds for work visas. Businesses fear that British workers will be unable or unwilling to fill the gaps, especially in sectors like health and social care, which heavily rely on migrant staff. The government aims to reduce migration and prioritize British workers, but industry leaders warn that training and skills development alone cannot solve the impending labor shortages.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, potentially leading to their release after over three decades for killing their parents in 1989. Judge Michael V. Jesic cited their rehabilitation in prison and letters from corrections officials as factors in his decision. The brothers apologized for their crimes during the hearing, expressing remorse for their actions. While the judge's decision makes them immediately eligible for parole, the final determination rests with Gov. Gavin Newsom and state parole-board officials, who are scheduled to appear before the board on June 13.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has approved a potential sale of over $1.4 billion in helicopters and F-16 fighter jet parts to the United Arab Emirates, coinciding with President Donald Trump's upcoming visit. The proposed sale includes $1.32 billion for CH-47 F Chinook helicopters and $130 million for F-16 parts, although some Democrats in Congress have expressed hesitation. This decision comes as Trump is scheduled to visit the UAE as part of his Middle East trip, amidst concerns about potential conflicts of interest due to UAE investments in Trump's ventures.</p>

          <p>President Zelenskyy has challenged Putin to meet him in Istanbul for peace talks, following Putin's demand for negotiations in Istanbul. This move is seen as a high-stakes gamble as both Ukraine and Russia vie for Donald Trump's support in resolving the conflict. While Putin has yet to respond, analysts believe he is unlikely to accept Zelenskyy's challenge, as both countries attempt to gain leverage amidst increasing pressure to end the war. The article suggests that the primary goal for both Russia and Ukraine is to secure Trump's backing, with the potential for a breakthrough hinging on his involvement.</p>

Critics suggest that Trump is using this program to position himself as a savior of white privilege and Christianity, while others point to the strained relations between Pretoria and Washington, particularly due to South Africa's ties with BRICS countries and its lawsuit against Israel.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear-enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washingtonâ€™s demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. The proposal, presented by Iranâ€™s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, to American special envoy Steve Witkoff, suggests Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade and then ship it to other Arab countries for civilian use. This plan aims to create a permanent solution, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and would involve on-the-ground presence of representatives from other countries, providing extra oversight. While the U.S. has denied the proposal, Iranian media outlets have reported on the new plan, raising questions about its feasibility.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices experienced a decrease in April, marking the first drop in months, but still remain near historic highs. The average price for a dozen Grade A eggs fell to $5.12, after reaching a record $6.23 in March, with the overall average price of eggs declining by 12.7%. This decline is attributed to reduced consumer demand after Easter and fewer bird flu outbreaks at commercial poultry operations. Despite this decrease, retail egg prices are still significantly higher than the previous year, due to the ongoing impact of bird flu wiping out flocks of egg-laying hens.</p>

This development has prompted military analysts to reassess China's military capabilities, particularly in the context of potential conflicts like a Taiwan invasion.

          <p>Ukrainian refugees living in Poland are reporting a rise in anti-Ukrainian sentiment, including abuse on public transport, bullying in schools, and xenophobic material online. A presidential election campaign has amplified these tensions, with some candidates expressing anti-Ukrainian views. While many Poles initially showed compassion and support for Ukrainian refugees, attitudes have shifted, with a decline in public support for accepting refugees. This has led to increased fear and a desire among some Ukrainians to return home, highlighting the challenges faced by refugees integrating into a new society.</p>

          <p>Casandra Ventura, known as Cassie, testified in the federal sexual assault and racketeering trial of Sean Combs, detailing drug-fueled sex sessions with male prostitutes that she described as "disgusting" and "humiliating." She claimed Mr. Combs dictated her sex acts and appearance, including nail color, and demanded she reapply baby oil frequently. Ventura testified that these sessions, known as freak-offs, lasted for days, leaving her feeling degraded and exploited. She stated she stayed in the relationship due to love and fear of Mr. Combs's power and potential blackmail.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Uganda have observed wild chimpanzees using medicinal plants to treat open wounds and other injuries, both on themselves and on each other. This research builds on previous discoveries that chimpanzees seek out and eat certain plants for self-medication. The study documented instances of chimpanzees applying plants to wounds and using leaves for hygiene, suggesting a behavioral repertoire for self-care and empathy. Some of the plants used have antibacterial properties, further supporting the medicinal use of these plants by chimpanzees.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told Sky News that Canadians "weren't impressed" by the UK government's decision to offer Donald Trump a second state visit, viewing it as undermining Canadian sovereignty. Carney noted that the invitation clashed with Canada's efforts to assert its sovereignty against U.S. threats. He also mentioned inviting the King to open Canada's parliament as a symbol of sovereignty. Since then, tensions between the two countries have abated, and further negotiations on trade and security are expected soon.</p>
