          <p>Former NFL star Shawne Merriman is introducing an innovative advertising technology to his mixed martial arts organization, Lights Out Xtreme Fighting (LXF). In a partnership with PTF Lab, LXF will utilize AI-powered virtual sponsorships, where advertisements displayed on the fighting canvas will change with each fight for viewers watching at home. Merriman described this as a "game-changer" for combat sports, allowing companies to sponsor fights on a more flexible, per-minute basis at a lower cost. He believes this new revenue model will help smaller, regional promotions remain successful in a competitive market by providing an incremental income stream without needing to raise significant capital.</p>

          <p>A two-year-old wild burro, nicknamed Cupid, is recovering after being shot with a hunting arrow in Moreno Valley, California, the latest in a series of similar attacks. The arrow punctured the donkey's lung, requiring emergency surgery to remove the arrowhead. Cupid is now stable and will join other rescued burros at the DonkeyLand sanctuary upon full recovery. The non-profit organization is offering a $24,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for at least six such attacks since June. Wild burros are a protected and iconic species in the American Southwest, valued by the community for their historical significance and role in wildfire prevention.</p>

          <p>Utah County prosecutor Jeffrey Gray has charged 22-year-old Tyler Robinson with aggravated murder for the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and announced his intent to seek the death penalty. During a detailed press conference, Gray laid out evidence that included incriminating text messages Robinson allegedly sent to his roommate, with whom he was romantically involved. In these messages, Robinson reportedly confessed to the shooting, stating he'd "had enough of his hatred" and that "some hate can’t be negotiated out." The evidence presented suggests the motive was tied to Robinson's recent left-leaning political shift and support for LGBTQ+ rights, which conflicted with his family's conservative views and Kirk's public rhetoric.</p>

Upon his arrival, Trump is scheduled to meet with King Charles and other senior royals at Windsor Castle for a ceremonial welcome, a military inspection, and a state banquet. The visit is framed as a diplomatic effort to strengthen the "special relationship," with a major US technology investment deal announced as it began. The UK government aims to use the visit to encourage continued US commitment to NATO and support for Ukraine, showcasing military cooperation through joint flypasts and a large guard of honour.</p>

          <p>Google's generative AI application, Gemini, has claimed the top spot for free apps on Apple's App Store, overtaking its main competitor, OpenAI's ChatGPT. This surge in popularity follows recent updates to Gemini, including a new image-editing feature that reportedly attracted 13 million new users in just four days. The demand was so high that Google had to enact temporary usage limits over the weekend. This success in the consumer AI space has also bolstered investor confidence, helping parent company Alphabet's market capitalization surpass the $3 trillion mark as its stock continues to climb.</p>

However, some experts caution that long-term rates may not be significantly impacted by a cut in the short-term federal funds rate, especially in a non-recessionary environment.

          <p>As President Trump visits the UK, this article profiles Winfield House, the official residence of the U.S. ambassador in London where he is staying. Located in Regent's Park, the 35-room mansion boasts the second-largest private garden in central London and has a long history of hosting diplomatic events, celebrities, and royalty. Originally rebuilt by Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton, it was sold to the U.S. government for one dollar in 1946. The residence is known for its high security and exclusivity, serving as a key venue for American soft power diplomacy and lavish events, such as its annual Fourth of July party.</p>

          <p>Following the firing of head coach DeShaun Foster after an 0-3 start, UCLA has named Tim Skipper as its interim coach. Skipper, who was serving as a special assistant, has a long-standing relationship with Foster and a deep history with Fresno State, where he previously served as interim coach. Known for his relentlessly positive attitude and ability to connect with players, Skipper faces the significant challenge of boosting team morale, preventing roster departures, and fixing struggling offensive and defensive units. Despite the difficult circumstances, those who know him believe he is up for the challenge and will command immediate respect from the team.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, numerous individuals have faced professional consequences, including termination and suspension, for their public comments on the matter. Among those affected are a sports reporter, a university employee, an MSNBC analyst, and a U.S. Secret Service agent, whose employers deemed their remarks inappropriate or in violation of company policy. The article notes that private companies generally have the legal right to fire employees for public statements that could harm the business's reputation.

This new route is significant as it will be China's first to South America that transits through the southern hemisphere, bypassing congested hubs in the United States and Europe.

          <p>Five top executives of RCI Hospitality Holdings, including CEO Eric Langan, have been indicted for an alleged multi-million-dollar tax fraud and bribery scheme. New York's Attorney General announced that the executives allegedly bribed a state tax auditor with complimentary trips to Florida strip clubs and cash to avoid paying over $8 million in sales taxes between 2010 and 2024. The scheme reportedly involved taxes on "Dance Dollars" used for private dances at the company's Manhattan clubs. RCI's stock price dropped significantly following the announcement of the 79-count indictment, though a lawyer for the company has denied the allegations.</p>

          <p>Recent data suggests that California's summer wave of COVID-19 may be leveling off, though coronavirus levels in wastewater remain high. While the statewide test positivity rate recently hit a seasonal peak, the rate of new hospital admissions has seen a slight decline. In Los Angeles County, transmission appears to be slowing, and in San Francisco, some experts believe the wave is cresting. However, other areas like Orange County are still in the middle of the wave, with emergency room visits for COVID-like illness at their highest level this year. Overall, hospitalizations remain low compared to previous surges in the pandemic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a quarter-point interest rate cut this week as it balances a softening labor market against inflation concerns. The decision comes amid significant political pressure from the White House, with President Trump urging a larger and more immediate reduction. The meeting will also see the debut of a new Trump-appointed governor, Stephen Miran, who is expected to dissent in favor of a more aggressive cut. While the initial rate reduction is largely anticipated by markets, the Fed's updated economic forecast and the "dot plot" of future rate expectations will be closely watched for signals on its policy direction for the remainder of the year.
