          <p>The Trump administration's handling of classified information has drawn criticism, particularly regarding the accidental disclosure of military attack plans via a non-governmental messaging app.  The administration's claim that the information was not classified has been disputed by national security experts.  This incident contrasts sharply with the administration's invocation of state secrets to avoid disclosing details about deportation flights.</p>

          <p>Analysis of ancient DNA from two individuals who lived in the now-arid Sahara Desert 7,000 years ago reveals a previously unknown human lineage.  These individuals, part of a pastoralist culture, remained genetically isolated for thousands of years despite the adoption of animal husbandry.  Their lineage persisted until the Sahara's climate shifted, leaving a genetic legacy among some modern North African populations.</p>
