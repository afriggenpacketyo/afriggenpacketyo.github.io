          <p>The leaders of China and India have signaled a move toward deeper trust and cooperation during a meeting at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin. Chinese President Xi Jinping stated the two nations should be partners, not rivals, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi noted an improved "atmosphere of peace." This diplomatic warming occurs as both countries face economic pressure from the United States, with Modi announcing that direct flights suspended since 2020 border clashes will resume.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has reported the first fatal case of whooping cough in an infant this year, noting the baby's mother was not vaccinated during pregnancy. This tragic event highlights a broader national concern over declining childhood immunization rates, with none of the main vaccines meeting the 95% uptake target for herd immunity. Officials are urging pregnant women to get vaccinated to provide passive protection to newborns in their first weeks of life, as they push back against rising vaccine hesitancy.</p>

The president acknowledged the right to peaceful assembly but warned against activities that are outside or against the law.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines whether the Trump administration's actions are normalizing autocratic tendencies within the United States, drawing parallels to authoritarian regimes abroad. It cites examples such as calls to arrest political opponents, the revocation of a rival's Secret Service protection, and the use of federal agents for large-scale immigration raids. Political scientists and activists express concern that these systematic efforts to control government institutions are shifting the U.S. toward a "competitive authoritarian system," a trend that some observers who fled persecution elsewhere find grimly familiar.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order to prohibit city police from cooperating with National Guard troops or federal agents if President Trump deploys them to the city. The order asserts that such a deployment without local consent would undermine democratic norms and civil liberties, instructing Chicago officers to maintain their distinct uniforms and avoid joint operations. This action escalates an ongoing feud between the Democratic city and state leaders and the Trump administration over the potential federal intervention in local law enforcement.</p>

          <p>NPR is seeking stories from Americans under 40 to understand how financial instability is impacting their lives and political views. Generations Z and millennials, who came of age during periods of economic uncertainty, are facing significant barriers such as a difficult job market and unaffordable housing, with the median age of a first-time homebuyer now at 38. This economic anxiety is contributing to a declining belief in the American dream and may be influencing voting patterns and major life decisions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially canceled $679 million in federal grants designated for 12 port projects intended to support the burgeoning U.S. offshore wind industry. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy described the funding as wasteful, suggesting it could be redirected to other critical port upgrades. This move is part of President Trump's broader campaign against wind power, which critics argue will stifle clean energy development, eliminate thousands of jobs, and potentially increase electricity costs for consumers.</p>

          <p>A new study by Chinese military researchers suggests that the complex undersea topography of the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea could be exploited for strategic advantage. The research proposes placing intelligent sea mines in "acoustic shadow zones," areas around submerged mountains where sonar is ineffective, to create a submarine kill zone. This tactic would enhance the concealment of underwater weapons, allowing them to evade detection and selectively target enemy vessels, potentially challenging U.S. naval dominance in the region.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion for the upcoming Monday night drawing, making it the fifth-largest prize in the game's history. No ticket matched all six winning numbers in Saturday's drawing for the $1 billion grand prize, causing the jackpot to roll over. The next winner will have the option of a lump sum cash payment of approximately $498.4 million before taxes or an annuity option paid out over 30 years. This is the sixth time the game's top prize has surpassed the billion-dollar mark.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-1 in a game marked by uncharacteristic mistakes and a lack of offensive support for pitcher Tyler Glasnow. Glasnow pitched a strong game, taking a no-hitter into the sixth inning, but the team's defense committed costly errors and the offense failed to capitalize on scoring opportunities. The loss, described by manager Dave Roberts as one where "we beat ourselves," narrows the Dodgers' lead in the National League West to just one game.</p>

          <p>Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, has stated an ambitious goal for his network to handle more transaction volume than the Swift international banking system within the next five years.

This confidence is driven by Tron's growing dominance in the global stablecoin market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Protests have erupted in cities across Mexico as thousands of people took to the streets to demand government action and justice for the country's more than 130,000 missing individuals. Relatives of the disappeared, many of whom have formed their own search parties, marched to highlight what the UN calls "a human tragedy of enormous proportions." The vast majority of these disappearances have occurred since 2007, largely attributed to organized crime cartels and, in some cases, security forces.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles City Councilmember Ysabel Jurado has publicly opposed plans for a new Home Depot in Eagle Rock, accusing the company of being complicit in federal immigration raids. Her statement follows a recent raid near a Westlake Home Depot, one of several such operations targeting day laborers in the store's parking lots. Jurado argued that by remaining silent, the company has chosen "power and profit over the working people who sustain it." Home Depot responded that it is not notified of ICE operations and is required to follow all federal laws.</p>
