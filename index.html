          <p>President Donald Trump dismissed interest in speaking with Elon Musk, referring to him as someone who has "lost his mind" following Musk's criticism of Trump's policies. Trump mentioned focusing on positive economic indicators and a planned visit to China. Sources close to Trump suggest he is more saddened than angered by the fallout, and he is considering selling his Tesla vehicle. Musk's father urged his son to end the feud, predicting Trump would prevail due to his election victory. The White House downplayed the dispute, stating Trump remains focused on passing his legislative agenda.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains how medical debt affects credit scores and what individuals can do to manage it. Recent changes in credit reporting rules have eased the burden, with paid medical collections no longer appearing on credit reports and a one-year waiting period before unpaid bills are added. Smaller debts under $500 are excluded entirely. Strategies for managing medical debt include reviewing and negotiating bills, applying for financial assistance from nonprofit hospitals, and considering debt relief programs. Monitoring credit reports regularly for errors is also crucial, as is acting quickly and proactively.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to lift a court order that reinstated Education Department employees who were laid off as part of efforts to dismantle the agency. The administration argues that the district judge lacked the authority to require the rehire of the workers. The staff reduction, affecting over 1,300 employees, was intended to streamline the Department. The judge pointed out that the staff cuts led to the closure of civil rights enforcement offices and eliminated the team supervising FAFSA.</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old law student, "Nathaniel", called into “The Ramsey Show” to ask if he would be a jerk not to pay off his fiancée's parents' debt in China. Nathaniel explained that he inherited about $1 million a few years ago but has kept it secret from his fiancée, a pianist, who has no assets or liabilities. Dave Ramsey and co-host Jade Warshaw advised him to have a serious, honest conversation with his fiancée immediately. Ramsey warned against enabling repeated financial mistakes.</p>

          <p>Oghenochuko Ojiri, a former Bargain Hunt art expert, has been sentenced to two years and six months in prison for failing to declare art sales to a suspected financier of Hezbollah. Ojiri admitted to eight counts under the Terrorism Act 2000. The art expert's "humiliation is complete" with the star losing "his good name" and the "work he loves." Transactions uncovered by UK police showed the suspected Hezbollah financier paid nearly £140,000 for works, which he had shipped from London to Dubai and Beirut.</p>
