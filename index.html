          <p>E.l.f. Beauty reported a 30% decline in net income for its first fiscal quarter since President Donald Trump's tariffs were announced, causing an initial stock drop. Despite this, CEO Tarang Amin emphasizes the company's consistent growth over 26 quarters and strategic expansions, including the new $1 billion acquisition of Hailey Bieber's popular skincare brand, Rhode. This article notes that E.l.f. is already the No. 1 color cosmetics brand in the U.S. by units sold and the most purchased by Gen Z, Gen Alpha, and millennial consumers. Experts are cautiously optimistic about the Rhode deal, expecting it to be accretive despite being financed with $600 million of debt, positioning E.l.f. for continued market leadership and challenging legacy players.</p>

          <p>Following a US-China tariff truce, experts anticipate continued difficult negotiations rather than immediate breakthroughs, suggesting a long-term test of trade resilience. While neither nation desires re-escalation of tariffs, a comprehensive resolution remains unlikely, implying ongoing extensions and adjustments will be the norm. President Trump indicated a potential meeting with President Xi Jinping by year-end if a trade deal progresses, signaling a diplomatic path forward despite underlying tensions. This article highlights that the current situation is a temporary pause rather than a definitive end to trade friction, requiring careful management from both sides.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats has surpassed 50,000 since the Labour government took power last summer, with 474 arrivals on a single Monday. This milestone has intensified political debate, with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson vowing to "turn this around" and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticizing Labour's plan. A woman tragically died attempting the crossing, highlighting the inherent dangers of the journey. This article notes that while the government's new "one in, one out" returns deal with France is expected to begin soon, critics argue for expanding safe and legal routes to effectively combat people-smuggling gangs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has dramatically escalated his pressure on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, threatening a "major lawsuit" over the alleged $3 billion cost of the Fed's headquarters renovation. Trump, who labeled Powell a "loser" and "Too Late," claims the project should have cost only $50 million and criticizes Powell's management as "grossly incompetent." This threat comes as Trump continues to demand immediate interest rate cuts, while Powell has previously stated that Trump's tariff policies have hindered monetary easing this year. This article details how the Fed has defended the renovation costs, pushing back on Trump's public assertions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve shifts towards potential rate cuts, savers are evaluating money market accounts (MMAs) and high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs). Both offer higher variable interest rates than standard savings, but MMAs typically include debit card and check access, often with higher minimum balances or tiered APYs. HYSAs generally have lower entry barriers and are ideal for emergency funds or short-term goals, while MMAs suit larger nest eggs needing occasional access. The choice depends on individual needs, accessibility, and fee considerations, though both are FDIC-insured and provide a secure way to save. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As year-end approaches, retirees aged 73 and older face required minimum distributions (RMDs) from pretax retirement accounts. For those with ample income, options exist to manage these withdrawals effectively. Strategies include reinvesting RMDs into brokerage accounts, preferably with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for tax efficiency and easier tax-loss harvesting. Charitable investors can utilize qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) to satisfy RMDs tax-free, benefiting non-profits. Additionally, RMDs can fund 529 college savings plans for family, potentially offering state tax credits and supporting legacy planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chad's former Prime Minister, Succes Masra, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison on charges including illegal possession of ammunition and incitement of violence, which he denies. Critics view this conviction as a deliberate move by President Mahamat Idriss Deby to silence opposition and tighten his grip on power ahead of the next electoral cycle. Human rights groups warn the ruling could reignite unrest similar to previous protests, as it undermines hopes for a meaningful political opposition and independent judiciary.

Hospitals, acting as "insurers of last resort," would bear increased uncompensated care costs, potentially pushing many rural hospitals into financial distress.

He has pleaded not guilty to 24 felony and misdemeanor counts after being extradited from Georgia. Detectives are seeking additional victims, as Pinkerton worked as a traveling evangelist across multiple states and internationally. This article notes that the Assemblies of God, his former denomination, stated he was never formally credentialed as a minister.</p>

This delisting marks a significant milestone in China's ongoing property crisis, ending Evergrande's 16-year trading history in Hong Kong. This article notes that the company amassed over $300 billion in liabilities and defaulted on offshore bonds in late 2021, sparking global concerns about contagion from the housing downturn.</p>

          <p>Eastman Kodak Co., the more than 130-year-old photography company, has cautioned that there is "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue as a going concern. The company cited difficulties in meeting upcoming debt obligations due within 12 months, lacking committed financing or sufficient liquidity, with only $155 million in cash as of June 30. Kodak is nearing completion of a manufacturing plant to create regulated pharmaceutical products, a key part of its reinvention efforts after its 2012 bankruptcy. This article highlights that the warning signals ongoing financial struggles for the iconic brand, which previously shifted its focus to commercial and packaging printing.</p>

          <p>A US-brokered peace declaration between Armenia and Azerbaijan, including a "Trump Route" transit corridor, has elicited mixed reactions in Iran. While President Pezeshkian welcomed peace, Supreme Leader's advisor Ali Akbar Velayati vowed to block the corridor, viewing it as a threat to Iranian interests and a sign of growing US influence. Analysts suggest the route reinforces Iran's geopolitical isolation and reflects a broader strategic competition between Russia and the West in the South Caucasus. This article notes that Iran, facing multiple domestic and international crises, is urged to rethink its foreign policy and potentially accept US regional presence.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7% annually in July, slightly below economists' forecasts of 2.8%, while the monthly increase was 0.2%. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, increased 3.1% over the past year, marking its highest level in five months. While food prices rose 2.7% annually, gasoline prices dropped 9.5%. Experts note some tariff pass-through to consumer prices, but it's not yet alarming, though economists debate whether tariff-induced price increases will be temporary or lasting.

          <p>As Presidents Trump and Putin prepare for a summit in Alaska, foreign-policy experts warn Trump could be walking into a trap. Putin, facing military and economic setbacks, seeks to buy time and has shown no sign of compromising on his maximalist demands for Ukraine. Observers fear Trump, desperate for a peace deal and a Nobel Peace Prize, might agree to terms unfavorable to Ukraine, potentially making Kyiv the "bad guy" if they reject it. Despite White House dismissals, concerns persist that Putin aims to re-establish influence over Trump, potentially with disastrous consequences for Ukraine's ability to continue fighting.</p>

Musk claims Apple makes it impossible for any AI company other than OpenAI to reach the top spot, an "unequivocal antitrust violation." This follows Apple's integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT into its products, which Musk previously called an "unacceptable security violation." Musk's xAI recently released Grok 4, while OpenAI launched GPT-5.

          <p>The Quad alliance, aimed at countering China in the Indo-Pacific, faces potential unraveling as President Trump strains relations with key partners India and Japan. Trump's imposition of 25% "reciprocal tariffs" on India and threats of additional secondary sanctions over Russian oil imports have plunged US-India ties to their lowest point in decades. This move, seemingly driven by domestic political posturing, has surprised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who previously navigated relations with Trump effectively.
