          <p>China's manufacturing activity contracted for the third straight month in June, with the official purchasing managers' index (PMI) at 49.7, just below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. Despite this, some sub-indexes for production and new orders showed slight improvement, offering a mixed signal for the industrial sector. The country continues to face challenges from a domestic price war, weak consumer demand, and the impact of U.S. tariffs on its exports. These economic pressures persist amid ongoing deflationary concerns, with both consumer and producer prices indicating a worrying trend for the world's second-largest economy.

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its digital services tax just a day before the first payments were due, following a declaration by U.S. President Donald Trump that he was terminating all trade talks. The tax, which would have applied a 3% levy on large tech companies like Google and Amazon, was a point of major contention with the United States. Ottawa's reversal is aimed at restarting crucial trade negotiations, with officials stating the move will support progress toward a new economic and security relationship. The U.S. had strongly opposed the tax, particularly its retroactive application, calling it discriminatory against American firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thousands of protesters have blocked major roads in Belgrade and other Serbian cities, escalating a months-long anti-government movement. The demonstrations, which initially sparked after a deadly train station roof collapse blamed on corruption, are now calling for the release of arrested activists and demanding snap elections. The movement intensified after a massive rally in the capital, with demonstrators using fences and garbage containers to create blockades. President Aleksandar Vucic has rejected the demands for an early election, accusing "foreign powers" of fueling the protests and vowing not to yield to what he termed "terror."</p>

          <p>The UK-based punk-rap group Bob Vylan has generated significant outrage after leading anti-Israel chants during their performance at the Glastonbury Festival. The duo's singer shouted "Death to the IDF" and "Free Palestine," prompting condemnation from political figures, festival organizers, and leading to a police review of the incident. In response, Glastonbury organizers stated they were "appalled" by the statements, emphasizing that hate speech and incitement to violence have no place at the festival.

          <p>A deadly ambush in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, has left two people, believed to be firefighters, dead and another individual injured after they were shot at while responding to a brush fire. The incident triggered a large-scale manhunt on Canfield Mountain, a popular recreation area. Authorities later located a deceased male with a firearm nearby, believed to be the suspected gunman, and lifted a shelter-in-place order. Law enforcement officials are investigating whether the fire was deliberately set to lure first responders to the scene, in what Idaho's governor described as a "heinous direct assault on our brave firefighters."</p>

          <p>The jury has begun deliberations in the trial of Erin Patterson, an Australian woman accused of murdering three relatives and attempting to murder a fourth by serving them a meal containing toxic death cap mushrooms. The prosecution argues that Patterson knowingly poisoned her guests with a beef Wellington in July 2023 and subsequently lied to authorities. The defense maintains that the poisoning was a tragic accident and that Patterson panicked, leading to her inconsistent statements. The case, which has captivated the public, now rests with the jury, who must decide if this was a deliberate act or a fatal culinary mistake.</p>

          <p>An opinion article from the South China Morning Post argues that Russia's restrained reaction to the recent conflict between its ally Iran and Israel demonstrates Moscow's declining power on the world stage. The author posits that Russia's deep involvement in the war in Ukraine has drained its military and financial resources, limiting its ability to support its allies effectively. Instead of providing significant military or diplomatic backing to Tehran, Moscow adopted a neutral, mediating stance. This pattern of strategic neglect, the article suggests, reveals that Russia's credibility as a reliable international partner has been severely compromised by its neo-imperial ambitions.</p>

The bear was previously seen in the area on June 19 and is believed to be the same one that first appeared in a neighboring county. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) states that black bears are typically shy and will avoid humans. Officials are advising residents not to approach or feed the animal and to secure potential food sources like trash, bird feeders, and pet food to encourage it to move on naturally.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles become more common, passengers are increasingly reporting experiences of motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration of EVs, particularly the regenerative braking systems, can contribute to queasiness. Regenerative braking, which captures energy when slowing down, creates a low-frequency deceleration that can provoke symptoms like dizziness and tension in passengers. This issue presents a new challenge for automakers, who must now consider passenger comfort and health alongside the environmental and performance benefits as they refine EV technology for a broader market.</p>

In his retirement statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and compromise in Washington, noting that independent thinking is often scorned.

          <p>Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has stated that recent U.S. airstrikes inflicted "severe damage" but did not completely eliminate Iran's nuclear capabilities. Grossi cautioned that Iran retains the industrial and technological knowledge to restart its program if it chooses to do so. His assessment seems to temper claims from U.S. officials that Iran's facilities were "obliterated." The IAEA head emphasized the urgent need for his inspectors to regain access to the sites to verify what materials and equipment remain, stressing that military action alone cannot definitively solve the nuclear issue.</p>

          <p>Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams has been forced to withdraw from the remainder of the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia due to a significant hamstring injury. Williams, who was having a standout season, sustained the injury after scoring a try in the team's recent victory over Western Force. Head coach Andy Farrell described the injury as "worse than expected," confirming it would sideline the player for the medium to long term. Scotland's Ben White has been called up as a replacement, a move that underscores the physical toll of the demanding tour schedule on the elite players.</p>

          <p>The official UK COVID-19 inquiry has turned its focus to the pandemic's devastating impact on the social care sector, a phase long-awaited by bereaved families. The hearings will investigate key government decisions, such as the policy of discharging hospital patients into care homes without testing, which is blamed for seeding the virus among vulnerable residents. Nearly 46,000 care home residents in England and Wales died with Covid, and the inquiry will scrutinize issues like "do not resuscitate" orders and restrictive visiting policies. Care managers and families are seeking accountability and lessons to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has voiced concerns that the expanded Club World Cup could "destroy" his team's 2025-26 campaign due to the demanding schedule. While preparing for the tournament, Guardiola admitted he is trying not to think about the potential for player exhaustion to avoid anxiety. The new 32-team format, held in the United States, significantly alters the traditional pre-season and rest periods for participating clubs. Guardiola's comments echo those of other top managers who have criticized football's increasingly congested calendar, highlighting the tension between governing bodies and the well-being of players.</p>

Despite the official prohibition, justified by the government as necessary to protect "family structure and moral values," activists gathered with rainbow flags but were met with a strong police presence. While homosexuality is not a crime in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government has adopted increasingly hostile rhetoric.

The law has been used to silence dissent and has led to the arrest of numerous activists and politicians.

          <p>In a recent interview, U.S. President Donald Trump signaled he has no intention of rolling back significant tariffs imposed on automobiles imported from Japan. This stance comes despite strong opposition from Tokyo during now-stalled trade negotiations between the two countries. Trump stated that his administration is prepared to unilaterally issue letters to Japan and other trading partners soon, formally informing them of the tariff rates for their exports to the U.S. This hardline position suggests that the trade friction over auto tariffs, a key issue for the Japanese economy, is likely to continue without resolution.

          <p>China has officially lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was imposed in August 2023. The ban was a strong political response to Japan's decision to release treated radioactive wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant into the ocean. The move to end the embargo follows an agreement between the two nations in May to begin the process of resuming trade. While the ban is lifted, it may still take several months for actual shipments to commence as procedural steps need to be completed by both sides, marking a significant de-escalation in the trade dispute.</p>
