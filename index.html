          <p>The Minnesota Timberwolves have initiated an investigation following accusations that fans made racially charged comments toward Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green during a playoff game. According to a team statement, one fan was ejected from the game, and another left voluntarily before being identified; the team is working to identify the second individual and determine further action. Green himself commented after the game that he felt there was an agenda to portray him as an angry Black man, which he refuted. The Timberwolves organization emphasized its commitment to fostering an inclusive and respectful environment and stated that racist behavior would not be tolerated.</p>

These talks represent the first known in-person contact between the two largest economies since the implementation of tariffs earlier this year.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is facing the potential of being labeled "Too Late" by President Trump, as the Fed navigates a complex economic landscape with threats to both growth and inflation. Despite Trump's calls for rate cuts, Powell has maintained a steady course, citing a "solid" economy and a labor market consistent with maximum employment. However, concerns persist about the impact of Trump's tariffs and potential economic slowdown, leaving Powell in a challenging position where any action could be seen as a mistake. History suggests that the Fed often acts too slowly, and Powell may risk repeating past errors.</p>

The leaders are seeking Moscow to agree to a truce and begin peace talks to end the conflict, building on a "constructive" call with U.S. President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. This push comes as Russia continues attacks along the front line, despite declaring a unilateral ceasefire. European allies view the conflict as fundamental to the continent's security and are seeking ways to support Kyiv militarily.</p>

          <p>The author argues that declining birth rates are becoming increasingly politicized, hindering productive discussions about the issue. Falling rates of family formation pose economic and social challenges, including a smaller working population supporting a larger elderly population. Richer societies are better positioned to combat climate change, and while we have been headed in the right direction, with rich countriesâ€™ per capita emissions falling rapidly over the last decade, that progress would be likely to reverse in a fiscally overburdened, rapidly shrinking society. The author urges progressives to engage in the conversation and support policies that empower people to have children if they choose, such as affordable housing, universal pre-K, and better healthcare.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses how the rise of part-time work and just-in-time scheduling has created a new form of exploitation for low-wage workers in America. Instead of overworking employees, large corporations are increasingly hiring multiple part-time staff, leaving workers with inconsistent schedules and insufficient hours to make a decent living. The author argues that Congress should address this issue by requiring large employers to set schedules in advance or by incentivizing the hiring of full-time workers. The dismantling of "9 to 5" has gone largely unnoticed, except among low-wage workers themselves, who unfortunately tend to lack access to the levers of power.</p>
