        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alpine has decided to replace Jack Doohan with Franco Colapinto for the next five races following a review of the season's opening races, with Briatore assuming Oakes' responsibilities. The team aims to fairly assess drivers for the 2026 season, deeming a line-up rotation necessary given the closely matched field and improved car performance. Doohan remains an integral part of the team as the first-choice reserve driver, while Colapinto is eager to deliver the best possible results alongside Pierre, acknowledging the intensity of the upcoming races. This decision follows the resignation of team principal Oliver Oakes, with Flavio Briatore stepping in to take over his responsibilities.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk reported strong first-quarter profits but lowered its full-year sales growth forecast due to competition from copycat drug compounders affecting Wegovy sales.

This redrawing of alliances injects superpower politics into the South Asian conflict, raising concerns about regional stability. The United States has cultivated India as a partner against China, while Beijing has deepened its investment in Pakistan. The changing dynamics reflect the complex and messy nature of alliances in the post-World War II global order, compounded by South Asia’s history of frequent military confrontations.</p>

Trump, who recently announced tariffs on films produced outside the U.S., accused Newsom of causing the industry to "abandon" the country due to incompetence. He also criticized California's high-speed rail project and brought up the wildfires. Trump did say that he always liked Newsom, and that he would be meeting with some film industry executives to ensure they're happy with the prospective tariffs.</p>
