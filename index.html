          <p>Top House Democrats are urging Speaker Mike Johnson to enhance security for House members, both in Washington and their districts, following the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses. They are requesting a substantial increase in the Member Representational Allowance (MRA) to support additional safety measures for every office. Senators are scheduled to receive a security briefing from law enforcement, and House Democrats will have a virtual briefing. The request comes after a suspect, Vance Boelter, allegedly targeted multiple lawmakers, leading to increased security concerns and postponed events. The number of threats against members of Congress has risen in the past two years, particularly during election years. </p>

          <p>Following the fatal shootings of Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota, Republicans have offered mixed responses, ranging from condemnation to mockery and promotion of conspiracy theories. While some GOP members, like House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, have unequivocally condemned the violence, others, including Trump and right-wing figures on social media, have used the tragedy to criticize Democrats. Experts warn that these divisive messages may resonate more widely than carefully crafted statements. The University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats suggests that joint statements from both parties are needed to combat the era of "violent populism."</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley is cautioning Senate Republicans against cutting Medicaid benefits in President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," aligning himself with Trump's stance on healthcare. Hawley argues that Republicans should adhere to Trump's promise to avoid Medicaid benefit cuts and prevent rural hospital closures. While Hawley supports stricter work requirements and measures against fraud in Medicaid, he emphasizes the importance of healthcare access for working Missourians who rely on Medicaid and CHIP. He believes it is wrong to take away healthcare access from people who are working hard but cannot afford private insurance.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's Club World Cup campaign began with a game played to a stadium with many empty seats, raising questions about the tournament's appeal to fans. Analysts suggest that the Monday afternoon kickoff time, high ticket prices, and lack of marketing contributed to the low attendance. There is concern that this apathy could extend to the upcoming World Cup in 2026, with calls for realistic ticket pricing and better marketing strategies. FIFA's latest project is in its infancy, but this was a very bad look so early in the tournament that it has set so much store by.</p>

          <p>President Trump attended the G7 summit in Canada amid ongoing trade tensions and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Trump stated that Iran would "like to talk" but needs to make a deal regarding its nuclear ambitions. He also mentioned Putin's ouster from the group and said Putin speaks to him. The summit takes place as tensions between Israel and Iran escalate, with Trump not planning to sign a G7 statement on Iran. Trump's attitude toward U.S. allies and tariffs have created uneasy relationships, with his musings about acquiring Canada and Greenland also straining relations with Canada.</p>

          <p>A report by Lazard indicates that renewable power sources like solar and onshore wind are the least expensive and quickest to deploy in the United States, even without government subsidies. The cost to build new gas-fired power plants has reached a 10-year high due to record electricity use and equipment backlogs. This is significant as U.S. electricity demand increases, raising questions about the sources that will meet this growing need. Different power-producing sources have varying implications for the reliability of the electric grid and for climate change. (not investment advice)</p>
