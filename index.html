          <p>Kyiv is experiencing a severe aerial assault with reports of numerous drones and missiles targeting the city, causing frequent explosions. Authorities have reported at least two injuries as dozens of drones were allegedly launched towards the Ukrainian capital, with some successfully reaching their targets and igniting fires. This attack follows a previous strike where Russian forces targeted various regions in Ukraine with over 470 attack drones, marking one of the largest overnight aerial assaults of the war. Russia and Ukraine recently conducted the first stage of a prisoner swap following an agreement reached during peace talks in Istanbul, providing a glimmer of diplomatic progress amidst the ongoing conflict. The continuous attacks and diplomatic efforts highlight the complex and volatile situation in the region.</p>

          <p>More than 300 Foreign Office staff who raised concerns about the UK's potential complicity in Israel's actions in Gaza were advised to consider resigning if they profoundly disagreed with government policy. The staff had questioned continued arms sales and what they saw as a disregard for international law by Israel. Senior civil servants responded that resignation was an "honourable course" for those with deep disagreements, sparking outrage among the signatories. The officials' letter reflected concerns about civilian deaths, aid restrictions, and settlement expansion, with staff feeling their warnings were ignored.

          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund indicates a global decline in fertility rates, with many people unable to have their desired number of children due to financial constraints and lack of suitable partners. The UNFPA surveyed 14,000 individuals across 14 countries, finding that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their ideal number of children. Financial limitations were cited by 39% of respondents as a primary barrier, with the highest response in South Korea and the lowest in Sweden. This report marks the UN agency's strongest statement yet on the issue of declining fertility rates, emphasizing the crisis of individuals being unable to create the families they want.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed Â£14.2bn to the Sizewell C nuclear plant project, aiming to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the decision as a catalyst for economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband emphasized the investment's importance for clean energy. However, critics argue the government is understating the project's cost and that the funds could be better spent elsewhere. The investment is part of a series of announcements ahead of the government's Spending Review, with Sizewell C expected to take at least a decade to complete. The funding decision underscores the government's commitment to nuclear power as a key component of its energy strategy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data from the CDC reveals a significant reduction in drug overdose deaths among young Americans, particularly those in Gen Z. Fatal overdoses among people under 35 dropped from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 in 2024. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less potent fentanyl on the streets, increased access to addiction healthcare, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens and young adults. While the trend is promising, challenges remain for individuals struggling with severe addiction, and concerns persist about potential funding cuts for addiction services. The reduction in fatalities represents a positive shift in the fight against the fentanyl crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

The jury, composed of seven women and five men, has faced internal tensions, with discussions stretching into their fourth day.

          <p>Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei stated that while the company's Ascend chips lag behind US chips by a generation, state-of-the-art performance can still be achieved through tactics like "stacking and clustering." He highlighted China's advantages in developing AI, including a large youth population, sufficient electricity, and a developed information network. Ren's comments come as the US ramps up restrictions on China and Huawei, with new guidance suggesting that the use of Ascend chips could violate American export controls. The interview underscores the ongoing tech war between the US and China and Huawei's efforts to overcome sanctions.</p>
