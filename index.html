          <p>Consumer goods giant Nestle has announced plans to cut 16,000 jobs as part of an accelerated cost-saving program under its new CEO, Philipp Navratil. The move, intended to improve operational efficiency, involves slashing 12,000 white-collar positions and 4,000 other roles over two years. Following the announcement, Nestle's shares surged nearly 9%, boosting the European food and beverage sector, as the company also reported better-than-expected organic growth in its third quarter despite challenges in its Greater China business.

This development comes amid a fragile US-backed ceasefire, during which Hamas has returned the remains of two Israeli hostages, Inbar Hayman and Mohammad al-Atrash. Meanwhile, Israel has urged Germany to lift its partial freeze on arms exports, which was imposed during the conflict, as diplomatic efforts for postwar stability continue.</p>

          <p>Following a historic ceasefire agreement, tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians and nearly 2,000 released prisoners are returning to Gaza, only to find their neighborhoods destroyed by two years of war. Many, like former prisoner Abdullah Farhan, describe mixed feelings of joy at their freedom but sadness at the dire living conditions, with many families now residing in tents. The UN estimates that 83% of structures in Gaza City are damaged and that reconstruction will cost around $70 billion, highlighting the immense humanitarian challenge ahead.</p>

          <p>During a recent trip to the Middle East, President Donald Trump made an unexpected diplomatic overture to Iran, suggesting a peace deal could be possible if the nation ceased funding militant groups and recognized Israel. The proposal was met with a cold reception in both Tehran, where officials cited recent U.S. aggression, and Jerusalem, where decades of enmity persist. Analysts believe the gambit is unlikely to succeed, with Iran's hardline leadership viewing the U.S. as untrustworthy, potentially leading to a re-escalation of military hostilities rather than peace.</p>

          <p>The proposal to make city buses free, championed by New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, has sparked a debate among transit advocates. Supporters argue that eliminating fares would increase ridership, improve equity, and speed up service by allowing all-door boarding. However, critics suggest that the funds would be better spent on improving service frequency and reliability, which they believe are bigger drivers of ridership than cost. The mixed results from cities like Kansas City, which is reinstating fares after struggling with funding, highlight the financial and logistical challenges of such a policy.</p>

While private insurers see a surge in demand, consumer advocates express concern about their accountability and the potential for "cherry-picking" less risky properties, which could further destabilize the already indebted NFIP.

          <p>The third episode of the reality show 'The Celebrity Traitors' featured a moment of unexpected humor when veteran actress Celia Imrie audibly farted during a tense moment, which she promptly admitted to. The incident, which caused host Claudia Winkleman and the other contestants to break into laughter, quickly became a talking point among viewers online, with many calling it a TV highlight. The episode also saw the elimination of YouTube star Niko Omilana, whose departure as a "faithful" sparked some backlash from fans who felt he was unfairly targeted.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has unveiled an ambitious action plan to double its electric vehicle (EV) charging capacity by 2027, aiming to support a network of over 80 million EVs. The plan, released by the National Development and Reform Commission, includes adding 1.6 million new fast chargers in urban areas and upgrading older infrastructure. This major expansion is designed to address issues like uneven network layout and insufficient services, further bolstering the country's rapidly growing new-energy vehicle market, which already accounts for nearly 58% of domestic passenger car sales.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK government-backed scheme to install external wall insulation has resulted in major problems for thousands of households, including damp, mould, and the need for major repairs. A National Audit Office report found that the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) scheme suffered from poor oversight, leading to widespread faulty installations. Critics argue that older UK housing is often unsuitable for such retrofits and that the scheme favored large, distant contractors over local tradespeople, leaving homeowners with inadequate work and limited recourse when problems arose.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientific research indicates that women may require more sleep than men, a need influenced by both biological and social factors. Studies show women sleep slightly longer on average and may need up to 20 extra minutes to support complex brain functions, with sleep quality fluctuating with the menstrual cycle. Beyond biology, societal demands and the burden of domestic labor contribute to a greater "sleep debt" for many women, impacting their mental and physical health. Experts note that women's bodies appear to have a biological resilience, but they also report insomnia at twice the rate of men.</p>

          <p>The implosion of the Titan submersible in June 2023 was due to an "inadequate" engineering process and a failure to conduct proper testing, according to an official report from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The investigation found that OceanGate, the operator, did not know the vessel's actual strength and was unaware it was damaged before its final, fatal voyage to the Titanic wreck. The report also highlighted a poor safety culture at the company, where concerns about the submersible's design were reportedly ignored.</p>

Bolstered by the AI boom, TSMC raised its full-year revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range and increased its budget for capacity expansion, signaling strong confidence in future growth.

          <p>A new study has found that Australia's tropical rainforests have become a net source of carbon, releasing more than they absorb, a first for any rainforest in the world. Researchers link this alarming trend to climate change, with rising extreme temperatures and more severe cyclones causing higher rates of tree death. This shift from a "carbon sink" to a carbon source has significant implications for global climate models, which may be overestimating the capacity of forests to offset fossil fuel emissions, serving as a "canary in the coal mine" for other tropical forests.</p>
