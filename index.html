          <p>The Israeli military has initiated a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in parts of Gaza to allow humanitarian aid to reach starving populations. This move comes amid mounting international pressure and warnings of famine, with aid agencies and nations like France welcoming the step while emphasizing the need for a full ceasefire. Despite the pause, Israel's broader offensive against Hamas continues in other areas, and Hamas has dismissed the measure as an attempt by Israel to improve its international image. The United Nations reports it has sufficient food supplies for Gaza's population but requires secure access to distribute them effectively.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have struck a framework deal on trade, establishing a 15% US tariff on many European goods and averting a threatened 30% rate. While the Trump administration hails it as a significant victory, the EU views it as a compromise that provides stability, despite the rate being higher than historical levels. The agreement also includes commitments for the EU to purchase billions in US energy and military equipment. This deal removes significant economic uncertainty for both sides, which depend heavily on their massive bilateral trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Top medical groups, including the American Medical Association, are raising alarms over reports that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may dismiss the members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). This independent panel of experts provides trusted, evidence-based guidelines for primary care, from cancer screenings to managing chronic diseases, which also influence insurance coverage under the ACA. The concern follows Kennedy's recent dismissal of a CDC vaccine advisory committee, leading to fears that a similar move could politicize the USPSTF and erode trust in its crucial recommendations.</p>
