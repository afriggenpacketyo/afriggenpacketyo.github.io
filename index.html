          <p>President Trump praised the agreement between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel at a rally in Pennsylvania, stating it would keep U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh and create American jobs. Trump announced plans to double tariffs on steel imports to 50% and claimed Nippon would invest $14 billion, including funds to increase steel production and modernize mills across several states. While emphasizing that U.S. Steel headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh and promising a $5,000 bonus for workers, Trump admitted he hadn't seen the final details of the deal, despite having previously opposed the sale to Nippon Steel. (not investment advice) The current administration had previously blocked the sale over national security concerns. Optimism for the deal is moderate, hinging on the final details and actual implementation.</p>

          <p>Federal agents arrested 36 Chinese and Taiwanese citizens suspected of being illegally present in the U.S. during a raid on an underground nightclub in Southern California. The operation involved Homeland Security officers, ICE agents, and members of the El Camino Real Financial Crimes Task Force. The raid comes as ICE increases enforcement under President Trump's orders, following the arrest of 12 Mexican citizens who traveled by boat from Mexico to Long Beach earlier in the week. The authorities have not disclosed the exact location of the nightclub or further details about the investigation, but the El Camino Real Financial Crimes Task Force's involvement suggests a focus on financial aspects of the operation.</p>

The administration had sought an emergency stay of an injunction issued by U.S. Judge Susan Illston in a lawsuit brought by labor unions and cities.

          <p>China has completed its first overseas new-generation radio telescope in northern Thailand, bolstering a global scientific network that monitors deep space signals and tracks shifts in Earth's rotation and tectonic plates. The 13-metre radio antenna, jointly developed by the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand, was inaugurated in Chiang Mai. Together with a second telescope under construction in southern Thailand, the station will enhance deep-space tracking and high-precision Earth monitoring, contributing to more accurate GPS, climate research, and earthquake forecasting. The project underscores the growing scientific partnership between China and Thailand.</p>

The review will recommend deploying new "digital" experts alongside troops to protect them from enemy drones and control the army's unmanned weapons. The Ministry of Defence will spend over £1bn to develop technology to speed up decisions on the battlefield. New defense funding will be partially sourced by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income.</p>

The warning comes as the average price of rice at supermarkets has risen steadily due to a poor harvest, hitting a record 4,285 yen per 5 kg in mid-May.
