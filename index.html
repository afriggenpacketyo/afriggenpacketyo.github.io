          <p>Analysts suggest that China's ongoing anti-corruption campaign targeting high-ranking officials in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) should not be interpreted as a sign of weak control by President Xi Jinping. The campaign's impact on the military's war readiness is considered limited, and internal competition among Xi's supporters may be a contributing factor. The article highlights recent investigations and expulsions of high-ranking military officials, including members of the Central Military Commission (CMC). Optimism score: 60</p>
