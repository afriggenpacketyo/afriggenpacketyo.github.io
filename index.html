          <p>Homebuilder sentiment dropped in June, nearing pandemic lows, due to higher mortgage rates and economic uncertainty impacting consumers. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index fell to 32, with all three components of the index showing declines. As a result, builders are increasingly cutting prices to address affordability concerns and entice hesitant buyers, with 37% reporting price cuts in June. Given current market conditions, the NAHB forecasts a decline in single-family starts for 2025 (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump displayed a trade agreement with the United Kingdom during a meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the G7 Summit. Trump accidentally dropped the document, blaming the wind, and initially misidentified it as an agreement with the European Union. The White House later clarified that the agreement was indeed with the UK and that the Commerce Secretary will determine quotas for steel and aluminum products entering the U.S. without tariffs. Trump also complimented Starmer's performance as Prime Minister.</p>

The letter was sent from the resupply ship Wimpey Sea Hunter, and park officials are attempting to locate any surviving crew members. Similar discoveries are not uncommon, with one message dating back to the 1930s, while park officials have also found appliances and waste washing ashore.</p>

          <p>Dame Louise Casey has advocated for a national inquiry into grooming gangs to serve as a moment for a "national reset" on the issue. Her report highlighted that the ethnicity of people involved in grooming gangs had been "shied away from" by authorities. She urged people to "keep calm" on the subject of ethnicity, pointing out that data on child sexual exploitation shows disproportionately Asian heritage suspects and offenders. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has pledged to implement all 12 of Casey's recommendations, including ensuring adults who engage in penetrative sexual assault with a child under 16 face the most serious charge.</p>

Factors such as gender, interest rates, annuity structure, and optional riders can affect the monthly income.

          <p>Shanghai-based AI start-up MiniMax has launched its first reasoning model, MiniMax-M1, claiming it requires half the computing resources of rival DeepSeekâ€™s models for some tasks. The company said that the new model matched the performance of leading global models from Google Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Amazon.com-backed Anthropic in maths, coding and domain knowledge. The model is built on the 456-billion-parameter MiniMax-Text-01 foundational model and employs a hybrid mixture-of-experts architecture.</p>

Excluding autos, sales fell by 0.3%, while building materials and gasoline stations experienced significant declines. However, online sales and furniture stores saw gains, reflecting a mixed picture of consumer behavior (not investment advice).</p>
