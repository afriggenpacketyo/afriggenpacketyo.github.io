          <p>A new Netflix documentary, "Trainwreck: Poop Cruise," examines the harrowing 2013 incident where the Carnival Triumph cruise ship lost power at sea. The film features passenger interviews detailing chaotic and unsanitary conditions, including overflowing toilets, which led to the notorious nickname. Carnival Cruise Line responded to the documentary, stating the event was a crucial learning moment that resulted in over $500 million in fleet-wide safety and system upgrades. The incident left over 4,000 people stranded for five days.</p>

          <p>Indirect ceasefire negotiations between Israeli and Hamas representatives are scheduled to restart in Doha, Qatar, as Israeli military operations continue across Gaza. The talks are centered on a U.S.-backed proposal for an initial 60-day truce involving a partial hostage release in exchange for increased humanitarian aid. However, significant disagreements persist, with Hamas demanding a permanent end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal, a condition Prime Minister Netanyahu has resisted. The ongoing violence, including deadly airstrikes, underscores the urgency of the diplomatic efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal was interrupted due to a failure in the new electronic line-calling system. At a critical moment in the first set, the system failed to make an "out" call on a long shot from Kartal, leading the umpire to halt and replay the point. A frustrated Pavlyuchenkova claimed the error "stole the game" from her, as Kartal went on to win the replayed point and the game. The All England Club attributed the malfunction to operator error, amid growing scrutiny from players over the system's accuracy.</p>

          <p>Military experts writing in the PLA Daily have advocated for significant structural reforms within the Chinese military to effectively counter the growing threat of unmanned aerial vehicles. The analysis suggests that recent conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, have highlighted the critical role of drones in modern warfare. The experts propose the eventual establishment of specialized counter-drone units and the immediate integration of anti-drone capabilities into existing forces. This includes upgrading electronic warfare units to handle AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming to neutralize unmanned threats.</p>

Passengers reported that both engines failed shortly after passing Calais, leading to uncomfortable conditions and non-functional toilets. Emergency services eventually arrived to distribute water and assist with the evacuation. Eurostar acknowledged the delay, which was caused by an electrical failure, and arranged for a replacement train to collect the stranded travelers.</p>

He emphasized that PBS provides crucial services beyond entertainment, including children's programming, educational content, and homeland security information.

          <p>An article explores the history of the Statue of Liberty, revealing its original purpose was unrelated to immigration. Initially conceived in 1865 as a tribute to the end of slavery in the U.S., the statue's meaning was transformed by Emma Lazarus's 1883 poem "The New Colossus." The poem reimagined Lady Liberty as a "mother of exiles," a vision that gained prominence with the opening of Ellis Island and the eventual end of restrictive ethnic immigration quotas in 1965. This shift cemented the statue's modern identity as a powerful symbol of welcome for immigrants arriving in America.</p>

          <p>Texas has enacted a new law that establishes a framework for using gold and silver as legal tender in everyday financial transactions. The legislation allows Texans to use precious metals stored in the state's Bullion Depository via debit cards and mobile apps. Supporters argue the move provides protection against inflation and aligns with constitutional principles, while critics raise concerns about potential conflicts with federal currency laws. The system, which converts precious metal holdings to U.S. dollars at the point of sale, is scheduled to be fully operational by May 2027. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Turkey Expands Political and Cultural Influence in the Western Balkans</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Turkey is significantly increasing its influence in the Western Balkans through a combination of "soft power" and strategic investments, a practice some experts call "infrastructure imperialism." A key example is the recently inaugurated Namazgah mosque in Tirana, Albania, which was largely funded by Turkey's religious authority. Beyond religious projects, Turkish investors are heavily involved in major infrastructure developments across the region, from railways to hotels. This strategy is seen as part of President Erdogan's effort to position Turkey as a regional power and heir to the Ottoman Empire's legacy.</p>

The city council condemned the "treacherous, despicable, and cowardly attack." Guanajuato is known as Mexico's deadliest state due to violent turf wars between rival drug cartels, including the Jalisco New Generation cartel and the Santa Rosa de Lima gang, which are responsible for thousands of murders annually.</p>

          <p>The head of London's Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, has proposed that football clubs should contribute to the £70 million annual cost of policing their matches in the UK. Arguing for a "polluter pays approach," the commissioner questioned why event organizers who require a police presence do not pay for the service, which diverts resources from local communities. The suggestion comes amid calls from Sir Mark for a radical reform of UK policing, including consolidating the current 43 forces into a smaller number of larger ones to better manage overstretched funding.</p>

          <p>An article analyzes the debate around Bitcoin's low adoption rate, questioning its utility as a currency when only a small fraction of the population holds it. The discussion highlights a split between those who see Bitcoin as "peer-to-peer electronic cash" and those who view it as "digital gold," a store of value. Proponents argue that, like gold, widespread ownership isn't necessary for it to maintain value as a hedge against inflation. However, critics contend it's a speculative asset whose value depends on the "greater fool theory" rather than any intrinsic utility. (not investment advice)</p>

According to a private security firm, the ship was struck by projectiles and possibly by bomb-carrying drone boats, marking a potential escalation in regional maritime threats. While there was no immediate claim of responsibility, suspicion has fallen on the Houthis, who have previously targeted shipping in the vital trade corridor.</p>

The farmer was hospitalized with wounds to his head, shoulder, and legs. The lion was later located in a wooded area and killed, and an investigation into its escape has been launched.</p>

          <p>Russia has officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, becoming the first country to do so since the group returned to power in 2021. The Taliban's foreign minister welcomed the move as the start of a "new phase of positive relations." Experts suggest Russia's decision is driven by economic interests, including positioning Afghanistan as a trade hub, and a desire to lead a coalition of authoritarian states in establishing new diplomatic norms. The recognition has sparked concern among human rights activists, who fear it normalizes the Taliban's repressive policies, particularly against women.</p>

          <p>This analysis suggests that in his first six months, President Trump has taken numerous executive actions that expand presidential authority and weaken traditional checks and balances. These actions include ordering a military strike on Iran without congressional approval, using national emergency declarations to impose tariffs, and taking control of a state's National Guard against the governor's wishes. Critics warn that these moves, combined with a compliant Congress and attacks on the judiciary, are eroding democratic norms.

          <p>A report from the research services of the German parliament, the Bundestag, has cast "substantial doubt" on the legal justification for recent Israeli and U.S. military strikes on Iran. The analysis, requested by a Left Party lawmaker, states that most international law experts believe the criteria for self-defense under the UN Charter were not met. The report argues that for the strikes to be justified, Israel would need to prove an imminent plan by Iran to use a nuclear weapon against it. The findings contrast with the German government's outspoken support for the military action.</p>
