          <p>Resident doctors in England are set to strike for five consecutive days in July after voting in favor of further industrial action over pay. The British Medical Association (BMA) states the government has refused to negotiate on restoring pay levels, which they claim are 20% lower in real terms than in 2008. The Health Secretary has called the move unreasonable, highlighting recent pay increases and warning of the dire impact on the NHS, which is already under significant strain.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a second meeting to discuss a potential ceasefire agreement in Gaza. The current proposal reportedly includes a 60-day pause in fighting, the release of some of the 50 remaining Israeli hostages, and a surge of humanitarian aid into the devastated territory. While negotiations continue in Qatar, the war's toll mounts, with ongoing Israeli strikes and a reported death toll in Gaza approaching 60,000, creating immense pressure for a resolution.</p>

It also discusses the influence of the Trump administration's policies on the region, arguing for regional solidarity and new development models to counter rising authoritarianism.</p>

The commentary highlights the president's long history of admiring the Russian leader, which critics have consistently warned was a naive and dangerous stance for a U.S. leader to take.</p>
