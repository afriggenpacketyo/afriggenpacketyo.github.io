          <p>A British woman has died following a white-water rafting accident on the Guisane river in the French Alps. The woman fell from her raft during an organized trip on a challenging section of the river and was later found on the riverbank. Despite being airlifted to a hospital in serious condition, she passed away. French authorities have opened an involuntary manslaughter investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding the tragic incident, and an autopsy is scheduled to be conducted.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly called for the Washington Commanders NFL team to immediately change its name back to the Washington Redskins. In a social media post, he also urged the Cleveland Guardians MLB team to return to its previous name, the Indians. Trump asserted that the changes, made five years ago due to the names being widely viewed as slurs against Native Americans, were a result of political correctness. He claimed that Native American communities largely support the original names, viewing them as a source of heritage and prestige.</p>

          <p>A protest in Epping, Essex, at a hotel housing asylum seekers escalated into disorder, with demonstrators throwing bottles and smoke flares at police vehicles. The unrest followed the recent arrest of an asylum seeker in connection with alleged sexual assaults in the town. Hundreds gathered for the protest, prompting Essex Police to implement a Section 60AA order, allowing them to require the removal of face coverings. Authorities have stated they will deal robustly with any criminal behavior while respecting the right to peaceful protest.</p>

          <p>According to Palestinian health officials, at least 94 Palestinians were killed by Israeli military fire on Sunday while attempting to access food aid. The deadliest incident occurred in northern Gaza, where dozens died trying to get flour from a UN convoy. The Israel Defense Forces stated its troops fired warning shots to address an immediate threat from a large crowd, and that their initial review does not align with the reported casualty numbers. The event marks one of the deadliest days for Gazans seeking aid amid severe food shortages and an expanding Israeli evacuation order in central Gaza.</p>

          <p>Coldplay frontman Chris Martin issued a friendly warning to his audience before the band's 'Jumbotron Song' segment, advising them to prepare in case they appeared on the big screens. This comes after a viral incident at a previous concert where a man and woman, later identified as a tech CEO and his HR chief, were caught in an intimate moment on camera, leading to the CEO's resignation. Martin's lighthearted comment to "do your makeup now" was a clear nod to the recent controversy, which has since become a source of internet memes and discussion.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign, despite exit polls projecting that his ruling coalition is set to lose its majority in the upper house of parliament. The election was held amid public frustration over rising prices and the threat of U.S. tariffs. A defeat would undermine the coalition's influence, as it already lost its majority in the more powerful lower house last year. Ishiba acknowledged the "harsh result" but said his focus remains on critical trade negotiations, even as the loss could trigger a leadership challenge within his party.</p>

          <p>A new peace declaration has been signed between the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the AFC/M23 rebellion, but experts remain skeptical about its implementation. The deal, mediated by Qatar, calls for a permanent ceasefire and direct negotiations for a comprehensive peace agreement to begin in August. However, disagreements emerged almost immediately, with the government claiming the rebels agreed to withdraw from occupied zones, a point the rebels quickly denied. Analysts question whether the political will exists for sustained peace, pointing to the failure of past agreements.</p>

The pledge comes as new data shows serious pollution incidents rose by 60% in 2024 to a record high.

His planned visit, which includes a stop in London, has drawn attention given his past rhetoric and the anti-Trump sentiment present in parts of the UK.</p>

          <p>Employment experts suspect that artificial intelligence is a larger factor in recent corporate layoffs than many companies are publicly admitting. While firms often cite reasons like restructuring or optimization, analysts believe these terms may disguise job cuts made possible by new AI technologies. Companies are likely being vague to avoid public and employee backlash against AI-driven job displacement. Experts note that roles in customer service, content creation, and HR are particularly vulnerable, and while AI cannot yet fully replace human judgment, the trend of automation-related workforce reshaping is expected to accelerate.
