          <p>A person from Yorkshire, UK, has died from rabies after being in contact with a stray dog while on holiday in Morocco. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has stated that there is no risk to the wider public, as there is no documented evidence of rabies passing between people. Close contacts of the individual and health workers are being assessed and offered vaccinations as a precautionary measure to prevent any potential spread. This tragic incident serves as a reminder of the importance of taking precautions when interacting with animals, especially in areas where rabies is prevalent. The event is relatively tragic and the tone of the article is neutral in reflection of the severity of the event.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned the U.S. of "irreparable damage" if it militarily strikes Iran amid escalating tensions with Israel. Khamenei stated that U.S. involvement would "100% backfire," causing greater harm to America than to Iran, and emphasized that Iranians would not surrender. These statements follow recent missile exchanges between Iran and Israel, with Israel targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, and the International Atomic Energy Agency confirming strikes on centrifuge production facilities. Tensions have been high since the October 2023 attack by Hamas, and the G7 has labeled Iran a "principal source of regional instability."</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing conflicts, including fighting in Gaza and strikes against Iran, Israel's economy has shown surprising resilience. The economy is strained by military spending and labor shortages, but the high-tech sector remains strong, contributing significantly to exports and GDP. The government has increased taxes to offset financial strain, and while sectors like tourism and manufacturing have suffered, high-tech, defense, and retail food industries are holding steady. Investors appear optimistic, anticipating a resolution to the conflicts, but long-term economic challenges include the security situation and internal social divides. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Smugglers are now using "taxi boats" to pick up migrants from the French coast, as French police struggle to manage a surge in Channel crossings. Instead of launching boats from beaches near police patrols, gangs are launching from hidden locations and picking up customers waiting in the sea. French police are hesitant to intervene at sea due to safety concerns, but new guidelines are expected to allow for more forceful intervention in shallow waters. The UK is seen as a magnet for migrants, and the French police are focusing on intercepting boats before they launch.</p>

          <p>British lawmakers voted to decriminalize abortion in England and Wales, approving an amendment to a crime bill that prevents women from facing criminal charges for ending a pregnancy. The amendment was introduced due to concerns that police have investigated over 100 women for suspected illegal abortions, including those who experienced miscarriages and stillbirths. Under the current law, doctors can legally perform abortions up to 24 weeks, but the change aims to remove vulnerable women from the criminal justice system. Anti-abortion groups opposed the measure, arguing it could lead to abortion on demand at any stage of pregnancy.</p>

          <p>Marty from Spokane, Washington, withdrew $400,000 from his 401(k) to buy a house, only to face a $140,000 tax bill he was unprepared for. He sought advice from The Ramsey Show, who recommended using his savings and taking out a personal loan to pay off the IRS quickly, rather than risking his home with a HELOC or credit card. The story serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding the tax implications of tapping into retirement accounts early. The co-hosts advised him to take a personal loan from a bank instead of the IRS, as owing a bank is a better situation to be in than owing the IRS. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysts are finding it difficult to predict how the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran will influence oil prices. The recent attacks on military and nuclear infrastructure have led to spiraling warfare, and the market is weighing the possibility of U.S. involvement and major supply disruptions. Some analysts suggest a risk premium is already factored into oil prices, while others warn of serious consequences for global supply and prices if critical energy infrastructure is further targeted.

This inability to share stories and build intimacy may contribute to the male loneliness epidemic, as gossip can be a valuable social tool for forging connections.

However, Trump is reportedly frustrated by Iran's inability to provide immediate answers and may opt for military action to avoid appearing weak.

          <p>With the U.S. imposing tariffs, businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower duties by altering materials or compositions to fit different harmonized system codes.
