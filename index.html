            <p>Rainess Holmes, a repeat offender, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and burglary charges related to the 2021 death of Rhodes College student Andrew Rainer during a home invasion. Holmes received a 20-year prison sentence, which he must serve in its entirety, plus nine years for separate burglary cases. While Holmes was one of four men involved in the crime, he was not the shooter, and authorities are still searching for the remaining suspects. The Shelby County District Attorney's Office worked closely with Rainer's family throughout the legal proceedings, and a memorial fund called "Live Like Drew" has been established in his honor.</p>

            <p>As Sino-European relations navigate calls for de-risking and decoupling, increased engagement is evident since the instigation of a global trade war by the US. Softening tones from European leaders towards China and increased diplomatic visits indicate a shift, while interest in China is growing across various sectors. This increased engagement suggests a contingency plan for Europe amidst an increasingly adversarial transatlantic relationship, with Hong Kong acting as a gateway between the world and mainland China. The impact of reciprocal tariffs initiated by the US is also considered, as political strategy appears to overshadow economic principles.</p>

            <p>Defensive miscues proved costly for the Dodgers, leading to their third loss in four games against the Washington Nationals. Errors by key players like Mookie Betts and Miguel Rojas resulted in unearned runs for the Nationals, while stellar defense from the opposing team prevented potential rallies by the Dodgers. Despite Shohei Ohtani's impressive performance, the Dodgers' struggles with fundamental plays and baserunning blunders continue to be a source of frustration in the early season. The team has committed seven errors in the last six games and yielded the most unearned runs in the majors.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can continue using the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime powers law, to carry out rapid deportations of alleged gang members. However, the court clarified that deportees must be given an opportunity to challenge their removal. The ruling specified that challenges must be raised in Texas, where the migrants are confined, and not in Washington DC. This decision vacates an earlier ruling that temporarily blocked the use of the law, but it emphasizes the importance of judicial review and the right to seek habeas relief.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced that the United States will engage in direct, high-level talks with Iran regarding its nuclear program, beginning Saturday. The meeting, which will be at "almost the highest level," aims to explore a potential deal, preferable to the "obvious" alternative. Trump offered few specifics but emphasized that a deal would be in Tehran's best interest. The announcement comes after Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and follows a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who stressed the shared goal of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.</p>

            <p>President Trump's implementation of "reciprocal" tariffs has created uncertainty in global markets as nations grapple with the potential economic consequences. While some countries seek to negotiate with the US to mitigate the impact, China has responded with retaliatory measures. The situation has sparked concerns about a trade war and its potential effects on the global economy. The tariffs are intended to restructure the global economy and America's place within it, but the long-term effects remain to be seen. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration may use a wartime law to deport alleged members of a foreign crime gang, but only if they are given the right to challenge the government’s claim. In a 5-4 vote, the court set aside the orders of judges in Washington who said the Trump administration had overstepped its power. The court majority said a group of alleged Venezuelan gang members facing deportation to El Salvador may appeal, but only before a federal judge in Texas, where they are held.</p>

            <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has temporarily halted a lower court order that mandated the Trump administration to return a Maryland man, mistakenly deported to El Salvador, to the U.S. The administrative stay allows the Supreme Court further time to deliberate the matter, with the Justice Department having requested intervention due to the court-ordered deadline. The dispute arose after the administration admitted the man's deportation was an "administrative error," sparking widespread attention and outrage.</p>

            <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is redeploying staff to address the measles outbreak in Texas, following recent layoffs at the agency. A team has been dispatched to assess the situation and collaborate with state and county officials, with more staff to follow. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. affirmed the CDC's redeployment in response to the governor's request. This action comes as the number of U.S. measles cases reaches the highest levels since 2019, raising concerns about the potential loss of America's status of having eliminated endemic spread of the virus.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume deportations of migrants claimed to be members of a Venezuelan gang, using a wartime authority. The court split 5-4 in granting a request for emergency relief sought by the Justice Department, but stated that detainees subject to the 1798 law "must receive notice" that they face removal. Dissenting justices criticized the majority's decision, with Justice Sotomayor accusing the Trump administration of largely ignoring "its obligations to the rule of law."</p>

            <p>Scientists at Colossal Biosciences have genetically engineered three wolf pups with characteristics resembling the extinct dire wolf, such as white hair and muscular jaws. The researchers used CRISPR technology to modify blood cells from a living gray wolf and transferred the genetic material to a dog egg cell. The pups, while physically similar to dire wolves, may lack the learned hunting skills of their extinct counterparts. Colossal has also cloned four red wolves to increase genetic diversity in the endangered species.</p>
