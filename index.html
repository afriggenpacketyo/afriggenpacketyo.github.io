          <p>A deadly shooting in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, resulted in the death of a woman and the suspect, with two state troopers being wounded in what authorities are calling an ambush. The suspect, armed with a rifle, first killed a 57-year-old woman before firing on the responding officers from a position of tactical superiority. An EMT was also injured in a crash while responding to the scene, and the suspect was ultimately killed by a Special Emergency Response Team after a standoff. This incident is part of a rising trend of ambush-style attacks on law enforcement across the U.S.</p>

          <p>Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson stated that a recent brazen escape of ten inmates from a New Orleans jail was the result of a "perfect storm" of critical failures. In an exclusive interview, she cited major design flaws in the ten-year-old facility, including broken locks, and a severe staffing shortage, with the jail operating at only 60% capacity. Hutson claims she had repeatedly warned the city about these issues and requested funds for necessary upgrades, which were ignored until after the incident. The investigation into the escape, which is believed to have been an inside job, is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Gareth Ward, an Australian politician recently found guilty of sexually assaulting two young men, has resigned from the New South Wales parliament. The resignation occurred just before a scheduled vote to expel him, following a failed legal challenge to remain in his position while he awaits sentencing. Ward, who had been a state government minister, left the Liberal Party in 2021 but was re-elected as an independent in 2023 despite the allegations. His resignation triggers a by-election for the seat he held since 2011, and he will no longer receive a parliamentary salary.</p>

          <p>Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson left his first preseason game of the year after sustaining an injury during a sack by a Baltimore Ravens player. The injury appeared to affect Richardson's finger, and he was seen jogging to the sideline before being replaced by backup quarterback Daniel Jones. Richardson had successfully led the Colts to a field goal on his opening drive before the incident occurred. The team had planned for Richardson to play for about one and a half quarters of the game, making the early exit a setback.</p>

          <p>For the first time on record, the Southern Small White butterfly, a species native to Southern Europe, has been sighted in the United Kingdom. A volunteer photographed the female butterfly at Landguard Nature Reserve in Suffolk, confirming its identity with experts. This species has been rapidly expanding its range northward through Europe over the past two decades, moving at an estimated rate of 100 kilometers per year. While a warming climate is considered a contributing factor, its expansion has been faster than models predicted, and its long-term establishment in the UK remains uncertain due to food source availability.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Signals Intent to Exclude Undocumented Immigrants from Census Count</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed the Department of Commerce to develop a census that excludes undocumented immigrants from its population count, a move that would have major implications for congressional representation and federal funding. The U.S. Constitution mandates a decennial count of all persons, which has historically been interpreted to include everyone regardless of citizenship status. While the Trump administration's previous attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census was blocked by the Supreme Court, this new directive seeks a more fundamental change to how the population is enumerated for apportionment purposes.</p>

          <p>A boil water order remains in effect for parts of Malibu due to unexpected delays during bridge construction work at Solstice Creek. The advisory was issued after a water main was disrupted, and concrete unexpectedly blocked the water line, prolonging the restoration of supply. Crews completed repairs and are now working to re-pressurize and test the water system for contaminants, a process expected to finish by Friday. In the meantime, officials are distributing bottled water to affected residents, who are advised to boil all tap water for at least one minute before consumption to prevent potential illness.</p>

In pre-trial hearings, which can now be reported, Simon Patterson detailed a suspected years-long campaign in which he became ill after eating food his wife prepared, including a curry and cookies. He stated he grew suspicious and began keeping notes, which is why he refused to attend the fatal lunch.

These foods, which are typically high in salt, sweeteners, and unhealthy fats while low in fiber, are consumed at even higher rates by young people, at 61.9% of their caloric intake. Common sources include sandwiches, sweet bakery products, savory snacks, and sweetened beverages.

          <p>Restaurant chain Texas Roadhouse reported mixed second-quarter financial results, with strong sales growth offset by declining profitability due to high beef prices. The company's revenue of $1.51 billion surpassed expectations, driven by a 5.8% increase in same-store sales and higher customer traffic. However, earnings per share fell short of analyst estimates as elevated beef costs squeezed margins, a headwind expected to worsen in the next quarter. In response, the company plans a modest menu price increase later this year to help offset some of the inflationary pressure from commodity prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to $50 million. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the new amount, accusing Maduro of being a major narco-trafficker who works with cartels to import drugs into the U.S. Maduro was first indicted on narco-terrorism charges in 2020 during Trump's first term, with an initial reward of $15 million. In response, Venezuela's foreign minister dismissed the increased reward as a "pathetic" and "crude political propaganda operation," calling it a desperate distraction.</p>

The fire, which started Thursday afternoon, quickly grew to over 1,000 acres, prompting mandatory evacuation orders for several areas, including the Lake Piru Recreation Area and Hasley Canyon. Authorities have also issued evacuation warnings for surrounding regions and implemented multiple road closures to ensure public safety.

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to lift a lower court's injunction that restricts the use of "roving patrols" by immigration enforcement agents in Southern California. A federal judge had banned the tactic, which involves armed agents apprehending individuals without establishing reasonable suspicion, finding it likely violates the 4th Amendment. The administration argues the ban irreparably harms its ability to enforce immigration laws in the nation's most populous federal district. Civil rights lawyers contend that lifting the ban would effectively authorize indiscriminate arrests based on factors like race and ethnicity.</p>

Holiday parks and campsites are also seeing an increase in spontaneous bookings, as families find it more convenient and budget-friendly to stay within the country.

This approach aligns with the NHS's 10-year plan to shift focus from hospital treatment to preventative community care.
