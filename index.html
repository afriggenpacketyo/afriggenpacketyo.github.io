            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, lasting until midnight Sunday. The ceasefire aims to halt fighting for humanitarian purposes, but Putin stated that Russian forces should be prepared for potential violations and provocations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded cautiously, stating that Ukraine would mirror the ceasefire if Russia genuinely observes it fully. Previous attempts at Easter ceasefires have failed, and skepticism remains about Russia's true intentions.</p>
