          <p>Two teenagers have been charged following an investigation by the National Crime Agency into a cyber attack on Transport for London, which occurred on August 31 of the previous year. The attack is believed to have been executed by members of the cyber-criminal group Scattered Spider. Thalha Jubair and Owen Flowers were arrested at their homes and are expected to appear in court. The charges include conspiring to commit unauthorized acts against TfL under the Computer Misuse Act. The NCA has previously warned of increasing threats from cyber criminal gangs, highlighting Scattered Spider as an example. The attack caused significant disruption and millions in losses to TfL, a part of the UK's critical national infrastructure. Optimism score is not mentioned in the article.</p>

          <h2>Liverpool's Habit of Late Goals Analyzed with Data</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data analysis reveals Liverpool's tendency to score late winning goals this season, contrasting with their performance in the previous season. The team, under Arne Slot, has scored late winners in all five of their competitive matches this season, with the average match-winning moment occurring after 91 minutes. Slot attributes this trend to self-belief and fitness, emphasizing the team's mentality to always push for a goal. While Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson were known for late winners, Liverpool's current rate surpasses even their record. Liverpool's wisest heads are making the difference in the key moments. Optimism score is not mentioned in the article.</p>

          <p>A large search is underway for two hunters, Andrew Porter and Ian Stasko, who were last seen in the Rio Grande National Forest near the New Mexico-Colorado border. The men were reported overdue after arriving in the area on September 11 and failing to check in with loved ones. Deputies found their vehicle with camping gear, but not the men themselves, prompting immediate search and rescue operations. Concerns about recent heavy rain and bad weather have intensified the search efforts, which involve local, county, and state resources, as well as volunteers from Texas. The search includes personnel on foot, horseback, and air assets like drones and a Black Hawk helicopter. Optimism score is not mentioned in the article.</p>

The $470 million agreement involves constructing a 26km electric railway line with eight stations, which aims to significantly reduce travel times for approximately 35 million passengers annually. Two Chinese teams are also bidding for a separate project to construct a 3.2km railway tunnel in the same system. This participation reflects China's increasing economic engagement in Latin America, a region historically supported by the United States. Optimism score is not mentioned in the article.</p>

          <p>Hedge fund billionaire David Tepper has cautioned that the Federal Reserve risks triggering inflation and asset bubbles if it cuts interest rates too aggressively.

He noted that valuations are currently high but said he wouldn't bet against stocks while the Fed is in easing mode. Tepper's comments come after the Fed lowered interest rates by a quarter point, signaling the possibility of two more reductions this year.

          <p>This article reviews the Jordan Peele-produced film "Him," which critiques American football through a psychological horror lens. The film follows Cameron Cade, a college quarterback, as he trains with a former football legend, Isaiah White, but the reviewer finds the film struggles with believability, particularly regarding the challenges faced by a quarterback prospect. While the film attempts to critique the conflation of white Christian values and American jingoism within football, it ultimately falls short. The reviewer praises the supporting cast but criticizes the film's distortion of reality and failure to deliver a cutting takedown of the sport. Optimism score is not mentioned in the article.</p>
