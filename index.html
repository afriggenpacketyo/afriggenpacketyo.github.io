        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym "Jane," provided potentially corroborating testimony in his federal sexual assault trial, alleging instances of abuse and coercion. Legal experts suggest Jane's account could bolster Cassie Ventura's claims if the jury finds their experiences similar, especially with the inclusion of voice memos. The testimony included details of alleged violent behavior, including a chokehold and physical assaults, and texts revealing Jane's feelings of manipulation and financial motivations. The defense may focus on emotional manipulation rather than violence, potentially weakening the prosecution's case, and the trial is expected to conclude by July 4. Optimism regarding the case is relatively low given the gravity of the allegations and the ongoing nature of the trial.</p>

          <p>Following immigration raids in Los Angeles, protests erupted, leading to a strong response from President Trump, who promised to quell opposition with military force, deploying National Guard troops and Marines. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized Trump's actions as authoritarian, accusing him of creating chaos and endangering democracy. Human rights lawyer Philippe Sands views Trump's response as a tactic to test the limits of public tolerance and create a sense of emergency. The deployment of troops without the governor's request is unprecedented since 1965, raising concerns about the erosion of democratic norms and the potential for authoritarianism in the US.</p>

          <p>Detectives in Derbyshire have discovered a clandestine operation manufacturing lethal "assassination kits" for organized crime groups. Ronald Knowles, 64, was arrested while attempting to destroy evidence in his garden, where he converted replica pistols and produced ammunition for numerous kits, complete with silencers and gloves. The kits were distributed by Gary Hardy, a known "drugs general" from Nottinghamshire. Police seized various weapons, including throwing stars and crossbows, along with nearly 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and Hardy, Knowles, and two others now face sentencing for serious firearms offenses.</p>

          <p>The City of Wolverhampton Council is considering compulsorily purchasing two more empty houses on Warstones Drive and Hadley Road to convert them into family homes. These properties have been vacant for several years, and the council's cabinet will review the potential purchases at an upcoming meeting. The council has already acquired and refurbished over 300 homes in the past five years, selling or renting them to generate funds for the scheme. Housing improvement officers initially work with owners to encourage them to renovate and reoccupy the properties before resorting to compulsory purchase.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States are planning a summit between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump in Canada during the Group of Seven (G7) leaders' meeting in mid-June. Prior to the summit, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is expected to visit Washington for further negotiations on the Trump tariffs. Japan is seeking the removal of U.S. tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, but is considering accepting reduced tariff rates due to the U.S.'s consistent refusal to eliminate them. Both countries aim to reach an agreement as soon as possible, focusing on boosting investment and creating jobs in the United States to reduce the trade deficit.</p>

          <p>Criminal gangs are exploiting a loophole in European law to smuggle ketamine, swapping it for legal goods like salt during transit, according to a BBC investigation. Ketamine, a regulated medicine in some countries like Austria and Germany, faces less scrutiny, allowing smugglers to divert it into illicit markets. The preferred route involves shipping from India through Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, before reaching the UK. This illegal activity has surged, with consumption in the UK rising by 85% between 2023 and 2024, leading to increased deaths and health concerns. European police forces are planning to collaborate with Indian authorities to address the issue.</p>

This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to approximately 100,000 tons.

          <p>President Trump has described Los Angeles as being under siege due to protests, while Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom paint a different picture, asserting that local law enforcement can manage the unrest. Trump deployed National Guard troops, claiming the city had been "invaded and occupied by illegal aliens and criminals," a move Newsom has condemned as inflammatory and illegal. The protests were sparked by immigration raids and have been concentrated in downtown Los Angeles, with some instances of violence and vandalism. Bass and Newsom have accused Trump of sensationalizing the situation and acting without their consent.</p>

          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an "unprecedented decline" in global fertility rates, indicating that millions are unable to have their desired number of children. The report cites the high cost of parenthood and lack of suitable partners as primary reasons. A survey of 14,000 people across 14 countries revealed that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. The findings underscore a shift towards lower fertility rates, driven by financial constraints and other factors, impacting families worldwide.</p>

          <p>Fatal drug overdoses among young Americans have decreased significantly, with a 47% reduction in overdose risk among those aged 20 to 29, according to recent data. The shift is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less potent fentanyl being sold, more accessible addiction healthcare, and a trend of less risky drug and alcohol use among teens. Despite the positive trend, challenges remain for individuals struggling with severe addiction, and potential cuts in funding for addiction services pose a threat to sustaining progress. One pill can kill, and the recent wave of devastation may have spurred a more cautious approach to drug experimentation among Gen Z.</p>
