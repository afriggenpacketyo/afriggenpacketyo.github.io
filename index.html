        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS is facing a critical blood shortage and is appealing for 200,000 new donors to register, particularly those with O negative blood, which is universally compatible. Low blood stocks prompted an "amber alert" last year, impacting patient treatment, and the situation has not improved significantly. The NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) aims to increase regular donors from 800,000 to over one million to ensure a stable supply. A "red alert" could lead to treatment delays, though urgent cases would still be prioritized, and the NHSBT is focusing on recruiting more Black donors due to their higher likelihood of possessing blood types crucial for treating sickle cell disease. The NHS is working to simplify the donation process by opening new centers and providing more convenient appointment options.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces seized a British-flagged ship, the Madleen, carrying aid to Gaza in international waters, detaining Greta Thunberg and other activists. The ship, organized by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, set sail from Italy to protest Israel's blockade of Gaza and deliver a symbolic amount of aid. Israeli forces stated they took command of the vessel and would return those detained to their home countries. The activists claimed the ship carried food for Gaza, where international aid has been largely banned, and Israel has implemented a limited delivery system under armed guard. Previous attempts by the flotilla coalition to deliver aid have been met with violence, including attacks on ships and fatalities.</p>

This followed the deployment of California National Guard troops in Los Angeles to support federal law enforcement amid escalating clashes between protesters and immigration agents.

          <p>Yvette Cooper, the UK Home Secretary, is the only cabinet minister yet to agree on her department's budget before the upcoming Spending Review, despite an offer of above-inflation increases to police funding for the next three years. Other ministers, like Housing Secretary Angela Rayner and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood, have already reached deals with the Treasury. The Home Office argues that police numbers must be maintained to deliver policy commitments on neighborhood policing, which may not be possible under the current proposals. Police chiefs have been publicly lobbying for more funding, and police representatives have warned that the police service is "broken" due to budget cuts.</p>

          <p>Nearly 350,000 nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are participating in a vote regarding a proposed 3.6% pay increase, which could lead to another round of industrial action. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has criticized the pay award as inadequate and views the vote as crucial in determining the next steps, including a potential strike ballot. The government claims that the pay rise will result in nurses earning over £30,000 as a new starter for the first time. The RCN argues that nursing staff have experienced over a decade of pay erosion, leading to a rise in nurses quitting, while the Department of Health and Social Care maintains that the proposed increase is the second above-inflation rise for NHS staff in the last 10 months.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials are initiating a nationwide strategy to arrest undocumented immigrants leaving asylum hearings, targeting those who have resided in the United States for less than two years. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) aims to expedite deportations by getting immigration cases dropped, with immigration judges cooperating in dismissing cases. Critics argue this initiative may deter migrants from attending hearings, potentially impacting those seeking legal citizenship. A legal analyst noted the Supreme Court has affirmed President Trump's authority to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for certain migrants, making them eligible for expedited deportation, while immigration attorneys express concern over targeting individuals following legal processes.</p>

          <p>China's consumer prices experienced a fourth consecutive month of decline in May, indicating that Beijing's stimulus measures are failing to boost domestic consumption. The consumer price index fell by 0.1% year-on-year, while factory-gate prices deepened, falling by 3.3%, marking the steepest decline since July 2023. A price war in the automotive industry and falling property prices contributed to the downward pressure on consumer prices. While exports have been strong, domestic demand needs to increase to combat deflation, and Chinese policymakers have urged the automotive industry to halt price wars. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Uriah Rennie, the Premier League's first black referee, has died at the age of 65, having officiated over 300 games between 1997 and 2008, including 175 Premier League matches. Rennie recently revealed he was learning to walk again after a rare condition left him paralyzed from the waist down. He began refereeing local football in 1979 and made history in 1997 when he oversaw a top-flight match between Derby County and Wimbledon. Rennie was a magistrate in Sheffield since 1996, campaigned on issues including improving equality and inclusion in sport, and was awarded an honorary doctorate by Sheffield Hallam University in November 2023.</p>

          <p>A search is underway for six people missing after a small, twin-engine Cessna 414 plane crashed into the ocean off the coast of San Diego. The U.S. Coast Guard received a report of the crash and located a debris field approximately three miles west of Point Loma, where the water is around 200 feet deep. Multiple agencies, including air and marine crews from the Coast Guard and Customs & Border Protection, are participating in the search efforts. A local resident witnessed the crash and described the plane going straight into the water, and the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the crash.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) unexpected and substantial rate cut will likely put downward pressure on the rupee by reducing foreign exchange forward premiums. The rupee has already been underperforming compared to its Asian counterparts due to weak capital flows, and the narrowing interest rate differential with the U.S. Federal Reserve could exacerbate this trend. A decrease in dollar/rupee forward premiums makes the rupee less attractive for carry trades and lessens the incentive for exporters to hedge future receivables. The central bank cut the key interest rates by 50 basis points, exceeding the 25 bps anticipated by economists, and also slashed the cash reserve ratio for banks.</p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a significant decline of 34.5% in May, marking the sharpest drop since February 2020, according to Wind Information. Overall exports rose 4.8% last month, falling short of estimates, and imports plunged 3.4% due to sluggish domestic demand. The decline in exports to the U.S. was partially offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, the European Union, and Africa. While prohibitive tariffs were lifted in mid-May, the damage had already been done, and China's exports of rare earths also decreased by 5.7%.</p>
