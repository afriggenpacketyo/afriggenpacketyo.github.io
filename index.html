          <p>Yokohama F Marinos were eliminated from the Asian Champions League Elite after a 4-1 loss to Saudi Arabia's Al Nassr.

Kota Watanabe scored a consolation goal for Marinos, but his second yellow card diminished any comeback hopes. The match saw Marcelo Brozovic delivering a strong performance for Al Nassr, contributing significantly to their victory, and Marinos' interim manager acknowledged the pressure and avoidable goals conceded.
