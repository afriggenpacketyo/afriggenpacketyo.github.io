          <p>Jasveen Sangha, known as the "Ketamine Queen," has pleaded guilty to federal charges for supplying the ketamine that led to the death of actor Matthew Perry. She faces a potential maximum sentence of 65 years in prison and a $2.5 million restitution payment, with her sentencing scheduled for December. The plea is part of a wider criminal case that also involves two physicians and Perry's personal assistant. As part of the agreement, Sangha also admitted to her involvement in a separate fatal overdose case from 2019.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's daughter, Kim Ju Ae, made her first known trip abroad, accompanying her father to Beijing for WWII commemorations. Her prominent appearance has intensified speculation that she is being positioned as a potential successor, following a tradition of presenting future leaders to China. Analysts note that while this is a significant signal, her young age and gender present challenges in North Korea's patriarchal society. The visit also served as a political victory for Kim, reinforcing his alliance with China's President Xi Jinping on the world stage.</p>

          <p>With interest rates on traditional savings accounts remaining low, savers with significant funds like $25,000 are exploring better options such as Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts. A comparison reveals that while high-yield savings accounts currently offer slightly higher returns in most short-term scenarios, the difference is minimal. Given that CD rates are fixed and high-yield savings rates are variable and expected to fall, CDs may offer more security for those looking to lock in a guaranteed return. This analysis highlights the trade-off between potentially higher but variable returns and lower but guaranteed earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Right-wing news outlet Newsmax has filed a federal lawsuit against Fox News, accusing the media giant of using its market dominance to illegally suppress competition. The lawsuit alleges that Fox coerces cable distributors into marginalizing or not carrying competing right-leaning channels like Newsmax. The legal action draws on internal Fox communications, revealed during the Dominion lawsuit, that showed Fox executives were concerned about losing viewers to Newsmax after the 2020 election. Fox News has dismissed the lawsuit as an attempt by Newsmax to compensate for its own competitive failures in the marketplace.</p>

          <p>Stephen Miran, President Trump's nominee for a Federal Reserve Governor position, has committed to maintaining the central bank's independence and its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. In his opening remarks to the Senate Banking Committee, Miran stated that independence is critical for preventing economic depressions and hyperinflation. His nomination comes amid concerns that Trump might seek to influence the Fed's decisions on borrowing costs.

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, research on survivors reveals a significant psychological silver lining known as post-traumatic growth, where individuals report positive personal changes following a traumatic event. Many survivors experienced increased personal strength, a greater appreciation for life, and improved relationships after the disaster. Studies found that while many also suffered from long-term PTSD and depression, post-traumatic stress and growth often coexisted. Factors like social support and self-efficacy were key predictors of this positive transformation, offering important lessons for future disaster recovery efforts.</p>

This action is part of a broader push for transparency regarding the Epstein case. It also appears to be an effort by House leadership to manage a separate bipartisan initiative by Reps.

          <p>Republican Senator Rand Paul has publicly criticized the Trump administration's decision to take a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel, labeling the $8.9 billion investment as "a step towards socialism." Paul argued that government ownership in the private sector is a bad idea and expressed concern that the free-market principles of the Republican Party are diminishing. This critique comes as the Trump administration has taken a more interventionist role in the private sector, including stakes in other tech and industrial companies. Ironically, the deal has found support from independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who believes taxpayers should get something in return for corporate aid.</p>

          <p>Angela Rayner, the UK's Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary, has admitted to underpaying stamp duty on a flat she purchased, attributing the error to incorrect legal advice. The issue revolves around her family home in Greater Manchester, where a trust for her disabled son complicated her tax status, meaning she should have paid a higher rate for an additional property. Rayner has now contacted tax authorities to settle the amount owed and has referred herself to the Prime Minister's standards adviser for investigation. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has backed his deputy, while the Conservative opposition has called for her dismissal.</p>

          <p>Following her admission of underpaying stamp duty, tax experts suggest that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner could face a financial penalty in addition to the £40,000 in back taxes. HM Revenue and Customs can levy fines for "carelessness" in tax affairs, which could amount to 30% of the underpaid tax, or an additional £12,000. The key factor will be whether she took appropriate and specialized tax advice regarding the complex trust arrangement for her son's home, as simply relying on a standard conveyancing lawyer may not be considered a sufficient defense. This scrutiny intensifies the political pressure on Rayner.</p>

          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut on September 17, mortgage rates could begin to fall before the official decision. Mortgage rates are influenced by, but not directly tied to, the Fed's policy, and lenders often adjust their rates in anticipation of such moves. Historical precedent shows that rates can drop in the lead-up to a formal announcement as market sentiment shifts. With mortgage rates already on a gradual decline throughout 2025, any further reduction is likely to be moderate rather than dramatic once the cut is formalized. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge's ruling in the Google Search antitrust case is being viewed as a significant victory for both Alphabet and Apple. The decision allows Google to continue paying Apple billions of dollars annually to be the default search engine on its devices, a highly profitable revenue stream for Apple. While the ruling prevents exclusive contracts, it opens the door for Apple to forge similar paid agreements with AI companies to integrate their services into Siri. This could create another major revenue source for Apple's Services division, turning a potential legal threat into a new business opportunity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>That was a walk-back of his declaration just 24 hours earlier that “we’re going in” to Chicago, a city he has long maligned for violent crime but has a Democratic governor who opposes Trump’s deployment of federal troops in his state.\n\nWhile he again credited the federal troops for D.C.’s drop in crime since their deployment last month, the president’s shifting plans for the next phase in his crackdown on urban crime marked a tacit acknowledgement of the legal challenges he’ll face going beyond his authority within the District of Columbia.\n\nHe suggested he’d be holding off on sending more federal troops into states where governors oppose such a move.\n\n“We’re pretty much waiting until we get asked,” Trump said about the potential of activating National Guard units to patrol other Democrat-led cities like Baltimore and Chicago, both of which he again characterized as unsafe.\n\n“I want to go into Chicago and I have this embarrassing governor who doesn’t want us,” Trump said.\n\nNearly a month after he ordered federal troops and law enforcement agents into Washington, Trump is eager to keep the public’s focus on the issue of urban crime. He complained about the media’s renewed fixation on Jeffrey Epstein — with Congress this week releasing an initial tranche of files from the disgraced financier’s legal case — presenting it as a distraction.\n\n“It’s really a Democrat hoax,” Trump said. “They’re trying to get people to talk about something that’s totally irrelevant to the success that we’re having as a nation.”\n\nTrump’s comments also came at the outset of a meeting with Poland’s new president, Karol Nawrocki, who he welcomed with a flyover by F-35 and F-16 jets, an unusual occurrence for a foreign leader’s White House visit — and one that startled residents in Washington even with the higher than normal troop presence at the moment.\n\nThe flyover, the president explained later, was a tribute in honor of a downed Polish Air Force F-16 pilot major Maciej “Slab” Krakowian, who died in a crash last week during an airshow in Poland.\n\nNawrocki, a far-right leader who Trump endorsed during his campaign, was eager to steer the discussion to security issues amid the ongoing war on its eastern border between Russia and Ukraine and the Pentagon’s forthcoming review of global force posture that Poles fear could mean a reduction of U.S. troops in their country.\n\nAsked by a Polish journalist about whether he might authorize a reduction in troops in Poland, Trump assured Nawrocki that the U.S. would maintain its current troop presence.\n\n“They’ll be staying in Poland,” Trump said. “We’re very much aligned with Poland.”\n\nTrump praised Poland as a model ally for spending the highest percentage of its GDP of any NATO country on defense, even joking that “we’ll put more [troops] there if they want.”</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated a potential shift in his plan to deploy federal troops to combat urban crime, suggesting New Orleans as a possible location instead of Chicago. This change appears to be a tacit acknowledgment of the legal and political challenges of sending troops into a state where the governor is opposed, as is the case in Illinois. Trump stated that his administration is now "pretty much waiting until we get asked" before activating National Guard units in other cities. He reiterated his criticism of Chicago's Democratic governor for not wanting federal assistance, while continuing to tout the success of the recent troop deployment in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>The number of federal student loan borrowers using forbearance to pause their payments has surged, rising from 2.9 million to 10.3 million between the third quarters of 2024 and 2025. This dramatic increase is largely attributed to the fallout from the repeal of the Biden administration's SAVE repayment plan, which placed millions of enrollees into an automatic forbearance. Many borrowers are reportedly struggling to exit this forbearance or find other affordable repayment options, leading to a backlog of applications for other income-driven plans. Experts note this trend shows many borrowers are struggling financially, risking interest accumulation.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive analysis of two decades of satellite data shows that fresh water is disappearing at an alarming rate, with vast "mega-drying" regions expanding across the globe. The study attributes the desiccation to rising temperatures from climate change and the chronic overpumping of underground aquifers for agriculture and cities. Researchers found that nearly three-fourths of humanity lives in countries that are losing water, and this depletion is now a larger contributor to sea level rise than melting mountain glaciers. The findings signal a worsening global water crisis that threatens food production, economic growth, and global stability.</p>

          <p>The average monthly Social Security benefit for a retired worker in 2025 is $1,976, but individual payments can vary significantly based on work history and claiming age. While this income is a crucial foundation for many retirees, it is often insufficient to cover all living expenses, highlighting the need for supplemental income. Strategies to boost retirement funds include delaying Social Security claims to increase monthly payments, using annuities to create a predictable income stream, or tapping into home equity via a reverse mortgage.
