          <p>Yuval Raphael, a survivor of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on the Nova music festival, is representing Israel at the Eurovision Song Contest in Basel, Switzerland. Her pop ballad, "New Day Will Rise," reflects hope and coping after loss, which resonates with her personal experience of surviving the attack by playing dead under bodies in a shelter. Despite widespread opposition to Israel's participation, Raphael has qualified for the grand final, and the Israeli delegation has prepared her for potential audience booing, as happened last year. The Eurovision organizers have clarified that no political expression is permitted onstage, and security measures have been heightened for the Israeli delegation. </p>

          <p>U.S. consumer sentiment has fallen to a three-year low in May, driven by concerns that President Trump's trade war will worsen inflation, according to the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index. The index declined by 2.7% to 50.8, the lowest since July 2022, with Americans worried about the economy and their financial prospects. Economists suggest this decline may lead to reduced spending on big-ticket items. While some anticipate improvement due to eased tariffs, the overall sentiment remains cautious. </p>

          <p>The University of Michigan survey indicates that U.S. consumers are increasingly concerned about tariffs leading to higher inflation, with the consumer sentiment index dropping to 50.8 in May. Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 7.3% from 6.5% last month, and long-term inflation expectations also ticked up. The survey notes that trade policy uncertainty is a key factor influencing consumer sentiment, though most of the survey was completed before the U.S. and China announced a 90-day pause on tariffs. </p>

Agency officials acknowledge that fear-mongering has driven people to claim benefits earlier because theyâ€™re afraid theyâ€™re not going to claim benefits at all.

          <p>The British Parliament has approved changes to a bill that would allow terminally ill adults to seek help to end their lives, ensuring that no health staff would be forced to participate in the assisted dying process against their wishes. This protection extends to social care workers and pharmacists. The debate has been emotionally charged, with supporters emphasizing the need to change the law for those in difficult circumstances, while opponents stress the need for stronger protections for vulnerable individuals and improved end-of-life care. Further debate and voting on additional changes are scheduled for June 13. </p>

          <p>A rare clue at a Minneapolis crime scene, bloody bare footprints, led to the arrest of Jerry Westrom in the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs. The footprints, left by the killer who stepped in Childs' wet blood, were documented but remained unsolved for decades. In 2015, DNA testing revealed an unknown profile that matched Westrom through investigative genetic genealogy. Westrom denied knowing Childs, but his DNA and footprints linked him to the crime scene, leading to his arrest. </p>

The top 0.1 percent, however, would gain significantly. Republicans argue the plan would generate economic growth, but experts remain divided on its overall impact. </p>
