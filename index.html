          <h2>Crude Oil Prices Plunge Amid Tariff-Driven Recession Fears</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. crude oil prices experienced a significant drop, falling below $60 a barrel to levels unseen since 2021, as concerns mount over President Trump's tariffs potentially triggering a global recession. The decision by OPEC+ to increase production has further contributed to the downward pressure on oil prices, compounded by Saudi Aramco's price cuts. Despite Trump's assertions that lower oil prices benefit consumers, worries persist that tariffs could elevate business costs, leading to an economic slowdown and decreased oil demand. JPMorgan has increased the odds of a recession this year to 60% following the tariff rollout. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin experienced a volatile trading day, initially dropping to $74,000 before partially recovering, as cryptocurrencies joined a broader market sell-off fueled by fears of a recession triggered by President Trump's tariffs. The downturn prompted significant long liquidations, with over $438 million in Bitcoin and $349 million in Ether liquidated within 24 hours. Analysts suggest Bitcoin's behavior is diverging from traditional assets, participating in market upside but not always mirroring risk-off moves, with the cryptocurrency testing the $74,000 level as a potential low. Despite short-term volatility, some investors believe deglobalization and geopolitical tensions could benefit Bitcoin in the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southampton's recent sacking of Ivan Juric, following their relegation from the Premier League, marks the continuation of managerial instability at the club, raising questions about their overall direction. With six managers in their past two Premier League campaigns, the constant changes cast doubt on the club's ability to rebuild and return to the top flight. Many are questioning whether the initial sacking of Russell Martin was a mistake, given the success of other newly promoted sides who stick with their managers. The club now faces the challenge of finding a new leader to guide them back to the Premier League.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration faces a legal challenge as the Justice Department appeals a court order to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Despite claims of gang affiliation, Abrego Garcia's lawyers dispute these allegations, emphasizing his lack of criminal record and previous grant of legal protection. The case raises concerns about due process and the administration's authority to deport individuals without proper justification, especially given that the US is paying El Salvador to detain prisoners. The Supreme Court is now involved, with the administration arguing it cannot compel El Salvador to comply.</p>

The recent cases, all fatal, are considered "tragic and alarming" due to their early occurrence in the year, as hantavirus cases are typically seen later in the spring and summer. Health officials suspect a high population of deer mice in the area may be contributing to the increased risk of exposure, emphasizing the importance of taking precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.

          <p>The Trump administration defended its deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly sent to a prison in El Salvador, arguing that "due process does look different" for individuals deemed members of terrorist organizations. Despite admitting the deportation was an "administrative error," the DHS asserts that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13, although the judge has seen no evidence of that. The case raises concerns about the administration's deportation practices and the extent of due process afforded to foreigners living in the U.S., especially those accused of terrorism.</p>

The Israeli government claimed the MPs had "accused Israel of false claims" and were "actively involved in promoting sanctions against Israeli ministers".

          <p>Restaurant stocks experienced a decline in morning trading, driven by investor concerns about a potential recession following President Trump's tariffs on imported goods. While the direct impact of tariffs on restaurant companies is considered manageable, the anticipated inflation could strain consumer spending and negatively affect industry demand. Starbucks shares fell after a downgrade citing near-term economic headwinds, with the company also facing risks to its international sales due to trade tensions. The inflation will put pressure on consumers' wallets and could lead to an economic downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article discusses the market's difficulty in assessing the impact of President Trump's tariffs and the potential for an "economic nuclear winter". The absence of market confidence stems from Trump's intransigence, corporate America's reluctance to speak out, and the Federal Reserve's constrained ability to intervene. The possibility of lower corporate earnings and already high share prices contribute to investors' worries. The longer-term consequences of normalized tariffs are also a concern, as the market trades on guesswork amid uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European policymakers are increasingly worried about a potential surge of cut-price Chinese imports into the region, exacerbated by President Trump's tariff policies. As the U.S. increases pressure on Europe, EU member states are urging action to protect businesses from Chinese industrial overcapacity. The direct impact of Trump's tariffs on EU exports to the U.S. is significant, and the potential diversion of Chinese goods to Europe at discounted prices poses further challenges for local firms. EU officials are calling for a rebalancing of trade relations with China to safeguard industry and economic security.</p>

          <p>A CNBC survey of CEOs reveals widespread concerns about the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs, with a majority anticipating a recession, price increases, and job losses. Most CEOs (69%) expect a recession, with over half of those CEOs saying the downturn will hit this year. The CEOs expressed a wide range of emotions, with concerns ranging from the sector-specific issues that will drive up the cost of everything built into strategic growth plans and sold to consumers, to perplexity over the tariffs math and logic, fear of the consequences for American brands worldwide, and outright anger. A little over one-third of CEO respondents (37%) said they do expect to cut jobs this year.</p>

          <p>Prices of new and used vehicles in the U.S. are expected to increase significantly this year due to President Trump's tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. Industry experts at Cox Automotive estimate that the tariffs will add thousands of dollars to the costs of new cars and trucks, both imported and domestic, and drive up used car prices. Automakers have responded in various ways, including offering temporary deals and ceasing U.S. shipments. The current automotive market is described as a "roller coaster ride" due to the regulatory environment and economic uncertainty impacting consumer purchases.</p>
