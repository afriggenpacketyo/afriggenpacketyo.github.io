          <p>Oracle has announced the promotion of Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia to co-CEOs, with current CEO Safra Catz transitioning to executive vice chair. Magouyrk, formerly cloud infrastructure president, and Sicilia, who led industry applications, are credited by founder Larry Ellison for their AI focus, which has significantly boosted Oracle's cloud business. This leadership change comes as Oracle's stock surged 85% this year, benefiting from the AI boom and its Nvidia GPU access. The company also reaffirmed strong financial guidance, with remaining performance obligations soaring to $455 billion.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 10:00:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's crude oil imports from Russia decreased by 15.2% year-on-year in August, totaling 7.94 million tonnes. This dip was, however, largely offset by increased purchases from other nations like Brazil and Indonesia, keeping overall imports steady. Analysts are debating whether this is a temporary fluctuation, possibly due to maintenance at Russia's Sakhalin-1 project, or a sign of a broader trend. Meanwhile, China's oil purchases from the US remained suspended for the third consecutive month.</p>

          <p>The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has unveiled a combat drone converted from a retired 1950s J-6 fighter jet at the Changchun air show, confirming long-held speculation. This repurposed aircraft, based on the Soviet MiG-19, could be deployed in large-scale swarm attacks across the Taiwan Strait. With a combat range of 700km and capacity for 250kg of munitions, the unmanned J-6 first flew in 1995. This development signifies a strategic move to leverage legacy aircraft for modern warfare scenarios.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from Edith Cowan University indicates that both resistance training and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) can help combat breast cancer. The study, published in Springer Nature, found that a single session of either exercise increased anti-cancer myokines, proteins produced by muscles, reducing cancer cell growth by 20% to 30%. This highlights exercise's potential as a therapeutic intervention in cancer care, with intensity being a critical factor. Researchers encourage cancer patients to exercise regularly to boost these cancer-suppressing molecules.</p>

          <p>Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, has been removed as a patron of Julia's House, a children's hospice charity, after an email surfaced in which she referred to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend." The email, sent in 2011, contradicted her public denunciations of Epstein and was reportedly sent to counter a defamation threat from him. Another charity, Teenage Cancer Trust, is reviewing her patronage. This incident highlights ongoing scrutiny of her past association with Epstein.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point rate cut, with potential for more in 2025, is anticipated to reduce returns on savings accounts. Some online banks have already lowered their rates, prompting financial experts to suggest locking in higher rates now. Certificates of deposit (CDs) are highlighted as a good option for securing returns, with some still offering 4% rates that extend into next year. Savers should prioritize liquidity for emergency funds while considering CDs for long-term, conservative growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sedation-assisted tattooing, where clients receive extensive work under anesthesia, is gaining popularity, particularly among the wealthy. This trend allows for large designs in a single session, bypassing traditional pain and multiple appointments. However, it sparks debate among tattoo artists, with some viewing it as blasphemous, arguing pain is integral to the tattoo experience and a measure of personal resolve. While offering practical benefits like cleaner work, the practice transforms parlors into medical clinics, raising questions about the art form's cultural traditions and accessibility.</p>

          <p>Pfizer announced its acquisition of weight loss drugmaker Metsera for up to $7.3 billion, including future payments, as it seeks to strengthen its position in the rapidly growing obesity drug market. This strategic move follows Pfizer's previous setbacks in developing its own obesity drug candidates. Metsera brings a promising pipeline of oral and injectable treatments, including a GLP-1 drug showing significant weight loss in early trials, and potential once-monthly injectable options. The deal is expected to accelerate Pfizer's entry into a market projected to reach $100 billion by the 2030s.</p>

High car ownership, a strong taxi lobby, and developed public transit limit market entry for new mobility solutions. While Germany has authorized Level 4 autonomy, progress is slow due to manufacturers' caution and public annoyance with overly cautious self-driving vehicles.

          <p>UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved plans for a £2.2bn privately-financed second runway at London Gatwick Airport, aiming to boost economic growth. The project involves moving the current Northern Runway 12 meters to bring it into regular use, increasing annual flights from 280,000 to 389,000 by the late 2030s. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the plan for creating "thousands of jobs and billions in investment," but it faces opposition from environmental groups like the Green Party, who deem it a "disaster" for climate goals.

His stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict, which the UN classifies as genocide, could lead to a prolonged conflict similar to Ukraine.
