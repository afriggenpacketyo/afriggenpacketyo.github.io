          <p>Over 25 protesters were arrested at the University of Washington after occupying an engineering building.  The group, Students United for Palestinian Equality and Return (SUPER UW), demanded the university sever ties with Boeing due to its defense contracts.  The university stated the protesters were trespassing and would face legal action, while SUPER UW spokesperson Oliver Marchant reported injuries during arrests. Boeing's significant donations to the university fueled the protest.</p>

          <p>President Trump's threats to annex Canada as the 51st state significantly impacted the Canadian election.  Analysts suggest Trump's actions inadvertently boosted the Liberal Party's Mark Carney, who projected an image of stability amidst the uncertainty.  Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre's campaign strategy, focused on domestic issues, failed to counter Trump's influence effectively.  Carney's Liberals won a minority government.</p>
