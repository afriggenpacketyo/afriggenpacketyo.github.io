          <p>The UK's Crown Prosecution Service is considering bringing further charges against former neonatal nurse Lucy Letby, who is already serving multiple life sentences for murdering seven babies and attempting to murder others. Cheshire Police have submitted a new file of evidence related to deaths and collapses at hospitals where she worked, including the Countess of Chester Hospital and Liverpool Women's Hospital. This ongoing investigation, known as Operation Hummingbird, covers incidents dating back to 2012 and is separate from recent arrests of former hospital managers.</p>

          <p>The tradition of barbecue, a quintessential element of American culture, traces its origins back to the Indigenous TaÃ­no people of the Caribbean islands. The word itself is an evolution of the TaÃ­no term "barabicu," which referred to the wooden frames they used for cooking meat over an open fire. Spanish explorers encountered this method in the 15th century, and the practice has since transformed into the diverse regional styles of barbecue celebrated across the United States today, especially during summer holidays.</p>

          <p>Spanish banking giant Santander has announced an agreement to acquire TSB from its current owner, Sabadell, in a deal valued at Â£2.65 billion. The takeover, which is still subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, would create the UK's third-largest bank by share of personal current accounts. Santander has indicated its intention to fully integrate TSB into its UK group, a move that would likely lead to the TSB brand disappearing from the high street and raises questions about potential job losses.</p>

          <p>A formal, Aboriginal-led inquiry in the Australian state of Victoria has found that British colonists committed genocide against the Indigenous population in the 19th century. The Yoorrook Justice Commission's report details how mass killings, disease, and sexual violence caused the local Indigenous population to decline by 75% in just two decades after colonization began. The commission issued 100 recommendations for redress to address these historical and ongoing systemic injustices, including potential reparations and government apologies.</p>

          <h2>Number of UK Aircrew Pursuing MoD Over Cancer Claims Reaches 180</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At least 180 current and former UK armed forces aircrew are pursuing the Ministry of Defence for compensation over cancer diagnoses they claim were caused by exposure to toxic fumes in helicopters. The claims are linked to aircraft such as the Sea King and Chinook. While the MoD has provided out-of-court settlements in at least six cases without admitting liability, veterans' groups are urging the government to implement a cancer screening program and raise awareness among former service members.</p>

          <h2>G7 Agrees to Deal That Weakens Global Minimum Tax for US Multinationals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 01:00:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece from The Guardian sharply criticizes a recent G7 agreement that will effectively exempt U.S. multinational corporations from a previously settled global minimum tax framework. The authors argue this decision undermines years of international negotiations, puts non-U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage, and will deprive countries of significant tax revenue. They contend the deal prioritizes corporate profits over citizens and developing nations, calling for the international community to reject it and pursue a more equitable system at the UN.</p>
