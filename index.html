          <p>Nicolas Sarkozy has become the first former French president to be imprisoned, beginning a five-year sentence for conspiring to illegally finance his 2007 election campaign with funds from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Despite appealing the conviction, the 70-year-old was ordered to La Santé prison in Paris, where he will be held in an isolation wing for his safety. The case, which has been highly controversial in France, marks a significant moment in the country's legal and political history, with Sarkozy continuing to maintain his innocence.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has elected ultraconservative Sanae Takaichi as the nation's first female prime minister, ending a period of political uncertainty following her predecessor's brief tenure. Her leadership was secured after her Liberal Democratic Party formed a new coalition with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party, shifting the governing bloc's political stance. A protege of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is expected to pursue a hawkish agenda, including strengthening the military and revising the pacifist constitution, though her new coalition's stability remains a challenge for passing legislation.</p>

          <p>A detailed analysis shows how Declan Rice's role at Arsenal has evolved since his £105 million transfer, transitioning from a traditional holding midfielder to a more dynamic box-to-box player. This strategic shift, further enabled by the signing of Martin Zubimendi, has allowed Rice to leverage his running power and significantly increase his attacking contributions, leading to a career-best season for goals and assists. The change has been praised by football experts and has also benefited the England national team, where he has been given similar freedom to operate in a more advanced position.</p>

          <p>An election review in Texas has identified over 2,700 potential noncitizens registered to vote, according to Secretary of State Jane Nelson. The findings resulted from a comprehensive crosscheck of the state's 18 million registered voters against federal citizenship records in the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ SAVE database. County election officials are now required to investigate each flagged registration, sending notices that give individuals 30 days to provide proof of U.S. citizenship before their registration is canceled. Confirmed noncitizens who voted in past elections will be referred for potential prosecution.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's government borrowing in September reached its highest level for that month in five years, totaling £20.2 billion, according to the Office for National Statistics. This increase was driven by rising debt interest payments, which overshadowed higher tax and national insurance revenues, bringing total borrowing for the first half of the financial year to £99.8 billion. The figures present a significant challenge for Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the upcoming Budget, increasing pressure to potentially raise taxes to stabilize public finances as overall public sector debt remains at historic highs.

          <p>A collaborative research team from China and Australia has identified a key cellular weakness that may pave the way for new therapeutic strategies against prostate cancer. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, pinpointed two protein enzymes that are crucial for the growth, survival, and treatment resistance of prostate cancer cells. By understanding how these enzymes regulate the androgen receptor protein, which fuels the disease, scientists hope to develop future treatments that can more effectively combat this common form of cancer.</p>

          <p>Myles Connor, a notorious American art thief known for stealing a Rembrandt in the 1980s, has commented on the recent jewelry heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris. He described the theft as 'damn close' to the most expensive in history and speculated that the thieves will be unable to sell the items intact due to their fame. Connor suggested their best option for profit would be to wait years and then use an intermediary to negotiate a reward for the items' return, a tactic he himself once used. He warned that the perpetrators will be 'vilified by the entire country' for stealing irreplaceable national treasures.</p>

          <p>Following a brazen daylight robbery at the Louvre Museum, art crime experts fear the priceless stolen jewels may have already been broken apart, with the gems and precious metals sold separately. An art detective suggested the professional thieves would likely dismantle the items to make them untraceable, as selling them intact would be impossible. The stolen pieces, including Empress Eugénie's tiara, have an inestimable historical value but could fetch up to £10 million on the black market once broken down. French authorities have tasked a specialist police unit with investigating the heist, which is suspected to be linked to organized crime.</p>

          <h2>Chinese 'Winology' Theory Gains Traction as Explanation for Western Perceptions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A theory termed 'winology,' developed by Chinese academics, is gaining popularity on social media as a framework for understanding what some see as unfair Western dismissals of China's advancements. The theory posits that a hierarchical worldview in the West categorizes different peoples, placing Chinese at a lower level and thus viewing their successes with skepticism or condescension. This concept is now receiving academic attention, with universities like Fudan and Tsinghua holding seminars to discuss its implications for fostering intellectual debate about China's global position and how it is perceived internationally.</p>

          <p>Demolition has begun on parts of the White House's East Wing to make way for a new ballroom project initiated by President Donald Trump. Construction crews were seen tearing down sections of a covered entryway, with the president stating the addition is being privately funded by 'generous Patriots' and will be fully modernized. The project has drawn concern from some historians, who note a lack of transparency and worry that the typically rigorous review process for such a significant building is being rushed, potentially reflecting a personal style rather than the nation's history.</p>

          <p>Brazil's government has granted state-run oil company Petrobras a license to drill for oil near the mouth of the Amazon River, a decision that has sparked sharp criticism from environmental activists. The approval comes just ahead of the COP30 climate summit, which will be hosted in Brazil. Environmental groups have labeled the move a 'sabotage' of climate goals, warning of potential damage to a fragile ecosystem and Indigenous communities. However, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's administration has defended the decision, arguing that the oil revenue is necessary to fund the country's climate transition.</p>

Comey was indicted for lying to Congress about not giving FBI personnel permission to act as anonymous sources regarding the Hillary Clinton investigation. His lawyers argue the charges are a result of a vindictive prosecution driven by President Trump and that the indictment misrepresents the Senate testimony, which they claim was narrowly focused on a different individual, not Richman.</p>

          <p>A new feature-length documentary titled 'Spacewoman' chronicles the historic career of Eileen Collins, the first woman to pilot and command a NASA Space Shuttle. Collins overcame the absence of female role models in her youth to become an Air Force test pilot and eventually a trailblazing astronaut. She commanded the critical 'return to flight' mission after the 2003 Columbia disaster, a role that required immense bravery and leadership. The film explores her determination, her perspective on being a working mother in a demanding field, and her execution of a risky in-space maneuver to ensure her crew's safety.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, a US fugitive who faked his own death and fled to Scotland, has been sentenced to at least five years in prison for the sexual assault of a woman in Utah in 2008. After a lengthy extradition battle during which he falsely claimed to be an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight, Rossi was returned to the US to face justice. During the sentencing in Salt Lake City, the judge described Rossi as a 'serial abuser of women' and the 'very definition of a flight risk,' while Rossi continued to maintain his disproven claims of mistaken identity.</p>
