        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a 3% annual pace in the second quarter, a bigger-than-expected rebound largely driven by a sharp decrease in imports. This trade swing was triggered by businesses rushing to import goods before President Trump's tariff policies took full effect. Following the data release, the president renewed his call for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, arguing the strong growth figure, combined with low inflation, justifies a rate cut to further stimulate the economy.

          <p>Palo Alto Networks has announced a deal to acquire Israeli identity security firm CyberArk for approximately $25 billion, marking a significant strategic move into the identity management market. The acquisition is intended to bolster Palo Alto's platform offerings, especially as AI advancements create new cybersecurity challenges. Despite the long-term strategic goal, shares of Palo Alto Networks fell more than 8% following the announcement, reflecting immediate market apprehension about the large-scale deal.

          <p>A UK court has granted the direct-action group Palestine Action permission to legally challenge the government's decision to ban it under terrorism legislation. The ruling acknowledges that the proscription may conflict with rights to free speech and that a full judicial review is necessary to avoid legal "chaos" in prosecuting individuals for supporting the group. The ban was implemented after the organization caused millions in damages to firms linked to Israel's defense industry. </p>

          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula generated tsunami waves across the Pacific, impacting Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and Japan. While initial warnings prompted evacuations, they were later downgraded as the waves were smaller than feared, causing minor flooding but no major damage or grave injuries. The event served as a major test for the Pacific Tsunami Warning System and highlighted the ongoing threat and response mechanisms for seismic activity in the region.</p>

          <p>British housebuilder Taylor Wimpey has seen its profits erased after setting aside an additional £222 million to fix fire safety defects on its buildings. This charge, a response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy, led to a pre-tax loss and a drop in its share price. The company also reported a slowdown in sales, particularly among first-time buyers who are facing significant affordability constraints in the current housing market, further compounding the company's financial challenges.</p>
