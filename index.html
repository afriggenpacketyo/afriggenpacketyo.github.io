          <p>Pfizer increased its full-year adjusted profit guidance for 2025, citing successful cost-cutting measures and strong business performance. The pharmaceutical company's second-quarter results surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by revenue from its COVID-19 products and other key drugs, causing its stock to rise. The updated outlook accounts for potential impacts from U.S. drug pricing policies and tariffs, with executives expressing confidence in their ability to navigate these challenges while engaging in productive talks with the administration.

          <p>Tennessee proceeded with the execution of inmate Byron Black, despite concerns that his implanted heart defibrillator was not deactivated, a situation experts believe is unprecedented. Black's attorneys had argued the device could cause unnecessary pain, but their legal challenges were ultimately rejected by the courts. Witnesses reported Black expressed he was in pain shortly after the lethal injection began. The execution marks the second in Tennessee since a five-year pause and contributes to a rising number of executions in the U.S. this year.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and DNC Chair Ken Martin have publicly joined Texas Democrats in their opposition to a Republican-led redistricting plan. The plan aims to create five new congressional districts favoring the GOP, prompting Texas Democratic lawmakers to flee the state to deny a legislative quorum. In response, Texas Republicans have issued civil arrest warrants for the absent members. National and Illinois Democratic leaders are framing the fight as a defense of voting rights against partisan gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee, led by Chairman James Comer, has issued a series of subpoenas related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. These include a demand for the complete, unredacted Epstein files from the Department of Justice and subpoenas for depositions with former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. The committee is also seeking testimony from several former and current high-ranking Justice Department and FBI officials. This move follows bipartisan pressure for more transparency after the current administration decided against releasing further federal files on the matter.</p>

The statue was torn down by protesters during Black Lives Matter demonstrations in June 2020.

          <p>LAFC is set to complete the signing of South Korean national team captain Son Heung-min from the English Premier League's Tottenham. The deal involves a transfer fee reported to be the highest in MLS history, surpassing $22 million. The acquisition is seen as a major coup for both the league and the team, expected to significantly boost LAFC's offense and engage Southern California's large Korean community. For Son, the move to the U.S. is also viewed as beneficial for his preparation as captain of the South Korean team for the 2026 World Cup in North America.</p>

A new agreement puts the deposition on hold but requires Murdoch to submit a sworn declaration about his health and provide regular updates.

          <p>New research from the think tank Third Way reveals a growing divergence in workforce participation between women with and without a college degree. Over the past two decades, the share of college-educated women in the workforce grew by nine percentage points, while participation for non-college-educated women increased by less than one percent. The report attributes this gap to changes like flexible work arrangements and enhanced caregiving benefits, which are more common in white-collar jobs typically held by degree holders, leaving many service-sector workers behind.

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed fines totaling nearly £46 million against former star fund manager Neil Woodford and his firm over the 2019 collapse of the Woodford Equity Income Fund. The collapse impacted approximately 300,000 investors. The FCA found that Woodford and his firm made 'unreasonable' investment decisions that increased the fund's illiquidity, disadvantaging investors who remained. Woodford faces a personal fine of nearly £6 million and a ban, while his firm faces a £40 million fine, though they intend to appeal the decision. (not investment advice)</p>

Executives stated that value messaging and new menu items have not resonated with consumers. In contrast, Taco Bell continued to perform well, reporting a 4% increase in same-store sales globally, driven by popular new chicken products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has implemented a new phone-sharing system that reroutes calls from local offices to other locations nationwide, a move intended to reduce wait times. However, employees and advocates report this is creating new problems, as callers are often connected with staff who lack the jurisdiction to resolve their specific cases. This can lead to delays and require the issue to be referred back to the original office, defeating the system's purpose.

          <p>A review of Scott Anderson's new book, "King of Kings," highlights its central argument that the 1979 Iranian Revolution was a contingent event, not a historical inevitability. The book focuses on the actions and miscalculations of key players in the months leading up to the revolution. It details the shah's hubris and the U.S. government's oblivious and unfocused approach, which was hampered by a lack of intelligence and internal divisions. Anderson concludes that the revolution's success was largely due to a 'freakish convergence of circumstances' rather than a single overarching cause.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has weighed in on the Texas redistricting battle, stating that Republicans are "entitled" to the five additional congressional seats the proposed new maps would likely create. His comments came as Texas Democrats remained out of state to block a vote on the Republican-drawn maps, which they argue are a form of gerrymandering designed to suppress minority voters. Trump also made unsubstantiated claims about gerrymandering in Democratic-controlled states like California and Illinois, where many of the Texas lawmakers have sought refuge. The standoff continues as the special legislative session's deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>Civic groups and Democratic lawmakers are raising alarms that new congressional maps proposed by Texas Republicans will unconstitutionally dilute the voting power of Latinos. The map, which prompted a walkout by Democratic legislators, significantly alters districts like that of Rep. Greg Casar in Austin, a historically Latino area. Critics argue the plan violates the Voting Rights Act by failing to create new Latino-majority districts commensurate with population growth and by weakening existing ones. The move is seen as a partisan effort to secure more seats for Republicans ahead of the midterm elections.</p>
