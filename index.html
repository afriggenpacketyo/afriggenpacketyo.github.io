          <h2>Barry Diller Reflects on Instinct and Decision-Making in New Memoir</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 12:41:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Media executive Barry Diller's new memoir, "Who Knew," explores his career and emphasizes the importance of instinct over relying solely on data when making creative and business decisions. Diller recounts his time at ABC, where he helped popularize the "Movie of the Week," and shares anecdotes about trusting his gut when selecting projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker." He argues that too much information can overload and obscure the essence of a good idea, and that simple human instinct is often a better predictor of success.</p>

          <p>At least seven people have died in Mogadishu, Somalia, after heavy rains overwhelmed the city's drainage system, leading to widespread flooding and road closures. The rains, lasting about eight hours, caused houses to collapse and left residents stranded, prompting ongoing rescue efforts. Floodwaters also damaged key infrastructure, including the Aden Abdulle International Airport, which temporarily disrupted operations, and officials have warned of potential flash floods in other regions outside the capital.</p>

While not opposed to players getting paid, Barkley questioned the return on investment for NIL funds and stated he prefers donating to HBCUs and local community initiatives.</p>

          <p>Climate change is altering bird migration patterns, affecting their ability to feed and breed successfully. Rising sea levels are impacting coastal stopover locations, while ocean acidification threatens the crustaceans that migratory birds rely on for food. Extreme weather events and warmer temperatures are also influencing migration routes, leading to conflicts with resident animals. While humans often feed birds, it can do more harm than good, so wildlife experts recommend expanding protected areas and creating bird-friendly habitats to help migratory birds on their journeys.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has crossed $100,000, driven by new crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are giving investors more access to the cryptocurrency. Financial expert Ric Edelman believes crypto is meant to be a long-term portfolio diversifier, but he cautioned against the use of leverage and inverse bitcoin ETFs, saying they may not be appropriate for retail investors. He highlighted the potential of buffer ETFs and yield ETFs, but warned that not all crypto ETFs are appropriate for all investors.</p>

This follows a similar order given to military academies, including the US Naval Academy, which removed nearly 400 books from its library. The defense secretary has vowed to purge DEI from the Pentagon, and the Trump administration has been overseeing a widespread culling of DEI initiatives within the federal government.</p>

          <p>Negotiations are ramping up for President Trump's tax agenda, with the House Ways and Means Committee releasing a preliminary partial text of its portion of the bill. Republican lawmakers can pass Trump's package without Democratic support via a process known as "reconciliation," which bypasses the Senate filibuster with a simple majority vote. However, the narrow Republican majority in the House and competing priorities could make the process difficult, and experts say some lawmakers want a more fiscally responsible package.</p>

The ruling is the broadest of its kind against the government overhaul led by Elon Musk and the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).</p>
