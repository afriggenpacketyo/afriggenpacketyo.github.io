          <p>Eighty years after the end of World War II, the relationship between China and Japan is characterized by a significant paradox. Deep-seated historical trauma, recently reignited by a popular Chinese film about the Nanking massacre, coexists with strong modern economic and cultural ties. This dynamic is highlighted by the fact that China is now Japan's top source of inbound tourists, underscoring a complex blend of geopolitical enmity, shared cultural affinity, and economic reliance.</p>

          <p>According to senior Department of Homeland Security sources, the Trump administration is preparing to launch major immigration enforcement operations in Chicago, potentially employing tactics similar to those used in Los Angeles that involved armored vehicles and tactical gear. The planned actions are reportedly separate from the president's recent push to deploy the National Guard to the city to address crime. Both Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have stated they were not consulted by the federal government.</p>

Proposals include traditional symbols like pine trees and codfish, as well as humorous concepts featuring Dunkin' Donuts logos, velociraptors, and lobsters. The official effort aims to replace symbols that many feel no longer reflect the modern values and diversity of the Commonwealth, welcoming both reverent and irreverent ideas from residents.</p>

          <p>Four senior officials who recently resigned from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention held a rally to protest what they describe as damaging political interference in the agency's scientific work. The former leaders cited the spread of vaccine misinformation under the Trump administration and the recent firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez as key reasons for their joint departure. At the event, they told supporters they would become the agency's "loudest advocates" and urged Congress to intervene to protect public health from politics.</p>

          <p>A large-scale Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) hiring event near Dallas drew hundreds of applicants with a wide range of backgrounds and motivations for joining the agency. The article profiles several candidates, including military veterans seeking camaraderie, individuals looking for better pay, and those driven by a patriotic desire to "defend the homeland" and secure the border. The event is part of the Trump administration's push to hire 10,000 new ICE officers by early next year to facilitate its aggressive deportation goals.</p>

          <p>Ford has issued a recall for approximately 500,000 vehicles, including the 2015-2018 Ford Edge and 2016-2018 Lincoln MKX SUV models, over a potential brake fluid leak. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a flexible hose in the rear brake system can rupture, which could lead to increased brake pedal travel and longer stopping distances, elevating the risk of a crash. Owners will be notified in September, though a remedy is not expected to be available until April 2026.</p>

          <p>The Reform UK leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, Mick Barton, has banned reporters from the Nottingham Post and its affiliated Local Democracy Reporting Service from speaking with him or his councillors. The council claims the ban is due to the paper "consistently misrepresenting" its policies, an action reportedly prompted by an article on local government reorganization. The newspaper's editor and the Liberal Democrats have condemned the move as a direct "attack on the free press."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary argues that while President Trump's political pressure on the Federal Reserve is concerning, the larger, more enduring threat to its independence is fiscal dominance driven by Congress. With public debt exceeding 100% of GDP, rising interest payments create immense pressure to keep rates low, regardless of who is president. The author contends that without congressional action to control spending and debt, the Fed will inevitably be forced to subordinate its monetary policy to the government's fiscal needs.

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly close to signing 23-year-old German international striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart for what could be a club-record fee, surpassing the £63 million paid for Alexander Isak. Woltemade had a breakout season, scoring 17 goals and winning the German Cup, before becoming the top scorer at the Under-21 European Championship. This major acquisition is significant as it could potentially pave the way for the departure of Isak, who has been a transfer target for Liverpool.</p>

Investigators found that the attacker had a "deranged fascination" with past mass shooters, had expressed widespread hate in writings, and had meticulously planned the assault.</p>
