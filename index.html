          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has initiated a defamation lawsuit against Fox News, seeking at least $787 million in damages. The suit, filed in Delaware, alleges that the network, particularly anchor Jesse Waters, knowingly spread false information about a phone call between Newsom and President Trump. Newsom's legal action claims Fox News acted to "lie and distort on behalf of the President." The specific damages sought mirror the amount Fox paid to settle the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit, a parallel Newsom explicitly highlighted.</p>

          <p>Two men face murder charges after a bride was killed and her groom and a 13-year-old were wounded at a wedding in southeastern France. Authorities report that four masked assailants opened fire in a parking lot, possibly as part of a drug-related conflict, as the groom was known to police for organized crime offenses. One of the attackers was also killed during the incident, and a fourth suspect remains at large. The event has shocked the small village of Goult and highlights the French government's ongoing struggle against drug-related violence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the authority of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which have been used to block policies from both Republican and Democratic administrations. The 6-3 ruling came from a case concerning President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, allowing the administration to partially enforce the policy while legal challenges continue. In the majority opinion, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote that such universal orders likely exceed the power granted to federal courts by Congress. The court did not rule on the constitutionality of the birthright citizenship order itself.</p>

This change aligns the U.S. edition's structure with other international versions of the magazine.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated his government has found "the right balance" on welfare reforms after making concessions to his own party's MPs. The initial plan aimed to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to reduce spending, but it faced a significant backbench rebellion. The government has now amended the bill so the stricter criteria will only apply to new claimants, not existing ones. While this move has satisfied many rebels, some MPs still intend to vote against the proposals.</p>

          <p>Methamphetamine seizures in East and Southeast Asia have reached unprecedented levels, with 236 tons intercepted last year, according to the UN.

Law enforcement officials note that despite record seizures, street prices remain stable or have even fallen, indicating a massive increase in supply. The drug trade is also deeply intertwined with the region's booming cyberscam industry, creating a complex criminal ecosystem.</p>

The strikes may also set a precedent for U.S. adversaries to justify their own actions against any regional powers pursuing nuclear capabilities.

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Global Health reveals that an alarming number of cancer drugs in parts of Africa are defective. Researchers tested nearly 200 products in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, and Cameroon and found that 17% had incorrect levels of active ingredients. Receiving substandard medication can lead to treatment failure and disease progression for cancer patients. The problem is attributed to a mix of manufacturing faults, poor storage, and counterfeit products, all compounded by inadequate regulatory oversight and testing capabilities in the region.</p>

          <p>This personal essay describes Tehran as two coexisting cities: a visible one of everyday life and an "invisible" one comprising a hidden network of state control. The author, a former political prisoner, recounts experiences with unmarked detention centers, secret intelligence offices, and safe houses disguised as ordinary buildings. He argues that the recent Israeli airstrikes, by targeting military and intelligence assets embedded in civilian areas, briefly illuminated this hidden architecture of the regime. This invisible city, the article contends, is a structural and psychological reality for Iranians.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Warn of Long-Term Health Crisis from Worsening Wildfire Smoke Exposure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 09:02:50 EDT</div>

          <p>A significant increase in wildfire smoke exposure across the U.S. is creating a looming public health crisis, yet its long-term effects remain poorly understood. Emerging research suggests severe consequences, with one study showing lung function deteriorating years after a major smoke event. Scientists are now finding links between smoke and a range of issues, from reduced fertility and poor sleep to neurological disorders and premature death. With climate change intensifying wildfires, researchers are racing to understand the cumulative impact of repeated smoke exposure on the human body.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust Trims Disney Stake After Stock's Strong Rebound</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 09:00:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CNBC Investing Club has announced the sale of 200 shares of Disney from Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust, citing the stock's strong performance in 2025. Shares of Disney have rebounded significantly, outperforming the S&P 500 this year, prompting the move as a matter of "discipline trumps conviction." The sale reduces the trust's position in the company but still leaves it with a substantial holding. The club notes that while the turnaround plan under CEO Bob Iger is showing success, it is prudent to take some profits. (not investment advice)</p>
