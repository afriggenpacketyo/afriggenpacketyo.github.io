          <p>The Trump administration laid off 639 employees at Voice of America (VoA) and its parent organization, the United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM). Kari Lake, a Trump ally and senior advisor to the USAGM, stated that the cuts were part of an effort to dismantle a bloated bureaucracy. Since March, approximately 1,400 people have been fired from VoA and USAGM. Trump has previously criticized publicly-funded news outlets like VoA and NPR, alleging bias against conservatives. </p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "Total and Complete Moron" for maintaining steady interest rates, and suggested he might fire him. Trump has been pressuring Powell to lower interest rates more aggressively, despite the Fed's cautious approach to avoid overheating the economy and spiking inflation. Legal experts debate whether the president has the authority to fire Powell before his term ends in May 2026. Powell has stated he would not resign if asked, and the Fed has declined to comment on the president's remarks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Romance and fantasy novels are experiencing a surge in popularity, driven by online communities like BookTok. The rise in sales has pushed UK fiction revenue above £1 billion for the first time, leading to changing attitudes towards the genre. Romantasy, a blend of romance and fantasy, has become a bestseller, with readers seeking stories with guaranteed happy endings and focusing on female pleasure and emotional connection. Despite the commercial growth, some believe sexism keeps the genre from mainstream critical appraisal.</p>
