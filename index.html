            <p>A family of five from Spain, including three young children, and their pilot were killed in a helicopter crash in the Hudson River. The family was visiting New York City to celebrate a child's birthday, and the father was in the area on business. The helicopter crashed shortly after takeoff, with witnesses reporting that the rotor blades had detached before impact. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the cause of the crash, which involved a Bell 206 helicopter owned by Meridian Helicopters and operated by New York Helicopter.</p>

            <p>Despite outwardly championing AI, the Trump administration's policies, including budget cuts to research institutions and restrictive immigration measures, are jeopardizing the future of American AI leadership. Generative AI breakthroughs rely heavily on federally funded academic research and university-trained researchers. Scientists are considering leaving the country due to these policies, potentially ceding ground to other nations like Canada, Europe, and China. The administration's actions risk hindering scientific innovation and consolidating the AI industry into an oligopoly.</p>

            <p>A US judge has ruled that the Trump administration can deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian activist, citing a 1952 law that allows deportation if a person's presence is deemed adverse to American foreign policy interests. Khalil was detained last month for his role in pro-Palestinian protests, with the government arguing that his activities pose "adverse foreign policy consequences" and threaten Jewish students. The ACLU criticized the decision as "pre-written," noting the government's reliance on a letter from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Khalil has also filed a federal lawsuit challenging his arrest as unconstitutional.</p>

            <p>Facebook Marketplace has become a dominant force within the Facebook ecosystem, resembling a modern version of Craigslist, with users buying and selling goods. While Facebook promised to connect people, it is now primarily a platform for transactions, as the company profits from advertising and data collection based on user preferences. However, hyperlocal Buy Nothing groups on Facebook demonstrate that people are using the platform to connect with each other by giving things away, showing that connections are not always about transactions.</p>

            <p>As the Trump administration's tariffs continue, U.S. companies are finding ways to absorb or avoid the added business costs, with some introducing "tariff surcharges" or raising prices. Consumers are stocking up on goods they anticipate will become more expensive, while some companies are using pre-tariff sales as a promotional tool. China has retaliated by hiking duties on American exports, further escalating the trade war. The uncertainty in the marketplace is leading to consumer panic-buying and a focus on saving money.</p>

            <p>The 10-year Treasury yield has surged to over 4.5%, driven by President Trump's trade policies, causing investors to sell off U.S. assets. The rapid increase in yields has raised concerns within the White House, as low financing costs are seen as a key component of the administration's agenda. The bond market's reaction likely influenced the administration's decision to pause tariffs on most countries, but rates have since resumed their upward climb.</p>

While he doesn't foresee a financial crisis, Fink acknowledges that economic weakness is being masked by consumer stockpiling ahead of tariffs.</p>

A survey revealed that U.S. consumer expectations for price growth have soared to a four-decade high. Despite these concerns, the White House insists that the U.S. economy is on the verge of a "golden age" and that countries are eager to make deals.
