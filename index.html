          <p>Following citywide Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, activists organized a "mass mobilization" in Los Angeles, leading to protests outside City Hall and federal buildings. President Trump deployed at least 2,000 National Guard troops to L.A. County after clashes between immigration authorities and demonstrators, including incidents of vandalism and property destruction. ICE operations resulted in the arrests of 118 immigrants, some linked to criminal organizations. Local officials urged peaceful protest, while the federal government emphasized enforcing the law, and the situation remains tense as authorities attempt to manage the unrest.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Barbara has formed off the southwestern coast of Mexico, with the National Hurricane Center forecasting it to strengthen into a hurricane on Monday. While there are no coastal watches or warnings in effect, the storm is expected to bring two to four inches of rainfall to portions of Mexico's western states, potentially leading to flooding and mudslides. The storm is also likely to generate sea swells with life-threatening surf and rip currents along the southwestern coast.

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most frequent sources of conflict in relationships, starting with tone of voice or attitude, which often signals contempt. Other common issues include family relations, household chores, and communication styles, each reflecting deeper misalignments and unmet needs. The article suggests strategies for moving past these conflicts, such as naming the effect of a sour tone, reassuring one another in family disputes, acknowledging the uneven distribution of labor in chore-related arguments, and using a "five-second rule" to prevent communication from spiraling. Addressing these issues can lead to stronger, more fulfilling relationships.</p>

          <p>A growing number of students at Pomona College are advocating for a reduced reliance on technology in campus life, with efforts including calls for more tech-free classes and the formation of a "Luddite Club." These students and some professors are concerned about the impact of ubiquitous technology on academic and social engagement. The article suggests that Pomona, with its resources and small campus, is well-positioned to experiment with formalizing tech-free spaces and policies. The aim is to differentiate the college by emphasizing a closely-knit community and in-person learning.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll indicates that the Trump administration's deportation program has positive net approval, particularly among Republicans, but is heavily influenced by perceptions of who is being targeted. Support is strong when people believe the program prioritizes dangerous criminals, but drops significantly if it is seen as targeting others. Half of Americans feel Trump is deporting more people than expected, and most in this group disapprove of the program, emphasizing the importance of due process. More Americans believe the program will weaken the economy, reflecting concerns about the impact on the workforce.</p>

          <p>A state-backed think tank has put forward China’s “four core principles” as a constructive framework for addressing disputes in the South China Sea. These principles include resolving disputes through consultation on an equal footing, managing differences through rules-based co-management, achieving positive outcomes through mutually beneficial cooperation, and opposing interference from external forces. The report blames regional tensions on external actors who fuel rival claimants’ actions and weaken the “willingness for maritime cooperation.” China formally presented its blueprint for cooperation in the South China Sea in 2002 through an agreement with Asean.</p>

The advice centers on open communication, setting boundaries, and cultivating secure attachment within oneself and the relationship. The article suggests exploring non-monogamy only if both partners genuinely feel ready and interested, and it suggests a temporary relationship structure can help to ease into non-monogamy.</p>
