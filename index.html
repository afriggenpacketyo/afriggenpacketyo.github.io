          <p>An environmental activist, Hipolito Quispehuaman, was shot and killed in Peru's Madre de Dios region, a known area for illegal mining and drug trafficking. Authorities are investigating the murder as retaliation for his advocacy work with the Tambopata National Reserve Management Committee. This incident highlights a dangerous trend, as at least 54 environmental defenders have been murdered in Peru since 2012, with human rights groups demanding urgent government protection for activists. The Peruvian Ministry of Justice has vowed to pursue justice to prevent the crime from going unpunished.</p>

          <p>The Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza reported that 14 individuals, including two children, died from malnutrition within a 24-hour period. In addition to the malnutrition fatalities, the ministry stated that 29 Palestinians were killed by Israeli airstrikes during the same timeframe. Local hospitals also reported that eleven people were killed near aid distribution sites, though an aid group disputed this claim. This news comes as Israel announced daily military pauses in some areas to facilitate aid entry into the besieged territory.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has preliminarily found that the Chinese online shopping platform Temu is in breach of the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA). The Commission alleges that Temu, which has nearly 94 million monthly users in the EU, fails to adequately prevent the sale of illegal products on its platform. Further accusations include the use of fake discounts, insufficient vendor information, and an addictive app design. If the violations are confirmed, Temu could face a fine of up to 6% of its global annual turnover.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham drew attention before a game against the Chicago Sky for her pregame attire, which featured a t-shirt with the message "Hot Girls Eat Arby’s." This is not the first time her fashion choices have gone viral, as she has a history of making style statements on gamedays. In the game itself, Cunningham contributed five points and two steals in the Fever's 93-78 victory. The team has been playing without star rookie Caitlin Clark, who is sidelined with a groin injury.</p>

          <p>After five days of intense fighting that resulted in at least 33 deaths and displaced over 275,000 people, Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. The agreement was mediated by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and followed pressure from the United States. The conflict, rooted in a long-standing border dispute, had escalated following a landmine explosion and involved exchanges of gunfire and rockets. Both nations have pledged to honor the ceasefire, a crucial first step toward de-escalation and restoring regional stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the phenomenon of being "too sensitive," where minor slights can cause significant emotional distress. Psychologists suggest this trait can stem from both genetic predisposition and past experiences like trauma or neglect, leading to heightened rejection sensitivity. While being emotionally attuned can be a strength, it can also disrupt relationships if not managed. Experts recommend coping strategies such as reality-checking negative assumptions, questioning the long-term significance of an offense, and developing healthier communication skills to express hurt feelings without escalating conflict.</p>

          <p>Germany's government is planning a "Bau-Turbo" (construction turbo) initiative to combat its severe housing crisis and rising rents. The plan involves amending the German Building Code to allow municipalities to fast-track approvals for residential construction projects, bypassing some complex regulations. The goal is to build approximately 320,000 new homes annually to meet demand, a target the previous government failed to achieve. While the construction industry welcomes the move, some economists are skeptical it will be a short-term fix, and environmentalists worry about the potential loss of green spaces.</p>

          <p>Elbridge Colby, the Pentagon's Undersecretary for Policy in the Trump administration, is a divisive figure advocating for a radical shift in U.S. national security strategy. He argues that the United States must prioritize confronting China above all other global commitments, even at the expense of aiding allies like Ukraine or maintaining influence in the Middle East. This "America First" approach has caused friction with traditional hawks in the Republican party and U.S. allies, who see the threats from Russia and China as intertwined.

Tribal leaders have expressed strong opposition to the tracks implementing HHR without their partnership, viewing it as an infringement on their rights.

Drawing on the work of philosopher Ruth Chang, the article argues that such choices are difficult not because one option is secretly better, but because the options are "on a par," offering different but equally valid kinds of value. Instead of searching for a non-existent correct answer, individuals must exercise their own agency to create reasons for their choice, defining who they want to be in the process.</p>

          <p>Increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids under the Trump administration are causing significant disruptions in the U.S. construction industry. A superintendent in Alabama reports a project is facing a three-week delay and potential cost overruns after half his immigrant workforce, fearing a raid, stopped showing up. Industry leaders state this is a widespread problem, exacerbating existing labor shortages and leading to project delays across the country. Even legally present Hispanic workers are reportedly staying home, fearful of being mistakenly detained, highlighting the far-reaching impact of the enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the story of Russell City, a thriving, unincorporated Black and Latino community in the San Francisco East Bay that was razed in 1963. Using eminent domain, the city of Hayward forcibly removed 205 families, paying them minimal amounts for their properties before destroying the town to build an industrial park. The story is told through the memories of former residents and is part of a new museum exhibition and local reparations efforts aimed at bringing this forgotten history to light. The displacement shattered a vibrant community and destroyed generational wealth.</p>

The stock, which had previously surged over 2,000% since its listing, saw a retreat as investors likely took profits and market expectations were reset. Laopu Gold, popular with younger consumers for its unique designs, attributed its strong revenue and profit growth to both online and offline expansion.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This long-form article argues that a decades-long decline in NASA's ambition and funding, coupled with a shift toward privatization, has made the U.S. space program dangerously dependent on Elon Musk and SpaceX. The piece traces NASA's history from its Cold War glory days to its current role as a customer renting rides from private companies. It contends that in ceding its capabilities, the government has allowed Musk's personal, often fantastical, ambitions—like colonizing Mars—to dictate the future of space exploration. This has created a situation where a single, unpredictable billionaire holds immense sway over a critical national asset.</p>

          <p>As GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic become increasingly widespread, a major unanswered question looms about their long-term effects on the brain's reward system. These drugs work by mimicking a gut hormone that can cross into the brain and suppress dopamine, which reduces cravings for food and other compulsive behaviors. Scientists are now exploring whether this modulation of desire could unintentionally dampen positive motivations and the experience of joy. While some research suggests a distinction between "wanting" and "liking," the full impact of altering these fundamental neural pathways over decades remains unknown.</p>

The pastor draws a disturbing parallel between the actions of U.S. immigration enforcement and the oppressive regime he escaped. He pleads for a change in policy, arguing that deporting these individuals back to Iran would be a death sentence and betrays America's promise of religious freedom.</p>

Jennings emphasizes that learning should be fun and narrative-driven, a principle that guides both "Jeopardy!" and his writing.

Since August 2024, the virus has affected over 75% of the state's dairy farms, sickening cattle and reducing milk output. The relief was provided through a USDA emergency assistance program, with payments expected to increase as more claims are processed.
