          <p>International Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Rafael Grossi informed the United Nations Security Council about radiological and chemical contamination within Iran's Natanz facility, mentioning the possible dispersal of uranium isotopes and hydrogen fluoride. Grossi reported destruction at multiple sites, including Natanz, Isfahan, Arak, and Tehran, but clarified that no radiological activity has been detected outside these facilities. He cautioned that the Bushehr nuclear facility could be targeted, which would have severe consequences due to the large quantity of nuclear material present, potentially necessitating evacuations and the use of stable iodine. The IAEA is closely monitoring the situation and urging restraint. </p>

          <p>Southern Mexico is currently assessing the damage caused by Hurricane Erick, which made landfall as a Category 3 storm.

          <p>The House of Commons passed a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives, following hours of debate and protests outside Parliament. The bill, which passed by 23 votes, will now be reviewed by the House of Lords. The bill stipulates that adults over 18 with less than six months to live can receive assistance to end their lives, subject to a series of safeguarding checks, including approval from two doctors and a panel including a social worker, legal figure, and psychiatrist. Supporters argue for the right to choose, while opponents fear manipulation of vulnerable individuals. </p>

          <p>Tesla has secured its first agreement to construct a grid-scale battery power plant in China, a project poised to be the largest of its kind in the country. This initiative aims to support electricity grids by balancing supply and demand, especially crucial with the rise of intermittent energy sources like solar and wind. The project, valued at 4 billion yuan, involves Tesla, the Shanghai local government, and China Kangfu International Leasing. Tesla's Shanghai factory has already produced over 100 Megapacks, each capable of providing up to 1 megawatt of power for four hours, during the first quarter of this year. </p>

          <p>Silver prices are experiencing a surge, prompting investors to consider it as a potentially attractive investment option. The price of silver has risen from $28.92 per ounce to $37.12 per ounce since January, marking a 28% increase. This rise is driven by strong industrial demand, particularly in the production of solar panels. While a diversified portfolio should ideally include a mix of precious metals, silver's lower entry price point and ability to hedge against inflation make it an appealing choice for investors seeking affordable diversification.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that fossil fuel companies can challenge California's ability to set stricter vehicle emission standards. The court's decision supports a challenge by oil and gas companies and Republican-led states against a waiver that has allowed California to set tougher standards than federal rules since 1967. The ruling overturns a lower court's decision that had dismissed the lawsuit, with Justice Kavanaugh arguing that the government cannot evade lawsuits by claiming the targets of regulation are unaffected bystanders.

          <p>In her upcoming memoir, "Far From Home: An Alaskan Senator Faces the Extreme Climate of Washington, D.C.," Senator Lisa Murkowski reflects on her career and the importance of consensus-building in an increasingly partisan political landscape. Murkowski emphasizes the need for elected officials to prioritize the needs of their constituents and to remain independent in their decision-making, citing her 2010 write-in campaign victory as a turning point in her approach to the Senate. She expresses concern over the shrinking number of pro-institution problem solvers in Congress and encourages citizens to get involved in their communities and to elect leaders who are willing to work together to solve problems. The book highlights the challenges and rewards of being a consensus-building senator in a polarized Washington. </p>

While the Iranian government has used the conflict to rally support, the regime's failure to protect its top officials has raised questions about its ability to defend the country. Exiled Iran expert Majid Golpour suggests that the collapse of the Islamist regime depends on the availability of a viable political alternative, while political scientist Shukriya Bradost believes a political vacuum could emerge if the regime weakens.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller suggested the central bank could cut interest rates as early as July, sparking a short-lived rally in stocks. Waller's argument centers around the notion that import taxes will result in a one-time increase in the price level of imported goods and not provide a re-accelerant for inflation. However, the rapid appreciation in energy costs does have the potential to have a more lasting impact on inflation, especially if the U.S. were to become more directly involved in the war between Israel and Iran. The U.S. has stressed the importance of STEM education, coding skills and software programming over the last many years just as AI tools were rendering those degrees rapidly obsolete.
