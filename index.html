          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, including Fordo, global leaders have reacted with a mix of condemnation, support, and calls for de-escalation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City is implementing ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election, a system where voters rank multiple candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed based on voters' second choices. The process continues until a candidate secures a majority. While proponents say this system prevents wasted votes and ensures broad support for the winner, critics worry about transparency and the potential for unexpected results.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump asserted that "obliteration" is an accurate term to describe the damage inflicted on Iran's nuclear facilities following recent U.S. strikes. This statement contradicts cautious assessments from the UN nuclear watchdog and Iranian sources. Gen. Dan Caine, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reported "severe damage and destruction" but stopped short of confirming complete obliteration. Amidst the uncertainty, reports suggest that some of Iran's enriched uranium was moved prior to the strikes. Battle Damage Assessment is ongoing to determine the full extent of the damage.</p>

          <p>Oil markets are experiencing increased volatility due to the U.S.'s involvement in the conflict between Iran and Israel, raising concerns about potential supply disruptions and soaring prices. Experts are warning of triple-digit oil prices as investors monitor Iran's response to the U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities. Threats of Iran blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a critical artery for global oil trade, have further intensified market jitters. If Iran closes the Strait of Hormuz, oil prices could approach $100 per barrel, potentially retesting the highs seen in 2022. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Nashville ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, facing human smuggling charges, can be released on bail, determining that the government failed to prove he is a flight risk. However, the ruling may be largely symbolic, as Abrego Garcia is likely to be immediately taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was previously deported to El Salvador's CECOT prison despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution. Another hearing is scheduled to set conditions for his release, though his actual release remains uncertain.</p>
