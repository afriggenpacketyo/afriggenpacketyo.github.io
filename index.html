          <p>The White House has withdrawn Jared Isaacman's nomination to be the next NASA administrator, citing the need for complete alignment with President Trump's "America First" agenda. Isaacman, the CEO of Shift4, has a long history with Elon Musk and SpaceX, which raised concerns during his confirmation hearing. While Isaacman stated he would prioritize sending American astronauts to Mars, he clarified that a lunar landing would take precedence.

          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S.-led proposal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza, seeking amendments to the plan. While details of the response are not fully known, Hamas aims for a permanent ceasefire, Israeli withdrawal, and unimpeded humanitarian aid. A senior Hamas official indicated the proposed changes relate to U.S. guarantees, the timing of hostage release, aid delivery, and Israeli troop withdrawal. The U.S. envoy to the Middle East deemed Hamas' response "totally unacceptable."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delaying Medicare enrollment can lead to penalties that increase premiums for life, but exceptions exist for individuals covered by an employer-provided health insurance plan. If you or your spouse is working for an employer with 20 or more employees, you can generally opt to keep the employer-provided insurance and delay applying for Medicare without penalty. Delaying enrollment also allows continued contributions to a health savings account, which are no longer permitted once enrolled in Medicare. It is wise to consult with the employer's benefits department to confirm appropriate coverage and eligibility for delayed application. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has criticized the introduction of a new rule clamping down on front wing flexibility in Formula 1, calling it "a waste of money." The FIA imposed a stiffer load test to limit aerodynamic exploitation, but Hamilton claims it has changed nothing. He stated that wings still bend, and teams had to spend more money on new designs. Hamilton suggested the money could have been better spent on charitable causes.</p>

          <p>Inflation is impacting the price of a New York City breakfast staple, the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. At El Vacilon Grocery in Brooklyn, the price recently increased from $4.50 to $5, the first increase since 2019. The owners, Freddy and Yovanna Melo, cited soaring egg costs as the primary reason for the price hike. They also own the building and collect rent from apartments above the store, which helps them stay afloat. </p>

          <p>As the nation’s top health official leading the Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has declared autism an “epidemic.” He has launched a massive federal effort to find the culprit for the rise in autism rates, calling for researchers to examine a range of suspects: chemicals, molds, vaccines, and perhaps even ultrasounds given to pregnant mothers. Scientists have identified hundreds of genes that are associated with autism, building a convincing case that genetics are the most important driver of autism’s development, not, as Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has argued, a single environmental toxin. Researchers fear Kennedy’s fixation on outside toxins could distract from genetic research that has facilitated the development of exciting new therapies that could help those with profound autism.</p>

The city's aging infrastructure, with many schools built before lead paint was banned, is a major concern.

This situation highlights the challenges faced by cities when federal resources are reduced, potentially leading to more local health emergencies going unaddressed.</p>
