          <p>The U.S. economy added only 73,000 jobs in July, a figure well below economists' forecasts and indicating a notable slowdown in the labor market. The unemployment rate saw a slight increase to 4.2%. Compounding the weak report, the Labor Department also issued major downward revisions for May and June, reducing previously estimated job gains by a combined 258,000. This trend suggests that economic pressures, potentially including trade tensions, are beginning to have a more pronounced impact on hiring across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the release of a jobs report showing slower-than-expected growth, President Trump announced the firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. In a social media post, the president made baseless claims that the statistics were "faked" and "manipulated for political purposes." The move to dismiss the career civil servant, who was confirmed by the Senate in 2024, has drawn criticism from economists who warn it could undermine the integrity of vital, nonpartisan economic data. This has raised concerns about the politicization of key government agencies.</p>

          <p>An investigative report reveals that Tim Parlatore, a lawyer known for representing Donald Trump and his allies, hired Darren Indyke, who served as Jeffrey Epstein's personal attorney for nearly 25 years. Indyke, who is also a co-executor of Epstein's estate and has been sued by victims for allegedly enabling the sex-trafficking network, joined Parlatore's law firm in late 2022. Parlatore defended the hiring by citing Indyke's "valuable" experience in complex corporate and financial transactions, the very skills accusers claim were used to facilitate Epstein's crimes.</p>

          <p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has announced it will shut down after Congress voted to eliminate its federal funding. For 57 years, the CPB has been a crucial financial pillar for over 1,500 local public television and radio stations, including PBS and NPR. The closure is expected to have a severe impact, particularly on rural communities that rely on these stations for local news, educational programming, and emergency information. The defunding follows long-standing arguments from some Republicans that public media is an unnecessary expense with a liberal bias.</p>

          <h2>Editorial Criticizes President Trump's Nuclear Submarine Announcement as Reckless and Distracting</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis piece characterizes President Trump's public announcement about repositioning nuclear submarines as a reckless and irresponsible act. The author argues that the president is treating instruments of nuclear deterrence like political tools, using them to create a distraction from domestic political troubles and a weak economy. The article suggests that such public threats in response to a low-level Russian official are unprecedented and erode the gravity and sobriety historically associated with nuclear command. It portrays the move as a dangerous departure from established presidential norms.</p>

          <p>The UK Supreme Court has issued a ruling that limits the potential for widespread compensation claims related to hidden commissions in car finance deals. The court dismissed the idea that car dealers have a "fiduciary duty" to buyers, which could have triggered billions in payouts. However, the ruling did uphold one claim where the finance agreement was deemed "unfair" due to a very large, undisclosed commission, potentially setting a precedent for similar cases. The financial industry has avoided a worst-case scenario, but a path remains for some consumer redress.</p>

This "safe country" concept is a legal cornerstone of the Italy-Albania deal.

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging its actions against the provision of gender-affirming health care for minors. The suit supports children's hospitals and medical professionals who have faced pressure from the administration to cease these services. The states contend that the administration's efforts are illegal and represent an overreach of federal power into state-regulated medical practices. This legal challenge marks a significant escalation in the conflict between state and federal governments over transgender rights.</p>

          <p>This article features an interview with the economist who originally coined the acronym BRICS, referring to the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, and China. The discussion explores how the concept evolved from a simple investment thesis into a formal economic and political alliance that now includes other nations. The interview also touches upon why this bloc has drawn significant animosity from President Trump, who views it as a geopolitical and economic challenger to U.S. interests.

          <p>Recent economic data has resolved the mystery of the U.S. economy's supposed resilience, revealing that it is not as strong as previously thought. The latest jobs report showed the weakest quarter for labor market growth since 2010, outside of the pandemic, with significant downward revisions. This article argues that this slowdown, combined with persistent inflation, aligns with economists' earlier predictions about the negative consequences of the administration's tariff policies. The data suggests the economic boom was largely an illusion, and the full impact of trade disputes may now be emerging.</p>

          <p>Amazon's stock dropped 8% after its latest earnings report, even though the company beat expectations on revenue and profit. Investors were concerned by weaker-than-expected profit guidance and cloud computing growth that lagged behind competitors like Microsoft and Google. The company also announced it would increase its capital expenditures, largely to support AI infrastructure development. While online retail and advertising sales remained strong, the results suggest Wall Street is increasingly focused on Amazon's competitive position in the high-stakes cloud and AI markets.

          <p>Indian fast bowler Prasidh Krishna revealed that a heated on-field exchange with England's Joe Root during the fifth Test was a deliberate plan to disrupt the star batter.

Coaches from both sides commented on the competitive but generally good-spirited nature of the contest, despite several contentious moments throughout the series.</p>

          <p>The National Football League is expected to take an ownership stake in ESPN, a move that would deepen the relationship between the sports media giant and its most valuable content partner. In exchange for equity, ESPN is anticipated to take operational control of NFL-owned media properties, including the NFL Network and the Red Zone channel. The deal, which could be announced soon, would further align the interests of the league and one of its key broadcasters. This comes as ESPN adapts to the changing media landscape and the decline of traditional cable television.</p>
