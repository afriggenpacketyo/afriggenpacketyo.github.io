          <p>The United States appeared to be positioning B-2 stealth bombers and refueling tankers in the Pacific Ocean as President Trump considers whether to join Israel's attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. According to sources, the U.S. aircraft have no orders beyond that. The Israel Defense Forces reported completing strikes in southwestern Iran on a military site containing missile launchers, as well as striking radar detection systems. This maneuvering comes as President Trump weighs the decision of taking action in the conflict with Iran. </p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced the killing of Saeed Izadi, an Iranian commander who allegedly helped fund and arm Hamas. Izadi was reportedly killed in an Israeli strike in Qom and was described as one of the orchestrators of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel. The IDF also stated that it killed a second Iranian commander, Benham Shariyari, who was responsible for weapons transfers to Iranian proxies in the Middle East. This action is part of Israel's ongoing efforts to dismantle Hamas's military capabilities and counter Iranian support for terrorist organizations. </p>

Jobe's goal showcased his anticipation, poise, agility, and ruthlessness, mirroring some of the qualities that made Jude a successful player for Dortmund before his move to Real Madrid. The goal capped a fine display on his full debut, and by his own admission, it's something the former Sunderland midfielder has been working on. </p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian rights activist and Columbia University graduate, has been reunited with his family after being released from ICE detention. Khalil, who was held for over three months, arrived in New Jersey and vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez emphasized that his release is a victory against the Trump administration's attempts to suppress pro-Palestinian voices. Khalil's detention sparked widespread protests and condemnation, as it was seen as an assault on freedom of speech. </p>

Reed argues Trump's stance may be influenced by contemplating an attack against Iran. He questions the timing of Trump's rejection of the intelligence community's conclusions, especially after Israeli activity. Reed suggests that if the intelligence chief made a false statement in her testimony, there would be an obligation to correct the record immediately, not just in the wake of this activity by the Israelis. </p>

          <p>The Senate parliamentarian has advised that a Republican proposal to shift some food stamps costs from the federal government to states would violate Senate rules. This ruling poses a setback for the Republicans' tax and spending cut bill, as they were counting on savings from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to offset the costs of tax breaks. The parliamentarian did allow a provision that would impose new work requirements for older Americans to receive food stamp aid. The goal of the multitrillion-dollar package is to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term and add new ones, while cutting federal Medicaid, health care, and food programs.
