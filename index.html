          <p>A horrific attack at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, left at least four people dead and several injured. The assailant, 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, reportedly drove a vehicle into the building during a Sunday service, then opened fire with an assault-style rifle before allegedly setting the church on fire. Police responded promptly, engaging and killing the suspect in the church car park. This incident, which caused extensive damage and left some unaccounted for, is being investigated as targeted violence, though the motive remains undetermined. Authorities commended the bravery of churchgoers who protected children during the eight-minute ordeal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the deployment of 200 Oregon National Guard members to Portland. State Attorney General Dan Rayfield argues that President Trump lacks the authority to federalize the National Guard for this purpose, asserting that local officials can manage public safety without federal interference. Governor Tina Kotek stated there is no "insurrection or threat to public safety" necessitating military intervention, despite Trump's claims of a "war-ravaged" city and an ICE facility "under siege." The lawsuit contends Trump's characterization is based on misleading social media reports, making the deployment unlawful and potentially inciting public outcry.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially withdrawn from his reelection campaign, citing relentless media speculation about his future and the Campaign Finance Board's decision to withhold significant campaign funds. His exit transforms the mayoral race into a three-way contest among Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, independent former Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams, who began his term in January 2022, has recently endured a challenging period, including a federal corruption scandal and scrutiny over his interactions with the Trump administration. Despite his withdrawal, his name will remain on the general election ballot, profoundly altering the political dynamics for the city's leadership.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has rapidly intensified, reaching Category 5 strength before fluctuating to a powerful Category 4, leading to a Tropical Storm Watch for Bermuda. Positioned approximately 450 miles south of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph, the storm is forecast to remain a dangerous major hurricane for the next few days.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deliveries of China's first narrowbody passenger jet, the C919, to major domestic airlines like Air China and China Eastern Airlines are reportedly facing delays, falling behind their stated schedules. Financial reports reveal that these airlines received only one C919 each in the first half of 2025, despite initial goals of adding ten aircraft apiece. Similarly, China Southern Airlines, which expected twelve jets this year, has only financially leased three. This discrepancy has fueled market speculation regarding potential disruptions to the model's engine supply, an observation echoed by independent aviation analysts. Despite having transported over 2 million passengers since its maiden commercial flight in May 2023, the C919's ambitious market entry might be hitting turbulence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The term "energy vampires" refers to individuals in friendships who consistently drain one's emotional and mental vitality, often characterized by incessant complaining, self-centeredness, or a noticeable lack of genuine interest in their friends' lives. Experts, including psychologist Suzy Reading and journalist Radhika Sanghani, identify common red flags such as an overwhelming need for attention and reassurance, or subtle emotional erosion through backhanded compliments. A crucial tell-tale sign is the feeling of exhaustion after spending time with them. Strategies for managing these dynamics include open and honest communication about feeling unheard, establishing firm boundaries on interaction frequency or topics, and modifying shared activities to prevent one person from dominating the conversation.</p>

          <p>More than 100,000 federal workers are reportedly poised to formally resign on Tuesday, an event anticipated to be the largest mass resignation in U.S. history. This unprecedented exodus is attributed to a Trump administration initiative designed to implement sweeping cuts across the federal workforce. Compounding the situation, the White House has directed federal agencies to draft plans for widespread firings should a congressional funding deal fail to materialize by Tuesday's deadline, potentially triggering a government shutdown. Many employees expressed feeling compelled to leave due to months of "fear and intimidation," a perceived undermining of their agencies' missions, and a significant erosion of job security and work-life balance.</p>

Wang highlighted this at the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, the world's first large-vehicle carrier capable of running on both traditional fuel and methanol.

          <p>An investigation has revealed alarming staff failings and unsafe conditions at Schoen Clinic York, a specialist eating disorder unit that recently ceased operations. Whistleblowers and former inpatients provided photographic evidence of staff sleeping during shifts when they were supposed to be monitoring vulnerable patients at risk of self-harm. Additional concerns included staff witnessing self-harm without intervention, unhygienic food being served, and the use of deeply triggering language towards patients. Despite the Care Quality Commission's prior "good" rating, numerous patients reported that their time at the unit exacerbated their conditions due to the substandard care. The unit's closure was officially due to low referrals, while its co-located dementia unit also faced recent safety concerns.</p>

This move comes after two federal courts universally blocked the order, which unilaterally declared only newborns to parents with permanent legal status are eligible for citizenship.

The attack resulted in one detainee's death and critical injuries to two others who were inside vans targeted by Jahn.

          <p>Team Europe clinched a hard-fought 15-13 victory over the United States in the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black, securing their fifth away win and the first since 2012. Despite entering Sunday singles with a record seven-point lead, the Americans mounted a fierce comeback, winning 8.5 points from 12 matches. Tyrrell Hatton ultimately secured the winning half-point, while Shane Lowry's crucial birdie putt ensured Europe would at least retain the trophy. Captain Luke Donald became the second captain to lead both home and away victories, cementing his legendary status. The win was achieved amidst a hostile crowd, with players like Rory McIlroy facing significant abuse throughout the week.</p>

          <p>Two eyewitnesses to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk are calling for a return to civilized debate in America, despite their differing political views. Hunter Kozak, a liberal who was the last person to speak with Kirk, and Jeb Jacobi, a conservative admirer, both stressed the importance of respectful dialogue after witnessing the shooting at Utah Valley University. Kozak, who intended to challenge Kirk on his views, and Jacobi, who admired Kirk's campus debates, now unite on the necessity for Americans to engage in civil conversations and recognize shared community. Utah Governor Spencer Cox echoed this sentiment, emphasizing how disagreement should be handled.</p>

          <p>A Texas man, Joshua Cole, has been arrested by the FBI for allegedly posting threats to commit a shooting at an upcoming local gay pride event in Abilene. According to court documents, Cole commented on Facebook, expressing a desire to "pay them back for taking out Charlie Kirk" and suggesting violence against participants, just nine days after the conservative activist's assassination. While Cole admitted to making the comments and owning a firearm during a traffic stop, he denied any intention to carry out the shooting. The FBI affidavit underscored the specific and non-conditional nature of the threats, deeming them beyond mere idle talk. The Abilene Pride Alliance subsequently reassured its community, commending law enforcement's prompt actions in safeguarding the event.</p>

          <p>The historic Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, celebrated for its iconic windmills, is set to implement a €17.50 entry fee for all non-local tourists beginning next spring. This initiative is a direct response to the escalating issue of over-tourism, with visitor numbers reaching 2.6 million last year for a residential population of just 100. Marieke Verweij, the museum director, emphasized the severe lack of privacy experienced by residents, citing instances of tourists entering private gardens and homes. The proposed fee, which will include admission to the museum and the interior of the windmills, is projected to generate substantial annual revenue, earmarked for essential maintenance and new infrastructure. While some visitors and locals support the move to preserve the village's unique charm, local businesses express concerns about potential revenue loss.</p>

          <p>The rising popularity of weight-loss injections like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro is sparking concerns that obesity management could become a wealth issue. While some drugs are NHS-prescribed, access is limited by a "postcode lottery" and strict BMI thresholds, leaving thousands ineligible. Consequently, over 90% of the 1.5 million UK users pay privately, at costs ranging from £100-£350 monthly. Experts warn that escalating prices, like Eli Lilly's proposed Mounjaro increase, could price out private patients, exacerbating existing health inequalities where obesity rates are higher in deprived areas. This trend raises questions about medicalizing a social issue and the need for broader public health investment.</p>

This defeat allowed the Cincinnati Reds to clinch the final National League wildcard spot. For many Mets fans, this disappointing conclusion mirrored similar late-season meltdowns in 2007 and 2008, where their playoff dreams also dissolved in the final game against the Marlins.

Those who decline the offer without reasonable excuse could face benefit sanctions.

Reeves will also advocate for a society where "hard work is matched by fair reward." The scheme builds on a previous "youth guarantee" and will involve private companies covering some wages, funded from existing budgets, addressing the nearly one million 16-24-year-olds not in education, employment, or training.</p>

Yan Lianke firmly believes in the simplest principle of literary common sense: that any human experience is a legitimate subject for literature, and no single experience is inherently more noble or deserving of literary exploration than another.
