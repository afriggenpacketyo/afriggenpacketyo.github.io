          <p>Donald Trump suggested hosting a UFC championship fight on the White House grounds as part of the America250 celebration next year. Speaking in Iowa, he stated that UFC CEO Dana White, a supporter, would organize the event for an audience of 20,000 to 25,000 people. This proposal is unprecedented, as a major sporting event of this kind has never been held at the White House. Trump, a frequent attendee of UFC matches, envisions an octagon ring being built on the property for the occasion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience outlines five food categories he avoids giving his own children to promote long-term heart health. These include microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and deli meats because of sodium and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. The article suggests healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and unprocessed proteins.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, England's Jamie Smith scored a remarkable 184 not out, leading a significant fightback after an early collapse. He and Harry Brook, who made 158, formed a 303-run partnership that brought England back into the match against India. However, India's bowlers, led by Mohammed Siraj's six wickets, rallied to dismiss England for 407, securing a 180-run first-innings lead. At the close of day three, India extended their overall lead to 244, leaving them in a strong position to level the series.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo are demanding an investigation into allegations that Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani falsely identified as African American on a past Columbia University application. Both politicians suggest this could indicate broader dishonesty, with Adams calling it an "insult" to other students. In contrast, Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa has dismissed the controversy as a distraction that could inadvertently help Mamdani by making him appear victimized. The Adams campaign has called for Columbia to release Mamdani's application records for review.</p>

Other financial giants like Deutsche Bank are also leveraging Ethereum-related technology for tokenization, while firms like BlackRock have launched funds on the network.

While long-term effects are not well-studied, short-term impacts include the stomach stretching to a massive size, potentially causing permanent damage to its ability to contract. Competitors ingest extreme levels of calories, sodium, and fat, which can lead to gastrointestinal distress and spikes in blood pressure. A 2007 study showed a competitive eater's stomach distended into a "massively food-filled sac" with little muscular activity.</p>

          <h2>Trump to Sign Sweeping Tax and Spending Legislation</h2>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign a landmark bill that enacts key parts of his agenda, including extending his first-term tax cuts and boosting spending on defense and immigration enforcement. The 870-page package also includes significant cuts to Medicaid, new tax breaks on certain income, and a reduction in clean energy credits. The legislation passed Congress by a narrow margin, with opposition from Democrats and some Republicans over its impact on the national debt and its benefits for the wealthy. The White House believes the measures will stimulate economic growth, but critics warn it will punish the poor.</p>

          <p>In an effort to save Florida's coral reefs, scientists are transplanting internationally crossbred corals onto a reef near Miami that was devastated by bleaching. The project, a collaboration between the University of Miami, the Florida Aquarium, and Tela Coral in Honduras, involves breeding native Florida Elkhorn corals with ones from a warmer reef in Honduras. The goal is to create more "thermally tolerant" offspring that can better survive rising ocean temperatures. This marks the first time such international crossbreeding has been permitted for introduction into a wild reef, offering a potential blueprint for future conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>Renowned underwater archaeologist James Delgado, known for discovering the last U.S. slave ship, the Clotilda, shared insights from his career exploring over 100 shipwrecks. In his new book, "The Great Museum of the Sea," he argues that every wreck tells a unique story, from tragedy to bravery. Delgado described the process of locating wrecks as a forensic science involving oceanographers and historical records. He recounted his experience exploring the Titanic in a submersible, describing the eerie and powerful feeling of witnessing the massive, deteriorating ship resting 2.5 miles below the ocean surface.</p>

          <p>A powerful explosion at a gas station in southeastern Rome has injured at least 25 people, including ten first responders who were investigating a reported gas leak. The blast, which occurred Friday morning in the Prenestino neighborhood, sent a massive fireball and smoke cloud into the sky, visible across the city. Authorities said police had evacuated a nearby sports center and surrounding buildings just before the main explosion, preventing a more serious tragedy. Rome's prosecutors have opened an investigation into the cause, which may be linked to a leak during an LPG unloading.</p>

          <p>Germany has approved a massive spending package to modernize its military, aiming to make its armed forces the strongest in Europe. While this is a boon for defense contractors like Rheinmetall, whose stock has soared, economists are skeptical about its broader economic impact. A study suggests that for every euro spent on defense, the economy may only see 50 cents in additional activity, far less than investments in infrastructure or education would yield. Critics argue that the spending primarily boosts arms companies' profits rather than generating sustainable growth, as military hardware does not create ongoing economic value.</p>
