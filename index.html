          <p>Russia has conditioned a maritime ceasefire with Ukraine on the lifting of certain Western sanctions, including those on Rosselkhozbank and the restoration of Swift access.  This demand complicates the ceasefire agreement reached in Saudi Arabia, with Ukraine asserting the deal doesn't require sanctions relief.  The situation highlights ongoing tensions and challenges in peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aiming to overhaul U.S. elections, mandating documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration and requiring all ballots to be received by Election Day.

          <p>US Vice President JD Vance's visit to Greenland, initially planned to include his wife's cultural tour, has been scaled back to a visit to a US space base.  This follows criticism from Greenland's acting head of government and Denmark.  The revised plan reduces the risk of protests and de-escalates tensions regarding the US's interest in Greenland's security.</p>
