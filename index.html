          <p>German federal prosecutors have charged Farhad N., an Afghan national, with two counts of murder and 44 counts of attempted murder following a car attack in Munich. The incident, which occurred last February during a trade union demonstration, resulted in the deaths of a 37-year-old woman and her 12-year-old daughter, with many others severely injured. Prosecutors state that the suspect's motive was "excessive religious motivation," driven by a desire to kill Germans indiscriminately in response to the suffering of Muslims in other countries. The charges now await approval from the Higher Regional Court in Munich, bringing a legal step forward in this tragic event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. consumer confidence saw a modest dip in August, decreasing by 1.3 points to 97.4, primarily driven by growing anxiety over a weakening job market for the eighth straight month. The Conference Board's report also indicated a fall in Americans' short-term expectations for their income, business conditions, and the job market, with this measure remaining below 80, a level that can signal an impending recession. Additionally, consumers' evaluations of their current economic situation also declined slightly. This article highlights persistent economic unease, influenced by factors like tariffs and high prices, suggesting a cautious outlook among the populace. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Budget retailer Poundland has averted administration following High Court approval of a crucial turnaround plan, just days before it was projected to run out of cash. The restructuring includes a substantial £90 million investment from its private equity owner, Gordon Brothers, and a three-year extension for repaying £276.5 million in loans. The company, which operates around 800 stores and employs 14,700 staff, has faced a difficult retail and economic climate, reporting a £35.7 million pre-tax loss last year. This deal also entails rent reductions for many unprofitable stores, alongside previously announced closures and the cessation of online sales, aiming to secure its future operations.

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested that Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook's refusal to resign after President Donald Trump announced her firing supports claims of mortgage fraud against her. Lutnick, speaking on CNBC, implied that her defiance was indicative of guilt, stating, "Well, the crook always says 'I'm not going anywhere.'" Cook, who has not been charged, maintains Trump lacks the authority to fire her without legal cause and has hired an attorney to contest the ouster. The Justice Department is investigating allegations of false statements on mortgage applications, a situation that could escalate to the Supreme Court.</p>

Ibrahim, arrested at 15 for alleged rock-throwing, is reportedly suffering from scabies and significant weight loss in Ofer prison, notorious for child abuse allegations. The coalition, including the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, argues his detention violates the Fourth Geneva Convention and highlights the U.S. government's responsibility to protect all American children.

This trend, highlighted by Realtor.com, suggests a deadlock in the housing market, as sellers with favorable mortgage rates are unwilling to compromise on price despite increasing inventory. Experts attribute this to sellers' expectations, which were set during the pandemic's red-hot market, being slow to adjust to the current cooled conditions of high prices and mortgage rates.

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered a remarkably preserved Stone Age settlement submerged 26 feet below the Bay of Aarhus, Denmark, offering a "time capsule" into life 8,500 years ago. This find is part of a major international project to map lost Mesolithic landscapes, revealing insights into how early human populations adapted to rapid sea-level rise after the last ice age. Excavations have yielded animal bones, stone tools, and preserved wood, with researchers hoping for more fishing artifacts. The article notes that studying these ancient adaptations can provide valuable context for understanding today's climate change-driven sea-level increases.</p>
