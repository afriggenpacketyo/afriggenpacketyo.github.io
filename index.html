          <p>Beijing is preparing for a major military parade on September 3 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, which will showcase the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) most advanced weaponry. While the event's official theme is not Taiwan, analysts believe its subtext is clearly directed at the self-ruled island. The parade is expected to feature new hardware, including fifth-generation fighter jets and carrier-based aircraft, developed with a potential Taiwan conflict in mind. The display of military might serves as a powerful message of China's capabilities and intentions in the region.</p>

          <p>This article critiques the French film industry for its general failure to confront France's significant role in the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism. The author notes that French audiences often learn about slavery through American films like "12 Years a Slave" rather than domestic productions. While highlighting recent independent films like "No Chains No Masters" and "Fanon" that address these themes, the piece argues they remain marginalized. It calls for more mainstream French cinema to engage with this painful history, suggesting audiences are ready for these overdue narratives.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts forecast that China's yuan will continue to appreciate against the US dollar into 2025, building on its recent gains. The People's Bank of China has set the currency's reference rate at its strongest level in months, reflecting improved sentiment about China's economic resilience. According to Goldman Sachs, this trend is driven by China's macro data being stronger than feared and growing investor concerns about US government debt and fiscal policy. The investment bank predicts the yuan could break the 7 per dollar mark within six months. (not investment advice)</p>

Panelists noted that many dominant AI models are English-based, creating a need for systems tailored to different languages and cultures. They identified open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing as key tools for democratization, allowing countries to build their own AI ecosystems without relying solely on a few major tech companies.

          <p>A private survey of Chinese factory activity indicated a surprising return to growth in June, contrasting with official data that showed a contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI registered 50.4, beating expectations and suggesting improving conditions for the eighth time in nine months, particularly among export-oriented firms. Analysts attribute the divergence from official figures to differences in survey timing and company coverage, with some suggesting the positive result reflects a delayed response to a US-China tariff reduction. Despite the expansion, new export orders declined and business optimism weakened amid fierce market competition. (not investment advice)</p>

The freeze affects programs supporting teacher training, after-school activities, English language learners, and students from migrant families across the country, with California losing over $800 million. Education officials expressed shock, stating the move is illegal and will immediately harm students and disrupt school budgets that had already accounted for the funds.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law two significant bills aimed at speeding up housing construction by reforming the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The legislation, which exempts most urban housing projects from lengthy environmental reviews, was pushed through the legislature by tying it to the state budget. This move overcame opposition from some progressive lawmakers and labor unions who had concerns about the changes. Proponents hail the new laws as the most consequential housing reform in the state's recent history, potentially unlocking numerous stalled development projects to address California's housing crisis.</p>

          <h2>Canada Scraps Digital Services Tax on US Tech Firms Following Pressure from Trump Administration</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax on large U.S. technology companies after facing intense pressure from the Trump administration. The White House had labeled the tax a "blatant attack" and threatened retaliatory tariffs, leading to the cancellation of trade talks. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced the tax would be dropped as part of a "bigger negotiation," and trade discussions between the two countries have since resumed. The 3% tax would have affected giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google, and its removal is seen as a significant victory for the U.S. tech industry.</p>

          <p>The commander of U.S. Northern Command has reportedly requested that some of the California National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles be reassigned to help fight wildfires. The proposal suggests moving 200 of the roughly 4,000 Guard members to prepare for what is expected to be an early and active fire season. This development comes amid the controversial deployment ordered by President Trump to handle protests, a move opposed by California's governor. State officials had previously warned that the deployment could hamper wildfire response capabilities by tying up essential personnel and resources.</p>

This finding helps explain the molecular mechanism behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. It also suggests potential future anti-aging strategies that could simulate the effects of exercise by targeting this pathway, offering new insights into promoting longevity.</p>
