          <p>Federal authorities have charged a 22-year-old Oregon man with orchestrating extensive global cyberattacks using a powerful network he allegedly created. The "Rapper Bot" botnet, comprised of tens of thousands of infected devices like routers and DVRs, was reportedly rented out to clients to conduct disruptive denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against targets in over 80 countries. Law enforcement successfully dismantled the network and took the alleged operator into custody as part of an ongoing international effort to combat cybercrime infrastructures. The man faces a potential prison sentence of up to 10 years if convicted.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly expanded its steel and aluminum tariffs, applying them to over 400 additional product categories that contain or are made from these metals. This policy change, which affects a wide range of goods from construction materials to auto parts, is intended to prevent circumvention of the original levies and bolster domestic industries. The Commerce Department released the new list using customs codes, making it difficult for the public to immediately identify all affected items. Experts estimate this expansion dramatically increases the total value of imports impacted by the trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite having no criminal record, he faces removal proceedings after a 2014 ruling on a previous marriage, leaving him in a state of legal uncertainty. He is leaving behind his American wife and three children, viewing self-deportation as the safest option to prevent being sent to a detention center while his case remains unresolved.

          <p>During a Philadelphia Phillies baseball game, former player and current color commentator John Kruk sparked a philosophical discussion on air. He mused about the invention of the first clock, asking his broadcast partner how its creator could have possibly known the correct time to set it. The question led to a brief on-air conversation about historical timekeeping methods, such as the sundial, providing a moment of lighthearted curiosity during the game. The article notes Kruk's penchant for asking such thought-provoking questions, which adds a unique element to his sports commentary and engages viewers beyond the action on the field.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock increased after the company reaffirmed its full-year sales forecast, even though its second-quarter earnings and revenue slightly missed Wall Street's expectations. The home improvement retailer noted that while homeowners still exhibit a "deferral mindset" regarding large projects due to economic uncertainty, it saw positive momentum with a rise in big-ticket transactions. The company's comparable sales grew for the second time in the last eleven quarters, indicating some recovery. Home Depot's outlook does not factor in potential interest rate cuts, which could further stimulate homebuying and renovation activity later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following high-profile summits with Russian and European leaders, President Trump's goal of brokering peace in Ukraine faces significant obstacles. While Trump has shown openness to providing U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, a key demand from Kyiv and its allies, the specifics of such a commitment remain vague. A major challenge is the uncertainty surrounding whether President Putin genuinely desires an end to the conflict, as Russia continues to make battlefield gains. The article suggests that European leaders are attempting to manage Trump's mercurial nature while navigating a complex geopolitical landscape where the American president has the least at stake compared to the primary belligerents.</p>

Furthermore, the piece suggests that Russia's apparent concession on security guarantees is a tactic to buy time for its aggression while complicating negotiations among Western allies.

          <p>Shares of artificial intelligence software company Palantir fell for a fifth straight day, continuing a pullback from the all-time highs reached earlier in the month. The stock has declined over 15% during this period, following a strong earnings report that marked its first-ever $1 billion revenue quarter. Despite the recent slump, Palantir remains one of the top performers in the S&P 500 for the year, having more than doubled in value amid AI enthusiasm and new government contracts. The rapid ascent has also led to a very high valuation, with its forward price-to-earnings ratio soaring past that of major tech giants. (not investment advice)</p>

A committee spokesperson confirmed the files will be made public after a thorough review to redact victim information and any material that could compromise ongoing investigations.

Visitors were evacuated from the area, and the motive for the attack remains under investigation. The search for the suspect is ongoing, with law enforcement actively combing the park grounds.</p>

His detention comes amid an ongoing immigration crackdown in the region, prompting the Los Angeles Unified School District to reaffirm that its schools are safe spaces for all students regardless of immigration status.

          <p>Gunmen attacked a mosque in Nigeria's Katsina state during morning prayers, killing at least 13 people and injuring others. Local authorities believe the assault was a retaliatory act after residents in the town of Unguwan Mantau had recently ambushed and killed several members of an armed group. For years, criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, have terrorized rural communities in northwestern and central Nigeria, conducting raids, kidnappings for ransom, and looting. The violence, which originated from land disputes, has evolved into organized crime, creating widespread insecurity in the region. Security forces have been deployed to the area to prevent further attacks.</p>

According to industry forecasts, overall spending may decline slightly compared to last year, with budget-conscious consumers trading down to off-price and online stores.

          <p>Ridership on the Los Angeles Metro bus system continued to decline in July, following a sharp drop in June that coincided with federal immigration raids across the county. While rail ridership saw a slight recovery, the bus system, which serves a majority Latino ridership, has not bounced back. The transit agency acknowledges a historical seasonal dip in summer but also notes that fears of being targeted by immigration enforcement may be a contributing factor. This sustained drop in passengers presents a challenge for Metro as it grapples with pre-existing financial deficits and strives to maintain ridership growth, which is critical for its long-term stability.</p>

          <p>S&P Global has maintained its AA+ credit rating for long-term U.S. sovereign debt, citing an expectation that revenue from President Trump's tariff policies will largely offset the fiscal impact of his recent tax-and-spending legislation. The rating agency anticipates that the significant income from tariffs will counteract the weaker revenue resulting from the new law, which includes both tax cuts and spending reductions. However, S&P warned that it could lower the rating in the future if deficits increase due to an inability to contain spending or if political developments weaken U.S. institutions or the Federal Reserve's independence.
