Additionally, the article mentions Trump's pressure on law firms for donations and corporate settlements benefiting his museum. The article suggests that these actions reflect a pattern of leveraging the presidency for personal gain, raising serious concerns about corruption and the erosion of public trust.</p>

Trump stated that Ciattarelli has gone 'ALL IN' and would work closely with the Trump administration to grow the economy, cut taxes, secure the border, and stop migrant crime. Ciattarelli responded on X, expressing his honor at receiving the endorsement and promising to unite the party and make New Jersey affordable and safe again. The endorsement comes after Ciattarelli was once a harsh Trump critic, but seems to have changed his stance since those comments.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan has placed India in a difficult position, as it has long opposed third-party intervention. Trump announced a ceasefire brokered by the US after clashes between the two countries.

The article notes that India's government has not formally responded to Trump's offer, but the Foreign Minister's statement indicates a firm stance against terrorism.</p>

          <p>An auction of the Riggio family art collection at Christie's in New York proved anticlimactic, signaling caution in the art market amid economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs.

While the collection totaled $272 million, the auction lacked the enthusiastic bidding seen in 2022.

          <h2>House Republicans Propose Sharp Restrictions on Food Stamps, Potentially Affecting Millions</h2>

          <p>House Republicans proposed sharp restrictions on the federal anti-hunger program known as food stamps (SNAP), seeking to limit its funding and benefits as part of a broader package to advance President Trump's tax cuts. The proposal would require states to supply some funding for food stamps and force more beneficiaries to obtain employment. The moves could result in millions of low-income families losing access to the program. Republicans argue that their approach would improve the provision of food stamp benefits while helping to defray the cost of Mr. Trumpâ€™s legislative ambitions.</p>

          <p>A shortage of air traffic controllers at the facility guiding planes to and from Newark Liberty International Airport caused significant flight delays. The Federal Aviation Administration said that as few as three controllers were scheduled to work, far fewer than the target of 14. The staffing crisis added strain to an already troubled aviation system, with flights delayed by as much as seven hours. The article notes that the F.A.A. moved the management of Newarkâ€™s air traffic to Philadelphia in hopes of hiring more controllers, but the relocation angered some controllers.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is launching an emergency task force and considering temporary flight reductions at Newark Liberty International Airport to ensure safety. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed recent telecommunications issues on the previous Biden administration, claiming they mishandled a move of air traffic control from New York to Philadelphia. The task force comprises experts from the FAA, Verizon, and L3Harris. Duffy also noted that the telecoms system's age contributed to recent issues and that the FAA has replaced copper lines with fiber lines at Newark, LaGuardia, and JFK airports.</p>
