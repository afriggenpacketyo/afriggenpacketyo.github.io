          <p>U.S. prosecutors have formally requested that a federal judge sentence music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs to more than 11 years in prison. This recommendation follows his July conviction for arranging prostitution-related activities across state lines. The filing included letters from accusers, such as singer Cassie Ventura, detailing the severe and lasting trauma caused by his abuse and control. Combs' defense team has argued for a much shorter sentence of 14 months, claiming he has changed while incarcerated, but prosecutors described him as unrepentant.</p>

          <p>The United States government is on the verge of a shutdown as funding is set to expire without a new spending bill agreed upon by Republicans and Democrats. The primary disagreement centers on healthcare policy, with Democrats demanding the extension of health insurance tax credits and opposing cuts to federal health agencies. If a deal is not reached, non-essential government services, such as national park operations and food assistance programs, could be halted. This standoff is particularly tense given the Trump administration's recent significant reductions in the federal workforce.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and his ministers are holding a cabinet retreat in Berlin to address pressing national issues and improve coalition unity after a difficult start. The main agenda focuses on boosting Germany's economic competitiveness by cutting bureaucratic red tape and reducing the size of the federal workforce. This meeting comes as public satisfaction with the ruling conservative-Social Democrat coalition has reached a record low. The government aims to adopt a modernization agenda to quickly deliver results for struggling German companies.</p>

          <p>A critical meeting between President Donald Trump and congressional leaders failed to produce a deal to avert an impending government shutdown, with both sides appearing to solidify their positions. Vice President JD Vance stated a shutdown seems likely, blaming Democrats for their demands related to healthcare subsidies. Democratic leaders confirmed that significant differences remain. The impasse is intensified by political calculations, as Republicans believe Democrats will be blamed, while Democrats see healthcare as a winning issue to rally their base.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for governing religious affairs more strictly in accordance with the law, framing it as essential for national harmony and stability. During a Politburo study session, he emphasized that promoting the "sinicisation" of religions—adapting them to Chinese political and cultural norms—is the only path forward. This involves enhancing relevant laws, conducting widespread legal education, and enforcing strict compliance. The move signals a continued tightening of state control over religious expression and practices within the country.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly shooting at an ICE field office in Dallas, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered several federal law enforcement agencies to help protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. In a memo, she directed agents from the FBI, DEA, and ATF to defend ICE personnel and property from what she termed "extreme political violence." Bondi also announced the formation of a temporary task force and specifically mentioned operations in Portland and Chicago. The move comes as ICE reports a spike in attacks on its agents during a period of intensified immigration enforcement.</p>

          <h2>German Coalition Faces Internal Divisions Over Budget, Taxes, and Social Policy</h2>

          <p>Germany's ruling coalition, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, is grappling with significant internal disagreements on key policy issues as public satisfaction plummets. The center-right CDU/CSU and the center-left SPD are at odds over the national budget, with conservatives pushing for austerity while the SPD favors tax increases on wealth. Other points of contention include the future of the "citizen's income" welfare program, pension reform, and immigration policy. The government is hoping its current cabinet retreat can help bridge these divides and restore public trust.</p>

          <p>A Black woman who was knocked unconscious by Solano County sheriff's deputies during a 2020 traffic stop has reached a $17 million settlement. Nakia Porter had pulled over to switch drivers with her father when deputies approached, drew their guns, and slammed her to the ground while handcuffing her. The entire incident, which occurred in front of her three young children, was captured on body camera footage. Porter was jailed overnight but never charged, and her lawsuit accused the deputies of using excessive force and violating her civil rights.</p>

          <p>Police in Morocco have detained dozens of people as they moved to suppress youth-led protests calling for improved education and healthcare systems. The demonstrations, organized by anonymous online youth networks, have occurred in several major cities, including Rabat and Casablanca. Protesters have expressed frustration that the government is investing in stadiums for the 2030 World Cup while neglecting essential public services. Human rights groups have condemned the arrests, viewing them as a crackdown on freedom of expression amid growing public discontent over social inequality.</p>

          <h2>Cultural Institutions in Germany Face a Backlash Against Diversity Initiatives</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-30 00:00:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that a strategic, right-wing-influenced backlash against diversity is growing within Germany's cultural sector. After a period of progress following movements like Black Lives Matter, many institutions are now retreating from commitments to inclusion, often under the guise of budget cuts or a return to "neutrality." The author contends that this is not just fatigue but a deliberate effort to sideline marginalized voices, fueled by far-right rhetoric framing diversity as "ideological indoctrination." This trend threatens to reverse recent gains in representation and artistic complexity.</p>

          <p>Major grocery chains in China, including Walmart and Alibaba's Freshippo, are revamping their stores to emulate the successful model of discount retailers like Aldi. They are reducing clutter and focusing on developing their own private-label brands to offer quality products at lower prices. This strategic shift is a response to a change in consumer behavior, as a slowing economy has made shoppers more frugal and value-oriented. The move aims to reverse a slump in sales and win back customers who are increasingly sensitive to prices.</p>
