        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Japanese retailer Seven & i Holdings plunged over 9% after Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard withdrew its $47 billion takeover offer. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i as the reason for terminating the bid. In response, Seven & i expressed disappointment and disagreed with what it called inaccurate statements from the Canadian firm. Analysts suggest that the deal's failure may be attributed to "Japanese protectionism," as the company is considered a core national asset.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell by 0.5% in June year-over-year, marking the second straight month of decline and raising fears of a potential recession. The drop was driven by decreased shipments to major partners like the U.S. and China, with the crucial auto sector being hit particularly hard by a new 25% U.S. tariff. Economists had expected a slight rise in exports, but the ongoing trade dispute continues to weigh heavily on Japan's export-dependent economy, which already contracted in the first quarter of the year.

          <p>The Justice Department has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, from her position at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. Comey was a lead prosecutor in several high-profile cases, including those against Sean "Diddy" Combs, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Jeffrey Epstein. According to sources, the dismissal memo cited the president's executive powers under Article 2 of the Constitution, intensifying speculation about the political motivations behind the termination.</p>

          <p>A major 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck about 50 miles south of Sand Point, Alaska, which initially prompted a tsunami warning for the region. The warning was later downgraded to an advisory and then fully canceled as authorities determined there was no threat of large, widespread waves. Residents in some coastal towns like Seward had evacuated to higher ground as a precaution, but no significant damage or injuries were reported from the seismic event in the active Pacific "Ring of Fire."</p>

          <p>While hosting the ESPYs, comedian Shane Gillis made a controversial joke targeting Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark during his opening monologue. Gillis suggested that after retiring from the WNBA, Clark would work at a Waffle House to continue "fist-fighting Black women," a remark that received polite laughter from the audience. Clark was not in attendance at the awards ceremony, as she was being evaluated for an injury she sustained during a recent game against the Connecticut Sun.</p>

          <h2>Twenty States Sue Trump Administration Over Cuts to Disaster Mitigation Program</h2>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for unlawfully terminating the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The lawsuit argues that the administration overstepped its authority by cutting the FEMA-run program, which provides federal funds for projects designed to mitigate the impact of natural disasters. The states claim the termination threatens critical infrastructure projects and leaves communities more vulnerable, particularly as hundreds of projects were already in development.</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit filed by investors against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other executives has begun, seeking to hold them accountable for the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal. The plaintiffs allege the company failed to disclose the risks of user data misuse and violated a 2012 FTC consent order, leading to over $8 billion in fines and legal costs. The lawsuit demands that Zuckerberg and others reimburse Meta for these financial losses, with both Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg expected to testify.</p>

          <p>In a direct contrast to President Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence has called for the administration to release all files related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. Pence emphasized the need for transparency but stressed that the names of victims should be protected from disclosure. His call comes as Trump has dismissed the entire matter as a politically motivated "hoax" run by Democrats. This public disagreement highlights a significant split within the Republican party on how to handle the controversial case.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's justification for clawing back nearly $8 billion in foreign aid, citing "waste, fraud and abuse," is being questioned by former officials and aid experts. Former USAID Inspector General Paul Martin and others state the administration has provided little evidence for these claims, suggesting the cuts are politically motivated. Critics allege that programs were targeted based on keywords like "gender" or "climate" rather than effectiveness, undermining lifesaving humanitarian efforts and dismantling the agency's oversight capabilities.

The preliminary report from India's accident investigation bureau confirmed the switches were moved but did not assign blame, noting both pilots denied doing so.</p>

          <p>Families in the UK are facing rising childcare costs, with a six-week summer holiday club now averaging £1,076 per child, according to the charity Coram. Prices have increased due to high demand and a shortage of more affordable council-run options, with some regions seeing hikes of up to 13% since last year. The rising expense poses a significant financial burden for working parents who rely on these services, especially since many must pay the high costs upfront before receiving any government benefits.</p>
