          <p>Search operations are in their sixth day in Central Texas for over 170 people missing after catastrophic flash floods. The death toll has surpassed 120, with Kerr County being the most severely affected area, particularly a girls' summer camp where numerous campers and staff died. A federal disaster has been declared, enabling FEMA support, but ongoing storms are complicating rescue efforts. The disaster has prompted scrutiny over the adequacy of weather warnings and the impact of federal budget cuts on forecasting capabilities.</p>

          <p>A man and two young children were killed after record-breaking flash floods devastated the village of Ruidoso, New Mexico. The Rio Ruidoso crested at over 20 feet, five feet higher than the previous record, after intense monsoonal rains fell on recent wildfire burn scars. Over 65 people were rescued, and an estimated 35 to 50 homes were damaged or destroyed. Officials noted that while a multi-alert system was in place, the flood's onset was extremely rapid, and the threat of more rain remains.</p>

          <p>Former New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning has stated he is no longer pursuing a minority ownership stake in the team, primarily because it has become too expensive. With NFL team valuations soaring, Manning noted that even a small percentage of a franchise valued at $10 billion is a significant financial commitment. He also cited potential conflicts of interest with his media work, including the "ManningCast" on ESPN, as a contributing factor. Manning remains involved with the organization in an advisory capacity.</p>

          <p>The removal of Christian Horner as Red Bull's team principal follows a period of significant internal turmoil and declining performance for the Formula 1 team. His departure is attributed to a combination of factors, including a power struggle following the death of Red Bull's co-owner, the controversial exit of star designer Adrian Newey, and questionable driver management decisions. The team's recent struggles on the track, with star driver Max Verstappen's future in doubt, culminated in the decision to release Horner from his duties after two decades.</p>

          <p>Following the passage of President Trump's major legislative package, Congressional Republicans are now determining their agenda for the remainder of the term. Immediate priorities include a "rescissions" bill to cancel previously appropriated spending, though it faces a narrow path in both chambers. The most significant upcoming challenge is funding the government and avoiding a shutdown this fall, which will likely require Democratic support in the Senate. Republicans are also pursuing further investigations into the previous administration and considering another reconciliation bill for additional fiscal measures.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has changed its visa policy for Nigerian citizens, replacing the previous five-year, multiple-entry visitor visas with single-entry visas valid for only three months.

The change significantly alters travel accessibility for Nigerians, who received nearly one-fifth of all non-immigrant visas issued by the U.S. in Africa in 2024. The policy shift occurs as President Trump hosts leaders from five other African nations to discuss trade.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against California's Department of Education and its interscholastic sports foundation, alleging their policies on transgender athletes violate federal civil rights law. The complaint argues that allowing transgender girls to compete in girls' sports is illegal and creates a hostile environment that denies equal opportunities. This legal action follows threats from the administration after a transgender student won two state high school track-and-field events. The administration contends the state's policies are unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause, a claim California officials are expected to contest.</p>

He was then seen on vacation in Greece as the flooding began, a situation that drew parallels to his 2021 trip to Cancun during a winter storm. Cruz has defended his position, calling criticism "partisan finger pointing," while critics argue the funding cuts weakened systems designed to protect the public from such events.</p>

Despite these advances, the pace remains slow, and Ukrainian forces are offering stiff resistance, bogging down Russian troops in border villages. Military observers believe Russia's strategy is to stretch Ukrainian defenses thin across the long front line, but it is coming at the cost of extremely high casualties.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump will significantly change the federal student loan system, making college potentially more expensive and harder to finance for many. The law eliminates popular income-driven repayment plans like the SAVE plan, replacing them with a single, potentially costlier option. It also introduces new borrowing caps for graduate and professional degrees, which may not be sufficient to cover the full cost of programs like medical or law school. Experts warn these changes could push students toward private loans with higher interest rates or create barriers to accessing advanced education. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has recorded its most severe measles outbreak since 1992, with over 1,288 cases confirmed this year and three deaths. The spread is attributed to declining childhood vaccination rates, creating a "new reality" where a once-eliminated disease is a growing threat. With summer camps and travel increasing transmission opportunities, the CDC is urging vigilance. The situation is compounded by a more lax approach to vaccination promotion from the Trump administration, prompting public health experts to emphasize that the MMR vaccine remains the safest and most effective protection against the dangerous virus.</p>

          <p>President Trump's stated intention to name a "shadow chair" for the Federal Reserve is raising concerns about the central bank's political independence and the credibility of its future leadership. The strategy aims to pressure current Chair Jerome Powell into cutting interest rates to lower government debt-servicing costs, a departure from the Fed's traditional mandate of managing inflation and employment. Experts warn that this could create market uncertainty and saddle Powell's successor with the perception that they were appointed to do the president's political bidding, potentially undermining the institution's integrity.

          <p>Colorado State University researchers are predicting an above-average Atlantic hurricane season for 2025, with 16 named storms, eight hurricanes, and three major hurricanes expected. The forecast attributes the heightened activity primarily to warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures, though it is expected to be less intense than the 2024 season. While weak La Niña conditions are currently present, they are expected to transition to neutral, removing a factor that often suppresses hurricane formation. This annual forecast is a critical tool for coastal communities to prepare for the season, which officially begins on June 1.</p>
