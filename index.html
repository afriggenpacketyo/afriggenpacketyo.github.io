            <p>Chinese fabric trader Jim Xie faced payment issues from a Syrian buyer after shifting focus from dwindling US sales to the Middle East. His experience highlights the challenges faced by Chinese traders who are increasingly turning to riskier emerging markets in search of new business opportunities. These traders often encounter unreliable buyers who set up temporary trading companies, making it difficult to recover payments. The shift towards emerging markets reflects the growing pressure on Chinese businesses to find alternative sources of revenue amid trade tensions and declining sales in traditional markets.

Governor Jenniffer González acknowledged the severity of the situation, estimating daily revenue losses of $230 million due to the blackout. The incident highlights the vulnerability of Puerto Rico's aging infrastructure and the urgent need for investment in renewable energy sources to prevent future disruptions.</p>

            <p>The NHS is facing pressure to revise its gender policies after the UK Supreme Court ruled that the term "woman" in the Equality Act refers to biological sex. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is set to issue updated guidelines for public services, including the NHS, to ensure compliance with the ruling. This decision could impact access to single-sex spaces and services, potentially requiring the creation of "third spaces" for transgender individuals. The EHRC has indicated it will pursue legal action against the NHS if it fails to update its policies accordingly, sparking debate about the rights and protections of both transgender and cisgender individuals.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is proposing a rule change that would significantly weaken the Endangered Species Act by narrowly defining "harm" to exclude habitat destruction. This change would make it easier to log, mine, and build on lands crucial for endangered species' survival. Conservation experts warn that this could reverse conservation gains and lead to further species decline. The proposal is based on a dissenting opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, who argued that "take" should be interpreted literally, requiring direct harm to individual animals, not indirect harm through habitat modification.</p>

            <p>Goldman Sachs estimates that US$370 billion in Chinese firms’ American depositary receipts (ADRs) are at risk if the US severs market ties with China.

This warning comes amid escalating trade tensions between the US and China, raising concerns about the delisting risk for Chinese companies and potential financial decoupling. Goldman Sachs predicts a possible US$2.5 trillion sell-off in stocks and bonds in both markets if financial ties are severed. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>China is retaliating against U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs by targeting the American services sector and other areas, after deeming further tariff hikes on goods as "meaningless." Beijing is employing non-tariff measures, including widening export controls of rare-earth minerals and opening antitrust probes into American companies. The latest move involves ordering Chinese airlines to halt further deliveries of Boeing jets and restrict purchases of aircraft-related equipment from U.S. companies. These actions signal a broader decoupling of the two economies, with Beijing leveraging various levers to inflict pain on U.S. companies.</p>

A growing narrative suggests that social media and overdiagnosis are contributing to the rise in reported disabilities.
