          <h2>Federal Courts Face Scrutiny Over Venue Shopping for Nationwide Injunctions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 23:12:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News analysis reveals that lawyers are increasingly engaging in venue shopping, seeking out federal jurisdictions with judges sympathetic to their views on divisive political issues, with conservatives often filing challenges to the Biden administration in small Texas courts. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should be able to dictate policy for the entire country through nationwide injunctions. Experts argue that while forum shopping is inevitable, judge shopping is problematic because litigants know exactly which judge they will get, potentially undermining the impartiality of the court system. The Judicial Conference has recommended a random case-assignment policy to limit the practice.</p>

          <p>Cassie Ventura faced intense cross-examination in Sean "Diddy" Combs' sexual assault trial, with defense attorneys presenting text messages to challenge her credibility and portray her as a willing participant in their sexual activities. The defense argued that Combs, while admitting to mistakes and domestic violence, never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone. Ventura acknowledged loving Combs for over a decade and hoping for a future with him, but testified that his personality changed over time, becoming violent and jealous. The trial also explored Ventura's participation in "freak-offs," with defense attorneys suggesting she willingly engaged in these activities.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp fall in exports, according to preliminary government data. The GDP data was worse than expected, with exports falling 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, influenced by uncertainties stemming from U.S. trade policies. Despite the contraction, domestic demand showed a "bright spot," growing by 0.6%, and the Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current stance on interest rates, anticipating a "reasonable deal with the U.S." to mitigate the tariff impact. The Bank of Japan also warned of downside risks to the economy from U.S. trade policy, but seems set to continue raising its policy rate.</p>

Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson stated that the agency is about 80-85% prepared and is working to close the gap, emphasizing a focus on safeguarding the American people and strengthening state capabilities.

          <p>China is experiencing the world's fastest rise in dementia cases, with projections estimating up to 115 million cases by 2050, according to research published in PLOS One.

Researchers analyzed data from the Global Burden of Disease database and found that dementia incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates have doubled globally between 1990 and 2021, but tripled in China during the same period.</p>

          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is under threat due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in crab fishing ropes, leading to injuries and deaths. To mitigate this, some fishermen are using high-tech systems involving remote-controlled pop-up devices to retrieve crab cages, reducing the amount of rope needed. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has shortened the crab season to protect whales, and is sponsoring experiments with the pop-up technology. While some fishermen are critical of the new technology due to tradition and cost, others have found it effective in preventing whale entanglements.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Weighs Limits on Birthright Citizenship and Presidential Power</h2>

          <p>The US Supreme Court is considering the constitutionality of President Trump's attempt to limit birthright citizenship through an executive order denying citizenship to babies born in the US to non-citizen parents. The court is also examining whether to narrow the scope of "nationwide injunctions" issued by federal judges, which the Justice Department argues unfairly tie the president's hands. The case stems from Trump's January executive order that would deny US citizenship to babies born on American soil if their parents aren’t citizens or permanent residents.</p>

          <p>New clinical testing requirements for vaccines may delay the availability of updated COVID and flu shots this fall, potentially limiting recommendations to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has stated that substantial updates to existing vaccines may require additional clinical evaluation, including seasonal strain changes, possibly impacting the availability of these vaccines. Some experts fear that the new federal limits are just the first steps in a campaign to undermine the use of all vaccines, including those in the childhood immunization schedule, by raising doubts about their safety and imposing requirements that make it untenable for companies to keep making them.</p>

          <p>An audit in Maryland found that medical examiners miscategorized dozens of deaths that occurred in police custody over the past two decades, with at least 36 deaths that should have been classified as homicides being labeled as accidental or natural. The report indicates evidence of racism and pro-police bias, with medical examiners less likely to call a death a homicide if the deceased was Black or had died after being restrained by police officers. The audit was prompted by the police killing of George Floyd and raised questions about the objectivity of the state's medical examiner's office.</p>
