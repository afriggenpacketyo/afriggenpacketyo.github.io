          <p>Alaska Airlines is expanding its international routes with new daily flights from Seattle to London and Reykjavik, Iceland, scheduled to begin next May. This expansion follows the airline's acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines and is part of a broader strategy to establish at least twelve intercontinental nonstops from its Seattle hub. To mark this growth, the carrier also unveiled a new livery for its Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, featuring colors inspired by the northern lights. These new routes add to previously announced services to Rome and Seoul, intensifying competition with other major airlines.</p>

          <p>Smoke from over 700 wildfires burning across Canada and the western United States has triggered air quality alerts in ten states, from Minnesota to Connecticut. Canadian fires have already consumed over 16 million acres this year, making it the third most destructive season on record. In the U.S., red flag warnings are active in several western states due to dry, windy conditions that could exacerbate fire development. The article also notes ongoing flood watches in Georgia and Alabama and a persistent heatwave in the Southwest, painting a picture of widespread extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>A new poll for the New Jersey governor's race shows Democrat Mikie Sherrill with a six-point lead over Republican Jack Ciattarelli, 48% to 42%, ahead of the November election. The race is considered a key indicator for the 2026 midterm elections. Affordability and taxes are the top issues for voters, with Ciattarelli seen as stronger on taxes and Sherrill favored for creating economic opportunities. The poll also reflects voter sentiment on national politics, with a majority of respondents believing the Republican Party is too focused on catering to former President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has asserted that India has the sovereign right to select its own trade partners, intervening in a dispute with the United States. This statement comes after President Trump threatened to impose significant tariffs on India for purchasing discounted Russian oil and allegedly reselling it for profit. The conflict highlights the growing trade relationship between Russia and India since 2022, with India becoming a major importer of Russian crude oil despite Western sanctions aimed at Moscow. India has responded to U.S. criticism by accusing Western nations of hypocrisy.</p>

This shift away from broad immunization could leave the population more vulnerable and make future waves more severe.

          <p>On its 100th anniversary, Virginia Woolf's novel "Mrs. Dalloway" is being celebrated as a profound exploration of the midlife crisis. The article argues that the novel, written when Woolf herself was entering middle age, masterfully captures the formlessness and transformative nature of this life stage through its protagonist, Clarissa Dalloway. As Clarissa prepares for a party, she reflects on past choices, present realities, and future uncertainties, grappling with feelings of being both young and aged. The novel's enduring power lies in its stream-of-consciousness style, which intertwines past and present to explore the existential questions of a life half-lived.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has raised its full-year adjusted profit guidance, signaling confidence in its performance and the success of its ongoing cost-cutting initiatives. The pharmaceutical giant also reported second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by strong revenue from its COVID-19 products and other key drugs. The updated outlook accounts for potential impacts from President Trump's calls for lower drug prices and planned tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. The positive results reflect the company's efforts to navigate a post-pandemic market and streamline operations to boost shareholder value.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mike Flood of Nebraska was met with a hostile and vocal crowd during a town hall in Lincoln. Attendees repeatedly shouted and booed as he attempted to defend his vote for a major policy and tax bill signed into law by President Donald Trump. The audience expressed anger over the bill's impact on healthcare, particularly Medicaid, and tax provisions, chanting "Tax the Rich!" Flood argued the bill was a middle-class tax cut and that changes to Medicaid would not affect the disabled or elderly, but he failed to placate the frustrated constituents.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has informed a federal judge that much of the information in the grand jury transcripts from the Ghislaine Maxwell investigation is already public knowledge. In a court filing supporting the unsealing of the documents, the DOJ provided an annotated version showing that most testimony was revealed at trial or otherwise publicly reported. The filing is part of a move to unseal transcripts from both the Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein cases. So far, the government is not seeking to release grand jury exhibits but is still considering its position on that matter.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have Democratic state lawmakers arrested and returned to the legislature after they fled the state to block a vote on a controversial redistricting plan. At least 51 Democrats left Texas, denying Republicans the quorum needed to pass the bill, which would likely give the GOP more congressional seats. Abbott instructed state law enforcement to locate and arrest any members who left, escalating a political standoff over voting rights and gerrymandering. The Democrats' move temporarily halts a plan sought by former President Donald Trump to redraw the state's congressional maps.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has provisionally fined former star fund manager Neil Woodford and his firm a total of nearly £46 million for their roles in the 2019 collapse of the Woodford Equity Income Fund. The collapse impacted approximately 300,000 investors who were unable to withdraw their money. The FCA found that Woodford and his firm made unreasonable investment decisions that increased the fund's illiquidity, disadvantaging remaining investors. Woodford, who denies the findings, has been banned from senior management roles and is appealing the decision.</p>

          <p>The U.S. space agency NASA is fast-tracking its plans to develop and place a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030, a key step toward establishing a permanent human presence. The move is seen by some as a response to similar ambitions from China and Russia, raising concerns that the project is driven by geopolitical competition rather than purely scientific goals. While many scientists agree nuclear power is the most viable option for a continuous energy source on the lunar surface, the ambitious timeline and recent NASA budget cuts have cast doubt on the plan's feasibility.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a narrow ruling that prevents a new Arkansas law requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms from being enforced in four specific school districts. The challenge was brought by families who argue the law violates the constitutional separation of church and state. In his decision, the judge assailed the law as part of a coordinated strategy to inject Christian doctrine into public schools. This ruling is the latest development in a broader legal battle over similar laws recently passed in other Republican-led states like Texas and Louisiana.</p>

          <p>A coalition of non-profits, tribes, and local governments is suing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reinstate a $3 billion climate program that was terminated by the Trump administration. The Environmental and Climate Justice (ECJ) block grant program, created by the Inflation Reduction Act, was designed to help disadvantaged communities address environmental hazards and improve climate resilience. The lawsuit argues that the administration's decision to terminate the congressionally mandated program was unconstitutional and unlawful. This first-of-its-kind class action seeks to force the EPA to unfreeze the funds and restore the initiative for all 349 selected grant recipients.</p>

          <p>The contentious July jobs report, which showed weaker-than-expected payroll growth and significant downward revisions for previous months, has confirmed that the U.S. economy is slowing sharply. With the three-month average for job gains plummeting, economists are raising concerns about elevated recession risks, though a full-blown recession is not yet the consensus forecast. The slowdown is attributed to factors like the impact of tariffs on consumer spending and business investment. Despite the worrying signs, White House officials remain optimistic, while markets are increasingly pricing in a potential interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>
