Employees like Richard Flanagan, a second-generation worker, and Staff Sgt. Genelle Marte, a returning native, express immense pride in supporting the Navy's mission from their hometown. As the city prepares to celebrate the 250th birthdays of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, the staff's connection to the community highlights the installation's significant, though often unseen, local presence and impact.</p>

          <p>A government shutdown is causing significant air travel disruptions as understaffed air traffic control facilities experience a rise in sick calls from controllers forced to work without pay. On Monday, several airports were affected, with California's Burbank Airport tower closing for several hours due to a complete lack of staff. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy acknowledged the financial strain on these essential workers, warning that safety protocols might require further flight reductions if staffing shortages continue. The situation has also sparked political disputes, with officials blaming opposing parties for the shutdown's impact.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that not all furloughed federal employees may receive back pay once the current government shutdown ends, stating, "it depends on who we're talking about." This comment aligns with a draft White House memo suggesting that a 2019 law guaranteeing such pay is not automatic and requires specific congressional appropriation. Critics and federal employee unions argue this is a misinterpretation of the law and a political tactic to pressure Democrats. Trump also suggested some workers "don't deserve to be taken care of," adding to the uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of federal employees.</p>

          <p>The price of gold reached a new record high on Tuesday, exceeding $4,000 per ounce, continuing a significant upward trend driven by inflation and geopolitical instability. For potential investors who feel they missed the opportunity, the article suggests several affordable entry points into the market before prices potentially climb higher. These strategies include purchasing fractional gold bars and coins, employing a dollar-cost averaging approach to build a position over time, and exploring alternative investments like gold IRAs or ETFs. Experts predict prices could continue to rise into 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has announced it will appeal a judge's decision to dismiss a terrorism-related case against Liam Og Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap. The charge, which stemmed from allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah at a London concert, was thrown out due to a technical error regarding the timing of prosecution consent. In a statement, Kneecap condemned the appeal as "political policing" and a waste of resources, linking it to a broader "witch-hunt against Palestinian solidarity." The CPS maintains the appeal is necessary to clarify an important point of law.</p>

          <p>In the Georgia election interference case against former President Donald Trump and his co-defendants, state prosecutors have requested a 90-day extension to find a replacement for District Attorney Fani Willis. The Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, tasked with the appointment, cited the case's complexity and a massive case file that has yet to be transferred as reasons for the delay. This request follows Willis's permanent removal from the case due to an "appearance of impropriety" over her relationship with a special prosecutor she hired. The new prosecutor will have the authority to continue, alter, or dismiss the charges entirely.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings' undrafted rookie Myles Price has made an immediate impact as the team's primary kick and punt returner through the first five games of his NFL career. Price, who recently got his first passport for the team's trip to Europe, expresses confidence that he is on the verge of returning a kick for a touchdown every time he touches the ball. He detailed his preparation process, which involves studying opposing punters and focusing on tracking the ball in the air to ensure optimal positioning. Despite his success in college as a receiver, he is still seeking his first-ever return touchdown.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a historic high of $4,000 an ounce, driven by investor fears of a recession and broader market uncertainty, creating significant pressure on jewelry companies. Retailers that aim to offer affordable fine jewelry, such as Mejuri and Pandora, are being forced to raise prices or innovate with alternative materials like 10-karat gold to absorb the increased costs. Industry leaders express concern over the metal's volatility, noting that the price surge is not driven by consumer demand for jewelry but by investors hoarding gold as a "fear indicator." This trend signals potential trouble for the broader economy.</p>

          <p>A new study proposes the unsettling possibility that a massive earthquake on the Cascadia subduction zone could trigger a major quake on the northern San Andreas fault within minutes, days, or years. Researchers analyzing ancient submarine landslide deposits found evidence suggesting this one-two punch has happened multiple times over the last 2,500 years, including around the year 1700. This hypothesis challenges the conventional view of these two fault systems as separate threats. If correct, the West Coast could face two catastrophic events nearly simultaneously, overwhelming emergency response resources and compounding the devastation across a vast region.</p>

          <p>Orlando Bravo, co-founder of private equity firm Thoma Bravo, has stated that valuations in the artificial intelligence sector are currently "at a bubble," drawing parallels to the dot-com era. He cautioned that it is unsustainable to value a company with $50 million in annual recurring revenue at $10 billion, as it would require immense, and often unrealistic, future cash flow to provide a return for investors. However, Bravo noted a key difference from the dot-com collapse: today's AI boom is being financed by large, established companies with healthy balance sheets, which provides a different financial foundation for the burgeoning industry.

          <p>The Trump administration is considering denying back pay to some furloughed federal workers, a move that appears to contradict a 2019 law guaranteeing compensation after government shutdowns. A draft memo from the Office of Management and Budget argues that the "Government Employee Fair Treatment Act" requires new congressional action to appropriate the funds, a position that federal unions call a misinterpretation. This stance is seen as part of a pressure campaign to force Democrats to pass a funding bill without their requested extensions for health care subsidies. The administration's own guidance on the matter was recently altered, removing a paragraph that affirmed the automatic restoration of pay.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team narrowly avoided an upset in the Women's World Cup, securing a four-wicket victory over Bangladesh in a tense match. Chasing a modest target of 179, England's batting lineup struggled against spin, collapsing to 103-6 at one point. Captain Heather Knight anchored the innings with a patient, unbeaten 79, guiding her team to victory with support from Charlie Dean. Earlier, England's spinners had dominated, with Sophie Ecclestone taking three wickets to help bowl Bangladesh out for 178. The unconvincing win highlights England's ongoing challenges against spin bowling despite maintaining their winning start to the tournament.</p>

          <p>A proposal by the Trump administration to retake the Bagram airbase in Afghanistan has been met with unified opposition from regional powers, including India, Pakistan, and China. At the Moscow Format Consultations on Afghanistan, these nations, along with Russia and Iran, issued a joint statement declaring the deployment of foreign military infrastructure in Afghanistan or neighboring states "unacceptable." The statement asserted that such a move would not serve the interests of regional peace and stability. President Trump has publicly advocated for re-establishing a U.S. presence at Bagram, citing its strategic proximity to western China.</p>

          <p>The World Trade Organization (WTO) has significantly raised its forecast for global trade growth in 2025 to 2.4%, up from a previous estimate of 0.9%. This upward revision is attributed to factors like U.S. importers front-loading orders to get ahead of tariffs and strong demand for AI-related technology. However, the outlook for 2026 is much bleaker, with the WTO slashing its growth forecast to just 0.5%, citing the cooling global economy and the full-year impact of higher trade tariffs. The organization warns that trade-restrictive measures and policy uncertainty remain key downside risks to the global economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined a compensation plan for millions of drivers affected by the mis-selling of car finance, with estimated average payouts of around £700 per person. The scheme addresses unfair discretionary commission arrangements, where dealers were incentivized to charge higher interest rates, affecting an estimated 14 million agreements made between 2007 and 2024. The total compensation payout from lenders could reach £8.2 billion. The FCA is proposing a formal scheme to streamline the process, which will require lenders to contact affected customers and review their cases for potential redress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>September, typically a peak month for shipping ahead of the holidays, has shown unusually weak performance this year, signaling a potential freight recession. The latest Logistics Managers' Index (LMI) recorded its lowest-ever September reading for transportation utilization, indicating a lack of movement for goods. According to the report's authors, the expected holiday surge is not materializing, as many retailers front-loaded inventory earlier in the year to avoid tariffs, and that stock is now sitting in warehouses. This has led to rising warehouse costs and stagnant transportation prices, a reversal of the usual seasonal trend. (not investment advice)</p>

Prosecutors stated in a memo that Williams made the threat because he was "overwhelmed with stress and anxiety and desperate to get out of an ongoing meeting." His lawyer cited undiagnosed mental health challenges, for which Williams is now receiving treatment, as a factor in the incident.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock price fell by 5% on Tuesday after a report from The Information raised concerns about the profitability of its cloud business involving Nvidia AI chips. According to internal documents cited in the report, Oracle's gross margin on its Nvidia cloud services was only 14%, far below the company's overall gross margin of around 70%. This suggests that despite rapid growth in cloud contracts, particularly with clients like OpenAI, the high cost of Nvidia's chips and aggressive pricing may be squeezing Oracle's profits.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article examines why Americans pay significantly more for prescription drugs than people in other developed nations, a long-standing political issue recently highlighted by President Trump's policy proposals. A key reason for the price disparity is the lack of a single, unified negotiating body in the U.S. healthcare system. Unlike countries with national health insurance that can leverage their entire population to demand lower prices or refuse to cover an overpriced drug, the fragmented U.S. market of private insurers and government programs has less bargaining power. This system prevents the aggressive price negotiations seen elsewhere.</p>
