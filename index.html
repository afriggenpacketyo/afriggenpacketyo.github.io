          <p>At least three migrants, including two children aged 3 and 4, died while attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea from Libya to Italy. The migrants were aboard a frail boat that lost engine power shortly after departing from western Libya, leaving them adrift for an extended period. The German aid organization RESQSHIP rescued 59 survivors, many of whom suffered critical injuries, including chemical burns from salt water and fuel. This route has become increasingly deadly, with almost 25,000 migrants dying or going missing since 2014, prompting criticism of EU agreements with Libya and Tunisia aimed at reducing migration. The incident highlights the ongoing humanitarian crisis and the perilous conditions faced by migrants seeking to reach Europe.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a cease-fire after a four-day military confrontation involving drones, missiles, and intense shelling. President Trump announced the agreement, praising both sides for their wisdom and fortitude, and offered to increase trade and mediate their dispute over Kashmir. While Pakistan acknowledged the U.S. role in mediation, India made no reference to American involvement, emphasizing that the negotiations were between Indian and Pakistani officials. Both countries are portraying the truce as a victory, with supporters of Prime Minister Modi citing the might of the Indian armed forces and Pakistan claiming operational superiority of its air force. Uncertainty remains regarding the durability of the cease-fire.</p>

          <p>A recent four-day conflict between India and Pakistan, while seemingly resolved with a truce, reveals new developments and persistent underlying issues that could lead to more frequent battles. The conflict saw the use of new military technology, including weaponized drones and missiles, leading to a rapid escalation. International diplomacy, particularly from the United States, played a crucial role in securing the cease-fire. However, entrenched religious nationalism in both countries, combined with India's determination to show a stronger stance, raises concerns about future confrontations and the potential for escalation.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the Trump administration has made significant progress in trade negotiations with China, following meetings in Switzerland. President Trump confirmed the progress, stating that a "total reset" was negotiated in a constructive manner, with the goal of opening China to American businesses. The talks aim to address the trade deficit and high tariffs imposed by both countries, which have disrupted global supply chains. This development follows a recently signed trade deal with the UK, indicating the administration's broader efforts to establish fair and reciprocal trade agreements. The article also notes that the UK deal keeps an existing 10% tariff in place against U.K. goods, while removing some import taxes on items like steel and cars.</p>

Democrats are hoping to persuade voters that the Trump administration is making their lives harder by undermining trust in vaccination programs.

          <p>The UK government plans to end the recruitment of care workers from overseas as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that rules will change this year, requiring firms to hire British nationals or extend visas of existing overseas workers. The government aims to cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers coming to the UK over the next year through changes to visa and recruitment laws. These plans include raising the threshold for skilled visas to graduate level and narrowing exceptions for temporary shortage visas. The government also intends to introduce new training requirements to encourage unemployed individuals to re-enter the UK labor market.</p>

          <p>US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy intends to reduce the number of flights in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport for the "next several weeks" to address radar outages, flight delays, and a shortage of air traffic controllers. He plans to meet with airlines to determine the reduction, with a larger cut in the afternoons due to international flight arrivals. The Trump administration has proposed a multibillion-dollar overhaul of the US air traffic control system, including new centers and technology upgrades. Duffy also plans to raise the mandatory retirement age for air traffic controllers from 56 to 61 and offer a bonus to encourage them to stay on the job.</p>

          <p>Iran and the United States held a fourth round of talks in Muscat, Oman, to discuss Iranâ€™s nuclear program, aiming to make progress on a key goal for both President Trump and Iranâ€™s leadership.

The U.S. insists on dismantling Iranâ€™s nuclear facilities, while Iran refuses to completely ban uranium enrichment. The talks occur as Mr. Trump prepares to travel to the Middle East and has threatened military action if the talks fail.</p>

          <p>Billy Evans, the partner of convicted Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, has reportedly raised millions of dollars for a new blood-testing startup called Haemanthus. The company's concept is strikingly similar to Theranos, promising diagnoses from blood, urine, and saliva samples. Evans is reportedly being advised by Holmes, who is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence for defrauding investors. Haemanthus aims to use laser technology to scan samples for illnesses, cancer, and infections, with long-term goals of developing a wearable device for humans.
