        <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended President Trump's economic policies, asserting their importance even if they cause a recession. He attributed potential recession risks to prior Biden administration policies and highlighted the policies' positive impacts on revenue, growth, and domestic factory construction.  Trump himself acknowledged potential transitional economic challenges but expressed optimism about long-term benefits.  Lutnick also downplayed concerns about the use of tariffs as negotiation tactics, claiming they are effective and not chaotic.</p>

        <p>Rep. Tom Suozzi warned of a looming crisis in senior care due to an aging population, fewer children to provide care, and geographical distance between children and parents. He introduced the "Well-Being Insurance for Seniors to be at Home Act" to encourage affordable long-term care insurance through a federal fund.  The bill aims to alleviate the burden on Medicaid and nursing homes.  Funding mechanisms under consideration include increased taxes or Social Security reforms.</p>

        <h2>House Passes Spending Bill to Avoid Government Shutdown</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-11 18:58:45 EDT</div>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>The House passed a spending bill to prevent a government shutdown.  Both supporters (GOP) and opponents (Democrats) expressed concern that the bill gives President Trump too much power to dismantle government programs through his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).  The bill's passage in the Senate is uncertain, requiring bipartisan support to overcome a filibuster.  Conservative Republicans, who previously opposed stopgap spending bills, supported this one to enable Trump's agenda.</p>
