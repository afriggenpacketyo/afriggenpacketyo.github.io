        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nottingham Forest has written to UEFA to seek clarification regarding Crystal Palace's qualification for the Europa League. The concern stems from UEFA's multi-club ownership rules, as John Textor, who owns a significant stake in Crystal Palace, also owns a majority stake in Lyon, which has also qualified for the Europa League. UEFA regulations prohibit an individual or entity from holding a majority stake in two clubs participating in the same European tournament to prevent collusion. Forest, which finished seventh in the Premier League, could potentially benefit if Palace is deemed ineligible to compete in Europe. </p>

          <p>Since early April, China has reportedly halted nearly all shipments of rare earth minerals, which are crucial for various technologies, including cars, robots, wind turbines, and jet fighters. This action has potential implications for global supply chains and industries reliant on these materials. The move underscores China's dominance in the rare earth market and its ability to leverage these resources in international trade and geopolitical strategies. The halt has led to concerns about potential disruptions and price increases in affected sectors. </p>

Harvard has walked back DEI efforts, suppressed pro-Palestinian sentiment, and is seeking greater intellectual diversity. It is unclear if these efforts will satisfy the Trump administration, whose ultimate goal may be retribution rather than reform. </p>

The increase in executions contrasts with efforts by the previous administration to reduce capital punishment. </p>
