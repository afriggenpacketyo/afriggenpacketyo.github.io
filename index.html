          <p>During Sean "Diddy" Combs' trial, the judge cautioned his defense attorney about Combs' interactions with the jury, including direct eye contact and nodding, which occurred during testimony from a friend of Cassie Ventura. The judge threatened to exclude Combs from the courtroom if such behavior continued. The testimony in question involved an alleged incident where Combs purportedly dangled the witness over a balcony in 2016, an allegation the defense countered with evidence suggesting Combs was elsewhere at the time. Another ex-girlfriend testified under a pseudonym, claiming to have participated in "freak offs" during their three-year relationship, as Combs faces multiple charges including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, which could lead to a life sentence if convicted. The judge's warning underscores the importance of maintaining decorum and impartiality throughout the trial proceedings.

          <p>President Trump publicly expressed his disappointment in Elon Musk after Musk criticized the Republican tax bill, which includes cuts to electric vehicle subsidies that would affect Tesla's business. Musk claimed that without his financial support, Trump would have lost the election, leading to Democratic control of Congress, while Trump stated he helped Musk significantly and suggested Musk was experiencing "Trump derangement syndrome." Trump also threatened to cancel Musk's federal contracts as a cost-cutting measure. The conflict arose over Musk's opposition to the bill's impact on the national deficit and the elimination of electric vehicle tax credits, despite Trump gifting Musk a key to the White House just days prior for his work with the Department of Government Efficiency.

Yusuf, who previously criticized the Conservative Party, was instrumental in professionalizing Reform UK, attracting donors, and expanding its activist base.

          <p>The U.S. trade deficit significantly narrowed in April as President Trump escalated tariffs, causing a plunge in imports, according to U.S. Commerce Department data. The trade gap fell by more than half, registering at about $61 billion compared to $140 billion the previous month, with imports dropping by 16% as trade barriers took effect. Trump has touted tariffs as a means to reduce the nation's trade deficit, viewing it as a threat to economic prosperity, although many economists disagree. Consumer attitudes have soured amid the tariff implementations, yet key economic indicators like unemployment and job growth have largely defied downturn fears, while inflation has cooled. The uncertain policy environment continues to create anxiety for businesses and consumers alike (not investment advice).</p>

This increase is attributed to heightened worksite enforcement and immigration court arrests, along with the use of collateral arrests. The White House emphasized the bill's provisions to double ICE detention capacity and increase personnel by 50%, with Deputy Assistant Alex Pfeiffer describing it as a "once-in-a generation opportunity to crack down on illegal immigration." These arrests come amidst broader policy changes under the Trump administration, including approved border wall waivers and a travel ban following the Boulder terrorist attack.

          <p>Democrats and civil rights groups have strongly criticized President Trump's travel ban on 12 countries, denouncing it as "reckless" and "racist," with some suggesting it is a distraction from his controversial tax bill. The ban, affecting countries including Afghanistan and Haiti, is justified by Trump as necessary for national security and counter-terrorism efforts. Critics, including Senator Adam Schiff and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, argue that the ban will not improve national security and will further isolate the U.S. internationally. The announcement of the ban coincides with Republican efforts to pass Trump's tax and spending bill, leading some Democrats to accuse Trump of attempting to divert attention from the bill's potential negative impacts.

          <p>The Trump administration has officially raised tariffs on aluminum and steel to 50%, a move experts say could increase costs on various consumer goods, including cars, homes, and household appliances. While the U.S. has a domestic metals industry, it still relies on imports, particularly from Canada. Experts predict that businesses will likely pass on these tariff-related costs to consumers through higher prices, as was seen in 2018 when similar tariffs were introduced. The increased tariffs have been praised by some of the nation's largest steelmakers, who saw gains in share prices following the announcement.

          <p>The original Hermès Birkin bag, once owned by the late Jane Birkin, is set to be auctioned at Sotheby's this summer, representing a significant piece of fashion history. The bag, which inspired one of the world's most coveted accessories, differs slightly from the models sold today. The auction house has not yet indicated how much the bag could fetch, but it is expected to be a highly sought-after item. Birkin, known for her artistry and style, inspired the creation of the bag after a chance encounter with Hermès' then-head Jean-Louis Dumas.

          <p>President Trump and his allies are promoting claims about his budget bill that contradict expert analysis, particularly regarding its impact on the national debt and tax relief. Despite claims that the bill will reduce the deficit by $1.6 trillion, non-partisan analysts estimate it will increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. Trump's assertion that taxes will rise by 68% if the bill does not pass is also disputed, with analyses suggesting a smaller tax increase. Claims that Medicaid cuts only target waste and fraud are also inaccurate, as the bill includes significant cuts to the program, including new work requirements.

          <p>The government has announced that any child in England whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible for free school meals from September 2026, regardless of their income. This change is expected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible, saving parents £500 a year and lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. Sir Keir Starmer described the measure as a "down payment" on a broader child poverty strategy, while Education Bridget Phillipson emphasized that the plan would lead to higher educational outcomes. The government has allocated £1 billion to fund the change up to 2029, with additional pledges to support food charities and review school meal standards.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected a lawsuit brought by Mexico that sought to hold American gunmakers accountable for their role in the country's struggle with drug cartels. The court voted 9-0 to uphold a 2005 law that shields gun manufacturers from liability if their products are misused. Mexico's government had argued that the "flood" of illegal guns across the border was a result of deliberate practices by US firms that appealed to cartel members. The court found that Mexico's complaint did not plausibly allege that the defendant manufacturers aided and abetted gun dealers' unlawful sales of firearms to Mexican traffickers.
