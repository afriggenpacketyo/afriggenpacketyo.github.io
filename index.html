        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kanye West, now known as Ye, is scheduled to perform at the Rubicon Festival in Bratislava, Slovakia, in July, marking his only confirmed European performance in 2025. This announcement has sparked controversy due to Ye's history of antisemitic remarks, including a recent song containing pro-Hitler lyrics, which is banned in Germany. A petition with over 3,000 signatures is calling for his removal from the festival lineup, citing his trivialization of Nazi ideology and crimes. While some platforms have banned the song, it remains widely available on social media, raising concerns about tech companies' content moderation policies. The performance has ignited debate about freedom of speech versus the need to combat hate speech, particularly in light of Ye's past antisemitic statements.</p>

          <p>Trump Media & Technology Group, the company behind Truth Social, Truth+, and Truth.Fi, has announced that its board approved a stock buyback of up to $400 million, causing the stock to rise about 3% premarket. The Florida-based company, trading under the ticker DJT, may repurchase both common stock and warrants through open market transactions, with all repurchased shares to be retired. CEO Devin Nunes stated that the company's $3 billion balance sheet provides the flexibility to support shareholder returns and explore strategic opportunities. Donald Trump, indirectly owning over 114 million shares through a revocable trust, remains the largest shareholder. The company's financial position allows for this move to potentially increase shareholder value. Optimism surrounding the company's performance is reflected in the market's initial positive reaction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the average credit card balance rising, experts clarify the rules regarding inheriting credit card debt. Generally, individuals are not responsible for a deceased loved one's credit card debt unless they were a co-signer, a joint account holder, or a spouse in a community property state where the debt was incurred during the marriage. The deceased's estate is typically responsible for settling debts before assets are passed to heirs; if the estate is insolvent, the debt may go unpaid. Experts advise notifying credit card companies and credit bureaus upon a death and consulting with an estate attorney before responding to debt collectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, several tankers initially reversed course away from the Strait of Hormuz due to concerns over potential disruptions to trade. Data indicated that at least six vessels, including crude carriers, chemical tankers, and refined products carriers, diverted their routes. However, some of these vessels later resumed their course toward the Strait, suggesting a fluctuating level of apprehension among shipowners. Despite the initial diversions, overall vessel flow into the region appears to be sustained, indicating a cautious but continued use of the vital waterway.</p>

          <p>Uranium, discovered in 1789, is a naturally occurring radioactive element found in trace amounts in the environment. It has a silver-white-gray finish and is denser than other heavy metals. Uranium is used in both enriched and depleted forms, with enriched uranium serving as fuel for nuclear power plants and weapons, while depleted uranium is used for radiation shielding. Exposure to high concentrations of uranium can be life-threatening, causing cancer and organ damage, and it can enter the environment through industrial runoff and mining operations. The majority of the world's uranium production comes from Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. engages in military action against Iran, China's support for its ally appears to be growing more restrained, influenced by its limited ability to mediate and its strategic assessment of Washington's involvement. China has drawn closer to Iran in recent years, but its primary economic interest lies in accessing Iranian oil and the Strait of Hormuz. While China condemned Israel's initial attacks, its rhetoric has shifted to emphasize dialogue and a ceasefire. Experts suggest that China may benefit from chaos in the Middle East, as it could distract Washington and potentially increase oil prices, which China is better prepared to handle than the U.S.</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old girl has died from severe food poisoning, and seven other children have become sick after consuming meat from two butcher shops in Saint-Quentin, France. Five of the children contracted hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a rare foodborne illness often linked to E. coli. Authorities have temporarily closed the butcher shops as a precautionary measure and are testing samples to determine the source of the contamination. An investigation has been launched to trace the origin of the meat, highlighting concerns about food safety and potential E. coli outbreaks.</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation straining household budgets, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to lock in higher returns than the current inflation rate. National average CD yields range from 1.71% to 2.02%, but top CDs offer rates between 4.00% and 4.51%. Strategies for securing good rates include looking at online banks and considering short-term CDs, which currently offer higher interest rates than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve. Experts recommend laddering CDs to take advantage of high rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, President Trump raised the possibility of regime change in Iran, despite earlier assurances from top officials that toppling Iran's leaders was not the aim. Trump's post on social media questioned why there wouldn't be a regime change if the current Iranian regime is unable to "MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN." The remarks have stirred speculation and put him at odds with his allies. Meanwhile, Iran has vowed "everlasting consequences," and the Israeli military said missiles had been launched from Iran towards Israel.</p>

          <p>Despite initial promises to end America's "forever wars," President Trump has deployed national guard troops and U.S. marines to Los Angeles in response to protests, raising concerns about the militarization of domestic political disputes. The troops are primarily guarding federal buildings and accompanying immigration enforcement agents, but the deployment has unnerved California's political leaders and prompted a lawsuit from retired military officials. Critics see a link between Trump's willingness to send troops into American cities and his decision to involve the U.S. in the conflict between Israel and Iran.

          <p>A significant heat wave is expected to bring record-high temperatures across the eastern United States, with more than 150 million Americans under extreme heat alerts. The National Weather Service has warned of numerous daily record maximum and minimum temperatures through at least Wednesday, particularly from the Midwest to the East Coast. The heat wave is caused by a heat dome trapping heat and humidity, leading to dangerously high temperatures. Experts recommend staying indoors, using air conditioning, and staying hydrated to avoid heat-related illnesses.</p>
