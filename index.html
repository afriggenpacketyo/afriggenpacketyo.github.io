          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a prominent women's rights symbol in France, has received the nation's highest civilian honor, the Legion of Honor. She gained international recognition for her courageous public testimony about the decade of abuse she suffered, where her ex-husband drugged and sexually assaulted her, and invited others to do the same. Her case, which led to the conviction of her ex-husband and 50 co-defendants, sparked a national debate on sexual violence. Pelicot's advocacy was instrumental in the French Senate passing a bill to include lack of consent in the legal definition of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>On the one-year anniversary of the assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pennsylvania, President Donald Trump issued a statement reflecting on the event. He credited divine intervention for his survival and praised the resilience of the American spirit against what he termed 'forces of evil.' The president honored the first responders and citizens who acted heroically during the attack, which left one person dead and two others wounded. Trump specifically remembered Corey Comperatore, a rally attendee killed while protecting his family, calling him a hero whose valor will not be forgotten.</p>

          <p>Singapore successfully avoided a technical recession, reporting 1.4% economic growth in the second quarter of 2025, reversing a contraction from the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed analysts' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector. Despite these positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution, highlighting significant uncertainty and downside risks for the second half of the year, particularly concerning U.S. tariff policies. The government has already downgraded its full-year GDP forecast and is rolling out grants to help businesses manage global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated that the central bank is prepared to implement larger interest rate cuts if the job market continues to weaken. In an interview, Bailey stated he believes the path for rates, currently at 4.25%, is downward, citing signs that businesses are adjusting employment and reducing pay increases. This follows a recent national insurance hike for employers and data showing the UK economy contracted in both April and May. The governor's comments suggest a proactive stance to stimulate the economy amid growing concerns about a potential slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

Journalists in remote places like Kotzebue, Alaska, argue their stations provide life-or-death information during emergencies.

          <p>A violent series of events in Lexington, Kentucky, ended with three people dead, including the suspect, after a shooting at a church. The incident began when a state trooper was shot and wounded during a traffic stop. The suspect then carjacked a vehicle and fled to the Richmond Road Baptist Church, where he shot and killed two people, identified as Beverly Gum, 72, and Christina Combs, 32. Two other men were also wounded at the church before Lexington police arrived and fatally shot the suspect. Authorities believe the shooter may have had a connection to the church victims.</p>

          <p>An aggressive wildfire on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures. The Dragon Bravo Fire grew rapidly due to high winds, burning through approximately 5,000 acres and also damaging a water treatment facility, which caused a hazardous chlorine gas leak. Meanwhile, another large fire burns in the nearby Kaibab National Forest. The incidents are part of a dangerous combination of extreme heat, dry conditions, and wildfire activity, as smoke from massive Canadian wildfires also blankets the U.S. Upper Midwest with unhealthy air.</p>

Despite holding the best record in the National League, the team's performance has been inconsistent, marked by an injury-plagued pitching staff and slumps from key veteran hitters. Sunday's game encapsulated their season, with a stellar performance from starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto followed by a blown save from closer Tanner Scott. While the team has underperformed relative to high expectations, they remain in a strong position for the postseason.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, known for his 'illiberal democracy' and admired by some conservative leaders abroad, is facing a significant political challenge at home. A new challenger from the center-right, Peter Magyar, has emerged, capitalizing on a government scandal and public frustration with the state of hospitals, schools, and the economy. While Orban has long maintained power by identifying and amplifying voters' fears, this strategy is showing signs of failing. Polls indicate a tight race, suggesting that Orban's 15-year rule is more vulnerable than ever before.</p>

          <p>A severe, multi-year drought in northern Mexico is intensifying a long-standing water dispute with the United States. Under an 81-year-old treaty, Mexico is required to send a specified amount of water from the Rio Grande to Texas, but it is currently in arrears. Farmers in Chihuahua, Mexico, argue they cannot send water they don't have, while Texan farmers contend Mexico is hoarding the resource. The Trump administration has threatened tariffs if Mexico does not fulfill its obligations. The conflict highlights the growing strain that climate change and population growth are placing on decades-old resource-sharing agreements.</p>

The administration also defended its 50% tariff on copper imports, framing it as a crucial step to ensure domestic supply for military production in a time of war. (not investment advice)</p>
