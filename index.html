            <p>A 17-year-old from Wisconsin, Nikita Casap, has been charged with the murders of his mother and stepfather. According to court documents, Casap allegedly committed these acts to gain financial resources and autonomy to assassinate President Donald Trump and overthrow the U.S. government. The FBI is investigating potential federal charges, including conspiracy and use of weapons of mass destruction, as Casap allegedly had contact with others about his plan and acquired materials like a drone and explosives.

Brown argues that threatening China and presenting zero-sum options is counterproductive, given China's strong narrative of resisting victimization and bullying. He notes that China has been preparing for this situation by diversifying its markets and supply chains, and increasing investment in research and development to address its technology deficit with the U.S. Optimism score: 50</p>
