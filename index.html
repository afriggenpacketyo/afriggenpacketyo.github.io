          <p>In Inner Mongolia, China is deploying a fleet of 100 self-driving, photovoltaic-battery-powered trucks at the Yimin open-pit coal mine. This initiative addresses a shortage of drivers and improves safety in dangerous conditions, as younger generations show declining interest in the profession. The Yimin mine, one of China's largest, previously required 1,200 drivers operating 300 trucks around the clock. This upgrade is part of China's broader push to digitally transform its coal industry and construct intelligent mines, aligning with strategic goals outlined by central government agencies in 2020. The project highlights China's commitment to modernizing traditional industries using advanced technologies amidst a shrinking and aging workforce.</p>

Hegseth emphasized the U.S. commitment to increasing its military presence, strengthening allies' defense capabilities, and rebuilding its defense industrial base. He urged Asian countries to increase their military spending, mirroring NATO nations' commitment to 5% of GDP, and stressed that the U.S. seeks peace through strength and will stand by its allies to deter Chinese aggression.</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has saved over $5 million annually by identifying and eliminating unused software licenses across various agencies. For example, the IRS had 3,000 software licenses but only used 25, leading to a 99% reduction in licenses. Similar cuts were made at the Department of Labor and the Securities and Exchange Commission, resulting in significant savings. These audits, continuously conducted since February, have contributed to an estimated $175 billion in savings due to asset sales, contract cancellations, and fraud payment reductions, translating to about $1,087 per taxpayer (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A hiker in Butte County, California, was rescued by helicopter after falling 30 feet down a waterfall and into a pool. The hiker, who was not identified, sustained serious injuries and could not be reached quickly by ambulance. The rescue team harnessed the man to a 150-foot rope and airlifted him to a landing zone for further medical care. Authorities noted that the helicopter rescue was necessary due to the severity of the injuries and the time it would have taken for an ambulance to arrive.</p>

An investigation in Lompoc, California, prompted authorities to break down the meanings of these emojis to help the public decode illicit transactions.

Professional medical groups, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, continue to recommend COVID vaccines based on scientific evidence, but their logos are absent from the current versions as their recommendations no longer align.
