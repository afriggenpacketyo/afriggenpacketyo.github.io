          <h2>Future of U.S. Birthright Citizenship Uncertain After Supreme Court Ruling on Injunctions</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision that limited the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, the future of birthright citizenship in the U.S. remains uncertain. The ruling allows the Trump administration to proceed with planning the implementation of an executive order aimed at ending the practice, although the order's constitutionality has not yet been decided. While legal challenges will continue, and some states are protected by narrowed injunctions, the decision could affect birthright status in the 28 states that have not sued. The administration has not yet clarified the practical details of how it would enforce such a policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate rejected a resolution aimed at requiring President Trump to seek congressional approval before taking further military action against Iran. The measure failed in a 47-53 vote, largely along party lines, following recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Proponents, like Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, argued for congressional oversight on matters of war, while opponents contended it would improperly constrain the president's ability to respond to threats. The vote occurred amid Democratic frustration over a lack of transparency from the administration regarding the intelligence and impact of the recent bombings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Tulane University has found that sections of New Orleans' flood protection system are sinking at a rate of nearly two inches per year, faster than the rise of sea levels. This subsidence, particularly in areas like the Michoud neighborhood, threatens to degrade the effectiveness of the $15 billion system built after Hurricane Katrina. Researchers used satellite radar data to identify these sinking hotspots, linking them to factors like soil compression and groundwater withdrawal. The findings raise concerns about the city's long-term flood security as it enters another hurricane season, 20 years after Katrina's devastation.</p>

          <p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned a new aid distribution system in Gaza, stating it is "inherently unsafe" and has resulted in the deaths of over 400 Palestinians. The system, operated by the Israel- and U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), bypasses the UN and is intended to prevent aid from reaching Hamas. Guterres emphasized that the search for food should never be a death sentence and called for a ceasefire. Meanwhile, the GHF has disputed the UN's claims, stating no deaths have occurred at its distribution sites and inviting other humanitarian groups to join its efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has significantly limited the use of nationwide injunctions by federal judges, a practice that has frequently halted policies from both Republican and Democratic administrations. In a 6-3 decision authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the court ruled that these broad orders likely exceed the authority Congress has granted to the judiciary. The case arose from challenges to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, but the ruling focused on the scope of judicial power rather than the policy's legality. Dissenting justices argued that the decision abdicates the court's role in checking potentially unlawful executive actions.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned that a Republican-backed budget bill in the U.S. Senate could cause up to 3.4 million Californians to lose their Medi-Cal health insurance. The bill proposes new work requirements for many Medicaid recipients, which Newsom argues would create a bureaucratic maze and lead to massive coverage losses. He stated the cuts could also threaten the stability of rural hospitals and increase premiums for those on the state's ACA marketplace. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the requirements would leave 4.8 million Americans uninsured nationwide while cutting Medicaid spending significantly.

          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security indicates a link between consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet and lower rates of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research, which surveyed nearly 12,500 employees, found that those who ate a diet rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables were less likely to report symptoms of depression. Researchers suggest that nutrients like folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, which are abundant in the diet, may play a role in supporting mental well-being by aiding neurotransmitter release and reducing inflammation. Further research is needed to confirm the findings for public health applications.</p>

The 33-year-old was arrested peacefully at a local residence, leaving only one inmate, Derrick Groves, still at large. The May 16 jailbreak, described by the governor as the worst in recent state history, involved the inmates breaking through a faulty cell door and a wall. Officials have since arrested at least 16 people accused of aiding the escapees, and a $50,000 reward remains for information leading to the final fugitive's capture.</p>

The dark comedy follows two sisters and their mother as they navigate financial struggles and dysfunctional relationships. Sadler, the writer, says the new season is even more intense, influenced by their upbringing in an all-woman household and the "bleak" modern dating scene she observes online. The series is known for its unflinching and humorous take on taboo subjects like mental health and abortion, which the creators feel they can push further following their initial success.</p>

          <p>Japanese farmers and chefs are exploring the culinary potential of the prickly pear cactus, a nutrient-rich plant gaining recognition as a superfood. Known for its high content of minerals and dietary fiber, the cactus is being incorporated into a variety of dishes, from tempura to pizza. Research from Chubu University suggests the plant may enhance immune function, adding to its appeal for health-conscious consumers. Farmers like Miki Deguchi in Kasugai are cultivating the resilient, pesticide-free plant, which experts believe has potential as a sustainable food source in the face of climate change.</p>

The incident occurred when police approached a man who was with Lenoir, suspecting him of concealing contraband in a vehicle. According to the LAPD, Lenoir retrieved the car keys, refused to return them to officers, and passed them to another individual who fled the scene. A subsequent search of the vehicle uncovered a loaded firearm and narcotics, leading to the other man's arrest on a felony charge. The 49ers have stated they are aware of the matter and gathering information.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News, seeking at least $787 million in damages. The lawsuit alleges that the network, particularly anchor Jesse Watters, knowingly made false statements by claiming Newsom had lied about a phone call with President Donald Trump. The dispute centers on conflicting accounts of a conversation and the subsequent reporting on it. Newsom's legal team stated they would dismiss the suit if Fox News retracts the claim and issues a formal on-air apology, while the network has dismissed the lawsuit as a "frivolous publicity stunt" intended to chill free speech.</p>

          <p>A BBC correspondent explored the resurgent field of phage therapy, a century-old medical concept that uses viruses to kill bacteria. By collecting samples from his home, including his toilet, he successfully isolated a bacteriophage capable of killing a patient's persistent urinary tract infection in a lab setting. Scientists at the University of Southampton explained that while antibiotics eclipsed phage research for decades, the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs is renewing interest in this alternative. Although challenges remain in bringing phage therapy to mainstream medicine, it is available in the UK on compassionate grounds and offers a promising avenue for treating incurable infections.</p>

He reports having paid approximately $162,000 in tariffs, which he could not absorb due to slim profit margins.

          <p>The UK's Labour government executed a major U-turn on planned cuts to disability benefits following the threat of a large-scale party rebellion. The initial plan aimed to save £5 billion annually by tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payments (Pip), but critics argued it was a short-sighted cost-cutting measure rather than a genuine reform to help people back into work. This reversal has raised questions about the government's fiscal credibility and its ability to manage its large parliamentary majority. The compromise will now cost an estimated £3 billion, forcing the Chancellor to find savings elsewhere or raise taxes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has announced that two of its research aircraft will be flying at unusually low altitudes over Southern California for several days. The planes, a P-3 Orion and a King Air B200, will be flying between 1,000 and 10,000 feet to conduct atmospheric research as part of the Student Airborne Research Program (SARP). The aircraft will perform maneuvers such as vertical spirals over urban areas, landfills, and power plants to sample gasses and measure surfaces. NASA is advising the public not to be alarmed by the low-flying planes, which will be visible over the Los Angeles Basin, Salton Sea, and Central Valley.</p>
