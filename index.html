        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House stated that Iran possesses everything necessary to produce a nuclear weapon within weeks, pending approval from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, posing an existential threat to Israel, the United States, and the world. This assessment follows ongoing debates about Iran's "breakout timeline" regarding enriched uranium stockpiles, with some experts estimating several months to two years to create a deliverable nuclear warhead. President Trump is expected to decide within two weeks whether to take military action against Tehran, influenced by ongoing correspondence between the U.S. and Iran and a split in his Republican base regarding isolationism and support for Israel. Trump's decision will be based partly on his instincts, with diplomacy as his preferred option, as the U.S. aims to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and ensure Middle East stability. </p>

          <p>A listeria outbreak linked to 17 illnesses, three deaths, and one fetal loss has prompted a voluntary recall of ready-to-eat chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals sold at Kroger and Walmart. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service is investigating the outbreak, tracing it to products made by FreshRealm, Inc. under the Home Chef and Marketside brands. Consumers are urged to discard or return the recalled products, with the FDA reporting illnesses in 13 states between August 2024 and May 2025. Symptoms of listeria infection include fever, muscle aches, and gastrointestinal issues, posing the greatest risk to pregnant women, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is launching a $10 million health study for residents of East Palestine, Ohio, following a toxic chemical spill from a train derailment. The five-year initiative will assess the long-term health effects of exposure to hazardous chemicals, including vinyl chloride and benzene residue, through epidemiological research and public health surveillance. Vice President Vance criticized the former Biden administration for allegedly neglecting the long-term health impacts on East Palestine residents. Residents had reported various health issues, such as headaches and respiratory illnesses, after the February 2023 spill, leading to a $600 million settlement from Norfolk Southern. </p>

          <p>The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), signed in 2015 between Iran and world powers, restricted Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the JCPOA in 2018, reimposing economic sanctions, arguing the deal was defective. Following the U.S. withdrawal and the killing of Qassem Soleimani, Iran ceased abiding by the deal's operational restraints.

          <p>Hurricane Erick, the fifth named storm of the season, made landfall in Oaxaca, Mexico, as a Category 3 hurricane before being downgraded to a tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center warned of heavy rainfall and potential life-threatening flooding and mudslides. Earlier, Erick had grown to a Category 4 storm with 140 mph winds. The storm is expected to produce 8 to 12 inches of rain in Oaxaca and Guerrero, with storm surge creating coastal flooding. </p>

          <p>A recent study suggests that a passing star could cause more havoc in our solar system than previously believed, potentially altering Earth's orbit. Simulations indicate that passing stars are the most probable trigger for instability over the next four billion years, affecting even stable objects like Pluto. The gravitational tug could increase the risk of instability for Mercury by 50 to 80 percent. Researchers found a small chance that Earth could be involved in a planetary collision or ejection. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are effective in reducing shoreline pollution, with local and state policies enacted from 2016 to 2023 reducing plastic bag waste by up to 47%. The study analyzed data from over 45,000 beach cleanups and found that full bans and fees were more effective than partial bans. California's efforts to curb plastic waste, including a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags, have shown mixed results due to loopholes allowing thicker plastic bags. The study also found a potential benefit in reducing harm to marine life in areas with bag policies. </p>

          <p>Despite Israeli strikes on other Iranian nuclear facilities, the underground enrichment site at Fordo has remained untouched, raising concerns due to its fortified location and potential for clandestine weapons development. Experts believe that Fordo is central to Iran's nuclear efforts, and the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency has declared Iran non-compliant with monitoring efforts. President Trump has been briefed on the risks and benefits of bombing Fordo, with a decision expected within two weeks. The facility's location deep within a mountain may require the use of a U.S.-produced "bunker-buster" bomb for destruction. </p>
