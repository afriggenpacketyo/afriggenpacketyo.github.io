          <p>Alaska's congressional delegation is celebrating the Trump administration's move to reverse a Biden-era rule restricting oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Senator Dan Sullivan stated that the previous rule illegally turned areas intended for energy production into wilderness, while Representative Nick Begich III hailed the decision as a major victory. Officials assert that repealing the rule will not weaken environmental standards but will enable Alaska to produce more energy, create jobs, and generate revenue. Governor Mike Dunleavy previously criticized the Biden administration's handling of land sales in ANWR, anticipating a more favorable approach under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor reported a 16.3% year-over-year U.S. sales increase for May, driven by an employee pricing program amidst rising tariff costs. Sales were led by a 17.2% increase in vehicles with internal combustion engines and a 29% jump in hybrid models, offsetting a 25% drop in electric vehicle sales. The employee pricing program, promoted as "From America, For America," has contributed to consecutive double-digit sales increases.

While a rate cut is unlikely in June, potential cuts later in the year could impact HELOC rates.

          <p>Max Homa carried his own bag at a US Open qualifier after parting ways with his caddie, Bill Harke, causing a stir on social media. Homa, who didn't want to discuss the split, ended up in a five-man playoff for the final spot after a three-putt on his 36th hole. He lost the playoff for an alternate spot on the next hole, reflecting on the challenges of carrying his own bag after a long time. Homa suggested that the experience might have helped him battle some inner demons.</p>

          <p>Decision coach Nell Wulfhart advises against overthinking difficult choices, suggesting that people often take too long to make decisions due to fear of regret. She recommends creating a list of personal values and sketching out an ideal life in the future to guide decision-making. Wulfhart emphasizes that some regret is inevitable and that moving faster can minimize regret. Testing things out and limiting the number of people consulted for advice are also helpful strategies.</p>
