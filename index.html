          <p>Walgreens has agreed to pay $300 million to resolve allegations that it unlawfully filled millions of invalid prescriptions for opioids and other controlled substances. The Justice Department claimed that Walgreens pharmacists knowingly filled prescriptions despite clear signs of illegitimacy, and that the company pressured employees to prioritize speed over legal compliance. The government's lawsuit alleged violations of the Controlled Substances Act and the False Claims Act, and the settlement dismisses the complaint against Walgreens. The company denies any liability, but the settlement averts potential fines of up to $80,850 per unlawful prescription.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has initiated legal action against the Trump administration, alleging attempts to control academic decision-making at the institution. The lawsuit is a response to the administration's threat to review $9 billion in federal funding after Harvard declined to comply with demands, including the appointment of an external overseer. The university aims to prevent a freeze on $2.2 billion in grants, asserting that the administration's actions have real-life consequences for patients, students, faculty, and the standing of American higher education.</p>
