            <p>An arsonist set fire to the Pennsylvania governor's official residence in Harrisburg early Sunday morning, while Governor Josh Shapiro and his family were inside. Fortunately, the family was safely evacuated by the Pennsylvania State Police and Harrisburg Bureau of Fire, and no injuries were reported. The fire caused a significant amount of damage to part of the residence, and authorities are investigating whether the attack was motivated by antisemitism, as it occurred on the first night of Passover and Shapiro is Jewish. The Pennsylvania State Police is offering a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.</p>

            <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping currently have no plans to communicate amid the escalating trade war. Despite the lack of direct communication, Greer maintains that the U.S. is working to reshore American manufacturing and address the trade deficit, attributing the current situation to China's decision to retaliate. The administration is preparing for the possibility that China may sell assets held in the United States and emphasizes the need for a resilient economy.</p>
