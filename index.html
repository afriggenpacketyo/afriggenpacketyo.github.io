          <p>Nintendo delayed US preorders for its highly anticipated Switch 2 console due to President Trump's newly implemented tariffs.

The tariffs significantly increase manufacturing costs for electronics companies like Nintendo, potentially leading to price increases for consumers.

          <p>Economists are criticizing President Trump's tariff formula, arguing that it misrepresents global trade economics.  Trump claims his tariffs are "reciprocal," but the calculation method used, based on trade deficits and imports, is flawed and doesn't reflect modern economic principles.  Experts point out that trade deficits are complex and not solely determined by tariffs.  The formula's questionable basis raises concerns about the effectiveness and fairness of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Guardian editorial analyzes President Trump's tariff policy as a form of economic imperialism, designed to maintain US dominance rather than address trade imbalances.  The tariffs are presented as a demand for tribute from other countries in exchange for access to the US market.  The editorial criticizes the policy's potential for negative domestic and global consequences, including inflation and trade wars.  It advocates for alternative strategies to reduce dependence on US economic power.</p>
