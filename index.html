          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man mistakenly deported by the Trump administration, has alleged severe mistreatment in a Salvadoran mega-prison. In a new legal filing, his attorneys claim he endured "psychological torture," "severe beatings," sleep deprivation, and inadequate nutrition, causing him to lose 31 pounds. Abrego Garcia, who has since been returned to the U.S. and faces separate human smuggling charges, denies the administration's claims of gang affiliation. His lawyers are seeking a court order to prevent another deportation while his case proceeds.</p>

          <p>A large explosion and subsequent fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Yolo County, California, has left seven people unaccounted for.

Two individuals were treated for injuries, but officials have not confirmed any fatalities, though family members of missing workers fear the worst.

          <p>A report from His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services found that historical child grooming investigations in Manchester were significantly delayed due to heavily redacted evidence provided by the city council. The watchdog stated that some documents were nearly impossible to assess, hindering probes like Operation Green Jacket and Operation Bernese. Manchester City Council defended its actions, citing complex data-sharing rules to avoid jeopardizing prosecutions. A new, more efficient protocol for sharing unredacted information between the council, police, and prosecutors has since been established.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that using a combination of estrogen and progestin for hormone therapy may increase breast cancer risk in women under 55 who have a uterus. Conversely, the research found that using estrogen alone, a treatment suitable for women who have had a hysterectomy, actually reduces the risk. This evolving science refines understanding from a controversial early 2000s study, highlighting that the type and timing of hormone therapy are crucial. Experts emphasize that patients should consult their doctors to weigh individual risks and benefits.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, a former criminology PhD student, has admitted to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students in a plea deal to avoid the death penalty. Kohberger pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary, waiving his right to appeal. The deal brings a conclusion to a case that garnered intense national interest but leaves questions about his motive unanswered. While the agreement provides closure for some victims' families, others expressed disappointment, with one father calling it a "deal with the devil."</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals a significant shift in the Latino electorate, with Donald Trump securing 48% of the Latino vote in the 2024 election, a major increase from 36% in 2020. Political experts suggest this is not a simple ideological move to conservatism but rather a turn towards populism driven by economic concerns and disillusionment with the Democratic Party. Analysts point to the Democratic Party's focus on progressive cultural issues over a working-class economic agenda and a perceived failure on immigration reform as key factors alienating these voters.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has ruled against a Trump administration order that suspended access to asylum for individuals crossing the southern border. The court determined that the president lacks the authority under the constitution or federal law to implement such a ban. The policy, which immigrant rights groups challenged in a lawsuit, was described as an unprecedented "flat-out ban on all asylum." In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss stated that the president cannot create an alternative immigration system that supplants laws enacted by Congress.</p>

This change could permit industrial development in critical areas, jeopardizing not only the orcas but also the salmon and other wildlife like the bald eagle.

          <p>Prosecutors in the Fabio Sementilli murder case are using evidence of a continued jailhouse love affair between his wife, Monica Sementilli, and her co-defendant Robert Baker as proof of their conspiracy. Intercepted letters and recorded conversations reveal the two used coded language, referred to themselves as husband and wife, and maintained a "Ride or Die" pact. Police conducted elaborate sting operations, placing the defendants in adjoining cells to record their interactions. The prosecution argues this ongoing commitment demonstrates a motive to kill Fabio for financial gain, while the defense deems the affair irrelevant to the murder charges.</p>

          <p>In a jailhouse interview, Robert Baker, who pleaded no contest to the 2017 murder of Fabio Sementilli, claims his former lover and co-defendant, Monica Sementilli, was not involved in the crime. Baker insisted that Monica "didn't know s***" and that he acted without her knowledge, a statement that could be a bombshell in her upcoming trial. Despite evidence of their affair and alleged conspiracy, Baker is now positioning himself as the sole perpetrator. Monica's defense team has expressed confidence that Baker's testimony will ultimately exonerate her of all charges.</p>

          <p>A coalition of former federal health officials has warned that proposed budget cuts for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could have severe negative health consequences for Americans. The proposed fiscal year 2026 budget would slash the CDC's funding by over half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. This would devastate state and local health departments, which receive roughly 80% of the CDC's domestic budget. The officials predict these cuts will lead to more illness and unnecessary deaths by damaging crucial programs for chronic disease, HIV, and injury prevention.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon believes that U.S. airstrikes on three key Iranian nuclear facilities last month have set back the country's program by approximately one to two years. A defense department spokesperson confirmed this internal intelligence assessment, which offers a more measured timeline than President Trump's claims of complete "obliteration." The assessment comes as intelligence agencies analyze damage to crucial infrastructure, such as centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site. Verifying the full extent of the damage has become more difficult as Iran has suspended cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA.</p>

          <h2>University of California Bans Student Governments from Enacting Boycotts Against Israel</h2>

          <p>The University of California system has officially banned its student governments from participating in boycotts of Israel or companies associated with the country. In a letter to chancellors, UC President Michael Drake cited existing university policies requiring sound business practices, effectively prohibiting such boycotts by official university entities. The move is a direct response to a Trump administration directive threatening to pull federal research funding from institutions engaging in anti-Israel boycotts. While the ban applies to official student governments, it does not restrict the speech or actions of independent student clubs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied bail for Sean "Diddy" Combs, who will remain in custody until his sentencing later this year. The decision came after a jury acquitted the hip-hop mogul of the most serious charges of racketeering and sex trafficking but found him guilty of transporting people for prostitution. Despite his lawyers' arguments that he was not a flight risk, the judge cited Combs' acknowledged history of violence in the ruling. Combs faces up to 20 years in prison for the conviction, concluding a nearly two-month trial that detailed allegations of a criminal enterprise.</p>

          <p>An essay adapted from a new book reflects on the legacy of Ritchie Valens, a Chicano rock 'n' roll pioneer who died in a 1959 plane crash at age 17. The piece highlights how Valens transformed traditional songs like "La Bamba" into rock anthems, paving the way for future artists and the Chicano soul movement. It also delves into the making of the 1987 biopic "La Bamba," detailing how the filmmakers and the band Los Lobos revitalized his music for a new generation. The film's success helped set a precedent for the global crossover of Latin music.</p>
