          <h2>Supreme Court Weighs Medicaid Cuts Targeting Abortion Providers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-02 13:44:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in *Medina v. Planned Parenthood*, concerning South Carolina's attempt to exclude abortion providers from its Medicaid program.  The case tests the enforceability of a federal law requiring Medicaid recipients to have provider choice.  The outcome remains uncertain, as several justices seemed inclined to find ways to circumvent prior rulings protecting Medicaid patients' rights to choose their providers.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported a 13% drop in first-quarter vehicle deliveries, significantly lower than analysts' predictions.  Experts attribute this decline partly to increased competition and negative consumer sentiment linked to CEO Elon Musk's controversial political activities and role in the Trump administration. The slumping sales follow Musk's substantial political donations and his controversial role in the Department of Government Efficiency, sparking protests and boycotts.</p>
