          <p>A vessel carrying approximately 157 migrants, mostly Ethiopian nationals, sank off Yemen's southern coast due to severe weather. The tragedy has resulted in at least 68 confirmed deaths, with dozens still missing and only 12 rescued. This incident highlights the extreme dangers of the migration route from the Horn of Africa to Gulf states, a path described by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) as one of the world's most perilous. The IOM is advocating for safer, legal migration pathways to prevent such disasters, which are exacerbated by smugglers exploiting desperate individuals amidst Yemen's ongoing civil war.</p>

          <p>Over 3,000 Boeing defense workers in Missouri and Illinois have initiated a strike after rejecting the company's latest contract offer. The union members, who build F-15 fighter jets and other military hardware, cited inadequate pay, work schedules, and pension plans as reasons for the walkout. This marks the first strike at Boeing's defense business since 1996 and adds to the aviation giant's recent struggles with safety issues and other labor disputes. While the company expressed disappointment, its CEO downplayed the potential impact compared to a larger strike by passenger jet workers last year.</p>

          <p>China's leading electric vehicle manufacturer, BYD, reported its first monthly delivery decline of the year, signaling the impact of a fierce price war within the country's EV market. The company shipped over 341,000 units in July, a drop from the previous month, as it and competitors like Li Auto and Nio face stiff competition. This downturn follows significant price cuts by BYD earlier in the year, which prompted other automakers to follow suit and drew warnings from Beijing about excessive competition. Some rivals like Xpeng and Xiaomi managed to post delivery growth, indicating a shifting competitive landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hotel tycoon Ong Beng Seng has pleaded guilty to abetting the obstruction of justice in a major corruption case involving Singapore's former transport minister, Subramaniam Iswaran. Ong admitted to helping the ex-minister cover up evidence related to expensive gifts, including a private jet trip, that he had provided. The case has shocked the nation, known for its low tolerance for corruption among public officials. Due to Ong's poor health from a rare bone marrow cancer, prosecutors have recommended a fine instead of a jail sentence, citing "judicial mercy" in the high-profile scandal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes Manchester City's strategic direction, suggesting that the hiring of Pep Lijnders, Jürgen Klopp's former assistant at Liverpool, is the club's most significant summer move. The appointment indicates manager Pep Guardiola may be embracing a more direct, high-intensity style of play, moving away from his famous "positional play" philosophy. Recent player signings like Omar Marmoush and Rayan Cherki, who excel at carrying the ball, further support this theory. The move is seen as an adaptation to a Premier League trend favoring faster, transitional football, potentially heralding a major tactical evolution for the champions.</p>

This leads to a state of permanent disconnect, with failing governments and angry protest movements on both the left and right.

          <p>Former President Trump commented on a controversial American Eagle ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, stating he now "loves her ad" upon learning she is a registered Republican. The ad, which plays on the words "genes" and "jeans," had drawn mixed reactions, with some critics claiming it had racial undertones while supporters defended it as lighthearted marketing. Public records indicate the "Euphoria" actress is registered with the Republican Party of Florida. The article also notes that other political figures, like Vice President JD Vance, have weighed in on the social media uproar surrounding the campaign.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly advocating for expanded military operations in Gaza as a means to free the remaining hostages held by Hamas. According to an Israeli official, there is a growing belief in Israel that Hamas is not interested in a diplomatic deal, prompting a shift toward a "military solution." This development comes as thousands protested in Tel Aviv, demanding the government secure the hostages' release, some of whom are believed to be on the brink of death. The push for a military option coincides with intensifying global concern over the humanitarian and hunger crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A riot at a prison in Tuxpan, in the eastern Mexican state of Veracruz, has left seven inmates dead and eleven others wounded, according to regional authorities. The unrest reportedly broke out after prisoners protested alleged extortion and abuse by members of the Grupo Sombra criminal organization within the facility. The incident highlights the severe and ongoing issues plaguing Mexico's prison system, including overcrowding and the powerful influence of cartels and gangs. A 2012 report found that a majority of Mexican prisons were controlled by criminal organizations rather than state authorities.</p>

          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese aerospace researchers have proposed a novel upgrade to enhance the survival rate of combat drones against missile attacks. The concept involves fitting small and medium-sized drones with compact, side-mounted rocket boosters. This system would allow a drone to perform an instantaneous, high-G "terminal evasion" maneuver in the final seconds before impact, making it nearly impossible for tracking systems to follow. Digital simulations showed the system could increase a drone's survival probability to nearly 90%, a dramatic improvement over current battlefield performance.</p>
