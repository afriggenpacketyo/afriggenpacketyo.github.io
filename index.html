          <p>Pewabic Pottery, a Detroit institution founded in 1903, continues to flourish by maintaining its commitment to handcrafted ceramics, a contrast to the city's history of mass manufacturing. Despite Detroit's economic turmoil over the decades, the pottery has survived by focusing on the Arts and Crafts movement's principles, creating unique tiles and vessels with distinctive, iridescent glazes. Now operating as a nonprofit, Pewabic recently had its most successful year, demonstrating a renewed public appreciation for artisanal goods in an age of increasing automation and artificial intelligence. The studio's resilience highlights a business model that values craftsmanship.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is calling for stronger international sanctions against Russia after a major aerial assault on Kyiv killed at least 33 people, including five children. The attack, one of the deadliest in the capital since the full-scale invasion began, involved over 300 drones and multiple cruise missiles, damaging civilian infrastructure like an apartment block and a hospital. The United States has condemned the attack and indicated new sanctions are forthcoming, while Germany has pledged to deliver additional Patriot air defense systems to bolster Ukraine's defenses against ongoing Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported second-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations, even as net income fell 23% year-over-year due to lower global oil prices. The company's strong performance was driven by record production in the Permian Basin and Guyana, reaching its highest second-quarter output since the Exxon and Mobil merger. While profits from its production business declined, its refining division saw earnings increase by 44% thanks to higher margins. Exxon continues to return significant capital to shareholders, paying out $9.2 billion through dividends and share buybacks during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An NPR interview delves into the influence of political commentator Hasan Piker, one of the most prominent progressive voices on the streaming platform Twitch. The discussion addresses whether Piker serves as a left-wing counterpart to right-leaning figures like Joe Rogan, and examines his appeal to young men through a blend of "bro culture" and leftist politics. Piker argues that masculinity and hobbies like gaming are not inherently conservative and that Democrats need to focus on substantive policy changes rather than just charismatic messengers to win over voters. He also highlights the growing ideological investment in far-right ideas among young conservatives online.</p>

          <p>Amazon's stock fell approximately 7% despite reporting second-quarter results that largely surpassed expectations for revenue and profit. Investors were concerned by weaker-than-expected profit guidance and slowing growth in its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which grew 18% compared to stronger gains from rivals Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. The company announced it could spend up to $118 billion on capital expenditures this year, primarily to build out infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Amazon also noted it has effectively navigated recent trade tariffs without seeing a significant drop in consumer demand so far. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chevron's second-quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street estimates, although net income dropped by about 44% from the previous year because of lower crude oil prices. The company achieved record worldwide production of 3.4 million barrels per day, bolstered by a significant jump in U.S. output. Following its recently finalized $53 billion acquisition of Hess, Chevron expects the deal to start contributing to its earnings in the fourth quarter and to generate $1 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The company returned $5.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

Human Rights Watch has accused Israeli forces of war crimes, alleging they are using starvation as a weapon and gunning down civilians seeking aid.

          <p>A group of Senate Republicans, led by Senator Katie Britt of Alabama, is introducing legislation to prevent noncitizens and illegal immigrants from voting in local Washington, D.C. elections. The bill aims to repeal a 2022 D.C. City Council law that granted voting rights to noncitizen residents for municipal contests like school board and mayoral races. Citing reports of roughly 400 noncitizens voting in the 2024 general election, proponents argue the measure is necessary to protect the integrity of elections in the nation's capital. While federal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections, municipalities have the authority to set rules for local races.</p>

          <p>At the urging of Donald Trump, Texas Republicans have proposed a new congressional map that analysts describe as an aggressive gerrymander designed to secure five additional Republican seats. The plan would give the GOP a 30-to-8 advantage in the state's congressional delegation by packing Democratic voters into fewer districts and diluting the voting power of Hispanic communities in south and central Texas. The new map is being drawn amid an ongoing legal battle over the current districts, which are already being challenged for diminishing the influence of non-white voters. Critics argue the new proposal further violates the Voting Rights Act by creating majority-Hispanic districts that are designed to elect conservative candidates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has rebuked the new wave of U.S. tariffs, reiterating its clear opposition to what it calls protectionism and the arbitrary imposition of duties. A ministry spokesman warned that "there are no winners in tariff or trade wars" and that such measures will ultimately harm everyone involved. The statement came after the Trump administration imposed widespread tariffs on 69 trading partners, with most Asian economies facing levies of 15% to 20%, and Taiwan facing a 20% rate. While some analysts noted the final rates were lower than previously threatened for some smaller economies, they still represent a significant increase in trade barriers.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has confirmed that production of the new Oreshnik hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile has begun and that the weapon has entered military service. He stated that the missiles will be deployed to allied Belarus before the end of the year, with deployment sites already selected. The Oreshnik, which can carry conventional or nuclear warheads, was first used against Ukraine in November and is touted by Putin as being immune to interception due to its speed and multiple warheads. This deployment extends Russia's strike capability across Europe and follows a revised nuclear doctrine placing Belarus under Moscow's nuclear umbrella.</p>

The vehicle will be based on Joby's vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft but will use a gas turbine instead of being fully electric. The companies aim to begin testing this fall, with operational demonstrations planned for 2026, targeting applications like airborne surveillance and logistics in contested environments. The partnership reflects a growing military interest in smaller, cheaper, and more adaptable autonomous aircraft for low-altitude support missions.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman have publicly explained their recent votes to cut interest rates, arguing that the central bank's decision to hold rates steady is "overly cautious." In separate statements, both officials, who dissented from the 9-2 vote, expressed concern that delaying a rate cut could lead to a deterioration in the labor market and slower economic growth. They contended that the inflationary impact from tariffs is likely temporary and should be overlooked. Waller suggested a gradual easing of up to 1.5 percentage points, while Bowman also backed gradual cuts to avoid policy falling "behind the curve."</p>

          <p>Switzerland has been hit with a surprise 39% tariff rate by the U.S., a much higher figure than the 10-15% that had been anticipated based on deals struck with other nations like the EU and Japan. The move has shocked the Swiss business community, with manufacturing associations warning it could put tens of thousands of jobs at risk, as the U.S. is one of its largest export markets. While the Swiss government has expressed "great regret" and continues to seek a negotiated solution, the news caused the Swiss franc to slide and hit the stock of companies like Watches of Switzerland. There is some hope for a reprieve, as the tariffs are not set to take effect until August 7.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of U.S. Department of Education employees are marking their last day after being laid off as part of a major reduction-in-force that will cut the agency's staff by roughly half. In interviews with NPR, departing civil servants described their roles in managing grants, analyzing data, and protecting the civil rights of students with disabilities. They expressed deep concern that the staff cuts will cripple the department's ability to ensure taxpayer dollars are used properly and to enforce laws guaranteeing educational access. The former employees argue that the move, framed by the administration as a way to increase efficiency, will create a self-fulfilling prophecy of government failure.</p>

          <p>The U.S. job market weakened significantly in early summer, with employers adding only 73,000 jobs in July as the administration's new trade tariffs began to take hold. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.2%, and job gains from the previous two months were largely revised away. The manufacturing sector, a supposed beneficiary of the trade policies, shed 11,000 jobs as factory managers cited uncertainty over import taxes. The slowdown in hiring is increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, even as concerns persist that tariffs could drive up inflation.</p>

          <p>An interest-free payment pause for millions of federal student loan borrowers enrolled in the SAVE forbearance plan ended on August 1st. Borrowers who do not make payments large enough to cover accruing interest will now see their debt balances grow again. The Trump administration, which has called the Biden-era SAVE plan illegal, stated the Education Department lacks the authority to grant a zero-percent interest rate. Experts advise the nearly 7.7 million affected borrowers to quickly find a new repayment plan, such as the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, to avoid significant interest charges, though IBR payments will likely be higher than they were under SAVE.</p>
