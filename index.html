          <p>Esther Ghey, mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey, has voiced her frustration with the government's approach to online safety, emphasizing the dangers young people face online. Brianna was murdered by two 15-year-olds, one of whom had been consuming violent content online, while Brianna herself had viewed material promoting self-harm. Ghey's criticism comes amid concerns that the Online Safety Bill could be weakened to secure trade deals, a suggestion she finds "shocking." She supports the Behind Our Screens campaign, urging stricter measures to protect young people's mental health from harmful online content and calling for a ban on smartphone social media access for children under 16.</p>

          <p>Kyle McDaniel, a member of the Fairfax County School Board in Virginia, is being sued by Blue Label Aviation, a local flight school, for allegedly embezzling $175,000 for personal expenses. The lawsuit claims McDaniel, who also served as the company's secretary and treasurer, used a company credit card for strip clubs, family vacations, and campaign-related costs. After being confronted, McDaniel repaid some of the money but allegedly continued to embezzle funds, leading to his termination. McDaniel denies the allegations, stating it's an ongoing business dispute and that he intends to prevail in court, remaining focused on public education.</p>

          <p>Trinity Rodman scored in the fifth minute of her return from a lengthy injury absence, and the US women’s national team beat Brazil 2-0 Saturday in a rematch of the 2024 Olympic final. Captain Lindsey Heaps scored a second-half penalty for the Americans in the first of two California friendlies in four days against Brazil, who lost 2-1 in Paris as the US secured their fifth Olympic gold medal. Despite Rodman’s return, the US are playing this spring without 13 members of their Olympic team from Paris due to injuries, retirement and personal leaves.</p>

          <p>The government in England is set to launch a consultation for its men's health strategy, prompted by the fact that men are more likely to die prematurely than women. Men are more prone to smoking, alcohol consumption, drug use, and high cholesterol, contributing to a lower life expectancy. The strategy aims to address these issues by improving men's access to health services and promoting healthier lifestyles, while also considering the impact of deprivation and social expectations on men's health.</p>

          <p>A family has been awarded damages after a mother died from cervical cancer due to misreported screening results. Louise Gleadell's cervical screening tests in 2008 and 2012 were wrongly reported as negative, leading to a missed opportunity for early treatment. An internal review found the samples were inadequate but this information was not shared with Gleadell or her family. The NHS trust has apologized for the mistakes and their devastating consequences.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imports represents a significant shift away from the free trade policies that have underpinned US economic might for decades. The tariffs, aimed at reducing the trade deficit and reshoring manufacturing jobs, have sparked concerns about potential trade wars and economic fallout. While the administration argues that these measures will benefit American workers, critics warn of higher consumer costs and damage to global trade relationships.</p>
