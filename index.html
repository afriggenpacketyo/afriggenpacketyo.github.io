          <p>Donald Trump and Elon Musk, once allies, have engaged in a public feud, drawing responses from billionaires, politicians, and pundits. The dispute began with Trump criticizing Musk's views on the Republican tax-cut and spending bill, escalating into online exchanges on Truth Social and X. Bill Ackman urged them to reconcile, while Steve Bannon suggested Trump seize SpaceX. Mark Cuban endorsed Musk's idea for a new political party, and European officials also weighed in, highlighting the widespread attention the feud has garnered. The unexpected and public nature of their falling out has sparked debate across various sectors. Optimism surrounding the state of politics and the ability for world leaders to get along is waning in the face of the feud.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian Air Force reported ballistic strikes on Kyiv, with air defense measures activated in the capital city. Kyiv's Mayor Vitaly Klitschko stated that three people were injured in the attacks, and Russian drones were entering the city, urging residents to seek shelter. Metro tracks between two stations were damaged, and cruise missiles targeted multiple regions. The escalation of attacks follows failed U.S.-brokered peace talks, and there is evidence Russia is retaliating for recent drone strikes on its military sites, damaging or destroying at least 11 Russian bomber aircraft and one large transport plane in Ukraine's drone attack against Russia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of criminal cases in England and Wales are collapsing annually due to lost, damaged, or missing police evidence. Data from the Crown Prosecution Service reveals over 30,000 prosecutions failed between October 2020 and September 2024, including serious violent and sexual offences. The BBC's investigation, alongside the University of Leicester, found a rise in cases recorded as an "E72," indicating failures due to unavailable evidence. A lack of resources and the loss of the dedicated Forensic Science Service in 2012 are contributing factors, with police forces struggling to manage the increasing amount of physical and digital evidence. Victim Support emphasizes the need for thorough investigations and sensitive evidence handling to ensure justice for all survivors of crimes.</p>

          <p>Private equity's annual SuperReturn conference in Berlin revealed concerns about the sector's ability to generate top returns, as a previously forecast boom in M&A and IPO activity has not materialized. The industry is under pressure due to headwinds from geopolitical tension and volatility in public markets, leading to companies staying private for longer. Despite these challenges, attendees defended private equity, highlighting growth areas like European defense firms and Middle Eastern data centers. Some argue that private equity outperforms public markets over the long term, although many firms may have overpaid for companies during the recent period of ultra-low interest rates. The sector is adapting with new trends such as continuation vehicles and NAV lending to address liquidity challenges.</p>

Russia claimed its air defenses shot down 174 Ukrainian drones overnight in parts of Russia and occupied Crimea. Zelensky called on the US, Europe, and the world to pressure Russia, while Trump said Putin vowed to respond strongly to Ukraine's recent attacks on Russian airbases.

          <p>Job growth is expected to have slowed in May due to business uncertainty and recession concerns influenced by President Donald Trump's fluctuating tariffs. Economists anticipate the U.S. added 125,000 jobs in May, a decrease from the previous month's 177,000. Recent trade agreements, such as the U.S.-China accord, have eased some tariffs, triggering a stock market surge. However, major companies like Pepsi and Goldman Sachs have warned of potential losses due to ongoing tariff uncertainty, and consumer spending could weaken if import costs rise. Despite these concerns, the unemployment rate remains historically low, and inflation has cooled. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s policies are sparking debate over the concept of "medical freedom." While advocating for personal health decisions without coercion, Kennedy has limited choices on certain products, such as COVID-19 vaccines. He has also called for restrictions on food stamp recipients purchasing soda and praised states for banning fluoride from public drinking water. Public health experts argue that Kennedy's actions create a dichotomy on public health, shifting the focus from community to individuals and potentially restricting access to preventive medicine.

          <p>The feud between President Trump and Elon Musk raises questions about the future of SpaceX and Tesla, both of which have benefited from significant federal support. Trump threatened to end Musk's government subsidies and contracts, prompting skepticism due to the deep ties between Musk's companies and the government. SpaceX plays a crucial role in the U.S. space program, while Tesla has been a major beneficiary of federal support for electric vehicles. Analysts suggest that while the political partnership may be over, it is difficult to imagine the government canceling SpaceX contracts anytime soon. The end of federal programs aimed at growing the EV sector would not damage Tesla as severely as other problems the automaker is confronting.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rehired Matthew O'Brien, an immigration judge who was fired under Biden, and promoted him to an assistant chief immigration judge. O'Brien has a history of hardline stances on immigration and a high rate of asylum denial. This move raises questions about the impartiality of immigration judges, who are supposed to make unbiased decisions. Critics argue that the rehiring could signal a shift toward a "deportation factory," undermining the court's role as a neutral arbiter. The Justice Department defended the decision, stating that all judges must decide matters impartially, based on the law.</p>

The ruling reverses a 2022 decision that held the executives liable for compensation.

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a new radar technology that can track moving targets without breaking radio silence. The innovation, led by Li Zhongyu at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, involves a "space-time decoupling two-channel clutter cancellation method." This allows a silent aircraft to detect moving vehicles with crystal clarity, even in cluttered environments. The technology has potential applications in both military and civilian sectors, providing a new approach to surveillance and target detection.</p>

The Home Builders Federation supports fitting more panels but cautions against burdensome paperwork that could hinder government efforts to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. The Labour government's plan promises universal solar panel installation, with exceptions only in rare cases.

The move was taken as inflation had significantly softened, and growth has been "lower than our aspirations amidst a challenging global environment and heightened uncertainty." RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said the Indian economy presents a picture of strength, stability and opportunity. The decision comes as India's inflation is largely on a downtrend, with the most recent headline inflation reading for April at 3.16%, its lowest level since July 2019. (not investment advice)</p>
