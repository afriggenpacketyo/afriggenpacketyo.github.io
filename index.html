          <p>A student suspected of opening fire at Evergreen High School in Colorado has died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound following an on-campus shooting. The incident, which occurred Wednesday afternoon, left two other students in critical condition and a fourth with non-life-threatening injuries. Authorities are currently investigating the motive and have obtained warrants to search the suspect's home and school locker. The event has prompted statements of devastation from state officials, including Governor Jared Polis, as the community grapples with the aftermath of the violence.</p>

          <p>The killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has drawn widespread condemnation from across the American political spectrum, uniting figures who often stand on opposing ideological grounds. Former presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton all released statements denouncing the violence and offering condolences to Kirk's family. President Trump, a close associate of Kirk, blamed inflammatory rhetoric from the "radical left" for the attack. The article highlights a rare moment of bipartisan agreement in mourning and in the call to reject political violence in the United States.</p>

          <p>China has opened the Changtai Yangtze River Bridge, now the world's longest cable-stayed bridge, significantly enhancing transportation infrastructure in the eastern Jiangsu province. The 10.3-kilometer structure connects the cities of Changzhou and Taizhou, reducing travel time between them from over an hour to just 20 minutes. Uniquely, the bridge is the first of its kind to integrate an expressway, a standard road, and an intercity railway on a single structure. Its innovative asymmetrical design, placing the heavier railway alongside the road, represents a significant engineering achievement for the country.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index surged to a new record high on Thursday, reflecting investor optimism driven by hopes for a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut and favorable inflation data. The rally was significantly propelled by tech investment giant SoftBank Group, whose shares jumped nearly 10%. This positive performance in the Japanese market contrasts with mixed results across other Asian exchanges, such as Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, which saw a decline. The gains mirror a record-setting session on Wall Street, where the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also reached new closing highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has officially appealed a federal judge's order that temporarily blocks him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb stated that Cook's reinstatement serves the public interest in maintaining the Federal Reserve's independence. Trump sought to remove Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies.

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, experts on domestic terrorism are warning of a potential "vicious spiral" of political violence in the United States. Researchers note a significant increase in politically motivated attacks this year, attributing the rise to economic insecurity, demographic anxiety, and inflammatory political rhetoric. The article suggests that Kirk's killing could act as a flashpoint, inspiring retaliatory violence in an already deeply fractured nation. This analysis comes amid other recent high-profile attacks and a shift in federal focus away from domestic extremism.</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox delivered an emotional statement condemning the fatal shooting of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk as a "political assassination."

The governor also reflected on a broader trend of political violence in the nation, describing the country as "broken" in the wake of this and other recent attacks.</p>

          <p>A significant portion of West Virginia's rural population, estimated at around 250,000 residents, lacks access to reliable and treated drinking water.

Crumbling infrastructure at treatment plants in towns like Kimball and Rhodell highlights the severity of the crisis.

She also expresses frustration with Biden's inner circle, claiming they failed to defend her from negative narratives and sometimes added to them.

Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the expiration, attributing it to inaction by Republicans in Congress and warning of increased traffic and pollution.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, who died at 31 after being shot in Utah, is being remembered as one of the most influential figures in modern young conservatism. At just 18, he founded Turning Point USA, building it into a powerful organization with a significant presence on college campuses and a massive online following. Kirk became a key ally of President Trump and a leading voice in the MAGA movement, advocating for free markets and limited government while often generating controversy. His work was credited with mobilizing young voters and playing a role in national Republican politics.</p>

          <p>Following a successful initial public offering where its stock climbed 14.55% on the first day, financial technology company Klarna is still considered a buying opportunity by CNBC's Jim Cramer. The Swedish online lender, known for its "buy now, pay later" services, has demonstrated solid growth and improving fundamentals, with shrinking earnings losses in recent years. While the company is not yet profitable, its strong underwriting standards and diverse revenue streams from transaction fees, advertising, and consumer financing suggest a positive outlook. The success of competitors like Affirm also bodes well for its market potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California state lawmakers have introduced a bill to significantly reform Measure ULA, Los Angeles's so-called "mansion tax," in an effort to stimulate housing construction. The proposed legislation would drastically reduce the tax rate for sellers of newly constructed apartment buildings and commercial properties. Critics of Measure ULA argue that it has had a chilling effect on development since its passage in 2022. The overhaul is part of a broader political strategy to counter a statewide ballot initiative that would nullify the tax entirely, creating a complex legislative battle over housing policy and local taxation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Traditional television cooking shows, once a staple of broadcast schedules, are experiencing a dramatic decline in viewership and new commissions. This shift is attributed to the rise of food content on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok, where creators can be more nimble, authentic, and directly responsive to audience trends. While TV productions are constrained by high costs, regulatory compliance, and lengthy development cycles, online influencers offer a raw, immediate style that resonates with younger audiences. This trend reflects a broader cultural shift as viewers increasingly favor user-generated content over professionally produced programming.</p>

          <p>An investigation by BBC Eye and partner organizations has uncovered the role of an international charity, SOS Children's Villages, in the disappearance of children during Syria's civil war. The report alleges that the charity, influenced by the Assad regime, held children of detained parents in its facilities, changed their identities, and prevented relatives from contacting them. Whistleblowers claim senior positions at SOS Syria were appointed by the Assad palace. The findings are part of a larger effort to trace over 3,700 children who went missing under the dictatorship, a search now possible after the regime's fall.</p>

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of CNBC's "Squawk Box," host Jim Cramer reflected on the evolution of investor sentiment since the show's inception. He recalled the 1990s as a time of widespread excitement for individual stocks, a spirit he sees returning to today's market after years dominated by index fund investing. Cramer credited the program with helping to "democratize" market information, making it more accessible to the general public. He noted that after the dot-com bubble burst, many investors became risk-averse, but today's high-performing stocks are once again highlighting the potential rewards of individual stock ownership.</p>

He advocated for exporting cohesive American "AI tech stacks"—which include chips, algorithms, and applications—to allies as a strategy to prevent China from gaining global market share.

The 23-year-old plaintiff claims the driver forced her out of the vehicle late at night after she vomited, leaving her miles from her destination without her phone or keys. According to the suit, she was then approached by two individuals who offered help but instead took her to an apartment where she was assaulted at knifepoint.

The investigation focuses on "dark DNA," the mysterious, non-gene portions of the genetic code, which these spiders possess in large quantities. Scientists hypothesize that this dark DNA may enable the spiders to adapt and evolve into new species rapidly in response to environmental changes. By examining this extreme case of variation, the research aims to uncover fundamental principles that drive the evolution and diversity of all life on Earth.</p>
