          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, prohibiting broad, untargeted immigration arrests in several California counties. The ruling responds to a lawsuit from advocacy groups alleging unconstitutional racial profiling and warrantless arrests by federal agents, particularly targeting Latino communities. In response, the Department of Homeland Security criticized the decision, asserting its agents are removing dangerous criminals. Concurrently, President Trump authorized law enforcement to arrest individuals who assault them during enforcement operations, following clashes between protesters and agents.</p>

          <p>Russia has escalated its aerial attacks on Ukraine, launching hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight, resulting in civilian casualties and significant damage in western cities like Chernivtsi and Lviv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed the scale of the assault, which damaged residential buildings and critical infrastructure. Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov arrived in Pyongyang for discussions with North Korean officials, highlighting the deepening military and political alliance between the two nations.

          <p>WWE superstar Drew McIntyre is set for an in-ring return against Randy Orton, a match set up after McIntyre criticized Orton's perceived loss of his "Legend Killer" instinct. In an interview, McIntyre shared his candid thoughts, stating he tells the truth and is not a "bad guy" for it. He expressed a desire to face Cody Rhodes for the championship, dismissing the current version of John Cena as someone he doesn't want to compete against. McIntyre emphasized the parallel careers he and Rhodes have had, suggesting a potential match between them would be a significant and compelling story.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited Texas following catastrophic flooding that claimed over 100 lives, where he praised the swift response from state and local officials. During a roundtable, Trump met with victims' families and deflected questions about the adequacy of the warning systems, calling such inquiries "evil." The visit occurred against a backdrop of uncertainty regarding the future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which Trump has previously suggested overhauling to place more responsibility on states. While federal officials emphasized a supporting role, the administration has not clarified its long-term plans for the disaster agency.</p>

Cockpit voice recordings captured one pilot asking the other why they cut the fuel, with the other denying having done so.

While ideologically aligned on many issues, the party is wary of a close association with Trump, whose policies and persona are viewed negatively by a majority of French voters, including some of their own supporters. Analysts suggest the party is distancing itself to avoid alienating moderate voters and to protect its blue-collar base from potentially harmful US tariffs.

Prien suggested a cap of 30-40% could be a "conceivable model" to improve educational outcomes, but the idea has drawn sharp criticism from educators, researchers, and student groups. Opponents argue that such a policy would be discriminatory, stigmatizing, and organizationally unfeasible, shifting focus from the real issue of inadequate German language skills. Critics and supporters alike agree that Germany's education system needs reform, but they are deeply divided on whether a quota is a productive solution.</p>

          <p>According to Palestinian officials, negotiations in Qatar for a new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas are on the brink of collapse. The officials claim Israel's delegation lacked the authority to make decisions and deliberately stalled the talks, using them to "buy time" during Prime Minister Netanyahu's visit to Washington. Deep divisions reportedly remain on key issues, including the mechanism for aid distribution and the extent of the Israeli military's withdrawal from Gaza. A map provided by Israel showing its proposed withdrawal zones was seen by Hamas as a bad-faith maneuver, further eroding trust between the two sides.</p>

          <p>Among the victims of the catastrophic July Fourth flood in Kerrville, Texas, was Jane Ragsdale, the beloved owner and director of the Heart O' the Hills camp for girls. Ragsdale, who was in her late 60s, was a central figure in the community, known for her generosity, kindness, and dedication to educating generations of young women. While the camp she ran was between sessions, she was the sole person killed on its grounds by the flooding Guadalupe River. Friends and community members remember her as a deeply involved and compassionate leader who embodied the spirit of the region and will be profoundly missed.</p>

          <p>A Chinese academic is analyzing the growing alignment between parts of the U.S. tech industry and the MAGA political movement, suggesting this "uneasy alliance" could backfire. The research, published in a Chinese journal, notes the trend of tech leaders deepening ties with the U.S. defense industry and adopting a more hawkish stance toward China. The analyst, Shi Bowei, questions whether these tech leaders will evolve into aggressive advocates for interventionism. However, he also posits that underlying tensions between the tech elite and the broader MAGA camp could ultimately undermine their political influence, particularly regarding China policy.</p>
