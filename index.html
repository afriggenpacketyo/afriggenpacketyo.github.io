          <h2>UK Government Invests Millions to Expand GP Surgeries</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 23:45:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is allocating Â£102 million to over 1,000 GP surgeries to facilitate upgrades and expansions, aiming to improve patient access and reduce waiting times. Health Secretary Wes Streeting emphasized that this investment, the largest in five years, will modernize facilities and enable doctors to treat more patients. This initiative is part of a broader plan to overhaul the health service and address the "08:00 scramble" for same-day appointments, with nearly 45% of GP appointments occurring on the day they are booked. The government hopes this will boost patient satisfaction, which has declined since the pandemic due to fewer in-person appointments. Ruth Rankine of the NHS Confederation welcomed the investment as vital for shifting care from hospitals to the community.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full investigation into the FAA due to ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, where hundreds of flights have been delayed or canceled. Schumer attributed the problems to a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, FAA cuts, outdated technology, and depleted federal funds. He highlighted the need to address critical leadership vacancies and scrutinize the FAA's administrative, operational, and capital functions. United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights a day at Newark because of the disruptions, and the FAA instituted a "flow constrained area." Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is expected to release a plan to revamp the air traffic control system, but passengers are currently facing significant frustration and delays.</p>

          <p>A scheduled Central Park performance by R&B singer Kehlani has been canceled due to pressure from New York City officials, citing security concerns. This decision follows a previous cancellation at Cornell University, where officials cited Kehlani's pro-Palestinian stance as antisemitic. First Deputy Mayor Randy M. Mastro warned the City Parks Foundation that its license to stage the SummerStage concert series could be at risk if the concert proceeded. Kehlani, who has been an outspoken critic of Israel's actions, expressed being unfazed by the cancellation and reaffirmed commitment to their art and mission. PEN America criticized the cancellation as a "cowardly" act of elected officials dictating acceptable expression.</p>

          <p>Michael Rogers, the FDA's top official overseeing drug and food safety inspections, has abruptly retired after more than three decades at the agency. His departure comes amid reported frustration among inspectors with the new FDA Commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary, and sweeping cuts to the agency's ranks. Makary's plans to expand foreign surprise inspections while cutting the length of foreign inspection trips have been met with skepticism. Officials warn of a drain on morale due to long-running challenges with hiring and retaining investigators. Concerns have been raised that cutting trip lengths without cutting corners on oversight is impossible.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to admit approximately 12,000 refugees into the United States, partially blocking the president's efforts to suspend the refugee admissions program. The order follows a dispute over the interpretation of a federal appeals court ruling. The judge criticized the government's attempts to limit the number of refugees admitted, emphasizing the need to adhere to statutory and constitutional law. The decision provides relief to refugees who had been approved for travel to the U.S. and had made significant life changes in anticipation of resettlement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's workforce reduction plan for the IRS has led to a significant departure of tax auditors, with almost one-third leaving the agency by March. These cuts, part of a broader effort by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), raise concerns about the IRS's ability to collect tax revenue, particularly from wealthy individuals and corporations. While the Treasury Department claims these measures improve efficiency, experts warn that losing experienced auditors could reduce federal revenue and encourage tax non-compliance. The Partnership for Public Service estimates that the cost-cutting efforts may offset savings due to lost productivity and legal expenses.</p>
