            <p>The United Nations is warning about the proliferation of multi-billion-dollar cyber scams, originating in Asia and now expanding to Africa, Europe, South America, and the Pacific. These scams, often involving investment, cryptocurrency, and romance fraud, are operated by crime syndicates that force trafficked workers to con people online.

            <p>The US supreme court on Monday heard arguments in a case that could threaten Americans’ access to free preventive healthcare services under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. At issue is the constitutionality of the US preventive services taskforce, which plays a critical role in determining which preventive services health insurers must cover without cost to patients. A big critic of the program during his first term, Trump and his administration have now taken over the case after the Biden administration initially filed the appeal.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court is hearing arguments in a case that could jeopardize Americans' access to free preventive healthcare services under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The case challenges the constitutionality of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which determines which preventive services health insurers must cover without cost to patients. A ruling against the government could lead to co-pays and deductibles for essential screenings and treatments, potentially deterring many Americans from seeking preventive care.</p>
