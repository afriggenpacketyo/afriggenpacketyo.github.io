          <p>A former Disney World employee, Michael Scheuer, received a three-year prison sentence for hacking into the park's menu system. Scheuer, a former menu production manager, altered allergy information, added profanities, and changed fonts, though none of his changes reached the public. The company incurred damages exceeding $150,000 due to his actions, which Disney characterized as threatening public health and safety. Scheuer's attorney claimed his client had a disability and was unfairly terminated, leading to the hacking as a form of retaliation after Disney failed to address his concerns and provide accommodations.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the United States are in discussions to establish a "minerals-for-security" agreement aimed at stabilizing the conflict-ridden eastern region of the DRC. Kinshasa is offering the US access to its vast mineral resources in exchange for security guarantees, military support, and increased American investment. This initiative seeks to reduce the DRC's reliance on China, which currently dominates the mining industry in the country. The arrangement could potentially shift the balance of power in the region, providing the US with a new avenue for accessing critical minerals while addressing security concerns in the DRC.</p>

          <p>Gestamp, a major manufacturer of metal parts for cars, is pursuing acquisition opportunities in China's automotive sector, despite a trend among international firms to reduce their presence. The Spanish company, which supplies chassis and body products to clients like Volkswagen and Ford, sees potential in the consolidation of unprofitable assemblers and supply-chain vendors. Gestamp aims to invest more, grow, and develop stronger relationships with Chinese car assemblers, becoming their partners both in China and abroad as they expand internationally. This move reflects a strategic bet on the future of the Chinese EV market, prioritizing safety and low-weight technologies.</p>

The rivalry extends beyond the pitch, fueled by historical factors like River Plate's relocation from a working-class neighborhood to a wealthier suburb, earning them the nickname 'Los Millonarios.' Boca Juniors, in contrast, remains in their traditional working-class home, La Bombonera, maintaining their Italian immigrant roots and identity as 'Xeneize'.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor is considering investing in a potential $42 billion buyout of Toyota Industries, a key parts supplier. Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda and his family may propose acquiring Toyota Industries, although Toyota Industries denies receiving a buyout proposal from the Toyota chairman or the Toyota group. The move could improve corporate governance by unwinding cross-shareholdings and allowing Toyota Industries to focus on growth strategies without shareholder pressure. Toyota currently owns 24% of Toyota Industries, while Toyota Industries holds shares in Toyota and Denso. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chris Eubank Jr. defeated Conor Benn after 12 grueling rounds at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, marking the culmination of a rivalry steeped in history and drama. The fight gained additional emotional weight with the unexpected arrival of Chris Eubank Sr., who had been estranged from his son for years, a reconciliation that seemed to give Eubank Jr. an edge. The two fighters inherited a bloodline feud from their fathers iconic duel in the 1990s. The victory followed a controversial two-year period after Benn failed a drugs test, which led to the cancellation of their scheduled 2022 bout, and the fighters reconciled with their fathers in the ring after the match.</p>

Liao Shihao, a third-generation coffee plantation owner, notes that people are seeking a more immersive experience with hand-drip coffee, moving away from commercialized varieties.

          <p>A peace proposal from the Trump administration, which includes recognizing Russian authority over Crimea, has been met with resistance from Ukrainian officials. Ukrainian officials have stated they will not accept any formal surrender of the peninsula, even though they expect to concede the territory to the Kremlin, at least temporarily. Experts say that formally surrendering the land would permanently relinquish Crimea and abandon the hope that Ukraine could regain it in the future, and is also politically and legally impossible.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court will hear a case involving Trina Martin, whose Atlanta home was mistakenly raided by FBI agents in 2017, to determine under what circumstances people can sue the federal government for law enforcement accountability. The FBI, looking for a suspected gang member, raided Martin's home based on incorrect GPS data, traumatizing her and her family. Martin's lawyers argue that Congress intended to allow such lawsuits and that blocking them would leave families with no recourse. The government contends that the agents made an "honest mistake" and that courts shouldn't second-guess law enforcement decisions.</p>

          <p>Australia is contemplating capping the number of international students as a measure to address unaffordable housing, a key concern for voters.

This shift represents a significant change for Australia, which has historically promoted international education as a major economic sector. Critics, however, argue that international students contribute more than they cost and that the focus should be on improving selection criteria rather than implementing blanket restrictions.</p>
