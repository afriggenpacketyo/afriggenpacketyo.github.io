          <p>President Trump's nomination of Dr. Casey Means, a wellness specialist, as surgeon general has ignited controversy, particularly from figures like Laura Loomer, who questioned her lack of a current medical license and her embrace of alternative medicine. Despite the criticism, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended Means, citing her ability to inspire Americans to rethink the healthcare system. Means's brother, Calley Means, also defended his sister, emphasizing her commitment to addressing the root causes of disease. The surgeon general's role is largely symbolic, focused on public health advocacy and communication, as highlighted by former FDA head Dr. David A. Kessler, making Dr. Means's communication skills a key asset.</p>

          <p>President Trump unveiled a new trade pact with the UK, but the details reveal limited substantive changes and the 10% import tax on most UK goods will remain intact. The White House framed the deal as a breakthrough, while the UK highlighted relief for steelmakers and car firms due to tariff rollbacks. However, goods from the UK still face higher tariffs than before the deal and the benefits for the US are limited. Analysts suggest Trump's primary goal is to announce deals, regardless of their actual impact, and American carmakers expressed concerns that the agreement favors UK imports.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., after withdrawing his previous nominee, Ed Martin. Pirro, a former Republican district attorney and staunch Trump supporter, will step down from Fox News to assume the role. Her appointment raises legal questions about circumventing Senate confirmation processes, as she replaces one interim appointee with another. Pirro's past includes defending Trump, questioning the validity of the 2020 election, and having her former husband pardoned by Trump, while Martin will move to the Justice Department to lead the â€œWeaponization Working Group.</p>

          <p>China's recent stimulus measures, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, have failed to boost its stock market due to persistent worries about economic deterioration and the ongoing trade war with the U.S. The stimulus package, intended to revive growth, was largely priced in by markets, and analysts believe more targeted fiscal measures are needed to boost consumer sentiment and support the real estate sector. Unlike previous stimulus efforts, this round is more focused on industrial and social needs rather than direct market support. Investors are awaiting more effective plans to prop up the real estate sector for a meaningful rally.</p>

          <p>A watchdog report reveals that at least 119 Amtrak employees and doctors participated in a $12 million health fraud scheme involving cash kickbacks for fraudulent medical claims. Healthcare providers filed false claims for services never rendered or medically unnecessary, bilking Amtrak's health plan out of millions between 2019 and 2022. While some employees have retired or resigned, and a dozen have been criminally charged, sixty-one are still employed by Amtrak.

          <p>Chinese academics are proposing a revision of World War II history, arguing that its start date should be moved back to 1931 with Japan's invasion of Manchuria. This perspective aims to highlight China's role as a frontline against fascism, challenging the Western-centric view that marks Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland as the beginning of the global conflict. The academics made these points at a history seminar in Beijing, coinciding with the 80th anniversary of the war's end. President Xi Jinping is set to attend Victory Day celebrations in Moscow, underscoring China's engagement with the war's legacy.</p>

          <p>UCLA's medical school is facing a federal class-action lawsuit accusing it of using race as a factor in admissions, despite legal prohibitions against affirmative action. The lawsuit, brought by activist groups, alleges that the school's associate dean for admissions requires applicants to submit responses revealing their race and that race is openly discussed and used in admission decisions. The lawsuit also claims that Black applicants with lower GPA and MCAT scores are routinely admitted, while white and Asian applicants are held to higher standards. This legal challenge comes amid broader scrutiny of UC campuses for potential illegal DEI practices in admissions.</p>

In return, the US agreed to allow Britain to export 100,000 cars annually with a 10% tariff and will remove additional tariffs on steel and aluminum. The deal expands market access for American beef and bioethanol in the UK, while the UK gains a tariff-free quota of 13,000 tons for beef.

          <p>The LAPD arrested a 44-year-old man suspected of cutting down 13 trees in downtown Los Angeles, using surveillance footage and community tips to track him down. Samuel Patrick Groft, found with a spray-painted electric chainsaw, has pleaded not guilty to felony vandalism charges. The bizarre crime spree, initially unnoticed, caused over $170,000 in damages, with officers from multiple divisions and helpful tips leading to Groft's arrest at a homeless encampment. While a motive remains unclear, Groft reportedly expressed his love for trees upon arrest.</p>

          <p>A new experimental hybrid documentary called "Pavements" explores the 90's indie-rock band Pavement by combining documentary footage, scenes from a staged musical, an art gallery dedicated to the band's ephemera, and a parody of a Hollywood biopic. Director Alex Ross Perry wanted to make a movie from the perspective of Pavement being the worldâ€™s most important and influential band, building a fictional world where their music inspired shrines, a museum, a Broadway show, and a biopic. The film captures the band's creative unruliness and enigmatic allure, preserving their legacy through irony and misdirection.</p>
