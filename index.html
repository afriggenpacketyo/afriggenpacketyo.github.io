          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina, but it continues to pose a significant threat due to heavy rainfall. The system is causing widespread flooding across the Carolinas, with some areas receiving up to six inches of rain, leading to road collapses and the evacuation of residents near swelling rivers. Forecasters warn that even as the storm weakens and moves northeast, dangerous surf and rip currents will persist along the Atlantic coast for several days. Emergency services are actively rescuing stranded motorists, though no immediate injuries have been reported.</p>

          <p>Authorities have recovered the bodies of seven victims who were reported missing following a massive explosion at a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, California. The blast, which occurred at a facility owned by Devastating Pyrotechnics, followed a fire and triggered a subsequent brush fire, with dramatic video capturing the incident. The victims are believed to be employees of the warehouse, although officials have not yet released their identities pending family notification. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is among the agencies investigating the cause of the deadly explosion.</p>

Musk announced the formation of the party on social media, positioning it as a challenge to the Republican and Democratic 'Uniparty.'

          <p>Leaders of the BRICS group of developing nations, meeting in Rio de Janeiro, have issued a joint statement condemning President Trump's 'indiscriminate' tariff policies as inconsistent with WTO rules. Brazilian President Lula da Silva opened the summit by decrying the 'collapse of multilateralism.' In response, Trump announced via social media that any country aligning with what he termed the 'Anti-American policies of BRICS' will face an additional 10% tariff. The summit was notably missing Chinese President Xi Jinping, while Russian President Vladimir Putin attended via videoconference to avoid potential arrest under an ICC warrant.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy has successfully reversed a form of congenital deafness, with a clinical trial showing significant hearing improvement in all ten participants within weeks of a single injection. The treatment delivers a healthy copy of the OTOF gene, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain, directly into the inner ear. Researchers from Sweden’s Karolinska Institutet reported that the therapy was safe and most effective in younger participants, with one seven-year-old girl regaining nearly all of her hearing. The success of this trial opens the door for developing similar therapies for other genetic causes of deafness.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating pressure on trading partners to finalize new trade agreements, warning that higher tariffs could be implemented on August 1 for countries without a deal. White House officials confirmed that letters will be sent to dozens of nations, outlining the impending duties and urging swift negotiations. President Trump also announced an additional 10% tariff for any country aligning with the BRICS bloc, which he accused of having 'Anti-American policies.' This move intensifies global trade tensions and creates further uncertainty for importers, following a 90-day pause on sweeping tariff hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

They argue that these legally binding documents are 'precious legal protections' that ensure necessary support from local authorities and prevent children from losing access to education. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has described the issue as complex and has not ruled out scrapping the plans, stating the government is focused on strengthening support. Critics, however, accuse the government of 'broken promises' amid a significant rise in the number of children requiring EHCPs.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's call to launch a new 'America Party' faces a daunting reality of legal, logistical, and financial challenges, according to election law experts. Creating a new national party is an extremely complex and expensive endeavor, requiring navigation of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are heavily biased toward the two major parties. The process involves collecting vast numbers of signatures, winning certain vote percentages, and likely facing intense legal challenges from Democrats and Republicans. Experts suggest that while Musk's wealth could fund the effort, building a viable third party would be a multi-year project costing hundreds of millions.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitchers Clayton Kershaw and Yoshinobu Yamamoto have been selected for the National League All-Star team. This marks the 11th All-Star selection for Kershaw, who was chosen as a 'Legend Pick' by the commissioner in recognition of his historic career. He is joined by his teammate Yamamoto, who has had a stellar season, leading the Dodgers in wins, strikeouts, and ERA. They will join fellow Dodgers Freddie Freeman, Will Smith, and Shohei Ohtani, who were previously named as starters for the game to be played on July 15.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Extend Bereavement Leave to Parents Experiencing Early Miscarriage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 19:16:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time off work to grieve, a move welcomed by advocates like the Miscarriage Association. The new law will provide at least one week of leave, addressing a long-standing campaign to recognize the significant emotional impact of pregnancy loss at any stage.</p>

          <p>In an effort to improve early education standards, the UK government will offer tax-free payments of £4,500 to qualified early years teachers who work in nurseries in 20 designated disadvantaged areas. The scheme is part of a £1.5 billion 'Best Start in Life' strategy aimed at narrowing the educational attainment gap among preschool children. Currently, only about one in ten nurseries employs a specialist early years teacher. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the plan will help give the youngest children a better start, though critics point to other financial pressures facing the childcare sector.</p>

          <p>Lena Dunham, creator of the New York-centric series 'Girls,' has set her new project, a Netflix rom-com titled 'Too Much,' in London. The show is loosely based on her own move to the UK and follows an American woman who falls for a punk musician. Dunham, who co-wrote the series, explains that she chose not to star in it partly to avoid the intense body scrutiny she faced during her 20s. She reflects that while society has made some progress, it remains deeply fatphobic, and she now feels more comfortable focusing on writing and directing.</p>

          <p>Despite a strong overall record, the Los Angeles Dodgers' recent series loss to the Houston Astros has highlighted potential weaknesses. The team was outscored 29-6 in a three-game sweep, and their record against winning teams is a concerning 20-19, a key metric for playoff potential. Furthermore, the team is battling a growing list of injuries to key players, including Teoscar Hernández and Tommy Edman, which has shortened their bench and strained their pitching rotation. Manager Dave Roberts remains unconcerned, but the performance issues and health concerns are becoming more apparent as the All-Star break approaches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariff policies under the Trump administration is forcing companies worldwide to fundamentally rethink their global supply chains. With a 90-day pause on sweeping tariffs set to expire, many businesses are moving production out of China to countries like Vietnam and India to avoid high import taxes. For example, an Illinois toymaker has shifted 16% of its manufacturing due to a massive increase in its tax bill. This strategic realignment is complex and expensive, creating new logistical challenges and demonstrating the profound impact of trade disputes on international commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a message marking the 20th anniversary of the 7/7 terrorist attacks in London, King Charles has called for people to stand united against division. He condemned the 'senseless acts of evil' on July 7, 2005, which killed 52 people and injured over 700 when bombs were detonated on the city's public transport system. The King praised the spirit of unity that emerged from the tragedy and emphasized the importance of building a society of mutual respect and understanding. Commemorative events, including a service at St Paul's Cathedral, will be held to remember the victims.</p>

The first part of a public inquiry's final report is due Tuesday, focusing on the human impact and compensation, but many victims are still waiting for full financial redress. Mr. Butoy, whose conviction was overturned after 15 years, says the process feels like a continued fight for belief and trust.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after the 7/7 London bombings, the UK has developed one of the world's most sophisticated counter-terrorism systems, yet faces threats that are far more complex and diverse. The 2005 attacks exposed failures in intelligence sharing and led to major reforms, including better police-agency coordination and new laws to prosecute plots earlier. However, the rise of self-radicalizing lone actors, inspired by groups like ISIS or the far-right, has created new challenges. While the state's powers have grown, the threat landscape has shifted from organized cells to rapid, unpredictable violence fueled by online extremism.</p>

          <p>A Metropolitan Police superintendent has recounted her experience as a first responder during the 7/7 London bombings, 20 years after the attacks. Anna Bearman, then a 23-year-old constable, described the initial call as a suspected fire at King's Cross, but felt a 'pinch-in-the-stomach moment' as the true horror unfolded. She and her colleagues walked deep into the tube tunnels to carry out the injured, witnessing scenes of hysteria and devastation. Her story, along with that of a doctor who set up a makeshift triage area, provides a powerful personal perspective on the tragic events of that day.</p>

          <p>Nathan's Famous, a hot dog brand deeply embedded in American culture and synonymous with events like the Fourth of July, is ultimately owned by a Chinese company. The brand is a subsidiary of Smithfield Foods, which was acquired in 2013 for $4.7 billion by the WH Group, a Chinese conglomerate that is also the world's largest pork processor. While the ownership might surprise some consumers, data shows that Chinese investment in U.S. agricultural land is relatively small compared to that of other countries like Canada. This article notes the brand's iconic status remains despite its international corporate ownership.</p>
