          <p>Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, known for his far-right views, addressed a Jewish society at Yale University, defending his policies and criticizing those who advocate for peace with Palestinians as 'naive.' He recounted his efforts to reduce the food served to Palestinian inmates and expressed admiration for America's willingness to kill murderers. Ben-Gvir's visit sparked protests and raised concerns about his extremist views, including his past support for Baruch Goldstein, who massacred 29 Arabs in 1994. When questioned, Ben-Gvir offered a perfunctory statement opposing Goldstein's actions, failing to express genuine remorse.</p>

Additionally, a federal judge prevented the administration from requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration.

          <p>President Trump's repeated calls for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates may not translate into lower borrowing costs for consumers, according to economists. Trump's attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his tariff policies could actually keep longer-term interest rates higher due to market concerns about inflation and the Fed's independence. Economists suggest that an independent Fed is crucial for maintaining stable inflation, and threats to its autonomy could backfire, leading to higher rates and market turmoil.

          <p>The National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) has applied to the US Soccer Federation to create a second-tier league, aiming to build on the rising interest in women's soccer. Eight of the NWSL’s 14 teams have committed to the proposed division, which would require each NWSL team to have a second-division affiliate within four years of its creation. Supporters say a second-tier league would improve the pipeline of US talent, particularly as European players start to dominate the women’s game.</p>

The Jones Road wildfire has scorched roughly 15,250 acres and is 50% contained, with charges filed against a 19-year-old for failing to extinguish a bonfire that allegedly led to the wildfire.</p>
