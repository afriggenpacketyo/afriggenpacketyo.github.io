          <p>Elon Musk initially declared that SpaceX would immediately decommission its Dragon spacecraft following President Trump's threat to cancel government contracts. This announcement came amidst a public dispute over Republican tax policies, with Musk criticizing Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill." However, Musk quickly reversed his decision after receiving advice from an X user, stating that Dragon would not be decommissioned. The Dragon spacecraft is the only U.S. option for delivering crew to and from the International Space Station, and NASA reaffirmed its commitment to space objectives despite the initial threat. Optimism score: The quick reversal and NASA's continued commitment suggest a relatively stable situation, although the initial threat introduces some uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the ban on foreign students with F and J visas is unconstitutional. The university claims the ban is a "government vendetta" following Harvard's refusal to comply with demands for ideological screening and government oversight. The lawsuit argues the ban targets Harvard specifically and lacks lawful basis, affecting over 7,000 students. A federal judge had previously blocked a similar attempt to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is growing around the trend of eating food products with fewer ingredients, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods (UPF). While some consumers seek simpler ingredient lists, nutritionists caution against sacrificing essential nutrients. Experts argue that the term UPF is not always a reliable indicator of health, as processing can enhance food safety and extend shelf life. The trend is also expected to drive marketing efforts to promote and justify the higher prices of less processed food products.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals that young offenders are frequently denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention, unlike adults in the criminal justice system. This practice extends their incarceration, impacting their rehabilitation and costing taxpayers.

          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced sanctions on four judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) for "illegitimate" targeting of Israel and the US. The sanctions involve blocking the judges' property and interests in the US. The move is a response to the ICC's investigation into alleged US war crimes in Afghanistan and its issuing of arrest warrants for Israeli officials. The ICC has responded, deploring the sanctions and asserting its independence.</p>
