          <p>A British doctoral student at Cornell University recounts his experience of being targeted by US immigration authorities after participating in a pro-Palestine protest. The activist describes being banned from campus, going into hiding, and ultimately self-deporting after learning he was under surveillance and his Google data was handed to Homeland Security. The article highlights the use of AI surveillance technologies to monitor non-citizen students and dissidents. It raises concerns about the erosion of free speech and the collusion between tech companies and government agencies.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new powers for police to manage recurring protests by considering their cumulative impact on communities. Senior officers will be able to impose conditions, such as changing the location of a demonstration, if a site has been used repeatedly for protests. This move follows a day of nearly 500 arrests and aims to balance the right to protest with community safety, particularly for religious groups who have felt intimidated by recent events. Anyone who violates these new conditions will face potential arrest and prosecution.</p>

          <p>An investigation into the murder of Kenneth Fandrich at an Intel campus in Oregon faced a major setback when a key piece of evidence was destroyed. Detectives believed the crime occurred inside a maroon minivan used by the suspect, Dr. Steven Milner, who was allegedly stalking the victim. After a frantic search, police located the vehicle's VIN at a tow company, only to discover it had been sold to a scrapyard. A detective arrived just moments too late, witnessing a video of the minivan being crushed into scrap metal.</p>

          <p>Nearly four years after its controversial £305m Saudi-led takeover, Newcastle United has seen significant transformation both on and off the pitch. The club has modernized its training facilities, won its first major domestic trophy in 70 years, and qualified for the Champions League multiple times. However, its growth is constrained by Profit and Sustainability Rules, preventing it from outspending rivals as Manchester City or Chelsea did in the past. The article also notes the ongoing criticism from human rights groups who argue the takeover is a form of 'sportswashing' for Saudi Arabia.</p>

          <p>Beijing is adopting a new soft power strategy in Africa by sponsoring social media influencers and content creators to reshape its public image, particularly among younger generations.

This approach marks a shift from traditional state-led diplomacy, aiming to connect directly with African youth through tourism and cultural exchange.

The author points to recent military buildups around Venezuela, threats against drug cartels, and attempts to strong-arm Brazil as examples of a bullying tactic that risks destabilizing the region. This approach is seen as a regression to the interventionist 'Monroe Doctrine' era, alienating potential partners and creating a backlash.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope for the release of all hostages 'in the coming days' after Hamas responded positively to key parts of a peace plan proposed by President Trump. The US-brokered deal includes the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. U.S. envoys are traveling to Egypt to finalize details, and Israel has instructed its military to prepare for the plan's first phase. While Hamas's response is seen as a positive step, significant details remain subject to further negotiation.</p>

          <p>A 28-year-old woman from Birmingham has learned she carries a faulty gene that will likely cause her to develop early-onset frontotemporal dementia, the same rare condition that killed her mother at age 54. After watching her mother's decline and knowing the disease had affected 13 family members, she underwent genetic testing. Despite the devastating diagnosis, she is using the knowledge proactively to plan for her future. She intends to use IVF and embryo screening to ensure any children she has are born free of the hereditary gene.</p>
