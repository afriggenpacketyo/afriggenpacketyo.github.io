          <p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was hospitalized with a fractured vertebra and other significant injuries after his vehicle was struck from behind at high speed in New Hampshire. A spokesperson stated the incident occurred after Giuliani had stopped to assist a woman who reported being a victim of domestic violence. The representative emphasized that the collision was not a targeted attack and requested privacy for the former mayor during his recovery. His son, Andrew Giuliani, later commented on his father's resilience following the accident.</p>

          <p>A 6.0 magnitude earthquake occurred in southeastern Afghanistan, close to the border with Pakistan, late on Sunday evening. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake's epicenter was located 22 miles north of Bāsawul with a shallow depth of 6.2 miles. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or casualties resulting from this specific seismic event. The region is highly prone to earthquakes, with a devastating 6.3 magnitude quake in October 2023 having caused thousands of fatalities.</p>

This achievement marks the first time in Alcaraz's career that he has reached a grand slam quarter-final without dropping a single set, underscoring his current run of consistent form. At just 22 years old, he also became the youngest man in the open era to reach 13 grand slam quarter-finals.

          <p>Russian tennis star Andrey Rublev has publicly voiced his disagreement with a $3,000 fine he received for using foul language during a US Open match. Rublev argued that profanity directed at oneself during moments of high stress is a personal matter and should not be penalized unless it is aimed at an official or another person. He asserted that expletives are a normal part of sports and life during crucial moments. The article also mentions a much larger fine given to fellow Russian player Daniil Medvedev for a separate outburst.</p>

          <p>Police arrested three individuals during a protest in Epping, Essex, concerning the housing of asylum seekers at the Bell Hotel. The demonstration, which drew approximately 200 people, led to clashes after a woman was detained for unfurling a flag in a restricted area. One man was arrested on suspicion of inciting racial hatred after an emblem was reportedly set on fire, while another was arrested for breaching protest orders. The unrest follows charges of sexual assault against an asylum seeker housed at the hotel, a case currently proceeding through the courts.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced that Abu Obeida, the prominent spokesman for Hamas's military wing, was killed in an aerial attack on Gaza City. Israel's Defence Minister praised the operation as a "flawless execution," although Hamas has not yet officially confirmed the death. The strike targeted a residential building in the densely populated al-Rimal neighborhood, where local journalists reported other casualties, including civilians. Obeida was a highly visible figure in Hamas's propaganda efforts, known for his masked appearances and defiant speeches against Israel.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton has been handed a five-place grid penalty for the upcoming Italian Grand Prix at Monza. The penalty was issued because he failed to slow down sufficiently under double yellow flags before the start of the Dutch Grand Prix. This setback compounds a challenging weekend for his Ferrari team, which also saw both Hamilton and his teammate Charles Leclerc crash out of the race in separate incidents. The penalty ensures Hamilton will start no higher than sixth in his first race at Monza as a Ferrari driver.</p>

          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade adviser to Donald Trump, strongly criticized a federal appeals court decision that ruled most of the former president's tariffs are illegal. Calling the ruling "weaponized partisan injustice," Navarro warned on Fox News that it would be "the end of the United States" if the decision is ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court. The court found that Trump had overstepped his authority by using an emergency powers act to justify the sweeping tariffs. The administration is expected to appeal the ruling, which currently puts a central part of its economic agenda in jeopardy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge issued an emergency order to halt the Trump administration's plan to deport hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came just as planes were reportedly preparing for takeoff, forcing officials to deplane the minors and return them to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services. Attorneys for the children argued the deportations were illegal and would deny them their right to seek asylum and other legal protections. The government contended it was repatriating the children at the request of their families, a claim disputed by the children's advocates.</p>

          <p>Bishop Montgomery High School in Torrance, California, has fired its football coach and co-athletic director, Ed Hodgkiss, amid a significant sports scandal. The dismissal follows a ruling by the CIF Southern Section that declared five transfer student-athletes ineligible due to rule violations, including the provision of false information. The school was subsequently forced to forfeit a game against a top-ranked opponent due to a lack of players after several were suspended for a separate on-field incident. The situation has raised questions about the Archdiocese of Los Angeles's oversight of its athletic programs.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized a £10 billion agreement to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 frigates, marking the UK's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The Ministry of Defence stated the deal will support thousands of UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This agreement will create a joint UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates, significantly enhancing NATO's capabilities in the North Atlantic. The deal was seen as a major victory for the British defense industry over international competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An infant has died from whooping cough in the UK, marking the first such fatality this year, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The agency confirmed that the baby's mother had not received the recommended whooping cough vaccine during her pregnancy. Health officials emphasize that maternal vaccination during pregnancy is crucial for providing passive immunity to newborns before they are old enough to receive their own first jab at eight weeks. The death highlights growing concerns over declining vaccine uptake and hesitancy in the UK.</p>

The next drawing on Monday will be the 40th since the jackpot was last won on May 31. This now stands as the largest Powerball jackpot since a $1.326 billion prize was won in April 2024.</p>

          <p>Iran-backed Houthi forces have raided the offices of the UN's World Food Programme and UNICEF in Sanaa, Yemen, detaining at least one UN employee. The raids occurred shortly after an Israeli airstrike killed the Houthi-led government's prime minister and several other cabinet members. The UN condemned the arbitrary detention of its humanitarian staff and is urgently seeking more information from the local authorities. This action represents an escalation in the Houthi crackdown on international organizations operating in the areas they control.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore has responded directly to President Donald Trump's criticisms of crime in Baltimore, stating he has no interest in fighting with the president but will continue to fight for his communities. The public feud escalated after Trump called Baltimore a "hellhole" and threatened to send in the National Guard, an offer Moore dismissed as "performative." While acknowledging there is still work to be done, Moore touted the city's recent progress in reducing crime and criticized the president's "arrogant criticism and cynicism." The exchange also saw the two trade barbs over their respective military service records.</p>

          <p>European Union foreign ministers held informal talks to brainstorm new strategies for supporting Ukraine, including the possibility of imposing secondary sanctions against Russia's key trading partners. Other ideas discussed included inviting Ukrainian arms companies to produce weapons on EU soil, creating a "safe haven" for their defense industry from Russian attacks. Ministers also revisited the complex debate on seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Ukraine's reconstruction. Another proposal involved shifting the EU's military training mission for Ukrainian troops onto Ukrainian soil in the event of a future ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated Old Firm derby between Scottish football rivals Rangers and Celtic ended in a lackluster 0-0 draw, a result widely described as one of the worst encounters between the clubs in recent memory. Rangers manager Russell Martin praised his team's fight and resilience, viewing the clean sheet as a positive step despite the team's poor start to the season. Conversely, Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers lamented his team's stark lack of creativity and attacking threat, which was statistically negligible for large portions of the match. The result leaves both clubs with significant questions to address moving forward.</p>

          <p>Indonesia's political parties have agreed to reduce some state-funded perks for lawmakers in an effort to quell widespread anti-government protests that have rocked the nation. The unrest, which has seen violent clashes in several cities, was fueled in part by public anger over a new monthly allowance for politicians nearly ten times the local minimum wage. President Prabowo Subianto announced the reversal but also warned that authorities would take strong action against looting and property damage. The protests were further inflamed by the death of a ride-sharing driver during a demonstration.</p>
