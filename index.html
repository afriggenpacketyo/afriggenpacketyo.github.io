          <p>A large explosion and subsequent fire at the Shaid Rajaei port in southern Iran, possibly related to missile propellant chemicals, resulted in at least 40 deaths and numerous injuries. The incident occurred during ongoing nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States in Oman, adding a layer of geopolitical sensitivity. While Iranian officials deny any attack, they acknowledge heightened security concerns due to past sabotage attempts. An investigation has been launched to determine the cause of the explosion, which caused significant damage to the port infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Africa's ruling ANC party is asserting its sovereignty amid rising tensions with the United States over race relations and land reform policies. The new expropriation law, allowing land seizure without compensation under specific circumstances, has drawn criticism from the US, including an executive order offering Afrikaners refugee status. The ANC has condemned South Africans who have appealed to the US to intervene, and is seeking to integrate the all-white separatist community of Orania. These developments highlight ongoing debates about land ownership and racial equality in South Africa.</p>
