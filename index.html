            <p>Chinese exporters are struggling to navigate the impact of rising U.S. tariffs, leading to increased prices for American consumers and accelerated diversification plans. Some companies are halting shipments entirely due to tariffs climbing from 10% to 125% in recent months. The situation is forcing businesses to seek alternative suppliers and explore domestic sales, as hopes for a U.S.-China trade deal fade. Economists predict a significant drop in China's shipments to the U.S. over the next two years, impacting employment and economic growth.</p>

            <p>Danish shoppers are boycotting U.S. products in response to President Trump's stance on Greenland and trade tariffs. Retailers are making it easier to identify European-owned brands, leading to a shift in consumer sentiment. This boycott mirrors similar movements in other European countries and Canada, where consumers are actively seeking regionally made goods.

            <p>President Trump's recent trade policy shifts, including the suspension of tariffs on most countries while escalating tensions with China, raise questions about his trade goals. While negotiations with countries like South Korea and Japan are underway, the instability of tariff policies makes it difficult for businesses to make long-term investment decisions. The confrontation with China carries enormous risk, and the U.S. may have alienated allies in the process. Trump's tariffs could generate revenue, but the long-term impact on prices for U.S. consumers remains uncertain.</p>

The EU must act as swiftly as possible to shore up its greatest weakness: its dependence on fossil-fuel imports. Europe can turn this into a window of opportunity to further its edge with the US on clean tech.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has instructed the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to a mega-jail in El Salvador. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadorian migrant, was deported despite a court ruling forbidding it. The Supreme Court upheld the district judge's order that the government has to bring Kilmar home. The case will now return to the trial court.</p>

            <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth axed $5.1 billion in IT and consulting contracts, including those with Accenture and Deloitte, deeming them "wasteful spending." The savings will be reallocated to critical priorities such as reviving the warrior ethos and rebuilding the military. Hegseth praised Elon Musk's cost-cutting outfit, the Department of Government of Efficiency, for its assistance in identifying wasteful spending. The move aims to improve resource allocation within the Department of Defense.</p>

She invested in companies like Lululemon and Dell Computer, which had experienced significant losses. Some of her investments have since rebounded following Trump's decision to pause most tariffs.
