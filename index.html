            <h2>Supreme Court Temporarily Halts Deportations of Venezuelan Men</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-19 02:13:02 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The US Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan men held in immigration custody after lawyers argued they were at imminent risk of removal without due process. The ACLU filed an emergency court filing stating that dozens of Venezuelan men held in a Texas detention center were being classified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang and would be deported under the Alien Enemies Act. The court's order prevents removals until further notice, with conservative Justice Clarence Thomas dissenting. The ACLU has sued to block deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, arguing that those facing removal should have the chance to argue their case in court.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Economists are concerned that Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could lead to corporate profiteering, allowing companies to raise prices beyond what is justified by the tariffs themselves. Experts suggest that the expectation of rising prices due to tariffs could become a self-fulfilling prophecy, giving companies cover to increase profits. Senator Elizabeth Warren warned that corporations might use tariffs as an excuse to price-gouge consumers, even for goods not directly affected. A study of Trump's previous tariffs on washing machines found that domestic prices also rose, suggesting a broader inflationary effect. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom granted clemency to 25 felons, including Sithy Bin, a Cambodian immigrant facing deportation. Bin, a former gang member sentenced in 2008 for shooting at a rival's home, became a minister in prison and demonstrated significant rehabilitation. Newsom's pardon aims to prevent Bin's deportation to Cambodia, a country he left as a toddler. Newsom also issued a posthumous pardon to Sgt. Richard Allen Penry, a Medal of Honor recipient who struggled with PTSD and substance abuse after serving in Vietnam.</p>

            <p>A divided panel of judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily paused an effort by District Court Judge James Boasberg to investigate whether the Trump administration engaged in criminal contempt by refusing to turn around two deportation flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members. The order does not rule on the merits of Boasberg’s inquiry but sets a deadline for the petitioners to reply to the government. Boasberg found probable cause that the Trump administration acted in contempt of court when it defied his order to return the deportation flights to the U.S.</p>

            <p>Investors are closely monitoring the US bond market after a rare spike in government bond rates, indicating a loss of confidence in the US economy. The increased volatility suggests uncertainty over the impact of Trump's tariffs. Higher government borrowing rates could affect public spending, mortgages, and business loans. The bond market reaction has drawn comparisons to Liz Truss's mini-Budget in the UK, prompting Trump to introduce a pause on higher tariffs for most countries. (not investment advice)</p>
