          <h2>Amazon Responds to White House Criticism by Abandoning Tariff Surcharge Display Plan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 16:55:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon has stated that displaying tariff surcharge pricing on products was never approved and will not happen, following criticism from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, who called the move a hostile and political act. The decision comes as some Amazon sellers have deemed tariffs unsustainable and raised prices on popular items to offset import costs. While Amazon denies plans to itemize tariffs, Walmart has confirmed it will implement tariff-related price hikes without itemizing them. This situation unfolds as tech billionaires, including Jeff Bezos, appear to be aligning with Trump's administration. The article notes Jim Cramer's concern about how much of the tariff costs Amazon is absorbing, particularly with earnings on the horizon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, won the federal election, marking a significant shift attributed to President Trump's territorial threats and tariffs. Carney emphasized Canada's need for independence and self-reliance in response to Trump's actions, signaling a departure from the traditionally close relationship with the United States. The election saw a record number of Canadians casting their votes, with sovereignty, tariffs, and affordability as key issues. Carney has pledged to work with the U.S. as independent nations, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, who lost his seat, vowed to continue fighting for change. Trump's repeated threats to annex Canada and his tariffs, which have undermined Canada's economy, had dominated the campaign and influenced voters' choices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump, in an interview with ABC News, defended his controversial trade policies, asserting that China will likely absorb the tariff costs and reassuring Americans about the economy. Despite polling indicating widespread anxiety over his trade policies, Trump claimed that prices for gasoline, groceries, and eggs have decreased since he took office. He dismissed concerns that tariffs would raise prices on various goods, stating that China was previously taking advantage of the United States. The interview highlights the ongoing debate over the economic impact of Trump's trade policies, with economists expressing concern about higher prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>Starbucks reported weaker-than-expected earnings and a continued decline in same-store sales, although CEO Brian Niccol stated the company's turnaround strategy is showing early signs of progress. The coffee chain's operating margin fell due to increased spending to revitalize its business, including higher labor costs and promotional expenses. While net sales increased by 2%, same-store sales declined for the fifth consecutive quarter as consumers seek cheaper alternatives. Niccol is focusing on improving customer experience and service speeds to revitalize the U.S. business. The company is planning cafe improvements and overhauling its innovation process to attract customers.</p>

          <p>Snap's stock price plummeted after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue but declined to provide guidance for the second quarter, citing macroeconomic uncertainties that could affect advertising demand. Snap's CEO noted headwinds to start the current quarter and emphasized balancing investment with revenue growth. The company faces a turbulent macro environment due to President Trump's evolving trade plans, leading to fears of reduced spending. Snap cited potential constraints on advertising demand as the reason for withholding guidance, with ad revenues showing mixed performance. Like other tech companies, Snap is grappling with uncertainties surrounding potential impacts on advertising demand due to macroeconomic conditions.</p>

This comes as President Trump promotes the harvesting of oil and minerals with minimal regard for environmental or foreign policy costs. Trump has previously signed an executive order encouraging exploitation of moon and asteroid minerals.

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order softening some of the automotive tariffs his administration had previously put into place, responding to lobbying from automakers and auto policy groups. The measures aim to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports, addressing the stacking effect of multiple duties. Automakers expressed appreciation for the changes but continue to face significant cost increases. The easing of auto tariffs follows concerns about regulatory uncertainty and additional costs for the car industry, with General Motors discontinuing its 2025 guidance due to the potential impact of tariffs.</p>

          <p>This CBS News article examines Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration's efforts to cut government spending and streamline operations, 100 days into the term. Musk, leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has aimed to slash the federal workforce and eliminate waste, facing both support and criticism. Despite promises of significant cuts, the actual savings achieved by DOGE have been debated, and some actions have faced legal challenges. Musk's involvement has raised concerns about conflicts of interest with his business ventures, which benefit from federal programs. The article provides a detailed look at Musk's influence, the impact on federal agencies, and the political reactions to DOGE's initiatives.</p>

          <p>UPS is planning to cut 20,000 jobs this year as part of a cost-cutting effort related to the company's decision to deliver fewer packages from Amazon. The move is part of a plan to consolidate facilities and workforce, which includes closing 73 buildings by the end of June 2025. UPS expects to save $3.5 billion this year as a result of its consolidation plan. The company also mentioned the risk that shifts in global trade policy could have on business, as the Trump administration has introduced sweeping new tariffs. </p>

Oddity expects tariff headwinds to be manageable and offset by cost efficiencies. The direct-to-consumer company is seen as a bright spot in the retail industry, with a focus on growth and larger profit margins due to its direct model.</p>

Within hours of the call, Amazon announced that the plan had been scrapped entirely. The White House had also criticized Amazon over the idea, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling it "a hostile and political act." The article notes that Bezos has been cozying up to Trump since he won the 2024 election, and that Amazon donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund.</p>

Google rejects the argument that it could monopolize generative AI, citing healthy competition in the AI race.
