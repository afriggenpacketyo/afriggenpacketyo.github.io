        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cartier owner Richemont reported fiscal fourth-quarter sales that surpassed analyst predictions, driven by strong performance in its Jewellery Maisons division, which includes brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. The Swiss luxury group's revenue increased by 7% year-on-year, reaching 5.17 billion euros, despite a decline in sales within its specialist watchmakers segment, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. While full-year sales rose by 4% to 21.4 billion euros, the company acknowledged ongoing global uncertainties that require agility and discipline. BofA Global Research noted that Richemont faces challenges from gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations, though its pricing power may offset some of these headwinds.</p>

          <p>In a medical first, a 9½-month-old boy with a rare genetic disorder known as CPS1 deficiency has been successfully treated with a custom gene-editing therapy. Doctors at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia administered an infusion designed to correct the specific mutation causing the disorder, which affects only one in 1.3 million babies and often leads to severe developmental delays and liver transplants. The treatment, which was developed rapidly through collaboration between multiple institutions and with the FDA's support, offers a potential new path for developing personalized therapies for other rare genetic diseases, potentially transforming healthcare by making such treatments more accessible and affordable. The baby is now well enough for the team to start planning to discharge him from the hospital and live at home, and he is meeting developmental milestones.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament is set to debate a bill legalizing assisted dying in England and Wales, marking the first such discussion since significant changes were made to the legislation. The bill, sponsored by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, has undergone intense scrutiny and amendments, including the removal of a High Court judge's approval for each assisted death request, replacing it with a panel of experts. A government impact assessment on the bill was quietly revised, reducing the upper estimate for assisted deaths in the first year from 787 to 647, raising concerns about the accuracy of the data. The debate comes amid strong opinions on both sides, with concerns about coercion and the protection of vulnerable individuals, but also arguments for respecting the autonomy of terminally ill patients.</p>

          <p>Patrick McGee's "Apple in China" argues that Apple's decision to manufacture approximately 90% of its products in China has created a significant vulnerability for the company and the United States. By training millions of workers in China, Apple has facilitated the transfer of technology and know-how, enabling Chinese companies to catch up in technological innovation. The book highlights the ethical concerns of operating in a country with low wages and human rights issues. While Apple's presence in China has brought benefits, the book suggests that the company's deep integration with the Chinese state has troubling consequences for global power dynamics.</p>

          <p>Chinese-made PL-15E air-to-air missiles faced their first combat test during a recent skirmish between Pakistan and India in Kashmir, after years of speculation about their capabilities.

This development has broader implications for regional security in the Asia-Pacific and any future Taiwan contingency.

          <p>Facing lawsuits and criticism over its potential harm to users' mental health, particularly among children, TikTok is launching in-app guided meditation exercises and well-being features. The company said it began testing the new meditation exercises with select teens earlier this year and will now make them available to users of all ages. The meditation feature, aimed at improving sleep quality, is triggered during "sleep hours" and will be turned on by default for users under the age of 18. This initiative comes amid public pressure and lawsuits alleging that TikTok is intentionally addictive and psychologically damaging to young users, posing risks such as depression, anxiety, and body dysmorphia.</p>

          <p>Legendary Motown singer Smokey Robinson is under criminal investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department following allegations of sexual assault dating back to 2014. The accusations stem from a civil suit filed by four former housekeepers who are seeking $50 million in damages, alleging sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, gender violence, and creating a hostile work environment. Robinson's attorney denies the allegations, claiming the accusers filed their police report only after the civil suit to publicize their case. The women allege they were sexually assaulted by Robinson in his home, sometimes multiple times, and that they did not come forward earlier due to their immigration status.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced a greater-than-expected contraction of 0.7% in the January-March period, marking its first decline in four quarters, according to government data. The contraction was primarily attributed to weak consumer spending due to inflation and increased imports. The government is also monitoring the potential economic impact of U.S. trade policies, including tariffs, which could further dampen economic growth. The government has enacted a law to allow preemptive acts of cyberdefense, giving the government the ability to legally monitor communications data during peacetime and to neutralize hostile servers in the event of an attack.</p>

          <p>New economic data indicates that Japan's economy contracted at a higher pace than expected in the first quarter of 2025, with a 0.2% decrease compared to the previous quarter. The decline was largely attributed to a fall in exports, which are crucial for the Japanese economy, even before the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. government. Concerns are rising that the Trump tariffs could exacerbate the economic slowdown, with analysts suggesting that a recession cannot be ruled out depending on the severity of the downward pressure from the tariff issue. Despite the economic challenges, the Bank of Japan has begun to gradually hike interest rates to combat inflation.</p>

Despite respectable growth numbers, Romania consistently performs poorly on key social indicators, with a significant portion of the population at risk of poverty.

          <p>Japan witnessed record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors shifted away from U.S. markets due to trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) worth of equities and long-term bonds, marking the largest net inflows for a calendar month since 1996. This shift was attributed to concerns about the U.S. economy and asset performance following the announcement of "reciprocal" tariffs, leading investors to diversify into other major markets, including Japan. However, with the U.S. softening its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, which could impact the appeal of Japanese assets.</p>

          <p>A pregnant woman in Georgia who was declared brain dead is being kept on life support to allow the fetus to develop, a decision the family says was mandated by the state's abortion law.

The family is upset that Georgia's law that restricts abortion once cardiac activity is detected doesn't allow relatives to have a say in whether a pregnant woman is kept on life support.

          <p>The Japanese parliament has enacted a law allowing preemptive acts of cyberdefense, granting the government the authority to monitor communications data during peacetime and neutralize hostile servers in the event of an attack. The "active cyberdefense" law will obligate operators of key infrastructure, such as those in the electricity and railway sectors, to report cyber breaches to the government. The government aims to be fully operational with the measures by 2027. A new independent panel will be set up to give prior approval for data acquisition and analysis, as well as for actions to neutralize hostile servers.</p>

Her attorney argues that the removal order should be lifted because she has resided in the U.S. for over 10 years, has no criminal record, and is the mother of three U.S. citizen children.
