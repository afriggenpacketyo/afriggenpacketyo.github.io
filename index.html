          <p>Former President Donald Trump is demanding $230 million from the Department of Justice through administrative claims, alleging damages from federal investigations into his 2016 campaign and his handling of classified documents. The claims, which often precede lawsuits, were filed in 2023 and 2024 and accuse the FBI of violating his rights during the Mar-a-Lago search. This situation presents a potential conflict of interest, as any settlement could require approval from officials Trump appointed to the DOJ during his second term. The former president has publicly acknowledged the awkwardness of effectively suing his own administration, raising questions about how the matter will be resolved.</p>

Discovery has announced it is exploring strategic alternatives, including a potential sale, after receiving unsolicited offers from multiple interested parties. CEO David Zaslav confirmed the board will review all options to maximize the value of its assets, which include major franchises like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. This development occurs as the company, still managing significant debt from its 2022 merger, was already planning to split its streaming and cable network businesses. The news caused company shares to jump over 11%, signaling a potential bidding war amid ongoing consolidation in the media industry.</p>

          <p>A man who was pardoned by President Trump for his involvement in the January 6th Capitol riot has been arrested for allegedly threatening to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Christopher Moynihan, 34, faces a felony charge of making a terroristic threat after allegedly sending a text message detailing his plan. Jeffries issued a statement highlighting that many individuals pardoned for the riot have since committed additional crimes, placing a burden on law enforcement. This arrest comes amid a documented increase in threats against lawmakers, with Capitol Police threat assessment cases rising dramatically in recent years.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska is publicly cautioning the Trump administration against its proposal to purchase beef from Argentina, arguing it will hurt American cattle ranchers without effectively lowering consumer prices. The plan was suggested by President Trump as a way to reduce grocery costs and is linked to a broader U.S. financial aid package for Argentina's struggling economy. However, Fischer and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association contend that government intervention will disrupt the market at a critical time for U.S. producers. This move has also drawn concern from soybean farmers, who are already suffering from the ongoing trade war with China.</p>

          <p>A White House official has stated there are no plans for a meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the "immediate future," effectively canceling a summit that was anticipated to occur in Hungary. This announcement followed a phone call between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, after which an in-person meeting was deemed unnecessary. The development comes as the Trump administration continues its efforts to mediate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who recently met with Trump, was reportedly waiting to see if he would be invited to the now-postponed talks.</p>

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat surged nearly 130% on Tuesday, following a 127% rise the previous day, in a dramatic turnaround for the struggling stock. The rally was ignited after the company was added to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, triggering a massive short squeeze, as over 63% of its available shares had been bet against. The momentum was further fueled by an announcement of an expanded distribution deal with Walmart. After years of declining value, the stock's sudden revival is seen by some as a sign of a speculative or "frothy" market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For retirees on a fixed income, reverse mortgages offer a way to access home equity without incurring monthly payments, a significant advantage in an inflationary environment. This article outlines three primary types of reverse mortgage loans available to homeowners aged 62 and older. The most common is the federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), which offers consumer protections and flexible payout options. For those with higher-value homes, private proprietary reverse mortgages provide larger loan amounts, while single-purpose reverse mortgages from non-profits offer an affordable option for specific needs like home repairs or property taxes.

          <p>A reversal in pediatric advice over the last decade, which now encourages introducing peanut products to infants early, has successfully prevented an estimated 40,000 cases of peanut allergy in U.S. children. A new study in the journal *Pediatrics* confirms that this change has led to a 43% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence among young children. The shift in guidance was prompted by a landmark 2015 study observing lower allergy rates in Israeli children who regularly consumed peanut snacks from a young age. This public health success marks a significant step in curbing the rising epidemic of food allergies in the country.</p>

The campaign's website encourages investors, including public pension funds, to hold Musk and the board accountable.

          <p>An analysis by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis shows that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are contributing to inflation, particularly for imported goods like furniture, car parts, and electronics. The research indicates that businesses passed on approximately 35% of tariff-related costs to consumers between May and July. Overall, the tariffs are estimated to have added 0.5 percentage points to the headline inflation rate from June to August. While some experts believe the full impact has been delayed as businesses await stable tariff rates, the levies are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices.

This positive outlook has restored investor confidence in the company, which supplies critical tools and equipment to the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A potential mass shooting at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was prevented thanks to a tip from the suspect's family. The brother of 49-year-old Billy Joe Cagle said the family contacted police after seeing Cagle live-streaming on social media, threatening to "shoot up" the airport. Police arrested Cagle inside the terminal and later found an AR-15-style rifle with 27 rounds of ammunition in his truck. Atlanta's mayor praised the family's quick action, stating that the "See something, say something" principle worked to avert a tragedy. Cagle, who his brother says has a history of mental health challenges, now faces multiple felony charges.</p>

          <p>A high court in Colombia has overturned a bribery conviction against former President Álvaro Uribe, who was sentenced to house arrest in August. The Bogota High Court ruled that the charges of witness tampering and bribery in criminal proceedings were not proven "beyond reasonable doubt," citing methodological errors and biased evaluation of evidence in the initial sentence. Uribe, who served as president from 2002 to 2010, had been accused of bribing former paramilitary members to lie about his alleged links to their groups. An appeal against a separate procedural fraud charge is still ongoing.</p>

While CD rates were exceptionally high in recent years, they have already begun to decline and are expected to fall further with anticipated Fed cuts. Although current rates around 4% are still competitive compared to traditional savings accounts, which average just 0.40%, they are becoming harder to find.

          <p>A French criminologist predicts that while authorities will likely apprehend the suspects behind the audacious daylight robbery at the Louvre, the stolen crown jewels may never be recovered. Professor Alain Bauer suggests that significant DNA evidence was left at the scene, which should aid in identifying the perpetrators. However, he and other experts believe the priceless historical artifacts, valued at $102 million, will probably be broken down into individual gems and sold on the black market for a fraction of their worth. The heist has been labeled a national embarrassment, raising serious questions about security failures at one of the world's most famous museums.</p>

          <p>For individuals overwhelmed by debt, Chapter 7 bankruptcy can offer a fresh start, but eligibility is largely determined by income through a process called the "means test." To qualify, a person's monthly income over the past six months must generally be below their state's median income for a household of their size. If their income is higher, they may still qualify if, after deducting allowed expenses like housing and healthcare, their disposable income is limited. For those who don't qualify, alternatives like Chapter 13 bankruptcy, debt settlement programs, or debt management plans offer other paths to financial relief without the same long-term credit impact.</p>

          <p>A coroner has concluded that neglect at a Manchester mental health unit likely contributed to the death of 22-year-old Cerys Lupton-Jones in May 2022. The inquest revealed that staff at Park House, run by the Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Trust, failed to conduct required 15-minute checks and falsified observation records. Cerys fatally harmed herself in a toilet just 20 minutes after a previous suicide attempt, during which time she was left unsupervised. The coroner described the care as a "shambles" and noted a culture of falsifying records, prompting campaigners to call for an inquiry into multiple deaths at the trust.</p>

He explained that the vests can help burn more calories and increase cardiovascular workload, but individuals with underlying health conditions should consult a doctor first. While the impact on bone health is inconclusive, the vests may improve muscle strength and help prevent falls if used correctly. Dr. LaPook advises starting with a weight equivalent to 5% of one's body weight and ensuring a proper fit to avoid putting undue stress on joints.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed softening a landmark EU law designed to ban imports of products linked to deforestation, such as coffee, soy, and palm oil. The original law, which faced opposition from major trading partners over concerns about increased costs and paperwork, would have required importers to provide detailed statements proving their goods did not come from deforested areas. The proposed changes would move the implementation deadline for large companies to the end of 2025 and limit the reporting requirement to importers, exempting companies that only process or sell the goods. The amendments still need approval from member states and the European Parliament.</p>
