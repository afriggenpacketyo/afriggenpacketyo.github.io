          <p>A freight train struck a double-decker bus in Atlacomulco, Mexico, resulting in at least eight fatalities and 45 injuries. The collision occurred at a railway crossing that appeared to lack visible gates or signals, ripping the bus apart. Authorities have opened an investigation into the incident, which highlights a rising trend of accidents at grade-level crossings in the country. Canadian Pacific Kansas City, the train line operator, confirmed the accident and is cooperating with the investigation.</p>

          <p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC) is pressuring the UK government to pass its proposed Employment Rights Bill without dilution, fearing key protections could be weakened. The bill promises significant updates to workers' rights, including a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and enhanced protection against unfair dismissal. Union leaders have expressed concern that recent cabinet changes might lead to a pro-business watering down of the legislation, with some threatening to reconsider their financial support for the Labour party if the bill is not delivered in full.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has initiated a targeted immigration enforcement operation in Chicago, named "Operation Midway Blitz." The department stated the operation will focus on "criminal illegal aliens," linking the action to sanctuary city policies in Illinois. Governor JB Pritzker criticized the move, accusing the Trump administration of using fear tactics rather than coordinating with local officials on public safety. The announcement follows social media posts from President Trump signaling a more aggressive stance on deportations in the city.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami striker Luis Suárez has been suspended for three MLS games following his actions in a brawl after the Leagues Cup final against the Seattle Sounders. Suárez was seen putting an opposing player in a headlock and later spitting on the Sounders' security director. The MLS suspension is separate from a more severe six-game ban issued by the Leagues Cup's disciplinary committee. The ban will sideline Suárez during a critical period as Inter Miami pushes for a better playoff position.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senate Republicans, led by Majority Leader John Thune, are initiating a procedural move known as the "nuclear option" to overcome Democratic obstruction of President Trump's nominees. The proposed rule change, which requires only a simple majority, would allow for nominees to be voted on in groups, or "en bloc." Republicans argue the move is necessary to counter what they call "Trump derangement syndrome on steroids," as Democrats have blocked even routine confirmations. The strategy is ironically based on a previous proposal from Democrats who faced similar frustrations during the Biden administration.</p>

          <p>The "Global Sumud Flotilla," a large maritime mission carrying humanitarian aid, is en route to the Gaza Strip to challenge Israel's long-standing naval blockade. Participants, including prominent activists, aim to draw global attention to the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which has worsened during the ongoing war. Israel maintains the blockade is necessary to prevent Hamas from importing weapons, and previous flotilla attempts have been intercepted by Israeli forces. Human rights organizations contend the blockade constitutes illegal collective punishment under international law.</p>

          <p>With mortgage interest rates falling to an 11-month low, many homeowners who purchased property in recent years are considering refinancing their loans. Experts suggest evaluating whether current rates, now in the low 6% range, offer enough savings to justify the action, especially for those with rates near the 8% highs of 2023. Key considerations include the risk of waiting for even lower rates, the upfront closing costs, and the owner's long-term plans for the home. A careful analysis is needed to determine if the potential monthly savings outweigh the costs and risks involved. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prominent tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities is becoming the chairman of Eightco Holdings, a public company that plans to accumulate Worldcoin (WLD) as its primary treasury reserve asset. The company announced a $250 million private placement to fund the strategy and will change its ticker to "ORBS." Ives stated he views Worldcoin, the crypto project from OpenAI's Sam Altman focused on biometric identity verification, as the future standard for authentication in an AI-driven world. The move follows a trend of public companies adopting crypto treasury strategies to potentially increase shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study published in Nature Climate Change indicates that rising temperatures are associated with increased consumption of products containing added sugar among Americans. Researchers analyzed household food purchase data and found a steep rise in sugar intake, primarily from sweetened beverages and frozen desserts, as temperatures climbed. The trend was more pronounced among lower-income and less-educated groups. The findings suggest that climate change could have indirect public health consequences by encouraging dietary choices linked to obesity and other metabolic diseases.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion and interest rates at multi-decade highs, many consumers are struggling with their balances. This article outlines three ways to get personalized help instead of relying on generic advice. These include consulting with a credit counseling agency for a comprehensive financial plan, working with a debt relief company to negotiate lower balances directly with creditors, and proactively contacting credit card issuers to inquire about hardship programs. Each approach offers a tailored strategy to address an individual's specific financial circumstances and create a viable path out of debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A strike by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union has severely disrupted London Underground services, forcing commuters to find alternative transportation. The walkout, centered on demands for better pay and a reduction in the work week from 35 to 32 hours, has led to increased traffic on buses, the Elizabeth line, and cycle hire services. Transport for London (TfL) has called the union's demands "simply unaffordable," stating it would cost hundreds of millions.

          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected President Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the $83.3 million verdict awarded to writer E. Jean Carroll for defamation. The court found no errors in the lower court's rulings and deemed the damages awarded by the jury to be "fair and reasonable." Trump's legal team had argued the amount was excessive and that he should have presidential immunity, but the panel was not persuaded by these claims. This ruling affirms the jury's decision that Trump defamed Carroll when he denied her accusation that he sexually assaulted her in the 1990s.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is now offering a substantial rebate of $7 per square foot to businesses, schools, and public institutions that replace nonfunctional lawns with water-efficient landscapes. This incentive, more than double the previous rate, aims to accelerate water conservation ahead of a new state law that will prohibit using potable water on such turf starting in 2027. To qualify, the new landscapes must include drought-tolerant plants and features for retaining stormwater. The goal is to beautify properties while saving water and improving biodiversity.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected a lawsuit from 19 states and the District of Columbia that challenged the Trump administration's mass firing of thousands of probationary federal employees. The court ruled 2-1 that the states lacked the legal standing to sue, as the management of the federal workforce is a federal, not state, concern. The administration terminated at least 24,000 workers early in its term as part of an effort to reduce the size of government. The ruling overturns a lower court's decision that had ordered the reinstatement of the affected workers.</p>

          <p>England's recent comfortable but uninspiring victory over Andorra highlights a long-running trend for the national football team: dominant but dull qualifying campaigns followed by struggles in major tournaments. Having lost only four World Cup qualifiers in 30 years, England's path to tournaments is often a formality against outmatched opponents, leading to a lack of jeopardy and excitement. Commentators and former players note that these routine wins offer little insight into the team's true capabilities against elite competition.

An independent review by law firm Latham & Watkins affirmed that FireAid acted according to its mission and had strong accountability measures. The reports detail how funds were distributed to vetted local non-profit organizations to provide swift aid, rather than direct payments to individuals, consistent with the charity's stated purpose.</p>

During the truce, negotiations would address a permanent end to the war, Hamas's disarmament, and the future governance of Gaza. While Israel is said to be seriously considering the plan, its defense minister has reiterated that Hamas must release hostages and disarm or face annihilation.</p>
