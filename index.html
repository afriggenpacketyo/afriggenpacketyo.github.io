          <p>Following the assassination of her husband, Charlie Kirk, Erika Kirk has been unanimously named the new CEO and board chair of Turning Point USA, the conservative youth organization he founded. The board stated that this decision aligns with Charlie Kirk's previously expressed wishes for the organization's leadership in the event of his death. In her first public statements, Erika Kirk vowed to continue her late husband's mission with renewed vigor, ensuring his political movement and media presence will carry on. The transition in leadership occurs as the organization and its allies prepare for his funeral.</p>

The move has drawn criticism from Democrats and former President Obama, who accuse the administration of government coercion and abusing power to silence critics.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has announced a $5 billion investment in rival chipmaker Intel, framing it as a strategic technology collaboration that was nearly a year in the making. The partnership will see the two companies co-develop AI systems for data centers by combining Intel's CPUs with Nvidia's GPUs and networking technology. Additionally, Intel will integrate Nvidia's graphics processors into its chips for PCs and notebooks. Huang expressed strong confidence in the deal, calling it an "incredible investment" and projecting that Nvidia will become a major customer for Intel's CPUs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines debt settlement as a potential solution for individuals with overwhelming credit card debt, using a $75,000 balance as an example. It explains that through negotiation, borrowers could potentially reduce their total owed amount by 30% to 50%, significantly lowering their financial burden compared to making traditional payments against high interest rates. While debt settlement can provide substantial relief, the article also notes the potential downsides, such as negative impacts on credit scores and the need for upfront cash. It contrasts this option with alternatives like consolidation loans and bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his new autobiography, "Heartbeats," tennis icon Björn Borg opens up about his life after abruptly retiring from the sport in 1981 at the age of 26. The 11-time Grand Slam champion recounts his struggles with heavy cocaine and alcohol abuse during the 1980s, his recent battle with advanced prostate cancer, and his eventual path to recovery and inner peace. Borg expresses regret for cutting ties with friends and fellow players after leaving tennis, a decision he believes led him into a destructive lifestyle. Now 69, he is in remission and says he has found happiness with his family.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, along with seven states, has filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation, alleging illegal ticket resale tactics. The suit claims the companies facilitated scalpers in unlawfully purchasing tickets to inflate profits and used a "bait and switch" approach to alter advertised prices. The FTC alleges that Ticketmaster, which controls roughly 80% of ticketing for major venues, effectively "triple dips" by collecting fees from brokers and consumers in both primary and secondary markets. This conduct is said to have cost fans millions of dollars and frustrated artists' efforts to maintain affordable prices.</p>

The debate highlights a deep divide between new panel members, some of whom are critical of existing vaccine policies, and representatives from major medical associations who warn that changing the recommendations could cause public confusion and reduce vaccination rates.</p>

It argues that this relationship has blurred the lines between grassroots political movements and media influence, creating a "government by the podcasters" where narratives are shaped and amplified outside of traditional journalism. The piece suggests this dynamic allows the administration to control its message while simultaneously attacking mainstream media. The recent backlash following Kirk's death is presented as an extension of this new media-political battleground.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the United States is actively trying to regain control of Bagram airbase, the former largest U.S. military installation in Afghanistan. Speaking at a press conference, Trump stated the base is strategically critical due to its proximity to China's nuclear weapons development sites. He suggested that he is negotiating with the Taliban, who currently control the facility, indicating they may need assistance from the U.S. in exchange for its return. Trump has frequently criticized the Biden administration for abandoning the base during the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court to proceed with the removal of Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. The administration argues that the president has the authority to determine what constitutes "cause" for removal, citing allegations that Cook engaged in mortgage fraud prior to her appointment. The Justice Department contends that lower courts cannot block the president's decision and that presidential appointees are not entitled to due process in this context. Cook denies any wrongdoing and has sued to block her dismissal from the independent agency.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut is expected to have varied but noticeable effects on consumer finances. Borrowers with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) are likely to see their rates decrease quickly, providing immediate relief. Mortgage rates, which have already been declining in anticipation of the move, may fall further, benefiting prospective homebuyers. Conversely, savers may see reduced returns, as yields on high-interest savings accounts and CDs are expected to drop in response to the central bank's policy shift. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Advocacy Groups and State Attorneys General Oppose New Public Service Loan Forgiveness Rule</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of 22 state attorneys general and over 250 consumer and advocacy organizations have formally opposed a proposed Trump administration rule that would narrow eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The new regulation would disqualify borrowers employed by organizations involved in activities the administration deems contrary to public order, such as those related to illegal immigration. Critics argue the rule is an unconstitutional and illegal attempt to punish employers for work the president dislikes, threatening promised debt relief for millions of public service workers across the country.</p>
