            <p>Donald Trump's 2025 inaugural committee raised a record $240 million, surpassing the $107 million raised in 2017. The largest donation came from Pilgrim's Pride Corporation ($5 million), followed by crypto company Ripple ($4.9 million). The filing discloses over 800 donors, but it remains unclear how much of the funds were spent on inaugural events versus how much is left over. The significant financial backing highlights the strong corporate and cryptocurrency industry support for the Trump administration, although the specific allocation of these funds remains undisclosed.</p>

            <p>With credit card debt at record highs and interest rates hovering around 22%, consolidating debt into a lower-rate loan can be beneficial. Personal loans currently average around 12%, potentially offering significant savings. The suitability of debt consolidation depends on credit profile, with those having good to excellent credit qualifying for the lowest rates. While effective, it requires addressing underlying spending habits to avoid accumulating new debt; consider this (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>The UN has issued a warning about the expansion of Asian cyber scam networks, which have made billions by targeting victims through investment, cryptocurrency, and romance scams.

            <p>The US Supreme Court heard arguments regarding the constitutionality of the US Preventive Services Task Force, potentially impacting access to free preventive healthcare under Obamacare. The case questions whether the HHS Secretary has sufficient oversight over the task force, which determines which preventive services insurers must cover without cost to patients. A lower court ruled the task force's structure unconstitutional, prompting the appeal. The decision could affect access to life-saving screenings and treatments for millions of Americans.</p>
