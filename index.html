          <p>Following a car and stabbing attack at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur, Prime Minister Keir Starmer vowed to protect Jewish communities and defeat antisemitic hate. The attack, which resulted in two deaths and several injuries, prompted national figures to condemn the violence and offer support to the Jewish community. Starmer promised increased police presence and emphasized the compassion and love of Britain while condemning the rising hatred against Jews. (not investment advice) The article details the responses from various leaders, including King Charles III and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, highlighting the gravity of the situation and calls for unity and strength against terrorism.

          <p>After a shooting at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Michigan left four dead and eight injured, a church member from Utah initiated a crowdfunding campaign for the gunman's family. David Butler, motivated by religious principles of loving enemies and caring for the vulnerable, aimed to raise $10,000 for the suspect's wife and children, including a chronically ill son. The campaign surpassed expectations, garnering over $300,000 from more than 7,600 donors, many of whom are also Latter-day Saints, who offered prayers for the family. The article highlights Butler's perspective on extending compassion to the family, who are also victims of the tragedy, despite facing criticism for supporting them.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security and FBI issued a joint intelligence bulletin warning of increased attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities and personnel by domestic violent extremists. Since June, extremists have conducted targeted, pre-planned violent attacks in at least three states, marking an escalation in tactics compared to past incidents. The bulletin references specific attacks, including a shooting at a Dallas ICE facility and an attack on the ICE Prairieland Detention Center in Texas, highlighting the use of encrypted communication for planning.

          <p>Alpha School in Austin, Texas, is pioneering a new education model where artificial intelligence shapes every lesson, replacing traditional teachers with 'guides' who earn six-figure salaries. Students spend two hours daily on AI-driven software for personalized learning in core subjects and afternoons on projects and life skills. The school, supported by major backers, claims its students test in the top 1%, but this approach raises skepticism among educators who question the unproven AI models. The article explores the potential benefits and concerns of integrating AI into education, highlighting both student engagement and the high cost of tuition.</p>
