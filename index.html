            <p>China's Commerce Ministry has expressed strong opposition to President Trump's threat of additional tariffs on Chinese goods, stating they will "fight to the end" to protect their interests. This response follows Trump's announcement of a potential 50% duty increase on U.S. imports from China if Beijing doesn't retract its 34% tariff on American products. The escalating trade tensions have raised concerns about the potential economic impact, with Morgan Stanley estimating a 1.5% to 2% dent in China's economy this year due to the increased tariffs. The broadened tariff scope reflects Chinese leadership's diminished hopes for a trade deal with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Asian markets showed signs of recovery on Tuesday after a tumultuous Monday, triggered by President Trump's global tariff campaign, while U.S. futures also edged up after a day of turmoil on Wall Street.

Monday's trading saw the Dow post its largest intraday point swing ever -- falling more than 1,700 points during its Monday session low, then swinging up 2,595 points from the low.

            <p>Akkermansia muciniphila, a unique gut bacterium, plays a crucial role in maintaining gut barrier function and preventing obesity. This bacterium thrives on mucin, a mucus layer lining the large intestine, which separates human cells from microbes. Studies suggest that A. muciniphila calms the immune system and may prevent metabolic diseases like diabetes. A high-fiber diet indirectly supports this bacterium by providing fuel for other beneficial microbes, which in turn produce substances that feed human cells in the colon, emphasizing the importance of a balanced diet for gut health.</p>

            <p>Vietnam, a major beneficiary of global trade, faces potential economic disruption due to President Trump's new tariffs, which include a steep 46% import duty on the Southeast Asian nation. This could significantly impact Vietnam's GDP, with economists estimating a 1.2 percentage point reduction in economic growth this year. Many companies, including Nike, Adidas, and Apple, rely on Vietnam for manufacturing due to its relatively low labor costs and supportive government policies. The tariffs may also deter foreign direct investment, posing challenges to Vietnam's ambitious growth targets. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Charlie Bean, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, advocates for a significant interest rate cut to 4% in May to counter the financial disruption caused by President Trump's trade tariffs. Bean believes a bold move is needed to address the uncertainty undermining business and consumer confidence. Another former rate setter, David Blanchflower, suggests an emergency meeting to consider a deep rate reduction. Financial markets have already priced in a series of rate cuts, but Bean argues for a more substantial intervention. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's sweeping reciprocal tariffs could inadvertently pave the way for China to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). As countries seek to counter American threats, they may close ranks against the US, potentially aiding China's long-standing application to join the trading bloc. The CPTPP, which includes Australia, Canada, Japan, and other major economies, was formed after the US withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership under Trump's initial term. This shift in global trade dynamics could reshape the balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can continue using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport individuals, but emphasized the necessity of proper legal process. The court stated that individuals must be given time to challenge their detention and for the government to prove its legal justification. This ruling comes amid concerns that some deportees were denied due process. The Supreme Court added guardrails. Deportees do have the right to go to court and challenge their detention. Also, they have to be given reasonable advance notice so they can attend court and not simply be whisked away in the middle of the night.</p>
