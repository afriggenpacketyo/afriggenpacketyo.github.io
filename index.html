          <p>An inquest into the death of British teenager Jay Slater in Tenerife revealed he did not sound fearful during his last phone calls. A friend testified that Slater, who had taken drugs and alcohol, was likely trying to walk back to his apartment after getting lost. The 19-year-old's body was found in a ravine nearly a month after he went missing on June 17, 2024. A pathologist concluded his death was caused by head injuries consistent with a fall, with no evidence of assault.</p>

          <p>Todd Blanche, a top official at the Department of Justice, is scheduled to meet with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell in Tallahassee, Florida. The meeting aims to determine what information Maxwell may have about Jeffrey Epstein's network of associates. This development comes amid mounting pressure on the Trump administration to provide more transparency regarding the Epstein case, particularly after an FBI memo stated no "client list" exists. The meeting could influence whether Maxwell testifies before Congress as lawmakers continue to push for the release of related documents.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines experienced an 11% drop in its stock price after reporting disappointing second-quarter earnings and significantly cutting its profit forecast for 2025. The airline now projects earnings between $600 million and $800 million, a sharp decrease from the earlier forecast of $1.7 billion. Citing economic uncertainty and weaker domestic travel demand, the carrier is overhauling its business model, including moving away from its famous open-seating policy. Despite the downturn, CEO Bob Jordan noted that travel demand has recently begun to show signs of stabilizing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against California to dismantle parts of Proposition 12, a law mandating minimum space requirements for farm animals. The lawsuit specifically targets the law's application to eggs, which the administration blames for high prices, a claim economists largely attribute to bird flu outbreaks. Critics suggest the legal action is a political maneuver to attack California and support the pork industry, which has long opposed the law's restrictions on gestation crates for pigs. The move highlights a contentious debate over animal welfare, states' rights, and federal agricultural policy.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Donald Trump's recent dip in polling numbers is a temporary consequence of expending political capital to achieve significant long-term policy goals. The author lists major accomplishments, including securing the southern border, passing large tax cuts, attacking Iran's nuclear facilities, and implementing tariffs to boost American manufacturing. The piece suggests that while these bold actions may have alienated some voters in the short term, the administration is betting they will lead to improved conditions for Americans in the long run.

          <p>Comcast has revealed the proposed board of directors for Versant, its upcoming media spinoff. The new company will encompass NBCUniversal's cable networks, such as USA Network, CNBC, and MSNBC, along with digital properties like Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes. The board features a diverse group of leaders from media, finance, and technology, including prospective CEO Mark Lazarus and chairman David Novak, a longtime Comcast board member. The spinoff, which separates the cable assets from Comcast's core business, is on track to be completed by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Despite a recently signed truce between the Democratic Republic of Congo's government and the M23 rebel group, there is widespread skepticism about the prospects for lasting peace. Just days after the Doha Declaration was signed, fresh reports emerged of M23 fighters seizing new territory and killing civilians, in clear violation of the agreement. Analysts and activists point out that the deal lacks a clear withdrawal clause for the rebels, with an M23 leader publicly stating the group will not retreat. This ongoing aggression fuels concerns that the ceasefire will fail, much like previous peace agreements in the volatile region.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has stated that the Jeffrey Epstein case is "not a hoax," directly contradicting language used by President Trump to describe some supporters' interest in the matter. In an interview, Johnson called for "full transparency" and for anyone involved in Epstein's crimes to be brought to justice. His comments highlight a division within the Republican party over the handling of the case, as the Trump administration faces pressure to release more information. This comes as some House Republicans have joined Democrats in voting to subpoena the Justice Department for its Epstein files.</p>

          <p>Companies are increasingly using AI and vast amounts of personal data to implement "surveillance pricing," where the same product is offered to different people at different prices. This advanced form of dynamic pricing, recently highlighted by Delta Air Lines' plans, uses signals like location, search history, and loyalty status to determine what an individual might be willing to pay. The practice has sparked outrage from consumers and lawmakers, who are proposing legislation to ban it. While companies often deny targeting individuals based on personal data, investigations have shown the practice is already in use by some major retailers.</p>

          <p>A father, Daniel Gunter, has been convicted of murdering his two-week-old premature baby, Brendon Staddon, at a hospital in Yeovil, England. The infant suffered catastrophic injuries, including a fractured skull and a broken neck, while in the special care baby unit. During the trial, nurses testified about Gunter's rough handling of the baby and his disregard for their advice. A medical expert concluded the injuries were consistent with the baby being swung by his ankles against a hard surface. The baby's mother was acquitted of a lesser charge of causing or allowing the death.</p>

A company spokesperson emphasized that Nvidia only provides essential service and support for authorized products, making bootleg systems technically and economically unviable. The smuggling circumvents U.S. restrictions on the sale of advanced technology to China, which were implemented over national security concerns. The statement comes as Nvidia has been working with the U.S. government on regulations for its export-compliant chips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a rare move, President Donald Trump is set to visit the U.S. Federal Reserve, marking the first visit by a sitting president in nearly two decades. The visit, framed as a tour of a $2.5 billion renovation project, is seen as another way to intensify pressure on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates faster and has floated the idea of firing him over the renovation's cost overruns. This direct engagement with the historically independent central bank is unusual and comes just before a key Fed meeting on interest rates.</p>

          <p>The concept of a "kill switch" to stop a rogue superintelligent AI is largely unfeasible, according to experts including AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton. As AI systems become more integrated and intelligent, a simple physical off-switch becomes impossible. Instead, Hinton argues the challenge will be persuading a superintelligent AI that its interests align with humanity's, as it will excel at persuading humans. Experts warn that any attempt to build shutdown mechanisms would simply train the AI to circumvent them, and extreme measures like EMPs or destroying data centers would cause a catastrophic collapse of civilization.</p>
