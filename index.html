          <p>The Reserve Bank of India has maintained its key policy rate at 5.5%, a decision that was widely anticipated by economists. This move follows a significant rate cut in the previous meeting and comes as India faces potential new tariffs from the United States. While the central bank noted that domestic growth is resilient, it acknowledged that ongoing geopolitical tensions and global trade uncertainties continue to pose risks to the economic outlook. The RBI also lowered its inflation forecast for the fiscal year, citing a more benign near-term outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC secured a 2-1 victory over Tigres UANL in the Leagues Cup, largely thanks to a standout performance from 19-year-old Venezuelan player David Martínez. Martínez scored both of LAFC's goals, including the decisive one from a remarkable individual play where he regained possession at midfield and skillfully finished. The loss leaves the Mexican club, Tigres, on the brink of elimination from the tournament, dependent on an unlikely combination of other match results. Despite the win, LAFC's own chances of advancing to the next phase remain slim.</p>

          <p>Ranchers in northern Mexico are struggling economically after the United States suspended imports of live cattle due to fears of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. This ban is the latest blow to a sector already weakened by severe drought, disrupting a cattle export business worth over $1.2 billion to Mexico last year. The parasite poses a significant threat to livestock, and the U.S. is taking extensive measures to prevent its spread. In response, Mexican ranchers are forced to sell cattle domestically at a major loss and explore new ventures to survive.</p>

          <p>A sudden and extreme downpour, known as a cloudburst, has triggered catastrophic flash floods in Dharali village in India's northern state of Uttarakhand. More than 100 people are currently missing, including at least 10 soldiers, after a massive wave of water and debris swept through the area. Rescue operations are severely hampered by continued heavy rains, damaged roads, and widespread power outages, making it difficult for disaster response teams to reach the affected village. Officials have confirmed rescuing around 130 people so far, but the situation remains critical.</p>

          <p>A senior United Nations official has issued a stark warning against Israel potentially expanding its military operations to a full reoccupation of the Gaza Strip. Assistant Secretary General Miroslav Jenča told the UN Security Council that such a move would be deeply alarming and could have catastrophic results for millions of Palestinians and the remaining Israeli hostages. The warning comes amid Israeli media reports that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considering a plan for the 'full conquest' of Gaza. The potential plan has reportedly caused division within Israel's own military leadership.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 41% tariff on Syria, the highest rate for any country, just months after lifting long-standing sanctions. While direct trade between the US and Syria is minimal, analysts say the move sends a damaging symbolic message that could deter much-needed foreign investment for reconstruction. The country's economy is on the verge of collapse after 13 years of devastating civil war, and it relies heavily on international aid and investment. Experts suggest the tariff may be a political tool to maintain leverage over Syria's new transitional government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Gifford fire, now the largest in California this year, has burned nearly 84,000 acres in the Los Padres National Forest and remains largely uncontained. The blaze is threatening over 800 structures across Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, forcing evacuations and injuring at least three people. Over 1,900 personnel are battling the fire, which grew rapidly from several smaller fires and is burning through steep, inaccessible terrain. Officials are concerned that a forecast of hot, dry weather will increase fire behavior and create more dangerous conditions in the coming days.</p>

          <p>Meta has announced that its messaging platform, WhatsApp, took down over 6.8 million accounts associated with scams during the first six months of the year. Many of these accounts were linked to criminal scam centers in Southeast Asia, which often use forced labor to target people globally with fraudulent schemes. The announcement coincided with WhatsApp rolling out new security features to alert users of suspicious activity, such as being added to a group by an unknown contact. The company is working to proactively detect and disable these accounts before they can be used for scams.</p>

          <p>Lebanon's government has directed its army to formulate a plan for the disarmament of all non-state groups, a move primarily aimed at the powerful militant group Hezbollah. The plan, which is to be presented to the cabinet by the end of August, calls for restricting all weapons to state institutions by the end of the year. This decision follows a ceasefire agreement and significant international pressure, particularly from the United States, to disarm the Iran-backed group. Hezbollah's leadership has already indicated it will not agree to disarm while facing ongoing attacks from Israel.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations, causing its stock to slide in after-hours trading. However, the company's revenue of $7.69 billion surpassed estimates, showing a 32% increase from the previous year. The company's data center segment grew 14%, driven by demand for both CPUs and GPUs for AI servers. AMD's AI business revenue was negatively impacted by U.S. export restrictions to China, but CEO Lisa Su expressed optimism about future growth in the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA disaster relief funds. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge found that the states were likely to succeed in their argument and that transferring the funds could cause 'irreparable harm' to communities needing the money for flood mitigation and other disaster preparedness projects. The administration is now blocked from repurposing the funds while the case proceeds.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is expanding its detention capacity by partnering with Indiana's prison system to use 1,000 beds at the Miami Correctional Center.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem dubbed the new facility the 'Speedway Slammer,' claiming it will house the 'worst of the worst,' though similar claims about another new facility in Florida have been questioned by reports.

          <p>A massive copper mining project in Afghanistan, backed by China's state-owned MCC, is reportedly making significant progress toward starting extraction this year after a 17-year delay. The Mes Aynak mine, which holds one of the world's largest untapped copper deposits, was stalled for years due to security issues, archaeological sites, and lack of infrastructure. The Taliban government announced last year that the project would switch to underground mining to better protect ancient relics at the site. The company stated it is ready to begin production if remaining government procedures are completed smoothly.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows a 4.5% drop in violent crime and an 8.1% drop in property crime compared to the previous year. Notably, murders fell by 14.9% and motor vehicle thefts saw a record one-year drop of 18.6%. While experts note the positive trend, they also point out that aggravated assaults remain higher than pre-pandemic levels and that many crimes go unreported.</p>
