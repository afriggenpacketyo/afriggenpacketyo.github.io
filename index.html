          <p>AI data center provider CoreWeave has announced plans to sell $1.5 billion in bonds to support general corporate purposes, including debt repayment.

Despite some investor concerns about its debt levels, the company, which serves major clients like Nvidia and Microsoft, has seen its share price more than triple since its public debut.

          <p>Despite the growing popularity and investment in women's football across Europe, as seen in Euro 2025, Eastern European nations have struggled to keep pace. Experts cite a combination of historical underinvestment, societal norms that discourage female participation, and a lack of professional infrastructure as key barriers. While organizations like UEFA are increasing funding and major tournaments are boosting visibility, figures in the region believe significant cultural shifts and dedicated investment are still needed for women's football to thrive.</p>

          <p>The anti-discrimination body Fare has questioned the England women's football team's decision to stop taking the knee before Euro 2025 matches, a choice made after player Jess Carter experienced racist abuse online. The Lionesses stated the gesture's symbolism was being hijacked and that a new approach to combating racism is needed, a decision supported by the FA. The incident has intensified calls for social media platforms to be held accountable under the UK's Online Safety Act, with campaigners arguing that current measures are insufficient to curb online toxicity.</p>

          <p>Bird strikes on airplanes are a persistent and costly problem for the aviation industry, with the FAA recording about 19,000 incidents in the U.S. last year.

          <h2>Leadership Expert Advises Against Using Flattery to Manage Employees</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leadership expert Jennifer Schielke advises managers to stop using flattery as a tool to be liked by their employees, arguing that it often backfires and comes across as insincere or manipulative. She suggests that relying on excessive praise can be a sign of insecurity and poor leadership skills. Instead of empty compliments, bosses can make employees feel valued by showing genuine appreciation, listening to their perspectives, and investing in team-building activities and policies that create an authentic and supportive workplace culture.</p>

The Israeli military stated it fired warning shots to disperse a threatening crowd, and its initial investigation found far fewer casualties.

          <p>Child development experts argue that parents often make the mistake of thwarting a young child's natural desire to help with household chores, which can hinder their development. By prioritizing speed and neatness over participation, or by micromanaging, parents can discourage enthusiasm for contributing to the family. Researchers suggest that involving children in real household tasks, even if imperfectly done, helps build motor skills, confidence, and a sense of responsibility. Turning chores into a shared social activity is recommended to foster a culture of helpfulness.</p>
