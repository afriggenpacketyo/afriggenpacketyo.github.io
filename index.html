          <p>SpaceX's tenth Super Heavy-Starship test flight was called off due to an issue with ground systems during propellant loading. This highly anticipated launch aimed to test various upgrades and push the vehicle's capabilities after three consecutive in-flight failures. The mission plan included a controlled splashdown for the Super Heavy booster and a suborbital flight for Starship, deploying Starlink simulator satellites and attempting an in-space engine restart. The delays raise further questions about the 2027 target for NASA's Artemis moon landing, which relies heavily on Starship's readiness.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan opposition leaders and civil society groups announced the release of 13 individuals who were jailed during President Nicolás Maduro's post-election crackdown last year. While authorities have not confirmed the releases, opposition figures celebrated it as a step forward, noting that eight were freed and five placed under house arrest. These detentions followed the disputed July presidential elections, which led to widespread protests and numerous arrests. Organizations advocating for political prisoners claim that around 1,000 people remain in detention, highlighting ongoing human rights concerns in the country.</p>

          <p>Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse has been abruptly ousted as Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) director, with no immediate reason provided to Congress. This firing follows the DIA's preliminary assessment of military strikes against Iran, which contradicted President Trump's more aggressive claims about their impact on Iran's nuclear program. Democratic Senator Mark Warner criticized the administration's "dangerous habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test." This move, along with other recent military leadership changes, suggests a pattern of politicization within national security agencies, causing widespread concern among DIA employees about their work being influenced.</p>
