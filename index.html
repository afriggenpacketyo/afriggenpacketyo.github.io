          <p>A German court has ordered the government to grant visas to an Afghan family, ruling that a previous promise was legally binding. This decision comes as the current conservative-led government has been tightening migration policies and had previously halted the admission program for at-risk Afghans. The family, currently in Pakistan, faced deportation to Afghanistan where they would be in danger from the Taliban. The court's ruling, which can be appealed, highlights the tension between legal commitments and shifting political stances on immigration.</p>

          <p>A man has sustained serious, life-changing injuries after being shot by a Kent Police officer in Hollingbourne, England. The incident occurred while officers were attempting to make an arrest on Monday evening. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has launched an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the firearm discharge. Kent Police has stated they are fully supporting the IOPC's inquiry into the shooting, which is currently in its very early stages.</p>

          <p>The IRS has indicated that it will not enforce the Johnson Amendment against churches whose pastors endorse political candidates from the pulpit. This move comes via a joint court filing with the National Religious Broadcasters Association, which sued the IRS arguing the rule violates First Amendment rights. The 1954 Johnson Amendment prohibits tax-exempt organizations, including churches, from endorsing or opposing political candidates. This new stance effectively creates a carve-out for religious organizations, formalizing a policy of non-enforcement that has largely been an unspoken practice. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Argentine man has been identified as the 140th "stolen grandchild" taken from political prisoners during the country's military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983. The 48-year-old was born in a clandestine detention center after his activist parents were "disappeared" by the regime. The identification was made possible through DNA testing, a result of the decades-long work by the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo activist group. This discovery brings both joy and a stark reminder of the brutal human rights abuses committed during the "dirty war."</p>

          <p>England's children's commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, has warned that some children are living in "Dickensian" levels of poverty, citing examples of homes with rats and a lack of basic necessities. A new report highlights a range of concerns, including poor housing and lack of access to healthy food. The commissioner, along with counterparts from across the UK, is urging the government to scrap the two-child benefit cap to address the root causes of poverty. The government stated it is committed to a new child poverty strategy.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in Texas, records show that officials in Kerr County, one of the hardest-hit areas, had discussed implementing a siren warning system for nearly a decade but never did. More than 100 people died in the flooding, and the lack of an audible alert system has come under intense scrutiny. A former sheriff had pushed for sirens as early as 2016, citing the specific danger to summer camps along the river. A funding application for a new system was not selected, and the county ultimately did not budget for it.</p>

The policy is supported by the Labour-led government and Plaid Cymru but is opposed by the Welsh Conservatives and some business groups who fear it will deter visitors.

It also proposes a legal framework for prosecuting these crimes as weapons of war, even without direct attribution to individual perpetrators.

          <p>This in-depth article argues that the world is entering a dangerous new nuclear arms race, with the fastest buildups occurring in China and North Korea. This destabilizing proliferation cascade in East Asia is increasing pressure on South Korea and Japan to develop their own nuclear arsenals, especially amid uncertainty about U.S. security commitments under the Trump administration. The piece, framed by a Hiroshima survivor's testimony, warns that the decades-long effort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons may be collapsing, raising the risk of a global conflict with unimaginable consequences.</p>

          <p>Women in South Asia are experiencing menopause and related aging signs earlier than their peers in Europe and the U.S., according to studies and anecdotal reports. The average age of menopause in India and Pakistan is around 46-47, compared to 52 in the general U.S. population. Experts point to a combination of factors, including genetics, chronic vitamin D deficiency, and significant societal stress. The cultural pressure to prioritize fertility over long-term health often sidelines conversations about women's well-being, compounding the physical and emotional challenges of premature aging.</p>
