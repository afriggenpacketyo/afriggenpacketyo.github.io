          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its AI model, Claude, qualifies as "fair use" and is "transformative." The judge stated that Anthropic's AI training did not infringe on authors' copyrights because the large language models did not reproduce creative elements or identifiable expressive styles. This decision is a significant victory for AI companies amidst ongoing legal battles over copyrighted works used in developing and training LLMs. The ruling establishes legal boundaries and opportunities for the AI industry moving forward, clarifying the use of copyrighted material in AI development.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson argues that the War Powers Act is unconstitutional, claiming it violates Article 2 of the U.S. Constitution. Johnson asserts that President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear targets falls within his powers under Article 2, which designates the president as commander in chief. A War Powers resolution introduced by Representatives Massie and Khanna, aimed at barring unauthorized U.S. military action in Iran, faces opposition from Johnson. Massie indicated he might not advance the resolution if the Iran-Israel ceasefire holds, further diminishing its prospects in the House.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, despite initial accusations from both sides of violating the agreement. Israel accused Iran of launching missiles at Beersheba, resulting in casualties, while Trump criticized Israel for conducting strikes just before the ceasefire was set to begin. After intervening, including a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, Trump announced that the ceasefire was in effect. The conflict between Israel and Iran, lasting 12 days, has resulted in at least 1,000 deaths, sparking international concerns and diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions.</p>

          <p>A New Jersey elementary school teacher, Laura Caron, has been indicted on charges of aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, and endangering the welfare of a child. The charges stem from allegations of an inappropriate sexual relationship with a student who resided in her home, beginning when he was 11 years old. Court documents suggest that the victim confirmed to police that he was in a sexual relationship with Caron and that he is the father of her young child, who was born when the victim was 13 years old.

The court cited the state's negligence in implementing regulations to protect waters from agricultural pollution, which causes the algae bloom. Auffray's family will receive compensation, with the state held 60% responsible for his death.

          <p>A new data tool from UCLA reveals significant environmental health disparities between Latino and white neighborhoods in Los Angeles, with Latino communities disproportionately suffering from extreme heat and air pollution. Latino neighborhoods experience approximately 23 more extreme-heat days per year than non-Latino white neighborhoods. The dashboard also highlights disparities in tree canopy coverage and housing quality, which compound the risks of heat exposure. The tool aims to provide policymakers, advocates, and residents with reliable data to push for equitable responses to environmental challenges.</p>
