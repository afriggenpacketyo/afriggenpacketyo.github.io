          <p>A cross-party group of 96 UK MPs has formally requested the government to bring sick and injured children from Gaza to the UK for urgent medical care. Citing the "decimated" healthcare system in Gaza, the letter calls for an evacuation timeline and adequate funding, stressing that the process should be based solely on clinical need. The parliamentarians also suggest that these children and their families should have the option to seek asylum in the UK after their treatment is completed.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss a peace agreement to end the war. Trump stated that both sides determined a direct peace agreement is preferable to a ceasefire, which he claims often fails to hold. While Trump described his meeting with Putin as productive, no specific details of the proposed agreement were shared, leaving European leaders to seek clarity on the vague U.S. security guarantees that were mentioned.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has declared his country open to foreign investment during the inauguration of a Chinese automaker's factory, signaling a potential pivot towards Beijing. This move comes as Brazil faces a 50% tariff on its goods from the United States, which President Lula has repeatedly criticized. He has also discussed a coordinated response to U.S. tariffs with fellow BRICS leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, highlighting growing economic and political tensions between Brazil and the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has rapidly strengthened into a powerful Category 5 storm over the Atlantic Ocean, with maximum sustained winds reaching 160 mph. As the first hurricane of the 2025 season, its outer bands are currently impacting the northern Leeward Islands, prompting warnings for heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and dangerous surf conditions. While forecasters expect the storm's path to curve northward and remain offshore from the U.S. mainland, residents in the Caribbean are urged to monitor its progress closely.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old Gazan woman, Marah Abu Zuhri, who was evacuated to Italy for medical treatment, has died from a cardiac arrest caused by severe emaciation. She was brought to a hospital in Pisa as part of an Italian government program that has transferred over 180 people from Gaza for care since the war began. Her death highlights the severe malnutrition crisis in the region, where the UN has warned of widespread starvation and the Hamas-run health ministry reports over 250 hunger-related deaths.</p>

          <p>Six influential Senate Democrats, including Chuck Schumer and Mark Warner, have formally requested that President Trump reconsider a deal allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell advanced AI chips to China. The arrangement involves the U.S. government receiving a 15% cut of the revenue from these sales in exchange for export licenses. The senators expressed serious alarm in an open letter, arguing that the deal trades away America's competitive technological edge and could strengthen China's military capabilities, thereby jeopardizing national security.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin's transformation from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane occurred through a process known as rapid intensification, where wind speeds increased by over 58 mph in just 24 hours. This explosive growth was fueled by perfect conditions, including very warm sea surface temperatures exceeding 85 degrees Fahrenheit and low wind shear, which allowed the storm's compact core to strengthen quickly. Experts note that climate change is making such events more common, as hotter oceans provide more energy for storms, complicating forecasting and emergency preparations.</p>

          <p>Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old founder and CEO of Epic Systems, has built the dominant electronic health record software company while deliberately avoiding Silicon Valley norms. Founded in 1979 and still privately held, Epic generates $5.7 billion in annual revenue and is used in over 40% of U.S. hospitals. Faulkner, often described as a mix of Bill Gates and Willy Wonka, has maintained a unique corporate culture at the company's massive Wisconsin campus and has established a trust to ensure the company is never sold or taken public after her death.</p>

          <p>Nationwide immigration arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) dropped by 13% in July, following a sharp increase in June. The total number of "initial book-ins" fell from over 31,500 to just under 27,500 for the month. While ICE has cited the need for more resources to meet administration goals, activists and immigrant rights groups believe their efforts, such as rapid-response hotlines and legal challenges, may be contributing to slowing the pace of arrests and deportations in certain regions.</p>

          <p>Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson claimed victory over American Noah Lyles in their first 100m head-to-head since the Paris Olympics, winning at the Silesia Diamond League meet. Thompson clocked a time of 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record, while Lyles finished second in 9.90 seconds. The race was a measure of revenge for Thompson, who had lost the Olympic gold to Lyles by a mere five-thousandths of a second in a photo finish a year ago.</p>

          <p>U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has publicly denied any intention of running for president in 2028, calling the claim a "flat-out lie." His statement came in response to attacks from conservative influencer Laura Loomer, who accused a top Kennedy aide of laying the groundwork for a future campaign. In a social media post, Kennedy affirmed his loyalty to President Trump and the administration's "Make America Healthy Again" agenda, dismissing the accusations as an attempt by the "swamp" to create a divide between him and the president.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued by a California Highway Patrol helicopter after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area near Sequoia National Park. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, trapping him. A search and rescue team located him using a drone, and he was hoisted to safety, where he was treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>A top scientist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has called for China to create a national, top-down strategy to accelerate the development of space-based solar power. This technology involves building large solar arrays in orbit that collect energy and transmit it to Earth via microwaves, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. The call to action emphasizes the need to close the technological gap with the United States in this emerging sector, which is seen as critical for both future energy security and the ongoing space race.</p>

          <p>An internal review has revealed that Grant Hardin, a former police chief, spent six months planning his escape from an Arkansas prison. Hardin told investigators that lax security in the prison kitchen, where he worked, allowed him to slowly gather supplies and create a fake law enforcement uniform using markers and a can lid. He escaped by walking out of a back gate after a tower guard opened it without confirming his identity, an incident that has led to the firing of two employees and a review of systemic security failures.</p>

          <p>Deadly flash floods caused by intense monsoon rains have killed at least 404 people across northern Pakistan and neighboring India, with rescue efforts ongoing. In Pakistan, the death toll has reached 344, primarily in the mountainous Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where homes collapsed or were swept away. In India-administered Kashmir, at least 60 people have died in a remote Himalayan village crowded with pilgrims. Experts attribute the increasing frequency of these destructive cloudburst events to climate change and unplanned development in vulnerable mountainous regions.</p>
