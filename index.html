          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) anticipates that its online services will remain disrupted until July due to a cyber-attack that occurred over the Easter weekend. The ransomware attack, believed to be the work of Scattered Spider, has affected online ordering and click-and-collect services, leading to an estimated £300m reduction in profits for the current year. M&S Chief Executive Stuart Machin stated that the company is managing the situation and views it as an opportunity to accelerate the pace of change within the organization. The disruptions have impacted food sales due to reduced availability and fashion, home, and beauty sales due to the pause in online ordering.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited House Republicans to advocate for the passage of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act", urging them to set aside their reservations and support the legislation. Speaker Mike Johnson engaged in negotiations with various factions to address their concerns, with some progress being made. The bill encompasses a wide range of provisions, including extending the 2017 tax cuts, increasing military and immigration enforcement spending, and reducing funding for Medicaid, food stamps, education, and clean energy subsidies. Trump's entreaties initially failed to resolve the divisions, but by Tuesday evening, Speaker Johnson appeared to have made progress in behind-the-scenes negotiations with lawmakers from across the conference.</p>

          <p>German authorities conducted raids across three states, arresting five individuals suspected of far-right extremism, and Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt will address lawmakers regarding border security measures. The German Council of Economic Experts is set to release its economic forecasts, amidst concerns about Germany's economic stagnation following two years of recession. Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new government has pledged reforms to revitalize the economy, including corporate tax cuts and deregulation.

          <p>A leaked memo indicates that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner had proposed tax increases to Chancellor Reeves, amounting to £3-4 billion annually, ahead of departmental spending plans. The proposals included increasing the corporation tax rate on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. While Reeves did not implement these measures, government insiders have downplayed the significance of the memo, and Environment Secretary Steve Reed affirmed the cabinet's unity behind the government's plan. The Conservatives have seized on the memo to criticize Labour's fiscal policies, urging the chancellor to rule out future tax increases.</p>

Current antivenoms are specific to certain venoms and derived from animals injected with small amounts of venom to produce antibodies.</p>

          <p>The election of Pope Leo XIV, the first pope from the US, has been met with skepticism from some within the Maga movement, who view him as a globalist. The article explores the potential challenges that Pope Leo XIV's papacy may pose to Catholic Maga figures, particularly regarding issues such as economic populism, immigration, and global cooperation. The new pope's choice of name is a sign that he recognizes the scale and the novelty of the challenge that the rightwing populist turn represents. The article suggests that Leo XIV's commitment to Catholic social teaching and universality may conflict with the nationalistic and insular views of Maga Catholics.</p>

Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike stated that the measure aims to protect residents' lives and daily living amidst declining real wages and surging prices.

She realized cooking had become a trigger for hyper-vigilance and is working to drive a cultural shift towards safer kitchen tools.

Such an event could wipe out cities like Seattle and Portland, Oregon, and cause coastal land to sink by as much as 6.5 feet.

The US curbs on sales of state-of-the-art AI chips to China have forced companies there to buy semiconductors from Chinese designers like Huawei. The American action has also pushed China to aggressively invest and develop a supply chain that is not dependent on foreign manufacturers. US President Donald Trump's administration rolled back some curbs last week, with countries complaining that they were being severed from key technology needed to develop AI.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang criticized the United States' export controls on artificial intelligence chips to China, stating that they have been a failure as companies are turning to locally-developed technology. Huang said the curbs have forced Chinese companies to buy semiconductors from domestic designers like Huawei, and pushed China to invest aggressively in developing its own supply chain. He noted that Nvidia's share of China's AI chip market has plummeted from nearly 95 percent to 50 percent. China has also condemned the US measures, calling on Washington to correct its wrongdoings.</p>

Downing Street added ministers were "clear that, after presiding over years of mismanagement, Thames Water should not be handing itself bonuses". The company secured an emergency £3bn loan in March to stave off collapse and is now looking to reduce its huge £20bn debt pile by requiring lenders to accept a discount in what they are owed.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to pause its scheme to pay out bonuses to senior executives linked with securing its £3bn rescue loan following criticism from the government and the public. The company's "retention scheme" was set to amount to 50% of senior bosses' pay packets, which could have led to them getting £1m on top of their annual salaries and regular bonuses. The decision comes after Downing Street said bosses at the troubled firm "rewarding themselves for failure is clearly not acceptable".

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister resigned Wednesday because of political fallout over recent comments that he "never had to buy rice" because he got it from supporters as gifts. The resignation comes as the public struggles with record high prices of the country's traditional staple food. Politically, the gaffe could be further trouble for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's already struggling minority government, which faces a crucial national election in July. Eto, while submitting his resignation, has sought to clarify the comments that got him in trouble. He said he does actually buy white rice himself and was not living on rice given as gifts.</p>

          <p>Tuesday didn’t start as a game the Dodgers necessarily had to win.

Not after Yoshinobu Yamamoto looked like an ace, a stopper and a Cy Young candidate all wrapped in one, spinning seven scoreless innings in a nine-strikeout gem.

Health experts warn about the addictive nature of nicotine and potential oral health issues associated with pouch use.

However, potential tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could undermine Malaysia's ambitious plans to move into chip design and cutting-edge manufacturing. While a 24 percent levy was recently put on hold, a 10 percent base-line tariff remains, and Trump is considering a blanket levy of at least 25 percent on all semiconductor imports.</p>
