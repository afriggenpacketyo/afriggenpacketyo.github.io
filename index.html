          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Maj. Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan on the TV series "M*A*S*H," has died at the age of 87 at her home in New York City from what is believed to be natural causes. Swit's portrayal of Houlihan, a foil to Alan Alda's Capt. Benjamin Franklin "Hawkeye" Pierce, earned her two Emmy Awards and multiple Golden Globe nominations during the show's 11-season run on CBS. As the series progressed, Swit sought to develop Houlihan's character beyond the "Hot Lips" nickname, emphasizing her intelligence and portraying her as a real person undergoing constant development and change. The actress's career spanned both stage and screen, but her role in "M*A*S*H" remains her most iconic achievement, remembered for its blend of comedy and drama set against the backdrop of the Korean War. The optimism score is 90.</p>

          <p>Mondelez International, the maker of Oreo and Wheat Thins, has filed a lawsuit against Aldi, accusing the supermarket chain of copying its packaging designs to mislead customers into buying store-brand versions of its products. The lawsuit claims that Aldi's products, such as Peanut Butter Creme Filled Cookies and Thin Wheat, feature similar font, colors, image placement, and product names as Mondelez's Nutter Butter and Wheat Thins. Mondelez seeks monetary damages and a court order to prevent Aldi from selling the allegedly infringing products, noting that Aldi has faced similar lawsuits in the past regarding product packaging. The suit highlights the ongoing battle between name-brand companies and store brands over consumer perception and potential trademark infringement. The optimism score is 50.</p>

          <p>PBS and Lakeland PBS, a Minnesota public television station, have filed a lawsuit against President Trump over his executive order to eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, arguing the order is unconstitutional and exceeds presidential authority. The lawsuit alleges that Trump's order is motivated by his dislike of PBS's news coverage and programming, violating free speech protections and editorial independence. Lakeland PBS, which relies heavily on federal grants, argues the funding cut poses an existential threat, as it is the only local television programming source for many Minnesotans. The lawsuit follows similar litigation filed by NPR, challenging the Trump administration's efforts to defund public broadcasting. The optimism score is 40.</p>

The new policy includes an appeals process and support for boxers with adverse test results. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>There is a growing trend of crypto kidnappings, where criminals use violence to steal cryptocurrency, referred to as "wrench attacks." These attacks involve threatening crypto owners to reveal their account passwords, which can be easier than stealing from traditional bank accounts. The rise in Bitcoin's value makes crypto holders attractive targets, and the crypto world's culture of flaunting wealth aids criminals in identifying potential victims.
