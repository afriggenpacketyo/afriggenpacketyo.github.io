          <p>The U.S. Senate is set to vote on competing measures to end a six-day federal government shutdown, with political tensions running high. Democrats are pushing for a bill that continues government appropriations while also extending certain health care provisions, a version Republicans have consistently opposed. If that fails, the Senate is expected to reconsider a Republican-backed, seven-week stopgap funding bill that has already passed the House. Both parties continue to publicly blame each other for the shutdown and the failure to reach a compromise, creating uncertainty for federal services and employees.</p>

          <p>Sébastien Lecornu, France's fifth prime minister in under two years, has resigned just 26 days after his appointment, plunging the nation into further political turmoil. The move came after his newly formed cabinet faced intense criticism and threats of a no-confidence vote from opposition parties. In his resignation speech, Lecornu blamed the "partisan appetites" of political factions for the governmental paralysis. The ongoing instability, stemming from a hung parliament, has raised calls for early elections and caused French stocks to fall sharply as the country grapples with significant national debt.</p>

          <p>Nearly 30 million Apple and Samsung smartphone users in the UK could be entitled to a payout of around £17 each if a lawsuit against chip manufacturer Qualcomm is successful. The consumer group Which? has taken Qualcomm to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, accusing the company of anti-competitive practices by overcharging for its components and patents. The lawsuit alleges that these inflated costs were passed on to consumers between 2015 and 2024. If the five-week trial finds Qualcomm abused a dominant market position, a second stage will seek £480 million in damages.</p>

          <p>CBS News' new owner, Skydance Media, has appointed Bari Weiss, founder of The Free Press, as the network's editor-in-chief in a move aimed at appealing to right-of-center audiences. Skydance is also acquiring The Free Press as part of the deal, though it will continue to operate as a standalone site. Weiss, who famously resigned from The New York Times citing an "illiberal environment," is expected to redefine the CBS News brand.

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has issued $50 million in grants for autism research, including a $5.1 million grant to Cornell University, to better understand treatment outcomes. This funding arrives amidst the Trump administration's controversial public health agenda, which has included promoting debunked theories linking autism to vaccines and Tylenol. While some experts express relief that the funded research is sophisticated and scientifically rigorous, they remain concerned about the administration's potential to promote non-experts and simplistic views on the complex condition. The initiative aims to create a more data-driven approach to studying autism.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown extends, a growing number of both Republican and Democratic lawmakers are publicly requesting that their pay be withheld. Due to constitutional and federal law, members of Congress cannot permanently forfeit their salaries but can have them withheld until the shutdown ends, at which point they will receive backpay. Representatives such as Chip Roy (R-Texas) and Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) have made these requests to the House's Chief Administrative Officer. This symbolic gesture aims to show solidarity with federal workers who are missing paychecks during the funding lapse.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Australia have filed an appeal against the sentence given to Erin Patterson, who was convicted of murdering three relatives with a poisonous mushroom meal. They argue that her sentence of life in prison with a possibility of parole after 33 years is "manifestly inadequate." Patterson was found guilty of killing her in-laws and her husband's aunt by serving them beef Wellington containing death cap mushrooms. Her own legal team has also indicated an intent to appeal her conviction, setting the stage for further legal battles in the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>The German government intends to extend the tax exemption for electric vehicles to encourage wider adoption and support its automotive industry. Under the draft legislation, the exemption would apply to EVs registered by the end of 2030, with the tax break lasting a maximum of 10 years, until December 31, 2035. Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil stated this is part of a broader package of measures aimed at securing jobs and ensuring Germany remains a leader in car manufacturing.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing 528 mammal species confirms that females tend to live longer than males, a gap that stands at nearly six years for humans in the U.S. Researchers suggest this longevity advantage stems from a mix of genetic, behavioral, and evolutionary factors. For instance, males across many species engage in riskier behaviors to compete for mates, a parallel seen in human males who have higher rates of smoking and drinking. The study also found a correlation between caregiving for offspring and longer life, suggesting that evolving gender roles could help narrow the lifespan gap in humans.</p>

The man, Husamettin D., claims he was deceived by Pelicot's then-husband, Dominique, into believing she had consented to the sexual acts while pretending to be asleep. His legal team argues he was trapped by the husband and is not a perpetrator of sexual assault. The appeal means Gisele Pelicot, who became a feminist hero for waiving her anonymity and speaking out, will have to face the ordeal of another court appearance.</p>

          <p>Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev commented that recent drone disruptions across Europe, including at airports in Germany and Denmark, serve as a useful reminder to Europeans about the dangers of war. While not claiming responsibility, Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, stated that the incidents should make citizens "fear and tremble." He accused European leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron of stoking conflict for political gain. His remarks reflect escalating rhetoric from Moscow in response to Western support for Ukraine and discussions of using frozen Russian assets.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged over 4% to a record high following the election of staunch conservative Sanae Takaichi as the new leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Her victory positions her to become Japan's first female prime minister and has fueled investor optimism for continued accommodative monetary policy and government spending. However, the news caused the yen to weaken significantly, passing the 150 mark against the U.S. dollar, which raises concerns about potential currency intervention from Japan's Ministry of Finance.

          <p>A woman was shot by federal agents in Chicago after authorities say their vehicles were rammed and boxed in by about 10 cars. The incident occurred near an ICE facility that has been the site of ongoing protests against the agency's enforcement actions. The Department of Homeland Security stated that agents opened fire after one of the drivers allegedly brandished a semi-automatic weapon. The woman was taken into FBI custody and faces charges, along with another man involved. The shooting led to a tense standoff between protesters and heavily armed federal officers at the scene.</p>

          <p>After five weeks of the NFL season, several teams are facing significant disappointment despite preseason expectations. The New York Jets remain the league's only winless team at 0-5, plagued by penalties, turnovers, and an ineffective defense. The Baltimore Ravens (1-4) suffered their worst home loss in franchise history, and the Cincinnati Bengals' season appears lost following Joe Burrow's injury. In contrast, the 4-1 Philadelphia Eagles are also facing internal discontent and fan skepticism despite their strong record, highlighting that a winning record doesn't always equate to a happy locker room.</p>

          <p>Despite critical acclaim, including Oscar wins, filmmakers from both Israel and Palestine are encountering significant challenges in securing international distribution for their work. The polarized debate surrounding the Gaza war has made distributors in key markets like the U.S. and Germany hesitant to release films that address the conflict. For example, the Oscar-winning Palestinian documentary "No Other Land" failed to find a U.S. distributor. Israeli filmmakers also face pressure, including boycott calls from some in Hollywood and funding cuts from their own government for films critical of its policies.</p>

The farmers describe the event as an "ecological catastrophe" that has destroyed crops, harmed livestock, and caused health problems for residents.

          <p>Police in Western Australia have seized 135 firearms and revoked or suspended 44 gun licenses from individuals believed to hold sovereign citizen views, which reject government authority. The crackdown was prompted by the fatal shooting of two police officers in August by a suspect who had previously espoused such beliefs. Officials used a legal provision that requires gun permit holders to be a "fit and proper person," arguing that anyone who does not abide by the law cannot meet this standard. The raids highlight growing concerns over anti-government extremism in the country.</p>

In a statement, Gavin admitted to a "mistake" and said he was addressing the matter. The contest for the largely ceremonial role is now between independent lawmaker Catherine Connolly and former government minister Heather Humphreys, with a recent poll placing Connolly in the lead.</p>

Rescue officials stated that they have cleared about 80% of the debris, recovering bodies and body parts from the rubble.

In the aftermath, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood urged pro-Palestinian groups to postpone demonstrations, labeling them "un-British" in the context of the community's grief, which sparked a debate about the right to protest. The incident has brought underlying societal tensions to the forefront, including concerns over both antisemitism and Islamophobia.
