          <p>The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Indiana Pacers 103-91 in Game 7 of the 2025 NBA Finals, securing their first championship since 1979, when the team was known as the Seattle SuperSonics. League MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 29 points. Pacers star guard Tyrese Haliburton sustained a right lower leg injury in the second quarter, later revealed by his father to be a possible Achilles tendon injury. The Thunder's victory marks a significant milestone for the franchise after its relocation. Optimism is present as this is a celebration of the sport and an important victory for the team and their fans.</p>

          <p>Oil prices have risen sharply, exceeding 7% after the U.S. military joined the conflict between Iran and Israel, raising concerns about potential disruptions to oil supplies and heightened market volatility. Experts warn of possible triple-digit oil prices as investors monitor Iran's response to the U.S. strikes, including potential countermeasures like blocking the Strait of Hormuz, which is a critical artery for global oil trade. A prolonged closure of the Strait or damage to Gulf energy infrastructure could push crude prices above $100 per barrel. The situation introduces significant uncertainty into the oil market.

          <p>Senior officials from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) held conference calls with governors and law enforcement agencies to discuss the implications of U.S. missile strikes in Iran on the U.S. threat environment. While there is currently no specific intelligence of a direct, credible threat against the U.S. homeland, the FBI is enhancing its posture and monitoring intelligence. Officials urged vigilance for increased cyber activity and potential risks to Jewish institutions and groups associated with Israel. The calls aimed to ensure states are aware of the current threat landscape and to encourage collaboration with relevant agencies and infrastructure partners. There is an increased potential for threats to the homeland.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Nashville ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, facing human smuggling charges, can be released on bail, determining that the government failed to prove he was a flight risk. However, the judge acknowledged that Abrego Garcia would likely remain in custody due to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was previously deported to El Salvador despite a court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution. The defense argues that the charges are a distraction from the lack of due process in Abrego Garcia's case. This case highlights the complexities of immigration law.</p>

          <p>Senior Pentagon officials have revealed details about the U.S. operation, dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer," to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran, with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff calling it the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history." The mission involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers that flew from Missouri to Iran, with additional B-2s acting as decoys. The strikes, targeting Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, used precision-guided weapons, including GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth described the attack as an "incredible and overwhelming success," emphasizing that it did not target Iranian troops or civilians. The Pentagon warned Iran against retaliation. This operation marks a significant escalation in the region.</p>

          <p>Chinese companies operating in conflict-ridden African nations face growing geopolitical, political, and security risks that threaten their survival. For over two decades, these companies have demonstrated a high risk tolerance, investing in mineral-rich countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and nations in the Sahel despite instability. However, attacks on mining sites, kidnappings of Chinese workers, and hijackings of Chinese-owned vessels highlight the high price of these investments. President Xi Jinping has called for severe punishment for those responsible for attacks on Chinese nationals, reflecting the severity of the threats.

Trump deemed the bombing operation a "spectacular military success," claiming that Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been "completely and totally obliterated."

China's decisions on panda loans are typically revealed during high-level bilateral talks. Experts suggest a new loan may be announced during a possible visit by a Chinese leader to Japan later this year. Since 1972, pandas have symbolized friendship between the two countries, bringing economic benefits as tourist attractions. This gesture could signal improved relations.

Marrying user-centered practices with governance and policy would ensure a better understanding of the risks posed by AI tools. More testing is necessary.</p>

Garcia faces charges for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the U.S. Judge Holmes denied the government's motion to detain Garcia, stating the government failed to prove he is a flight risk or a danger to the community. Garcia was previously deported to El Salvador despite a court order barring his deportation. A hearing is scheduled to determine the conditions of release. This case has been ongoing for months.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships shares five phrases that parents should avoid using and suggests alternative phrases to encourage cooperation. Traditional parenting phrases can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, while language that honors a child's autonomy can lead to better cooperation. The expert emphasizes the importance of creating conditions where cooperation feels natural by fostering respect, emotional safety, and involvement. These phrase shifts represent a deeper shift in how we view parenting itself. There are many things that parents can do to help their children.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has found that children as young as 10 and 11 have been reported to police for suspected cyberstalking offenses, raising concerns about the normalization of constant online monitoring. Charities say that sharing locations, checking online activity, and constant messaging are often seen as signs of love and care, but can set precedents for unhealthy relationships. Experts stress the importance of educating young people about healthy relationships in the digital age and ensuring location sharing is always a choice, not a condition of trust. There is a growing need for education.</p>

NHS England plans a staggered approach to reach those most in need, managing GPs' workload and NHS resources. Some GP practices warn patients who do not meet the criteria not to book appointments, and pharmacy trade organizations are concerned that demand will outstrip supply. Mounjaro makes people feel fuller, leading to weight loss, but requires monthly check-ups and is not suitable for everyone. Weight loss injections are becoming more and more available.</p>

The U.S. has reached out to Iran diplomatically, stating that regime change efforts are not planned. Homeland Security officials are monitoring for potential physical and cyber reprisals.

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz, a major commercial trade passage. The Strait, located between Oman and Iran, is a critical artery for global oil trade, facilitating the transit of millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products daily. Iran controls the northern side of the strait, making it a vital oil "chokepoint." Secretary of State Marco Rubio said an Iranian effort to block the strait "would be a suicidal move."
