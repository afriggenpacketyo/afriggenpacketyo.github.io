          <p>The U.S. Army will place large metal plates on Washington D.C. streets to protect them from damage during a parade featuring 25 M1 Abrams tanks, scheduled for June 14 to honor the Army's 250th birthday and coincide with President Trump's birthday. Concerns about the tanks' weight previously prevented their use in a parade during Trump's first term. The parade, estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million, will include thousands of troops in historical uniforms and modern battle dress, along with vehicles and helicopters following a route from the Pentagon to the National Mall. The event will conclude with a parachute jump, concert, and fireworks display.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government is opposing a provision in the House Republican tax bill that would impose a 5% excise tax on remittances sent by non-U.S. citizens to their home countries, arguing it would harm the economy of both nations and disproportionately affect low-income migrants who already pay taxes. Mexico's ambassador to the U.S. has urged House leaders to reconsider, warning of unintended consequences such as migrants seeking unregulated channels for money transfers, increasing risks of financial insecurity and tax evasion. Representatives from the electronic payment transfer industry have also voiced concerns, suggesting the tax would drive consumers to underground channels to avoid the added cost.</p>

          <p>Republican leaders in Louisiana are advocating for the removal of remaining federal desegregation orders in the state, arguing that they are outdated and no longer necessary due to the progress made since the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling. They believe the country needs to move on from these orders, which were implemented to supervise school districts resistant to integration. Civil rights advocates, however, view this effort as an attack on Black students and civil rights, fearing that the rollback of these orders would exacerbate segregation in U.S. schools. The Justice Department is open to considering requests for dismissal on a case-by-case basis.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are considering a non-prosecution agreement with Boeing, potentially abandoning a deal where the company would plead guilty to a felony charge related to the 737 Max crashes, according to lawyers for the victims' families. The Justice Department officials cited Boeing's refusal to plead guilty as the reason for considering this reversal. Under the potential agreement, Boeing would pay approximately $445 million to a crash victims' fund, invest in compliance and safety, and agree to oversight by an independent compliance consultant. The crashes, which occurred in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019, were blamed on changes Boeing made to flight control software on the 737 Max.</p>

          <p>US prosecutors are considering dropping a criminal charge against Boeing, linked to two crashes involving its bestselling aircraft, the 737 Max. Officials for the Department of Justice (DOJ) said they were considering allowing the company to sign a non-prosecution agreement to settle the case. The move would avoid a trial over the criminal fraud charge that is due to begin in June, after a judge rejected an earlier settlement in which Boeing had agreed to plead guilty. Lawyers representing families of the crash victims said they were "deeply disappointed" by the new plan.</p>

Four Republican members of the far-right Freedom Caucus joined with the Democratic minority to block it from proceeding, arguing the legislation does not make deep enough cuts to federal spending and to programs they dislike. The GOP is split over what to include and what to cut in the expensive legislation, which Congress’s non-partisan joint committee on taxation estimates will cost $3.7tn through 2034.</p>
