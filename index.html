          <p>Russia and Ukraine completed a significant prisoner swap, exchanging over 1,000 prisoners, marking a rare instance of cooperation amid ongoing conflict.

          <p>President Trump announced a pause on his threatened 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9, following a "very nice call" with EU chief Ursula von der Leyen. Von der Leyen stated that Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly to reach a good deal, requiring time until July 9. The EU trade chief, Maroš Šefčovič, responded that trade relations must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. The increase would dramatically raise Washington’s current tariff baseline levy of 10% to 50%, and fuel simmering tensions between two of the world’s economic heavyweights.</p>

The GHF, backed by the U.S., aimed to distribute 300 million meals in Gaza but faced non-cooperation from the UN and traditional aid agencies due to its alleged collaboration with Israel. Wood expressed pride in the pragmatic plan developed to feed hungry people while addressing security concerns, but emphasized his commitment to humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence. He urged Israel to expand aid provision into Gaza and called on all stakeholders to explore innovative delivery methods without delay, diversion, or discrimination.</p>

          <p>Ministers are facing calls to resume processing Syrian asylum applications, as over 7,000 people remain in limbo after the UK paused decisions following the fall of President Assad. Charities argue that the situation has left Syrians in an "indefinite limbo," and are calling for claims to be processed again on a case-by-case basis. The government said decisions were paused "while we assess the current situation" in Syria, which is now under the control of the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The number of Syrian asylum claims has fallen sharply since the pause, but many Syrians still feel unsafe to return.</p>

The Burgundy Wine Board has stated that the US accounted for about a quarter of Burgundy's wine exports last year. While the current 10% tariff is expected to be absorbed by producers and merchants, a potential increase to 20% could significantly disrupt the market.</p>
