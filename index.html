          <p>Claire's, the popular fashion accessories chain, is on the verge of collapse in the UK and Ireland, appointing administrators and jeopardizing 2,150 jobs across 278 UK and 28 Irish stores.

          <p>President Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and NATO leaders held virtual meetings to coordinate positions ahead of Friday's Trump-Putin summit in Alaska. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz convened the calls to ensure European and Ukrainian voices were heard, emphasizing that Ukraine must be involved in any peace talks. Zelenskyy stressed the need for a ceasefire and robust security guarantees, warning that Putin is "bluffing" and does not genuinely seek peace. The article notes Trump's intention for a "feel-out meeting" to assess Putin's intentions, despite previous suggestions Ukraine might cede territory.</p>

          <p>Following an almost nationwide power outage in Iraq, millions of private generators are serving as a critical but problematic power source amidst extreme summer temperatures. The national grid is outdated and insufficient, supplying only half the peak demand, leading to widespread reliance on these diesel-powered machines. While essential for daily life, these unregulated generators cause significant noise and air pollution, consume vast amounts of water, and contribute to environmental degradation. The article highlights the lucrative, yet unaddressed, "generator mafia" business and the high costs incurred by Iraqi households.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup survey reveals that U.S. adult alcohol consumption is at a record low, with only 54% reporting drinking, a figure not seen since 1958. For the first time, a majority of Americans (53%) now view even moderate drinking as harmful, a significant increase from previous years. This decline is attributed to growing public health warnings linking alcohol to various cancers and overall negative health outcomes. The article notes that the shift is particularly pronounced among younger adults, influencing both the frequency and amount of alcohol consumed.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that the Trump administration's efforts to defund Planned Parenthood by excluding it from Medicaid reimbursements could severely cripple the U.S. healthcare social safety net. Planned Parenthood served over 1.5 million Medicaid patients in 2024 for non-abortion services, including critical contraception and STI screenings. Experts warn that if the ban proceeds, access to these vital services, especially for low-income communities, will be significantly reduced, potentially leading to increased STIs and cancer rates.
