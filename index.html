          <p>South Korean chip heavyweights Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix experienced significant stock surges, reaching multi-decade highs, following their partnership announcement with OpenAI. This collaboration, integral to OpenAI's Stargate initiative, aims to boost the supply of advanced memory chips crucial for next-generation AI technologies and expand data center capabilities in South Korea. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman held meetings with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and top executives from both companies to solidify these agreements. This strategic alliance underscores the pivotal role these firms play in the global artificial intelligence value chain, particularly in high-bandwidth memory development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has achieved a record $500 billion net worth, cementing his position as the world's richest person, significantly ahead of global tech rivals. This milestone is largely fueled by the surging valuations of his diverse portfolio, including electric car manufacturer Tesla, rocket company SpaceX, and artificial intelligence startup xAI. Investors have responded positively to Musk's increased focus on his business ventures rather than political engagements, contributing to Tesla's substantial stock gains this year. The company's board has also outlined an ambitious, trillion-dollar pay package for Musk if he successfully meets a series of challenging growth targets over the coming decade.

          <p>An Idaho state judge has ruled against the public release of graphic crime scene photos taken after Bryan Kohberger murdered four University of Idaho students in 2022. The court determined that the potential for "extreme emotional distress" to the victims' families significantly outweighed the public's interest in how the investigation was conducted. While other investigative records, including videos of distraught friends, can be released, any portions of images showing victims' bodies or surrounding blood will be redacted. Kohberger was sentenced to life without parole after pleading guilty, and family members of two victims had specifically requested these highly invasive images remain hidden from public view.</p>

          <p>French asset manager Amundi, which manages €2.3 trillion in assets, has largely exited China's September equity rally, shifting its holdings towards dividend stocks. This strategic move is driven by lingering doubts about China's economic outlook and concerns over stock valuations. Philippe d’Orgeval, the firm’s deputy group chief investment officer, indicated trimming positions in "overvalued" Chinese stocks while increasing exposure to onshore shares over Hong Kong-listed equities. Amundi maintains an openness to re-entering the Chinese market if conditions improve, but currently views the macro environment as less supportive for equity markets, particularly given ongoing tariff uncertainties.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order vowing to use all lawful and appropriate measures, including diplomatic, economic, and potentially military action, to defend Qatar's security and territorial integrity. This pledge follows a recent Israeli attack on Doha targeting Hamas leaders, for which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later expressed deep regret during a Washington visit. The order highlights the "close cooperation" and "shared interest" between the US and Qatar, a nation critical to US military operations in the Middle East due to its vast Al Udeid airbase. The true legal weight of this executive order, however, remains subject to debate regarding treaty approval.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen approximately $26 billion in federal funds earmarked for projects in Democratic-leaning states, a move announced on the first day of the government shutdown. This includes about $18 billion for New York transit initiatives and nearly $8 billion for green energy projects across 16 states that did not vote for Trump. Vice President JD Vance warned that federal worker layoffs could commence if the shutdown prolongs, a stance Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer condemned as using Americans as "pawns." This action underscores the severe partisan conflict exacerbating the current funding lapse.</p>

          <p>Brendan Carr, the pro-Trump chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), has reportedly agreed to testify before the Senate commerce committee. This follows Disney's decision to temporarily suspend talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, an action seemingly influenced by Carr's public comments. Carr had appeared to pressure network affiliates to stop airing Kimmel's show over remarks made about the death of a far-right pundit, drawing criticism from figures like Senator Ted Cruz. Although Kimmel's show was reinstated and achieved high ratings, the incident has sparked significant debate regarding political pressure on broadcasters and the boundaries of free speech.</p>

Russell Vought, director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, stated these funds were being canceled because the projects did not "adequately advance the nation’s energy needs" or offer a positive return on taxpayer investment. Democratic lawmakers, such as Senator Adam Schiff, decried the action as political retaliation, warning it would lead to higher energy prices and job losses.

          <p>A boiler room explosion caused a significant partial collapse of a 20-story New York City Housing Authority building in the Bronx, leaving a large section of its side destroyed. Amazingly, no injuries were reported, despite extensive debris and damage across Alexander Avenue. Mayor Eric Adams confirmed initial reports pointing to a boiler room blast that sent shockwaves up the chimney, leading to the collapse. Residents from 38 apartments were evacuated, and inspections are ongoing, revealing two active violations for unsafe facades on the building dating back to 2020. Cleanup and structural integrity assessments are now underway.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders employed a unique, non-verbal response to reporters' questions after Dillon Gabriel was promoted to the team's starting quarterback position. When asked about remaining the third-string QB, Sanders smiled broadly and offered only pantomimed answers, effectively "muting" himself. This unusual behavior may be a reaction to recent critical remarks from former NFL coach and analyst Rex Ryan, who took issue with Sanders' previous comments about his capabilities as a backup quarterback in the league. The incident offers a glimpse into player dynamics amidst team roster changes.</p>

          <p>Tennessee is set to execute Christa Gail Pike in September 2026, which would mark the first execution of a woman in the state in over two centuries. Pike, convicted of the brutal 1995 murder of 19-year-old Colleen Slemmer, was just 18 at the time of the crime. Her legal team argues that her young age and undiagnosed mental health struggles, including bipolar and PTSD, should merit a sentence of life without parole instead of death. Pike herself has expressed deep remorse, acknowledging the immense harm she caused. This rare event reignites national discussions on capital punishment, mental health, and the treatment of female death row inmates.</p>

Cramer highlighted significant Q3 surges from companies like AppLovin, Western Digital, Seagate, and Warner Bros.

          <p>This article provides practical guidance on choosing and using cooking oils, debunking several common myths surrounding their health implications and appropriate uses. Professor Nita Forouhi from the University of Cambridge asserts that rapeseed (vegetable) and sunflower oils are beneficial, particularly when replacing saturated fats, due to their high content of healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats. The article also clarifies that modern margarines are suitable for a healthy diet, unlike older versions containing harmful trans fats. For cooking methods, it advises against deep-frying with extra virgin olive oil due to its low smoke point, recommending it for dressings instead.</p>

The article suggests these settlements signify "corporate cowardice" and a strategic shift by tech platforms away from robust moderation. This trend effectively concedes that these companies should not be held liable for content, driven by political pressure and a desire to shed editorial responsibility.</p>
