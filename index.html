          <p>At WWE's SummerSlam event, Tiffany Stratton successfully defended her WWE Women's Championship against Jade Cargill, extending her title reign beyond 200 days. The match, which was the first SummerSlam appearance for both competitors, featured a high-energy, back-and-forth contest with numerous aerial assaults and powerful moves. Despite Cargill hitting her finisher, Jaded, Stratton managed to get her foot on the ropes to break the pin. Stratton ultimately secured the victory by countering a top-rope maneuver and hitting her own finisher for the pinfall.</p>

          <p>Singer Justin Timberlake has revealed his diagnosis with Lyme disease, an illness he described as potentially "implacably debilitating, both mentally and physically." In an Instagram post, he shared that he considered ending his recent Forget Tomorrow tour but decided to continue, stating the joy of performing outweighed the physical stress. Lyme disease, transmitted by deer ticks, can cause flu-like symptoms, joint pain, and neurological issues but is typically treatable with antibiotics. Timberlake expressed gratitude to his family for their support and remains uncertain about his future on stage.</p>

          <p>Shayna Glassman, whose father was terrorized by his neighbor David Berkowitz, the "Son of Sam" serial killer, has been visiting him in prison. Her father, Craig Glassman, was a volunteer deputy sheriff whom Berkowitz targeted with threatening letters and a fire outside his door in 1977. Despite her family's disapproval, Shayna initiated contact with Berkowitz, who has been incarcerated for nearly 50 years, as a way to connect with her late father and understand the story he left behind. She describes their relationship as complex but not romantic, finding Berkowitz to be a changed person.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article reflects on why the Nanking massacre remains a deeply resonant and powerful symbol in China, shaping both national identity and foreign policy. The author notes that recent films about the wartime event are introducing a new generation to the historical trauma, which is described as a "moral wound" for the Chinese people. The piece emphasizes that the memory is more than just a tragic historical chapter. It argues that the event's legacy persists, particularly due to a perception that the Japanese government has never properly acknowledged or atoned for the atrocities.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the 25-year-old wife of a Marine Corps veteran, has been released from ICE custody after being detained for two months in Louisiana. Clouatre, who was breastfeeding her newborn at the time of her arrest, was taken into custody during what she believed was a routine green card interview. Her detention stemmed from a 2018 deportation order she was unaware of, issued after her mother, who had abandoned her as a teen, missed an immigration hearing. Now released on bond with an ankle monitor, her case highlights the current administration's stricter immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a former judge and prominent Fox News personality, to the position of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia in a 50-45 vote. Pirro, a staunch supporter of President Trump, had already been serving in an acting capacity since May. This powerful role oversees the prosecution of both federal and local crimes in the nation's capital. Her nomination proceeded with relatively little pushback from Democrats compared to the president's previous nominee, who had lost support due to controversial statements about the January 6th Capitol attack.</p>

This federal law restricts the political activities of federal employees. The investigation follows a request from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's actions, particularly the timing of his investigations before the 2024 election, were politically motivated to harm Trump's campaign. Smith, who resigned in January, had previously maintained that his work was not driven by politics.</p>

The ruling stems from a lawsuit over Trump administration sweeps in Southern California that sparked widespread fear and protests.

          <p>A group led by Boston Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca is reportedly finalizing a deal to buy the WNBA's Connecticut Sun for a record $325 million and relocate the team to Boston. The move, which is pending league approval, would not happen until the 2027 season and includes a commitment of $100 million for a new practice facility in Boston. The Sun, currently owned by the Mohegan Tribe, has been one of the league's most successful teams on the court but lacks a dedicated modern training facility. The sale price far exceeds previous WNBA expansion fees and team sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Mystery Solved: Winston Churchill's Gift Platypus Likely Died from Heat, Not a U-Boat Attack</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long-standing mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II died has been solved. For decades, it was rumored the animal, named Winston, died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, recent archival research by students at the University of Sydney has revealed a more likely cause. By analyzing the platypus attendant's logbook, researchers found that water and air temperatures on the ship rose well above the safe threshold for the species as it crossed the equator. The evidence strongly suggests the platypus essentially overheated, rather than dying from the stress of war.</p>

          <p>In a discussion based on a recent Foreign Affairs article, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute explores the role conservatives can play in challenging and shaping U.S. foreign policy in the current political landscape. The conversation touches upon the theme of a "Dispensable Nation" and what America's place in the world might look like in a post-American or altered international order. The piece examines how conservative thinkers and policymakers might navigate and influence foreign policy debates, particularly in relation to the approaches established during the Trump administration. This provides a perspective on the internal debates within the conservative movement regarding international engagement.</p>

          <p>Carol Mason's new book, "From the Clinics to the Capitol: How Opposing Abortion Became Insurrectionary," is discussed in an interview with NPR. The book traces the connections between the anti-abortion movement and the rise of far-right, insurrectionary politics in the United States. Mason argues that the tactics and ideologies developed over decades of clinic protests and political organizing have contributed to broader extremist movements. The conversation explores how the opposition to abortion has evolved and intersected with other political grievances, culminating in events like the January 6th Capitol attack, according to the author's thesis.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offense targeting individuals who use the internet to advertise or promote illegal small boat crossings across the English Channel. The proposed law, part of the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, could result in up to five years in prison for those creating online material that facilitates breaches of UK immigration law. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the measure is aimed at disrupting the business model of "immoral" criminal gangs who use social media to sell false promises of a safe journey. The National Crime Agency has already removed over 8,000 such posts in 2024.</p>

          <p>The Orlando Sun Resort, a once-luxurious hotel near Disney World, now lies abandoned and in a state of extreme decay, as documented by an urban explorer. Closed since 2012, the 600-room property has become a "lawless ghost town," covered in graffiti, filled with garbage, and housing homeless individuals. The explorer's video showcases caved-in roofs, a murky green swimming pool, and widespread vandalism. Once a premier destination in the 1970s, the resort's decline began with increased competition from on-site Disney hotels and was exacerbated by financial troubles, ultimately leading to its complete abandonment.</p>

          <p>A global TikTok trend for Labubu dolls has created a lucrative market for criminals producing dangerous counterfeit versions, according to a BBC News investigation. Trading Standards officers recently seized thousands of fake dolls from a London location, finding that they easily fall apart and present a serious choking hazard for children. The immense popularity of the dolls, which helped parent company Pop Mart's revenue double, has led to authentic products selling out in seconds, driving consumers toward cheaper but unsafe fakes. Authorities warn these counterfeits can be made with toxic materials and are part of a massive criminal enterprise.</p>
