            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador, while clarifying the scope of the lower court's order. While upholding the order to 'facilitate' his return, the court instructed the lower court to clarify the term 'effectuate,' considering the executive branch's authority in foreign affairs. Garcia's lawyer expressed optimism, expecting his immediate release, while the Justice Department emphasized the President's foreign policy prerogatives.

            <p>Will Poulter and Kit Connor shared their experiences of bonding with the cast of Alex Garland's film 'Warfare' through head-shaving and tattoos. The cast underwent a three-week military bootcamp to prepare for their roles as US soldiers in Iraq, fostering trust and familiarity. They decided to get matching tattoos that say "Call On Me" as a commemoration of their brotherhood and the film's theme. The film is based on a real-life mission and aims to recreate the experiences of soldiers in combat.</p>

            <p>Schools in Dahieh, a southern suburb of Beirut, are fearing a return to war following recent Israeli strikes in the area. The strikes, targeting Hezbollah facilities, have caused panic and chaos, leading to evacuation drills and increased security measures in schools. Despite a ceasefire, the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has left students, staff, and parents traumatized, with reminders of destruction serving as constant reminders of the potential for renewed violence.</p>

            <p>A general strike in Argentina, protesting public spending cuts, has severely disrupted transport services. Domestic flights have been cancelled, and train and metro services are suspended in Buenos Aires and other areas. The strike, the third since President Javier Milei took office, reflects opposition to austerity measures aimed at tackling hyperinflation. Unions argue that vulnerable populations, including pensioners and low-paid workers, are disproportionately affected by the cuts.</p>
