          <h2>Afghanistan Faces Total Internet Blackout as Taliban Implements Morality Measures</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Taliban government has imposed a nationwide internet blackout in Afghanistan, severing fiber-optic cables to enforce morality measures. This action has led to a "total internet blackout," disrupting telecommunications, international news agency contact, mobile internet, and even flights from Kabul airport. The move, which follows weeks of connectivity issues, has drawn criticism from business leaders and former media figures, who warn of severe impacts and compare Afghanistan's internet isolation to North Korea. The shutdown is indefinite and part of broader restrictions under Sharia law.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily suspended the Trump administration's plan to eliminate 532 jobs at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America (VOA). The judge cited "concerning disrespect" for previous orders to restore VOA programming and blocked the agency from implementing the job cuts, which represent the majority of its staff. This ruling preserves the status quo pending a decision on blocking the reduction in force. The administration argues it's exercising lawful authority, while critics contend it's an abuse of power.</p>

          <p>A BBC undercover investigation revealed nurses, pharmacists, and a bogus doctor engaging in dangerous and illegal Botox practices, putting patients at risk. Researchers filmed a nurse trading prescriptions via WhatsApp, a pharmacist advising clients to falsify records, and an unqualified individual selling unlicensed Korean toxin. These actions bypass crucial in-person consultations and prescriptions, increasing risks like drooping eyelids, headaches, or even respiratory failure. Regulators have expressed concern and pledged to review the evidence, as the booming aesthetics market sees a rise in reported complications and even deaths.</p>

          <p>A source has confirmed the separation of A-list couple Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban after nearly 20 years of marriage. The Oscar-winning actress and Grammy-winning country singer, who share two daughters, have reportedly been living apart since the summer, with Kidman not wanting the split. Married in 2006, they have navigated career highs and personal lows, including Urban's addiction struggles, which they previously stated strengthened their bond. The specific reasons for their separation remain undisclosed, despite recent public appearances suggesting otherwise.</p>

          <p>YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump after his account was banned following the January 6th Capitol riot. The settlement, which does not admit liability, allocates $22 million to a trust for Washington D.C.'s National Mall and a White House ballroom, with the remainder going to other parties. This marks the third tech firm, after Meta and X, to settle with Trump over perceived online muzzling. Trump's YouTube account was reinstated in 2023.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu have unveiled a new 20-point peace plan for Gaza, calling on Hamas to accept its terms. The proposal includes an immediate cessation of military operations, the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for detained Gazans, and Hamas having no future role in Gaza's governance. While leaving the door open for a Palestinian state, the plan outlines a temporary technocratic committee overseen by an international "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump. Trump warned of full US backing for Israel to "finish the job" if Hamas rejects the deal.</p>

          <p>The NFL's announcement of Bad Bunny as the Super Bowl LX halftime show headliner has ignited a "culture war" debate among conservative commentators. Critics express outrage over the choice of a predominantly Spanish-language artist who has endorsed Kamala Harris and decried immigration sweeps. This article highlights the predictable backlash, with some accusing the NFL of political motivations rather than selecting a globally popular artist. It also notes previous controversies surrounding politically charged halftime performances and the lack of popular MAGA-promoting artists suitable for such a platform.</p>

          <p>Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the deployment of 200 Oregon National Guard members to Portland to protect federal property. State Attorney General Dan Rayfield argues that President Trump lacks the authority to federalize the Guard and that local officials can manage public safety without federal interference. The White House defends the deployment as a lawful effort to protect federal assets amid "violent riots." Governor Tina Kotek called the move an abuse of power, making residents less safe, and is in talks with other governors facing similar federal intervention.</p>

          <p>This article offers a critical "reality check" on President Trump's new 20-point Gaza peace plan, tempering his optimistic pronouncements of "eternal peace." While acknowledging significant developments, such as Netanyahu's backing, the analysis highlights fundamental disagreements that persist, including Hamas's reluctance to disarm and Israel's conditions for withdrawal. The plan's vague language on troop withdrawal and amnesty for Hamas members raises further questions. Experts suggest that both Israel and Hamas might agree in principle but then delay with negotiations, making a swift end to the conflict unlikely without sustained pressure or dramatic political shifts.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes a government shutdown will not significantly impact the stock market, advising investors to "keep calm and carry on." He notes that past shutdowns haven't shown a clear negative trend for stocks, distinguishing it from a debt ceiling default. Cramer's primary concern is the potential delay in releasing vital economic data, which could complicate the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. However, he acknowledges the severe impact on furloughed federal workers and the broader economy if the shutdown is prolonged. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan also prioritizes advancing exploration of critical metals like copper and lithium, developing ultra-pure materials, and enhancing recycling efforts.

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is reportedly considering fielding stealthy flying-wing aircraft, potentially B-21 Raider variants or new platforms, to serve as "arsenal planes" loaded with "dozens" of air-to-air missiles. This concept aims to supplement or replace Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones in high-intensity conflicts, particularly with China in the Indo-Pacific. These arsenal planes would provide extensive "magazine depth" for crewed fighters, launching long-range missiles at targets designated by other aircraft. The study is in early stages, exploring various design and production options to enhance air superiority.</p>
