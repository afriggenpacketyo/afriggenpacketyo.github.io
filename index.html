            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported that Russian forces continued attempts to advance and inflict casualties despite Vladimir Putin's declaration of an Easter ceasefire. Zelenskyy cited numerous instances of shelling and assaults by Russian units, challenging the credibility of the announced truce. Kyiv maintains its offer to extend the ceasefire for an additional 30 days, contingent on the actual situation on the ground, highlighting the ongoing skepticism and cautious approach amidst the conflict. This underscores the fragile nature of agreements and the persistent tensions in the region. Optimism score: 25</p>

            <p>Malaysian durian growers are experiencing a significant increase in sales to China, driven by Chinese consumers' growing preference for fresh, naturally ripened fruit.

            <p>The Los Angeles Lakers suffered a significant loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves in Game 1 of the 2025 playoffs, with the Timberwolves winning 117-95. Despite a strong start from Luka Doncic, the Lakers struggled to maintain momentum, failing to match Minnesota's energy and physicality. Key concerns for the Lakers include fast break points allowed, second-chance points conceded, and the performance of Minnesota's supporting players. The Lakers aim to improve their physicality and control the controllable aspects of the game in future matchups. Optimism score: 45</p>
