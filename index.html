        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a roughly 2% increase amidst volatile trading following the announcement of a 250 billion yen share buyback and an operating income that surpassed estimates. The company's operating income for the last three months of the financial year reached 203.6 billion yen, exceeding analyst expectations. Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of the shares to Sony Group shareholders through dividends. Despite this positive news, Sony's outlook for the current financial year ending in March was somewhat lackluster, with a slight 0.3% increase in operating profit forecasted due to potential impacts from trade relations.</p>

          <p>President Zelenskyy has challenged President Putin to meet in Istanbul for peace negotiations, escalating the brinkmanship between Russia and Ukraine. This move comes after Putin demanded peace talk negotiations in Istanbul, prompting Zelenskyy's challenge for a face-to-face meeting, while both leaders are also seemingly trying to involve Donald Trump in the negotiation process. The article suggests that the talks are unlikely to yield significant progress, as Russia's demands remain unacceptable to Ukraine, including Ukraine dropping its aspirations to join NATO. The article also highlights the shared desire of both Russia and Ukraine to enlist Donald Trump's support in resolving the conflict.</p>

          <p>The United States, under President Trump, has fast-tracked the arrival of white South Africans as refugees, citing racist policies and a "genocide" that's supposedly taking place. However, this move is based on false narratives, as there is no persecution of white Afrikaners in South Africa, according to South African officials and experts. The claim of land theft is also unsubstantiated, with white South Africans owning a significant portion of private farmland. Critics argue that Trump is positioning himself as a savior of white privilege and Christianity globally, straining relations between Pretoria and Washington, especially after South Africa's lawsuit against Israel for genocide against Palestinians.</p>

          <p>Family offices are experiencing rapid growth as the ultra-rich seek personalized wealth management services, but they face challenges in finding qualified money managers. A major issue is trust, with families often prioritizing lifelong relationships over expertise when hiring. This selectivity, combined with competition from banks and private equity firms, leads to a talent crunch. Additionally, younger employees are reluctant to work at family offices due to a lack of clear corporate structure and the perception of it being a "retirement job," and this is compounded by the fact that investment-related roles in family offices tend to be harder to fill compared to other roles.</p>

          <p>British businesses are warning that the UK government's plans to tighten immigration rules on foreign workers will lead to labor shortages in key sectors. The government's proposals include raising English-language requirements and skill levels for migrants, aiming to prioritize British workers over cheaper overseas labor. However, businesses fear that Brits cannot or will not fill the gap, especially in sectors like health and social care, which heavily rely on migrant staff. Care England warns that ending overseas recruitment for social care visas could have serious consequences for a sector already under immense pressure with 131,000 vacancies.</p>

          <p>Iranian officials have proposed a joint nuclear-enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington's demand that Iran dismantle its nuclear program, according to The New York Times article. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi suggested the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The proposal entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with oversight from international representatives. This plan would be permanent, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and could address American concerns about Iran's nuclear program.</p>

Trump clarified that the jet is a gift to the Department of Defense for defending Qatar and will be retired to the presidential library once Boeing delivers the new AF1 fleet.

          <p>Several UK newspapers lead with the release of Peter Sullivan, who spent 38 years in jail for a murder he did not commit, while others highlight research on new weight-loss drugs and their potential to reduce deaths from heart attacks and strokes. The Daily Telegraph reports that counter-terrorism police are investigating a blaze at the prime minister's London home and considering the possibility of a hostile state being involved. The Guardian focuses on Ukrainian President Zelensky's comments that Putin is the obstacle to a peace deal and that he will travel to Istanbul for peace talks, regardless of Putin's attendance.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has stated that Canadians were not impressed by the UK government's decision to offer Donald Trump an unprecedented second state visit, as it cut across clear messages that the Canadian government was trying to send to the White House regarding Canadian sovereignty. Carney invited King Charles, who is Canada's head of state, to open its parliament later this month as a "clear message of sovereignty". The former Bank of England governor stated that Mr Trump had changed his intentions to annex Canada from an "expectation to a desire".</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has said he will lift sanctions on Syria, ahead of an expected meeting with its leader Ahmed al-Sharaa. Trump has agreed to "say hello" to Syria's interim president on Wednesday in Saudi Arabia as part of his tour of the Middle East, the White House said. The announcement of the lifting of sanctions was met with elation in the Syrian capital of Damascus, where cheering, dancing and celebratory gunfire were heard. The sanctions had previously blocked any foreign financing, including aid, from reaching Syria and were originally intended to put pressure on the dictatorship of now-ousted President Bashar al-Assad.</p>

          <p>China has reasserted its territorial claims near its contested border with India by publishing “standard” names for dozens of places in the region, most of them in Indian-controlled territory. The renaming of 27 places covered a diverse array of geographical features: 15 mountains, five residential areas, four mountain passes, two rivers and one lake. Each location was assigned names in Chinese characters, Tibetan, and pinyin and accompanied by detailed latitude and longitude coordinates, and a high-resolution map. The move comes despite efforts in the past year to improve relations between the two countries after a long period of tension.</p>

          <p>Even as the United States and China take steps to rein in their trade war, Beijing is preparing for broader rivalry with Washington to continue, according to The New York Times article. For China, that means its search for economic and diplomatic opportunities across Asia is unlikely to soften its tough line on its regional territorial claims and military competition. A Chinese government policy-setting document warned that “external forces” posed increasing “threats to China’s frontier regions, border areas, and security in its surrounding areas.” China's emerging approach to the Trump era also includes flexing its power: basically, telling other governments, especially in Asia, not to expect Beijing to hold back its regional claims and ambitions.</p>

China is Pakistan’s biggest weapons supplier, accounting for 81 per cent of its arms imports from 2020 to 2024. Key Chinese weapons being used by Pakistan’s military include the Chengdu J-10C Vigorous Dragon fighter jet and HQ-9B long-range surface-to-air missile system. The 4.5-generation fighter aircraft is considered the most upgraded version of the J-10 series, equipped with a more advanced engine and active electronically scanned array, or AESA, radar.</p>

He also addressed speculation about Biden's cognitive decline, stating that he received everything he needed from him while working in the West Wing.

The New York Times article details how countries like France, Spain, Denmark, and Britain are offering financial incentives, academic freedom, and social security benefits to lure talent. European Union has also announced it would spend an additional 500 million euros to “make Europe a magnet for researchers.” The article highlights that while salaries may be lower in Europe, the generous social safety net can compensate for the difference.</p>
