          <p>Following ICE raids in Los Angeles that resulted in numerous arrests of illegal immigrants, including those with criminal histories, violence broke out in Downtown LA. Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom for allegedly encouraging the riots and not taking appropriate action. The Department of Homeland Security released information about 19 suspects arrested by ICE Los Angeles on June 7, accused of crimes ranging from robbery to second-degree murder to sexual assault.

          <p>China's recent export restrictions on rare earth minerals are impacting the automotive and robotics industries, and analysts warn that Western defense giants will also feel the effects. The restrictions, imposed by China's Ministry of Commerce in early April, require firms to apply for licenses for the export of rare earths and magnets, which are essential for modern defense technologies. William Bain of the British Chambers of Commerce noted that critical minerals like samarium, used in magnets, are essential for F-35 fighter jet construction in the U.S., and limited access could affect both U.S. construction and national security. Gracelin Baskaran of CSIS suggests that the U.S., EU, and Australia must coordinate supply- and demand-side interventions to boost rare earths production.</p>

          <p>Japan plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from government stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers to address elevated rice prices, according to Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi. The release will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, prompting concerns about emergency preparedness, and Koizumi has expressed interest in increasing rice imports to ensure a stable domestic supply. The government aims to distribute the rice to smaller supermarket chains and specialty shops to lower prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>China's relations with Niger have faced strains despite Beijing's efforts to strengthen ties with the country's military government following the 2023 coup. The junta expelled three Chinese oil executives over salary disparities between expatriate and local workers and revoked the license of a Chinese-owned hotel, citing discriminatory practices. Niger also ordered China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) to terminate contracts of expatriate employees with over four years' service. Observers note that this dispute highlights the limitations of Beijing's non-interference policy, which, while intended to avoid entanglement in domestic affairs, has resulted in economic costs as nationalism rises in some nations.</p>

The report acknowledges that Japan's efforts remain insufficient, noting its ranking of 118th out of 146 economies in the 2024 Global Gender Gap Index. The government aims to step up efforts to advance gender equality by ensuring more opportunities for women in decision-making roles. The government adopted its latest basic policy on gender equality and women's empowerment, focusing on local economies and small businesses, amid a trend of female brain drain in rural areas.</p>

The number of available jobs decreased by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, the highest in almost four years. This weakening in the labor market is attributed to factors like increased employer National Insurance contributions and a rise in the minimum wage in April.

          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have increased significantly in the first five months of the year, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. Shipments to Vietnam rose by 18.8%, while exports to Thailand and Indonesia grew by 20.9% and 16.8%, respectively. This expansion is partly attributed to Chinese manufacturers shipping more goods to factories in Southeast Asia to offset losses from high US tariffs. These factories then produce finished goods for sale locally or in Western countries, including the U.S.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the deployment of the National Guard and the Marines to Los Angeles. Newsom argues that the deployment violates federal law and state sovereignty. He described the situation as a red line being crossed and called for action from the courts and Congress. Trump has stated that the city would have been 'completely obliterated' without the deployment of the Guard, though their interactions with protesters have been minimal, with local law enforcement managing crowd control.</p>

          <p>Smugglers are exploiting a loophole in Europe's drug classification system to traffic ketamine, with criminal gangs earning more from it than other illegal drugs like cocaine. In some countries, ketamine is regulated as a medicine, leading to less scrutiny during import and transit. Criminal organizations are misusing long routes, shipping the drug from India through Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, before diverting it into illicit markets. Authorities are calling for greater international cooperation to tackle the problem, as ketamine use continues to rise, leading to cognitive problems and bladder damage.</p>
