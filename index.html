          <p>European stocks opened with mixed results as investors closely monitor the legal battle over President Trump's trade tariffs in the United States. The market's cautious sentiment follows a federal appeals court decision that found most of the tariffs illegal, a ruling the administration is now appealing to the Supreme Court. This uncertainty is creating a tense atmosphere for global trade, with traders awaiting further clarity on the future of the tariffs and upcoming U.S. labor market data, which will influence near-term economic outlooks.

          <p>Beijing has imposed new anti-dumping tariffs on several American fiber-optic companies, a move announced shortly after the United States sanctioned a Chinese chemical producer. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated the duties, ranging from 33.3% to 78.2%, are a response to US exporters altering trade practices to circumvent existing tariffs. This action represents a direct escalation in the ongoing trade friction between the two economic powers, signaling China's willingness to respond in kind to US sanctions and trade restrictions.

          <p>The Nasdaq stock exchange is proposing a new rule that would require companies primarily operating in China to raise at least $25 million from their public offerings to list in the U.S. This change aims to address concerns over the high volume of small Chinese IPOs that have been associated with "pump and dump" schemes and compliance issues. The move is seen as a way to instill greater investor confidence and protect against manipulative trading activities, though it will make it significantly more difficult for smaller Chinese firms to access U.S. capital markets.

          <p>A federal appeals court has reversed a lower court's decision, upholding an Illinois law that prohibits carrying firearms on public transit systems like buses and trains. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the decade-old restriction is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of regulating firearms in sensitive and crowded places. The court argued that the Second Amendment does not prevent lawmakers from ensuring public transportation remains free from accessible weapons. The decision is a significant ruling on gun control measures following the Supreme Court's 2022 Bruen decision and is expected to be appealed.</p>

          <p>During a meeting in Beijing, Chinese President Xi Jinping encouraged Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico to help promote positive relations between China and the European Union. Xi praised Slovakia for its friendship with China, particularly noting its opposition to recent EU tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles. The discussion highlights China's strategy of engaging with individual EU member states like Slovakia and Hungary to advocate for its interests within the bloc. Fico's visit underscores his government's populist-led effort to attract Chinese industrial investment and strengthen bilateral ties with Beijing.</p>

          <p>UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner could face a significant fine from tax authorities in addition to the £40,000 she has admitted to underpaying in stamp duty on a property purchase. Tax experts indicate that HM Revenue and Customs may levy a penalty if her actions are deemed "careless," which could depend on whether she sought appropriate specialist tax advice regarding a complex family trust. The controversy centers on whether her reliance on legal advice constitutes a reasonable excuse, with potential penalties reaching up to 30% of the underpaid tax, placing her political career under intense scrutiny.</p>

          <p>France is facing intense scrutiny over its political and fiscal stability, with economists now asking if it is becoming "the new Italy." The country's high budget deficit, which at 5.8% of GDP is significantly worse than Italy's, and a growing debt pile are causing concern in financial markets. This economic pressure is compounded by political turmoil, as Prime Minister Francois Bayrou faces a critical confidence vote over a contentious 2026 budget. A government collapse would mark the fifth prime minister in less than two years, contrasting sharply with the relative stability Italy has experienced under its current leadership.

          <p>During Kim Jong Un's recent meeting with Vladimir Putin in Beijing, North Korean staff were observed meticulously cleaning and removing any items the leader touched, including his chair and drinking glass. Analysts explain this is part of a long-standing and comprehensive security protocol designed to prevent foreign intelligence agencies from obtaining biological samples that could reveal information about his health. These extraordinary measures, which reportedly include traveling with a personal toilet, aim to conceal any potential vulnerabilities by ensuring no DNA, waste, or other personal traces are left behind during foreign trips.</p>

          <h2>Survey Reveals Nuanced Chinese Public Opinion on Global Rivalry and Alliances</h2>

          <p>A survey conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre suggests that Chinese public opinion on global affairs is more nuanced than often portrayed in the West. While respondents expressed strong national pride and optimism, a plurality of 48% indicated that China is interested in a shared global leadership role rather than outright dominance over the United States. This suggests an acceptance of peaceful coexistence. The findings depict a public that is also skeptical of the U.S. but flexible in its worldview, providing potential avenues for reducing international tensions.</p>

          <p>Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that the infamous Angola prison in Louisiana was intentionally selected to house immigration detainees as a deterrent. Speaking at the newly designated "Louisiana Lockup," Noem stated the facility's notorious reputation was a factor in its selection and is meant to send a message to what she described as the "worst of the worst" detainees. The move is part of the Trump administration's broader strategy to reinforce a tough-on-crime immigration policy and create a sense of fear to encourage self-deportation.</p>

          <p>China's massive military parade commemorating the end of World War II served as a powerful display of its growing global influence, sending a clear message to the United States and the world. This article analyzes the spectacle as a symbol of a new center of power emerging as an alternative to the American-led order. The event, closely watched by President Trump, is viewed in the context of his "America First" trade policies, which have scrambled global alliances. These policies may be inadvertently pushing nations like Russia and India closer to China, creating new geopolitical challenges for the U.S.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has overturned the Trump administration's decision to cut approximately $2 billion in research funding to Harvard University, ruling that the move violated the institution's First Amendment rights. The administration had frozen the grants in April, citing accusations of antisemitism and "radical left" ideologies at the university. Judge Allison Burroughs stated that the government used these claims as a "smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault" on premier universities. The White House has vowed to appeal the ruling, calling it an "egregious decision" by an activist judge.</p>
