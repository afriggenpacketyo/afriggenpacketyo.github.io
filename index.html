          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 09:47:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>USA Volleyball has revised its gender eligibility policy, effective immediately, to comply with a presidential executive order. The new rule mandates that athletes must compete based on the gender assigned on their original birth certificate, effectively banning transgender women from girls' and women's events. This change aligns with new guidance from the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, which requires all national governing bodies to adhere to the federal directive. The previous policy had allowed for transgender athletes to compete under specific conditions, including monitored testosterone levels, which have now been eliminated.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Depression in older adults often goes unrecognized or is misattributed to the normal aging process by both patients and doctors. While symptoms are similar across age groups, they can manifest more physically in the elderly, leading to delayed diagnoses and more chronic conditions. Social stigma and the complexity of treating patients with multiple physical ailments and medications also pose significant barriers to effective mental healthcare. Experts stress that despite a generational increase in mental health awareness, professional diagnosis remains crucial to avoid the pitfalls of misinformation and self-diagnosis for all age groups.</p>

          <p>President Trump has filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, over an article detailing an allegedly obscene birthday card sent to Jeffrey Epstein. This legal action is part of a broader pattern of the administration using the courts and regulatory bodies like the FCC to challenge media outlets perceived as critical. The lawsuit serves to rally his base by discrediting the story and acts as a warning to other news organizations, even those traditionally seen as allies. This escalation in his media war highlights an effort to control information and punish unfavorable coverage.</p>

          <p>LaQuayia Goldring, a 35-year-old woman who spent ten years on dialysis, has received a new kidney from a living donor just days after her story was featured on CBS News. Goldring, who had been an outspoken advocate for kidney disease awareness, had previously described the difficulties of relying on dialysis and the shortcomings of for-profit care clinics. Her successful transplant highlights the critical importance of living donations, which account for about one-third of all kidney transplants in the U.S. and generally offer better outcomes. She plans to continue her advocacy to encourage more people to become living donors.</p>

          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker recently shared that during her early career at age 18, she learned to live on a tight budget, making $40 last for three days between acting jobs. While her main drive was performance, she acknowledged the importance of financial security and being able to pay bills. A financial advisor comments that while such restrictive budgeting can be a short-term solution, freelancers and artists with volatile incomes should focus on building a system that absorbs financial instability. The advisor suggests a 'bucketing strategy,' allocating income by percentages to essentials, savings, and wants to create a more sustainable financial foundation.</p>

          <p>A National Transportation Safety Board report concluded that a 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene 'Buzzy' Peltola Jr., husband of then-Congresswoman Mary Peltola, was caused by the aircraft being overloaded and improperly balanced. The small plane was nearly 120 pounds over its maximum weight with moose meat from a hunting trip, and a set of antlers had been improperly strapped to a wing strut. This configuration degraded the plane's performance, leading to a loss of control shortly after takeoff from a remote area near St. Mary's, Alaska.

While national average yields for CDs are relatively low, top rates from online banks are substantially higher, with some one-year CDs offering over 4.40% APY. Due to an inverted yield curve, short-term CDs currently provide better returns than long-term ones, a phenomenon not seen in typical economic conditions. To maximize earnings, financial experts suggest comparing rates from online banks and considering a laddering strategy to take advantage of high short-term rates. (not investment advice)</p>

Key factors influencing its price include supply and demand dynamics, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and central bank policies.

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has reduced its 2025 financial guidance after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit, falling to 3.83 billion euros. The company attributed the decline to significant headwinds, including a 1.3 billion euro impact from U.S. import tariffs in the first half of the year and 700 million euros in restructuring costs. Consequently, VW now forecasts a lower operating return on sales and expects full-year sales to be flat compared to the previous year. The results underscore the severe challenges facing European automakers from trade disputes and competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>France's recent announcement to recognize Palestinian statehood makes it the first G7 nation to do so and the 148th country worldwide. This move is part of a broader trend, with most nations having recognized Palestine after the PLO's 1988 declaration of independence, particularly former communist and non-aligned countries. While the U.S., Canada, and many Western European allies officially support a two-state solution, they have historically maintained that recognition should only come as part of a final peace agreement. However, with the ongoing conflict, other European nations like Spain, Ireland, and Norway have already moved forward with recognition, signaling a potential shift in Western policy.</p>

This positions the company to capture a significant share of what its CEO projects could be a multitrillion-dollar market. The author suggests that Nvidia's current stock valuation does not fully account for this long-term growth potential, making it an attractive buy for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn the nomination of his former lawyer, Alina Habba, to be the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, a move that enables her to serve in an acting capacity. The decision follows a dispute where a federal court, citing an expiring 120-day interim term, moved to replace Habba with her deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace. Attorney General Pam Bondi swiftly criticized the judges' action and removed Grace as first assistant, creating a leadership scramble. By pulling the formal nomination, the administration bypasses a legal provision that would have prevented Habba from serving as the acting U.S. attorney.</p>

          <p>An intense heat dome that has been affecting the central U.S. is now moving eastward, bringing extreme temperatures to the East Coast ahead of the weekend. Over 100 million people are under heat alerts, with forecasters predicting temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above average and feels-like temperatures exceeding 100 degrees in many areas. In the Midwest's Corn Belt, the heat has been exacerbated by high humidity from 'corn sweat,' a process where corn crops release large amounts of water vapor. This phenomenon can add up to 10 degrees to the heat index, intensifying the dangerous conditions.</p>

          <p>Despite declining poll numbers on key issues like immigration and the budget, and internal rifts over the Epstein files, an analyst argues that President Trump's hold on power is not solely dependent on public approval. The opinion piece suggests that while tyrants crave adoration, they ultimately rely on other means to maintain control, such as intimidating voters, suppressing protest, and attacking the press. The article points to the administration's escalating deportation campaign and pressure on election officials as evidence of these tactics.

          <p>The Trump administration's new Arctic strategy, which allocates nearly $9 billion for icebreakers, is intensifying the geopolitical debate over polar shipping routes. As climate change makes the Northern Sea Route more navigable, Washington aims to reassert American control over the region. Chinese scholars view this as a strategic challenge, arguing that China, as a 'Near-Arctic State,' must seize the opportunity to use these more efficient shipping lanes to counter U.S. geopolitical containment. The move highlights the growing competition between the two powers for influence and access in the rapidly changing Arctic environment.</p>
