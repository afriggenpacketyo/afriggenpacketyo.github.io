          <p>A retired University of Alberta professor, Jutta Hinrichs, was killed in a rockfall in Banff National Park, along the Bow Glacier Falls hiking trail. The incident, described as an extremely rare event by Parks Canada, also left three others injured. Witnesses described a large rock slab detaching from the mountainside, creating a cloud of dust as they fled the scene. The trail has been closed indefinitely, and officials have expressed their condolences to the families of those affected, with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney also offering his sympathies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has declined to order Trump administration officials to recover deleted Signal messages, despite a lawsuit by American Oversight alleging violations of federal records law. The lawsuit stemmed from officials discussing military operations on the encrypted messaging service, Signal, which allows for automatic message deletion. While the judge ordered officials to preserve any messages not yet deleted, he stated that American Oversight failed to demonstrate the feasibility of recovering past messages. The case has raised concerns about classified information being shared on the platform, with some officials denying any wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>Romance fiction, particularly the romantasy subgenre, is experiencing a surge in sales and popularity, driven by the BookTok community on TikTok. This has led to changing attitudes towards the genre, which is often dismissed as "smut" by critics. Readers and industry experts highlight the strong world-building, character development, and plots found in many romance novels, which offer a comforting and entertaining escape. The growth in sales reflects a broader consumer trend among millennial women, who are driving the demand for both romance and fantasy books.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the Trump administration believes the National Guard deployment to Los Angeles is still "necessary" despite waning protests. He accused California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of inciting violence during protests sparked by ICE raids. Newsom's office criticized Vance's visit, highlighting a moment where he mistakenly referred to Senator Alex Padilla as "Jose Padilla". Federal immigration officers have increased enforcement efforts, aiming for 3,000 arrests daily, though the current average is around 1,200 arrests.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is largely shaped by President Donald Trump's demand for increased defense spending by European allies. Secretary General Mark Rutte is working to meet this demand, aiming to avoid conflict with the US. While European countries are increasing defense spending due to both Trump's pressure and concerns about Russia, divisions remain on trade, Russia, and the Middle East conflict. The summit will be shorter than usual, possibly to accommodate Trump's preferences and to minimize the visibility of disagreements among member nations.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been arrested for the first-degree murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, more than five years after her disappearance. This is the second time he has faced murder charges in the case, with the initial charges dismissed in April 2022.

          <p>Defense attorneys for Luigi Mangione, charged with the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, claim that prosecutors are intentionally trying to "bias" the public against him. They allege that the prosecution unnecessarily released Mangione's handwritten journal entries to justify filing murder charges with a terrorism enhancement. The defense argues that the search of Mangione's backpack may be illegal, and releasing his journal serves no legitimate objective. Mangione is due back in court in September, with a federal court date set for December, leaving it unclear which prosecution will proceed first.</p>

          <p>This satirical article humorously critiques the lack of a clear uniform for ICE agents, questioning how individuals are supposed to recognize them as law enforcement officials. The piece suggests that the absence of a uniform and the use of face coverings create confusion and undermine accountability. It sarcastically advises agents to dress in a way that obscures their official capacity, resembling someone on a casual errand rather than a representative of the law. The article highlights the importance of clear identification and accountability for law enforcement agencies.</p>

He dismissed talks between Iranian and European diplomats, stating Iran wants to speak directly to the U.S. Despite this, Iran has rebuffed offers to resume nuclear negotiations. Trump also contradicted his Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, on Iran's nuclear capabilities, while Israel insists it can act alone against Iran.

          <p>China has launched the International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong, positioning itself as a key architect of global governance. This move aims to address what Beijing sees as a lack of representation for developing nations in existing international mechanisms. By placing the organization in Hong Kong, China signals the city's evolving role beyond its economic gateway status, towards a more political bridge to the Global South. Foreign Minister Wang Yi highlighted the importance of enhancing the participation and voice of developing countries in international governance.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is bracing for the first significant heat wave of the summer, with temperatures expected to feel like they're in the triple digits across much of the country. Cities like Philadelphia have issued code red warnings to provide shelter for the homeless, while other regions anticipate days-long streaks of extreme heat. Meteorologists warn that people may not be acclimated to the high temperatures due to a mild spring. The National Weather Service encourages people to take precautions to avoid heat-related complications, which are exacerbated by climate change.</p>
