        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A gunman killed four people, including an NYPD officer, and critically injured another in a Midtown Manhattan office building. New York City's mayor confirmed the shooter intended to target the NFL's headquarters but took the wrong elevator, attacking a different office instead. A note found on the gunman, who had a history of mental health issues, indicated he believed he had the brain disease CTE and blamed the NFL for his condition. The 27-year-old assailant, who drove from Las Vegas, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after carrying out the attack.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has reported its sixth straight quarter of same-store sales declines, with a global drop of 2% that was steeper than Wall Street estimates. Despite this, CEO Brian Niccol stated that the company's turnaround plan is progressing ahead of schedule, drawing on his experience from Chipotle. The company's North American sales fell less than expected, and its China market saw a 2% sales increase for the first time in over a year. Starbucks plans to invest $500 million in labor and is focusing on improving customer service and cafe environments to regain momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An ordinary evening in Midtown Manhattan turned into two hours of terror as a gunman opened fire inside the 345 Park Avenue skyscraper. This article provides a chronological account of the event, detailing how employees barricaded themselves in conference rooms and sent goodbye messages to loved ones. It follows the shooter's path from his arrival to the lobby, where he killed a police officer and two others, before taking a mistaken elevator to the 33rd floor. The narrative captures the chaos and fear experienced by those inside and outside the building during the tragic attack.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump claimed that Jeffrey Epstein "stole" Virginia Giuffre from her job at the Mar-a-Lago club's spa in the early 2000s. Trump stated this was one of several instances where Epstein recruited workers from his property, which ultimately led to him severing ties with the financier. Giuffre, who later accused Epstein of sexual abuse, had previously said she was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell while working at the spa. Trump's comments came as his lawyers are pursuing a deposition from Rupert Murdoch in a lawsuit over a separate Epstein-related story.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon, under Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, has suspended all engagement with think tanks and similar civilian institutions, labeling them promoters of "globalism" and hatred for the president. This article argues that the move, which led to a withdrawal from the high-profile Aspen Security Forum, stems from resentment, insecurity, and fear within the administration. The author suggests the ban serves to protect unqualified officials from public embarrassment and prevents them from misspeaking in ways that could anger President Trump.

The tool is currently being tested with a small group of U.S. users before a wider launch, building on existing parental supervision features.</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has agreed to a $6.45 million settlement in a federal lawsuit filed by Jewish students and a professor. The lawsuit alleged that the university violated their civil rights and enabled antisemitism by failing to dismantle a pro-Palestinian encampment in spring 2024, which they claimed created a "Jew Exclusion Zone." As part of the settlement, which is one of the largest of its kind, UCLA has also agreed to policies prohibiting the exclusion of Jewish individuals from campus areas. The funds will be distributed among the plaintiffs, legal fees, and donations to several Jewish community groups.</p>

          <p>The new film "Together," starring real-life spouses Dave Franco and Alison Brie, is reviewed as a unique blend of body horror and couples therapy. The movie centers on an unhappy couple who move to a remote forest and discover a pool of water that causes a biological urge to physically merge with the nearest mammal. The article praises the film's gooey metaphor for codependence and its clever fusion of John Carpenter-style horror with philosophical concepts from Plato's "Symposium." Director Michael Shanks is commended for expert misdirection and creating a narrative that is both grotesque and empatheticly tragic.</p>

However, Swinney adopted a more diplomatic tone during the visit, focusing on economic issues like U.S. tariffs on Scotch whisky, reflecting the complex relationship between political opposition and economic necessity.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement that the UK will recognize a Palestinian state is a significant shift in British foreign policy, driven by both public and political pressure. This analysis explores whether the move can have a tangible impact or if it will remain a symbolic gesture. The recognition is conditional on Israel taking steps toward a ceasefire and a two-state solution, which seems unlikely given the current Israeli government. With the U.S. holding greater influence and a differing position, the ultimate effectiveness of the UK's new stance is uncertain and depends heavily on the actions of international partners.</p>

He envisions a grand structure capable of holding a thousand people, a significant increase from the East Room's capacity.
