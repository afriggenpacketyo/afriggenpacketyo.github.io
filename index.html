          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel has launched an investigation into former Special Counsel Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act. The probe follows a request from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged Smith's investigations into Donald Trump were politically motivated to interfere with the 2024 election. The OSC is an independent agency that enforces restrictions on partisan political activities by government employees. Given that Smith is no longer a federal employee, the potential consequences of a violation finding are unclear, though the agency could refer its findings to the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>Celebrating its tenth anniversary, Ethereum has evolved from a niche project into a foundational technology for global finance, now valued at over $420 billion. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are leveraging its network for tokenized assets and stablecoins, which processed $28 trillion in transactions last year. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin acknowledges the platform's success but warns against the risk of centralization as mainstream adoption grows. Experts note that despite not being the fastest blockchain, Ethereum's stability, security, and widespread adoption have made it the preferred system for integrating with traditional financial markets.

          <p>In the fifth Test against India, England concluded day three at 50-1, requiring another 324 runs to secure a series victory. Opener Zak Crawley was dismissed late in the day, but Ben Duckett remains unbeaten, offering hope for the hosts. India posted a strong second-innings total of 396, largely thanks to Yashasvi Jaiswal's century and a surprise half-century from nightwatchman Akash Deep. Despite some dropped catches, England's bowlers toiled hard, with Josh Tongue taking five wickets, setting up a tense and potentially series-deciding final two days of play.</p>

Authorities have located the suspect's vehicle but he remains at large, with the search focused on a mountainous area west of the town. The suspect, an Army veteran who lived next to the bar, is considered armed and dangerous, and residents have been urged to stay indoors.</p>

The exchange on social media continued a friendly banter between Reese and Colson.

          <p>The Tea app, which allows women to anonymously share information and run background checks on men, has suffered a significant data breach. The hack exposed highly sensitive user data, including driver's licenses, private messages, and selfies, which were subsequently leaked online. This incident has raised serious safety concerns for its users and highlights the inherent risks of digital "whisper networks," which gained popularity for holding individuals accountable but can also facilitate unverified accusations. The company now faces two class-action lawsuits and has taken the affected systems offline while investigating the breach.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has limited the Trump administration's sweeping asylum ban at the U.S.-Mexico border, ruling that it cannot override laws protecting migrants from deportation to countries where they face persecution or torture. The D.C. Circuit Court panel partially upheld a lower court's decision, finding the administration can still deny access to the asylum system but must continue to process claims for other mandatory protections, such as "withholding of removal." The ruling stems from a challenge to a presidential proclamation that sought to close the asylum system entirely, which officials credit for a historic drop in illegal border crossings.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely maintained restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming that agents cannot detain individuals based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The Ninth Circuit ruling supports a lower court's finding that such practices violate the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures. The case originated from controversial raids in June where Customs and Border Protection agents detained individuals, including U.S. citizens, far from the border. While pro-immigrant advocates praised the decision, the administration criticized the ruling, stating that its enforcement actions target individuals in the U.S. illegally, not specific ethnic groups.</p>

State rules that fast-track the approval of smaller projects have also accelerated development.

          <p>The British and Irish Lions won their series against Australia 2-1, but their tour ended on a sour note with a 22-12 defeat in the final Test in Sydney. The loss denied them a 3-0 whitewash and an unbeaten tour record. Analysts suggest the Wallabies, who improved significantly throughout the series, were underprepared for the first Test, which ultimately cost them the series. The Lions' victory was sealed by a dramatic, last-minute try in the second Test, a moment that proved decisive in what became a much closer contest than initially anticipated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's second-quarter profit fell significantly after the company took a $3.76 billion writedown on its investment in food giant Kraft Heinz. While overall quarterly earnings dropped to $12.37 billion, the company's operating earnings, which Warren Buffett considers a more accurate measure, were only slightly down at $11.16 billion. Most of Berkshire's diverse businesses, from insurance to its railroad, performed well despite economic uncertainty. The writedown reflects the ongoing challenges Kraft Heinz faces with changing consumer tastes and the potential for a major restructuring of the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Palestinians in Gaza report a worsening starvation crisis, describing aid deliveries as symbolic and insufficient to address the widespread hunger. Residents say the journey to find food is a "death journey," with hundreds reportedly killed near aid distribution sites since May. International diplomatic efforts and promises of new food centers are viewed with skepticism on the ground, where people say they need immediate, tangible action rather than political statements. Airdrops are described as theatrical and ineffective, often landing in inaccessible or dangerous areas, deepening the sense of hopelessness in the war-torn enclave.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that aligning fitness activities with personality traits can lead to greater enjoyment and consistency in workout routines. Researchers found that extroverts tend to prefer high-intensity group workouts like HIIT or team sports, while conscientious individuals are drawn to goal-oriented activities like marathon training. Conversely, those with more anxious tendencies may benefit from private, one-on-one sessions, and introverts often gravitate towards solo exercises like running or yoga. The findings suggest that if a particular exercise isn't enjoyable, trying a different type that better suits one's personality could be the key to long-term success.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic reflects on the recent passing of actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner and his nuanced portrayal of Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show." The piece argues that Warner skillfully balanced Theo's "slacker" persona with a complex vulnerability, making the character more than just a punch line. Theo's journey from an unmotivated teen to a young adult who finds purpose after a dyslexia diagnosis provided a key narrative arc for the series. Warner's performance allowed the character to challenge his parents' rigid expectations of success and grow into a relatable and endearing figure.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, following the release of a weak July jobs report. The report showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs and included a steep downward revision for the previous two months. Trump, without evidence, accused the agency of manipulating the numbers for political purposes and claimed the economy was "booming." The move was immediately criticized by economists and policy experts, who warned that it threatens the integrity and independence of crucial economic data relied upon by markets and policymakers.</p>

          <p>Several senior Republican senators have condemned President Trump's decision to fire the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after a poor jobs report. Lawmakers including Cynthia Lummis and Thom Tillis expressed concern that the move was "impetuous" and undermines the credibility of essential economic data if it was done simply because the president disliked the numbers. The bipartisan criticism highlights unease with the politicization of a historically independent federal agency. The firing came after Trump, without evidence, claimed the jobs numbers were "rigged" against him.</p>
