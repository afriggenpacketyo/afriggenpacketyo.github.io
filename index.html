          <p>The United States and Iran have commenced a third round of negotiations in Oman concerning Tehran's nuclear activities, aiming to establish a new accord and de-escalate potential conflicts in the Middle East. These discussions seek to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the easing of economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. The talks occur amidst heightened regional tensions, particularly following the devastating Israel-Hamas conflict and an explosion at an Iranian port, underscoring the urgency and complexity of the negotiations. Optimism remains cautious as both sides navigate sensitive issues such as uranium enrichment levels.</p>

          <p>Charles Burnett's acclaimed film "Killer of Sheep," now fully restored, offers a tender and unvarnished portrayal of Black working-class life in 1970s Los Angeles.

          <p>Craig Moffett, a leading analyst, questions the feasibility of Apple's plans to shift iPhone assembly to India as a strategy to counter tariffs, citing concerns that the supply chain would remain heavily reliant on China. Moffett argues that moving assembly alone would not significantly reduce costs associated with tariffs and anticipates potential resistance to diversification efforts. He also highlights the risk of consumer backlash in China due to U.S. tariffs, potentially impacting iPhone sales. Moffett's analysis suggests that Apple faces significant challenges in navigating the complexities of global trade tensions.</p>

          <p>China is expanding its initiative to create a new academic discipline aimed at eliminating Western bias in ethnic studies, as Beijing seeks to consolidate its narrative on a unified national identity. The State Council has approved 15 more universities to establish study programs in “community for the Chinese nation.” This interdisciplinary field integrates Marxist theory, philosophy, history, ethnology, and sociology. The initiative reflects China's efforts to promote its own perspectives and narratives in academic research and education.</p>

          <p>Under the Trump administration, opportunities for student loan forgiveness are narrowing, with the SAVE repayment plan blocked by a U.S. appeals court and other repayment plans no longer leading to debt erasure. Despite these changes, Public Service Loan Forgiveness remains intact, although its eligibility criteria may be subject to future revisions. Federal student loan borrowers retain access to other forgiveness programs, such as the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program. Borrowers should carefully review their options and maintain thorough documentation of their payments and employment to maximize their eligibility for available relief.</p>

          <p>A parenting coach and advocate for children's emotional health warns against the overused phrase "You're okay," arguing that it can cause long-term damage by teaching children to doubt their own emotions. Dismissing a child's feelings invalidates their experience, short-circuits emotional processing, and teaches that love is conditional. The expert suggests that parents should instead validate children's emotions and provide support to help them identify, name, and regulate their feelings. The article highlights the importance of emotional safety and unconditional acceptance in fostering children's mental health.</p>

Her name will always be associated with the scandals and criminality surrounding the late billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his circle. The photo of her and Prince Andrew, taken in London in 2001, became emblematic of the royal's entanglement with Epstein and was central to his disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019. Ms Giuffre - who was born in the US - died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia aged 41, her family said on Friday.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, shows that graduates who major in education, social work or the arts tend to earn the lowest median incomes within five years of finishing school. The analysis includes only full-time workers with a bachelor's degree and excludes those still enrolled in school. While engineering majors can make upward of $80,000 early in their careers, many liberal arts and education majors earn closer to $40,000. The median salary of all majors examined was $50,000.</p>
