          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that President Donald Trump's proposed tax bill would increase the national debt by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. The bill, already passed by House Republicans, is projected to decrease federal revenues by $3.7 trillion while lowering spending by $1.3 trillion. The budget package is expected to undergo further revisions in the Senate, where it is facing resistance from deficit hawks concerned about its potential to significantly increase deficits. Republican senators, including Ron Johnson, and Elon Musk have voiced strong opposition to the bill, criticizing it as fiscally irresponsible.</p>

Biden issued over 1,500 pardons in his final weeks, including a pardon for his son Hunter Biden, who was convicted of firearm offenses and faced tax crime charges. Biden also issued preemptive pardons for family members involved in congressional investigations into their business dealings, which some critics found controversial.

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum, which experts predict could increase the cost of various consumer goods. The tariffs, which went into effect today, are expected to impact industries ranging from automobile manufacturing to household appliances. Experts suggest that businesses will likely pass on these tariff-related costs to consumers through higher prices, potentially affecting the affordability of cars, sports equipment, canned goods, and homes. While some domestic steel makers may benefit, economists warn of potential negative consequences for consumers and industries reliant on these materials.</p>

          <h2>On-Time Debt Payments May Not Guarantee Credit Score Improvement, Experts Say</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts say that consistently paying bills on time is not always sufficient to significantly improve one's credit score. While payment history is a critical factor, not all debt payments are treated equally, and other factors such as credit utilization also play a crucial role. Many Americans carry substantial credit card debt, and understanding the nuances of credit scoring is essential for effectively managing debt and raising credit scores. Checking credit reports can help individuals identify which payments are influencing their credit score. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal investigation has found that a Texas hospital violated the law by repeatedly discharging a woman with a nonviable, life-threatening pregnancy. The hospital, Ascension Seton Williamson, failed to provide Kyleigh Thurman with proper medical screening and stabilizing treatment for her ectopic pregnancy, which ultimately led to the loss of part of her reproductive system. The government's findings highlight the challenges women face in accessing emergency abortions in states with strict abortion bans, although a new policy from the Trump administration has cast doubt on federal oversight of hospitals in such cases.</p>

His remains were recovered and identified through dental, anthropological, and DNA analysis.

The agreement aims to eliminate tariffs on steel and cars, but uncertainty remains as the UK continues negotiations with the US.

This discovery is puzzling because it was previously thought that small stars could not provide the conditions needed to form such large planets.
