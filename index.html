          <p>The landmark national security trial of 77-year-old pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai is in its final stages in Hong Kong, with closing arguments delayed by a typhoon. Lai, a British citizen and prominent critic of Beijing, faces a potential life sentence for allegedly colluding with foreign forces under a controversial law imposed in 2020. International figures, including the UK Prime Minister, have called for his release, viewing his case as a symbol of the erosion of political freedoms and the rule of law in the city. The trial highlights the stark contrast between his heroic status among democracy advocates and his portrayal as a traitor by mainland China.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops and federal agents have been deployed to Washington D.C. after President Trump took control of the city's police force, citing concerns over violent crime. Armored vehicles were seen in the city as officials announced the deployment of 800 troops and 500 federal agents. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has strongly opposed the move, labeling it an "authoritarian push" and pointing to police data showing a significant decrease in violent crime this year. The White House has stated this is only the beginning of a month-long operation to arrest violent criminals in the district.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a warning to travelers after a significant increase in cases of the mosquito-borne chikungunya virus. Over 70 cases were reported in the first half of the year, more than double the previous year, with all infections linked to travel, primarily to the Indian Ocean region. While rarely fatal, the virus causes fever and can lead to debilitating joint pain that lasts for years. Officials are urging travelers to use insect repellent and take other precautions, as there is no risk of onward transmission within the UK.</p>

The man reportedly yelled racist slurs, waved a skateboard, and engaged in a physical altercation with a flight attendant and another passenger. According to airline staff, he was placed in restraints twice but managed to break free both times. Upon landing, the passenger was taken into custody by local police at the direction of the FBI, adding to the over 1,000 unruly passenger incidents reported by the FAA this year.</p>

This move has been criticized by environmental groups, who argue it puts wildlife and local communities at risk from rocket debris, hazardous materials, and sonic booms.

The animals are suffering from Shope Papilloma Virus, a relatively common and typically harmless disease spread by fleas, ticks, and rabbit-to-rabbit contact. The growths, or papillomas, are usually not harmful unless they interfere with the rabbit's ability to eat, and they disappear once the animal's immune system fights off the virus. The disease, which cannot spread to humans or other pets, is believed to be the origin of the mythical "jackalope" creature.</p>

          <p>Small businesses are feeling the pressure as U.S. tariffs contribute to rising inflation for imported goods like coffee, tea, and spices. Coffee prices saw a 14.5% year-over-year surge in July, forcing shop owners to raise their own prices to protect thin margins. Importers of specialty products, such as single-origin teas and spices, face a difficult choice as they cannot easily shift sourcing to other countries. Business owners worry that the tariffs, framed as punishing other countries, will primarily harm American small businesses and consumers by either increasing costs or forcing quality compromises.

          <p>A large-scale study from Sweden suggests that medication for ADHD can provide wider life benefits beyond managing core symptoms. The research, published in the BMJ, found that starting drug treatment was linked to significant reductions in first-time instances of suicidal behavior, substance misuse, transport accidents, and criminal behavior. Researchers believe this is because the medication helps reduce impulsivity and improves concentration, which are key factors in these negative outcomes. The findings could help patients and doctors make more informed decisions about treatment by highlighting the potential risks of unmedicated ADHD.</p>

The fate of the ban and the protestors hinges on three upcoming court battles: the prosecution of hundreds of individuals for supporting a proscribed group, the trials of alleged PAG members for violent criminal damage, and a High Court challenge to the legality of the ban itself. The government justifies the ban by citing damages and alleged assaults, while critics argue it infringes on free speech.</p>

          <p>In response to U.S. tariffs aimed at curbing China's dominance in shipbuilding, South Korean firms are increasing their investments in Southeast Asian countries like the Philippines. This strategic shift is seen as a way for Korean shipbuilders to overcome domestic constraints such as high labor costs and limited capacity, thereby enhancing their competitiveness against Chinese rivals. For example, HD Hyundai plans to invest $550 million to revive a defunct shipyard in the Philippines, aiming to build up to ten vessels annually.

          <p>The government of Nova Scotia is facing criticism for imposing a sweeping ban on entering all wooded areas, including for hiking and fishing, to mitigate extreme wildfire risk. The province, described as a "tinder box" due to a lack of rain, is enforcing the ban with a C$25,000 fine, and a tip line has been established to report violators. While Premier Tim Houston defends the restrictions as a necessary precaution, citing that humans cause 97% of wildfires, some critics, including a civil liberties group, have labeled the move "draconian" and an example of "creeping authoritarianism."</p>

The lawsuit claims that design flaws, such as a quick registration process and lack of verification, made the network "uniquely susceptible to fraud."

          <p>Nine years after legalizing Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID), Canada is grappling with the profound ethical questions raised by its system, which has seen demand far exceed initial predictions. A feature in The Atlantic explores how the program's emphasis on patient autonomy has created complex situations for clinicians, who must decide on eligibility. The article highlights cases where patients have sought MAID for treatable conditions, forcing doctors to navigate a law where a disease is considered incurable if the patient finds the available treatments unacceptable. This has led to a national reckoning with the logic and limits of a right to die.</p>

These creators—journalists and specialists—work to debunk misinformation and provide context, but they struggle to compete in an attention economy that rewards virality over veracity. The article proposes creating new infrastructure to support them, such as an independent certification system to signal trustworthiness and shared-ownership models for resources like legal protection.
