          <p>Israel launched strikes across Iran, targeting the "heart" of Iran's nuclear program and military commanders. The strikes resulted in the deaths of senior military figures, nuclear scientists, and civilians, according to reports, which are not independently verified. Israel stated that the operation, dubbed "Operation Rising Lion," aimed to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's survival, citing Iran's steps to "weaponize" its nuclear program. Iran responded by launching drones towards Israel, vowing to defend its sovereignty, while the US clarified its non-involvement and urged the avoidance of targeting American interests. The strikes have heightened regional tensions and raised concerns about the future of US-Iran nuclear talks. Optimism is tempered due to the escalation of violence and uncertainty surrounding diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>An Air India passenger plane crashed in Ahmedabad, India, shortly after takeoff, resulting in 241 confirmed fatalities out of 242 people on board. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, en route to London's Gatwick airport, crashed into buildings, causing additional casualties on the ground. Initial reports indicated no survivors, but officials later confirmed that one man, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, was found alive and is being treated at a hospital. Investigations are underway to determine the cause of the crash, with weather reportedly not being a factor. The plane appeared to have its landing gear down and flaps up at a time in the flight when those should have been reversed.</p>

          <p>Israel initiated a major operation against Iran, conducting airstrikes on nuclear facilities, scientists, and military commanders, prompting retaliatory drone launches from Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared the operation, "Operation Rising Lion," aimed to counter Iran's perceived threat to Israel's survival. The IDF spokesman stated that the strikes eliminated senior Iranian security leaders, including the Chief of Staff, Commander of the Revolutionary Guards, and Head of the Emergency Command. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, confirmed that Iran's Fordo nuclear site was not impacted by the Israeli strikes, with no increase in radiation levels observed at the Natanz site. The situation remains tense, with potential for further escalation and broader regional conflict.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Canada for the G7 summit, providing an opportunity to reset strained relations between the two countries. Tensions have arisen following Canada's accusations against the Indian government regarding the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen and Sikh activist. Despite these tensions, both countries share strong trade and people-to-people ties, with a significant Indian diaspora in Canada. The visit may allow for discussions on mutual interests and a potential stabilization of the bilateral partnership, but unresolved issues surrounding the Nijjar investigation remain.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a breakthrough in the commercial extraction of rubidium directly from salt lake brine, potentially reducing dependence on imports, mostly from Canada. This industrial-scale method produces ultra-pure rubidium chloride from ultra-low concentrations, offering a new domestic source for this strategically vital material. Rubidium is widely used in the electronics, specialty glass, and aerospace sectors, with extensive military, technological, and civilian applications. The Qinghai Institute of Salt Lakes (ISL) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) announced that researchers had produced 99.9 per cent pure rubidium chloride from potassium chloride material containing just 0.001 per cent rubidium.</p>

          <h2>Private Schools Lose High Court Challenge Over VAT Changes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The High Court has dismissed a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees. Lawyers representing families and private schools argued that the policy was discriminatory and in breach of human rights law. The government defended the policy, stating it would raise Â£1.8bn a year by 2029/30, which would be spent on raising standards in the state sector. The court found that the government was entitled to consider the financial benefits of the policy despite its potential impact on some families.</p>

          <p>Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is making changes to her welfare reform package to reassure Labour MPs concerned about planned benefits cuts. The changes include a 13-week transitional payment for those losing personal independence payment (Pip) and extra income support for benefits recipients with the most severe health conditions. Dozens of Labour MPs have expressed concerns about the plans to cut Pip payments and the sickness-related element of universal credit (UC). The welfare package as a whole could push an extra 250,000 people, including 50,000 children, into relative poverty, according to the government's impact assessment.</p>

However, the proposals, which emphasize work requirements, may reduce aid for children in low-income families when it comes to certain tax credits, health coverage and food assistance. Households in the lowest decile of the income distribution would lose about $1,600 per year from 2026 through 2034, mainly due to reductions in in-kind transfers, particularly Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The proposed changes would also make about 4.5 million children who are citizens ineligible for the child tax credit because they have at least one undocumented parent who files taxes with an individual tax identification number.</p>
