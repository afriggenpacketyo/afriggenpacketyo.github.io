          <p>The UK Parliament is debating a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek assistance in ending their lives, with MPs considering amendments such as protecting healthcare workers' right to opt out of participating. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP sponsoring the bill, emphasizes the importance of choice and compassion for those facing difficult end-of-life circumstances, while opponents raise concerns about potential pressure on vulnerable individuals. The debate has been emotionally charged, highlighting the complexities and differing perspectives surrounding assisted dying, and the bill is set for further debate and voting on June 13. The government remains neutral, allowing MPs to vote according to their conscience on this divisive issue.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that his administration will soon inform other nations of the tariff rates the U.S. will impose on imports, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick sending the letters. This move follows recent negotiations with major trading partners regarding tariffs set in April, which U.S. companies like Walmart and Target pay, potentially leading to higher prices for American consumers. While Trump aims to incentivize domestic manufacturing, trade experts remain skeptical that tariffs alone will spark a major revival in U.S. manufacturing, citing other factors like labor and energy costs as more critical determinants.</p>

          <p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is facing increasing scrutiny and legal action in Africa regarding its data privacy practices and content moderation. Nigerian authorities have issued substantial fines against Meta for regulatory breaches, including discriminatory practices and unauthorized data sharing, which Meta is appealing. Additionally, a lawsuit is being prepared against Majorel, a Meta contractor, over the psychological impact of content moderation work on its employees in Ghana, sparking calls for stronger regulatory frameworks for tech platforms in Africa. These legal challenges could set precedents for data protection and digital sovereignty across the continent, as African countries seek to hold global tech giants accountable.</p>

          <p>Richemont, the owner of Cartier, saw its shares jump after reporting better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong performance in its Jewellery Maisons division, which includes Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. While the specialist watchmakers segment experienced a decline in sales, overall revenues rose 7% year-on-year, indicating that the wealthiest consumers are continuing to spend on luxury goods despite global economic uncertainties. The company's chairman noted that ongoing global uncertainties would continue to require "strong agility and discipline," and analysts suggest that Richemont's pricing power could help offset headwinds from gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations.</p>

          <p>President Trump acknowledged the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, stating that “a lot of people are starving” and expressing the U.S.'s intent to help alleviate the suffering. This marks a shift in tone from his administration's previous stance on the conflict, as he had long remained largely silent on Israel’s conduct of the war. Trump's remarks come amid warnings from aid groups about the risk of famine in Gaza, exacerbated by an Israeli blockade and intensified military campaign, and he indicated that the United States must take action to address the crisis, signaling a potential change in U.S. policy towards the region.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the gap between Americans' earnings and the cost of achieving a basic standard of living is widening, with the bottom 60% of U.S. households unable to afford a minimal quality of life. The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) finds that these households, earning an average of $38,000 per year, need $67,000 to afford essential items, including technology, education, and healthcare. The analysis also suggests that the official unemployment rate understates economic distress, with a functional unemployment rate topping 24% when factoring in low-wage workers and those unable to find full-time employment.</p>

          <p>Two North Korean fishermen, who "accidentally defected" to South Korea after their boat drifted south, remain in limbo as North Korea refuses to communicate with the South. Despite the fishermen's repeated requests for repatriation, Pyongyang's silence, driven by strained relations with Seoul, has prolonged their stay beyond that of any other reluctant defectors. Experts suggest the men may be stuck in South Korea until relations improve, although they might eventually change their minds about returning, and the situation highlights the deep divide and lack of communication between the two Koreas.</p>
