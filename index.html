          <p>Israel is mobilizing thousands of reserve soldiers to reinforce its military campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, signaling a potential escalation of the conflict. This move has prompted increased fear and anxiety in Gaza, where humanitarian aid has been restricted for over two months. The Israeli security cabinet is scheduled to convene to formally approve the expansion of the offensive, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing an "absolute victory" over Hamas despite ongoing efforts by international mediators to broker a cease-fire and hostage release deal. The mobilization intensifies concerns among hostage families who fear for their loved ones' safety amid renewed fighting.</p>

The trial follows the death of Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, after a traffic stop in January 2023, which led to nationwide protests and calls for police reform.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a lawsuit against Colorado and Denver, challenging state and city laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit targets policies that prohibit officers from detaining individuals solely based on civil immigration detainers and restrict the sharing of information with federal immigration authorities. The administration argues that these "sanctuary policies" provide safe havens for criminals, while local officials maintain that they foster trust within immigrant communities, encouraging the reporting of crimes and engagement with essential services. This legal action is part of a broader effort by the administration to compel state and local law enforcement to assist with deportation efforts.</p>

While the proposal faces opposition and potential legal challenges, it reflects a broader debate about generational change and the need for fresh perspectives in politics, particularly as voters express growing support for age limits for elected officials.</p>

          <p>As official research positions are lost due to budget cuts, the efforts of citizen scientists to preserve federal forests are becoming increasingly valuable, as demonstrated by Don Pike's work in the Tonto National Forest. Pike, a retiree, leads a team of volunteers in clearing invasive species like buffel grass and fountain grass, which threaten native plants and increase wildfire risks. Volunteers like Pike are helping to reduce fire and heat risks, clear hundreds of acres of invasives and capture data on threatened cactuses, helping to save what otherwise might be lost. Their efforts highlight the crucial role of community involvement in environmental conservation amid government underfunding.</p>
