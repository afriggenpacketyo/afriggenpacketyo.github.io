          <p>A federal judge blocked the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from accessing sensitive Social Security Administration data, citing concerns about privacy violations and the lack of justification for unlimited access.  The judge described DOGE's approach as a "fishing expedition" and ordered the destruction of any personally identifiable information already obtained.
