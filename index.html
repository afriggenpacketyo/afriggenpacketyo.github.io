          <p>Delta Air Lines has reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and a strong profit forecast for late 2025, driven by rising airfares and sustained demand for luxury travel. The airline projected adjusted earnings of $1.60 to $1.90 per share for the fourth quarter, surpassing analyst expectations. CEO Ed Bastian highlighted improved demand and a reduction in flight surplus, positioning Delta for continued growth and margin expansion into 2026. Premium travel revenue increased by 9%, while main cabin revenue saw a slight decline, indicating a robust high-end market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's extended 'super golden week' holiday experienced a decline in box-office revenues compared to the previous year's National Day break, marking the second-lowest total since 2017. Despite an increase in screenings and lower ticket prices, film-goers were not sufficiently enticed to turn out in larger numbers. However, nationwide takings since the start of 2025 have already surpassed the total for all of 2024, indicating an overall improvement in the annual picture. This holiday period traditionally serves as China's second most lucrative film season, trailing only the Spring Festival.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political polarization in America has intensified to the point where consumer choices and personal identities are now 'left or right coded.' Researchers find that political affiliation has become central to how many Americans think, feel, and define themselves, influencing everything from dating preferences to religious beliefs and even health behaviors. This politicization extends beyond policy stances, leading to increased social homogeneity within partisan groups and greater animosity across the political divide. While not applicable to all Americans, this trend suggests a profound psychological element driving contemporary partisanship. This article highlights the historical shift from political apathy to deep partisan division.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Priscilla, after weakening from a hurricane off Mexico's Pacific coast, is still expected to bring significant flash flooding to the southwestern U.S. in the coming days. Forecasters predict two to four inches of rain, with isolated areas receiving up to six inches, across central and northern Arizona, southern Utah, and southwest Colorado. A tropical storm watch remains in effect for parts of Baja California Sur. Large swells generated by Priscilla are also impacting coastal areas, posing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, alongside potential coastal flooding.</p>

          <p>Two Pennsylvania State Police troopers were shot and critically wounded while responding to a retail theft report in Franklin County, with the male suspect fatally shot by police. The incident began at a Dick's Sporting Goods, leading to a police pursuit on Interstate 81 where spike strips were deployed. After the vehicle stopped, two female suspects were apprehended, but the male suspect opened fire on troopers. This shooting marks the latest in a series of violent acts against Pennsylvania State Police, following recent fatal ambushes of officers in York County.

          <p>The federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's death, ruled a suicide, was reportedly plagued by significant procedural failures, according to forensic experts. CBS News' review of photos and documents revealed a scene of disarray that was not thoroughly inspected, with evidence moved before FBI agents arrived. Crucially, Epstein's body was removed, hindering the ability to determine the exact time of death, and investigators failed to conduct basic forensic tests like fingerprint or DNA analysis. These oversights, combined with delayed witness interviews and inconsistencies, have fueled ongoing speculation and questions about the integrity of the probe, despite official conclusions of suicide.</p>

The spokesman emphasized that educational exchanges between the US and China are mutually beneficial, fostering understanding and people-to-people ties. China urged the US to honor President Trump's stated welcome for Chinese students and to cease undermining bilateral educational relations and the broader China-US relationship.</p>

          <p>The formal announcement of the 2026 Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), expected in October, faces potential delays due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. Experts project a COLA increase of 2.7% to 2.8%, which would boost the average retirement benefit by approximately $54 per month. This adjustment, while lower than recent years, still helps beneficiaries cope with persistent high prices. Additionally, Medicare Part B premiums are estimated to rise by 11.6%, potentially offsetting some of the COLA benefit. (not investment advice)</p>

The county denied her claims, attributing her dismissal to performance issues.

          <p>At 92, President Paul Biya is pursuing an eighth term in Cameroon, having held power for 43 years, while a fragmented opposition struggles to mount a unified challenge. Biya made a rare public appearance, pledging security, employment, and infrastructure upgrades, seeking to legitimize his continued rule. His main challenger, Maurice Kamto, was disqualified on technical grounds, sparking criticism of politically driven rulings. Despite increased voter registration, practical fears like separatist lockdowns in Anglophone regions and transactional politics within the opposition cast doubt on the fairness and competitiveness of the election, though a new energy for change is palpable among younger voters.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have reached an initial ceasefire deal, announced by President Donald Trump, which aims to end the conflict in Gaza. The agreement's first phase includes the release of all remaining hostages from Gaza, the liberation of Palestinian prisoners, and a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces.

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has pleaded not guilty to charges of lying to Congress, in a case that paradoxically exposes both the dangers and limitations of President Trump's influence on the justice system. Prosecutors initially refused to charge Comey, highlighting the case's flimsiness and suggesting the Justice Department's independence has 'completely collapsed' under Trump. The grand jury's mixed verdict on the charges further underscores the weakness of the prosecution. This article suggests that if the case results in an acquittal or dismissal, it could be seen as a significant embarrassment for the administration, sending a message about the ability to resist Trump's political pressures.</p>

          <p>Approximately 500 National Guard soldiers from Texas and Illinois have been deployed to the Chicago area to protect federal agents and facilities, sparking a legal battle over President Trump's deployment authority. Illinois state leaders, including Governor JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson, have filed a lawsuit challenging the deployment, arguing there is no crisis warranting troops. A federal judge has scheduled a hearing on a temporary restraining order, with federal attorneys asserting the President's legal authority. The article highlights the unprecedented nature of deploying out-of-state National Guard members and the ongoing constitutional debate over military involvement in domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>England's National Health Service (NHS) waiting list for routine treatments has increased for the third month in a row, reaching 7.41 million by the end of August. This rise, along with an increase in patients waiting longer than the 18-week target, jeopardizes the government's key priority of tackling the healthcare backlog. Experts warn that the government is unlikely to meet its target of seeing 92% of patients within 18 weeks by the end of the parliament. The article highlights concerns from health leaders about critical resource issues and staff vacancies, despite ministers' claims of record-breaking activity.</p>

          <p>Beleaguered wind farm operator Orsted plans to cut 2,000 jobs by the end of 2027, aiming to boost competitiveness and refocus on Europe, as President Trump's policies continue to impact its US operations. Trump's administration has suspended new offshore wind leases and ordered a halt to Orsted's Revolution Wind project, although a court later overturned that order. The job reductions, amounting to a quarter of its global workforce, are expected to yield annual savings of 2 billion Danish krona from 2028.

          <p>US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order designating Antifa as a 'domestic terrorist organization,' vowing to aggressively pursue the movement. Antifa, a loosely organized, far-left anti-fascist movement, lacks a distinct structure, prompting experts to question the legal basis and practical implications of this designation. While critics highlight Antifa's willingness to use violence, legal experts suggest that existing legislation and First Amendment rights could challenge Trump's efforts, as there's no formal mechanism to designate domestic groups as terrorist organizations. The article notes this move follows the Charlie Kirk killing and is part of a broader campaign against the 'radical left.'</p>

          <p>An opinion column argues that George Washington would be deeply disturbed by President Trump's escalating efforts to politicize the military and undermine the separation between military and civilian power. Washington, who set precedents for voluntarily relinquishing power and warned against partisan subversion, would find Trump's actions a betrayal of foundational American principles. The article criticizes Congress and the Supreme Court for deferring to the president, enabling his purges of military leadership and attempts to turn the armed forces into a personal militia. It highlights recent instances of Trump using military sites for rallies and threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act, despite judicial rulings against his troop deployments.</p>
