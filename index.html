          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has confirmed that Beijing and Washington have finalized the details of a trade framework agreement established earlier this month in London. According to the announcement, China will proceed with reviewing and approving applications for items under its export control regulations. In return, the United States has agreed to lift a series of existing restrictive measures against China, aiming to stabilize the previously tense economic relationship. This development follows the initial Geneva consensus, which had faltered due to disagreements over rare earth exports and US tech restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Business owners across the United States are voicing concerns that the current administration's intensified crackdown on immigration could disrupt the nation's labor supply. Industries such as cleaning, home care, and construction report losing employees who hold temporary work permits and are now facing deportation, creating significant replacement challenges. Economists warn that a reduced immigrant workforce, which constitutes a record high percentage of US labor, could limit economic growth and potentially fuel inflation. Despite these economic warnings, the administration maintains that enforcement, including workplace raids, remains a key policy priority.</p>

          <p>Severe flooding in Venezuela's western Merida state has devastated a local town after heavy rainfall caused a river to swell and overflow its banks. According to the state government, more than 270 families have been affected, with many residents losing their homes and all their personal belongings to the floodwaters. One resident recounted the harrowing experience of saving his family just as their house was washed away. The Venezuelan government has initiated a special response plan to provide medical care, food, and other essential supplies to the affected region, and thankfully, no deaths have been reported.</p>

          <p>The UK's car manufacturing output plummeted in May to its lowest level since 1949, excluding the pandemic lockdown period, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Production fell by nearly a third compared to the previous year, a decline largely attributed to new 25% US tariffs that caused exports to the American market to be halved. Major manufacturers like Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin suspended or reduced shipments in response to the tariffs. The SMMT expressed hope that a recent agreement to lower these import taxes will provide future relief for the struggling sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits saw a significant 9.1% year-over-year drop in May, marking the sharpest decline since October of the previous year and signaling that government stimulus measures may be insufficient. The National Bureau of Statistics cited weak domestic demand and falling prices for industrial goods as primary reasons for the downturn. Despite a recent recovery in retail sales, businesses have not seen increased profitability due to depressed price levels and intense market share competition. Economists suggest this data is unlikely to prompt immediate, large-scale government action, as other economic indicators have shown more robust performance. (not investment advice)</p>

Speaking at a virtual forum, the Reagan appointee emphasized the need for civility and lamented the rise of identity politics, where individuals are judged by partisan affiliation rather than on issues. While not naming former President Trump, his comments came amid concerns over increased threats against judges and repeated attacks on the judiciary. Kennedy stressed that protecting judges is essential, as they are central to democratic function.</p>

          <p>Twelve years after the British and Irish Lions' tour of Australia, former Wales winger George North reflects on an iconic moment that has become part of rugby folklore. During the second Test in Melbourne, North famously lifted his 17-stone opponent, Israel Folau, onto his shoulders while still carrying the ball and used him to charge forward. Although the Lions lost that specific match, the powerful and unusual carry came to define their victorious 2-1 series. Now retired from international rugby, North recalls the moment with a smile, acknowledging it is the first thing fans want to discuss with him.</p>

Yan Xuetong, a professor at Tsinghua University, stated that the current international trend is one of deglobalization, leading to more military conflicts and greater uncertainty. His comments were made in the context of recent US military operations in the Middle East, which China condemned as a breach of international law. The analysis suggests that the current global environment is not about establishing a new order but rather accelerating a breakdown of the existing one.</p>

          <p>A year after a landslide election victory, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government is facing significant challenges, marking a stormy end to its first year in office. Despite careful pre-election preparations, the new Labour government has been criticized for a lack of decisive direction and has struggled with internal tensions and public perception issues, such as the 'freebiegate' controversy. While Starmer has earned praise on the world stage for his pragmatic diplomacy, his domestic agenda has been plagued by crises, including recent riots and a major rebellion from his own MPs over welfare reforms. The article suggests this first year has clarified the immense battle he faces to prove his government can deliver on its promises.</p>

          <p>The UK government under Prime Minister Keir Starmer has executed a significant U-turn on its welfare reform plans following a large-scale, organized rebellion from his own Labour MPs. The reversal, which sources confirmed just after midnight, was seen as the least worst option to avoid a humiliating defeat in Parliament. This capitulation has created two major political problems: it disrupts the Treasury's financial projections and raises serious questions about the Prime Minister's authority, especially with such a large parliamentary majority. The article notes that this kind of internal defeat is highly unusual for a government less than a year into its term.</p>

This spike in sales was reportedly driven by concerns that new, higher tariffs imposed by the US administration would soon lead to increased vehicle prices. In contrast to the sales figures, Toyota's global production for the same month saw a slight dip of 0.7 percent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 50th anniversary of a nuclear energy agreement between Germany and Brazil is prompting fresh debate over its future, especially in light of Germany's nuclear phase-out and geopolitical shifts. Signed in 1975, the deal aimed to build eight nuclear plants in Brazil, but only one, Angra-2, was completed, and it is now considered susceptible to natural disasters. Critics, including Germany's Green Party, have long called for its termination, while recent developments, such as Brazil's uranium deals with Russia's state-owned Rosatom, have added a new layer of controversy. The future of the pact may now depend on the current German government's stance on energy partnerships.</p>

While the judge described the attacks as "dangerous and shocking," he noted that Yoo's obsessive-compulsive disorder significantly influenced her behavior. The defense had claimed she was bullied by other students, but the court found no evidence the victims were involved.</p>

She warned that an over-reliance on exports could create trade friction not just with the US, but with the entire world. The consensus suggests that for harmonious global trade and sustainable internal growth, China must elevate domestic consumption as a key measure of economic success. (not investment advice)</p>
