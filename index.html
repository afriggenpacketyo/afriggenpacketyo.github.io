          <p>Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) convened in Malaysia to voice their apprehension regarding "unilateral tariff measures," indirectly referencing the United States. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim noted ASEAN's resilience amidst complex global developments, specifically mentioning the strain on the global trading system due to recent U.S. tariffs. The leaders cautioned that these tariffs could pose multidimensional challenges to ASEAN's economic growth, stability, and integration, while reaffirming their commitment to a multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization. ASEAN trade ministers previously decided against retaliating to avoid escalating trade tensions.</p>

          <p>North Korea has arrested a fourth official, Ri Hyong Son, following the failed launch of a new navy warship, which resulted in damage to the vessel. The accident, which occurred last Wednesday, involved the crushing of parts of the 5,000-ton destroyer's bottom, and Kim Jong Un has condemned it as a criminal act resulting from carelessness. Work is reportedly underway to restore the warship's balance, and the incident is viewed as an embarrassing setback for Kim's efforts to strengthen North Korea's naval forces. This follows the detention of three shipyard officials earlier in the week.</p>

Despite women's active role in protesting against the previous president, current candidates are hesitant to focus on gender discrimination due to fears of alienating young male voters. South Korean women face significant gender-based discrimination, including wage gaps and underrepresentation in leadership roles.

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to reduce soaring prices, aiming to bring them down to approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. This move bypasses the auction system, allowing major retailers to purchase rice directly and increase the government's influence over prices. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi emphasized the urgency in addressing public concerns about rising rice prices, which have reached record levels due to a poor harvest. The government will also cover transportation costs to regional areas and consider online sales to broaden distribution.</p>

          <p>A Chinese military magazine, Naval and Merchant Ships, suggests that Beijing could cripple Taiwan by targeting its critical infrastructure, leading to a systemic collapse. The article identifies 30 to 40 "super critical" targets, including liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities, which were recently the focus of a People's Liberation Army drill. By disrupting electricity, water, and communication systems, the article argues that Taiwan's will to resist would be diminished, facilitating a "win without fighting." Taiwan's reliance on imported energy and vulnerability to natural disasters make it susceptible to this tactic.</p>
