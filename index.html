Residents have been scrambling to stockpile food, water, and other essential supplies, overwhelming online delivery platforms in the process. Forecasters are warning that the storm could be one of the most powerful to hit the region in years, causing significant anxiety among the city's population, many of whom have never experienced a typhoon before.

          <p>Morgan Stanley is preparing to offer cryptocurrency trading to its retail customers through its E-Trade division, with a planned launch in the first half of 2026. The Wall Street firm is partnering with the startup Zerohash for liquidity and custody services, signaling a significant embrace of digital assets. Jed Finn, the head of wealth management, stated in a memo that offering crypto trading is merely the "tip of the iceberg." The bank is also developing its own wallet infrastructure to become a direct custodian for clients' digital assets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order designating antifa as a "domestic terrorist organization," but legal experts argue the move faces significant hurdles. Critics point out that antifa is a decentralized ideological movement, not a formal organization, and that the president lacks the legal authority to make such a domestic designation. The action, which directs federal agencies to investigate and disrupt antifa-related activities, has raised concerns about potential infringements on First and Fourth Amendment rights. Legal scholars maintain that while individuals can be prosecuted for violent acts, an ideology itself cannot be criminalized.</p>

The incident occurred in front of horrified onlookers, including the handler's wife and young daughter. According to the local sheriff, the tiger unexpectedly began biting and shaking Easley inside the enclosure. The tragedy has prompted animal rights organizations like PETA to reiterate the inherent dangers of using wild animals for public entertainment and performance. The preserve has canceled all future tours indefinitely.</p>

          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee has voiced caution about the pace of future interest rate reductions, emphasizing the need for a careful approach. While he supported the central bank's recent decision to lower its key borrowing rate, Goolsbee stated that with inflation remaining above the 2% target, the Fed should avoid being "up-front aggressive" with further cuts. He believes that while rates can eventually come down, the central bank must ensure that the economy is on a clear path to price stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An asylum seeker from Ethiopia, Hadush Kebatu, has been sentenced to one year in prison for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and another woman in Epping, Essex. The incidents, which took place just eight days after he arrived in the UK, sparked a wave of demonstrations outside the hotel where he was being housed. The judge described the assaults as "disgusting and sickening" and noted that Kebatu had shown no remorse. Kebatu's conviction makes him eligible for deportation upon completion of his sentence.</p>

The community has experienced elevated rates of cancer and other severe illnesses, which advocates attribute to decades of radioactive and chemical contamination. The situation has been exacerbated by the Trump administration's decision to suspend federal review boards responsible for overseeing medical aid for workers at former nuclear sites, leaving many feeling abandoned.</p>

          <p>The German government has announced it will not join several other European nations in formally recognizing a Palestinian state at this time. Chancellor Friedrich Merz explained that Berlin does not believe the necessary conditions for statehood are currently fulfilled and that such a move should be the final step of a comprehensive peace process resulting in a two-state solution. Germany's position is shaped by its unique historical responsibility for Israel's security, creating a complex diplomatic balancing act amid growing international pressure to recognize Palestine.</p>

          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air after a temporary suspension, which was prompted by comments the host made regarding the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. The network stated that after "thoughtful conversations" with Kimmel, the decision was made to reinstate the show. The suspension had ignited a fierce debate over free speech and corporate censorship. However, Sinclair, one of the largest ABC affiliate owners in the U.S., announced it would not immediately resume broadcasting the program, indicating continued fallout from the controversy.</p>
