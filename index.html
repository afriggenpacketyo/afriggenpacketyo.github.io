        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump, Speaker Johnson, and House Republican holdouts met to address the "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act's" challenges. Negotiations stalled due to disagreements on Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deduction caps. House leadership aimed to bring the bill to the floor, but hard-liners pledged to vote against it. The White House urged passage, calling failure "the ultimate betrayal," while Trump claimed progress. Ultra-conservative members seek steeper Medicaid cuts and the elimination of Inflation Reduction Act subsidies. The bill has exceeded spending cut targets, slashing over $1.5 trillion from the federal budget.</p>

          <p>Republicans are pushing for a House vote on a sweeping domestic policy bill to enact President Trump’s agenda, facing divisions over Medicaid cuts and tax plan details. The bill includes a $3.8 trillion tax cut, benefiting the wealthy, while increasing military and immigration enforcement funding and cutting health, nutrition, education, and clean energy programs. Sticking points include the state and local tax deduction, Medicaid work requirements, clean energy program cuts, and food stamp reductions. The bill would also boost national security and immigration enforcement spending while cutting education programs and raising the debt ceiling. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the legislation would cause 8.6 million more Americans to be uninsured at the end of a decade.</p>

          <p>President Trump confronted South African President Ramaphosa at the White House, pushing false claims of "genocide" against white South African farmers. Trump dimmed the lights to play videos and showed news articles alleging violent attacks against white Afrikaners, claiming they were fleeing due to violence and racist laws. Ramaphosa disputed these claims, stating that criminality affects all South Africans, not just white people. Elon Musk, present at the meeting, has also amplified these false claims. The South African government vehemently disputes accusations of genocide, and resettlement of Afrikaners in the U.S. has been prioritized.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments after facing mounting political pressure. Over 10 million pensioners lost out on the payments after the pension top-up became means-tested last year. Starmer stated ministers would change the threshold to allow "more pensioners" to qualify again, though the exact number and timeline remain unclear. The move follows criticism from unions and pensioner charities, with some Labour MPs blaming the policy for recent local election losses. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch welcomed the "inevitable" U-turn but called for early details of the new approach.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled $33 million in FEMA funds for earthquake retrofits in California, prompting concern from Sen. Adam Schiff. The funds were meant to strengthen 750 to 1,500 apartment buildings vulnerable to collapse in earthquakes. FEMA claimed the program was wasteful and politically motivated. These funds were crucial for retrofitting soft-story apartment buildings, which have historically caused deaths during California's major earthquakes. Schiff urged the administration to reinstate the funds, emphasizing the risk to vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Public companies are using euphemisms to discuss the impact of tariffs to avoid angering President Trump. As companies face the effects of Trump's tariffs, they must inform investors, often by raising prices. However, Trump insists other countries pay the tariffs and dislikes hearing about price increases. Corporate leaders are wary of Trump's social media attacks and are advised to use vague language, like “fluid economic environment,” and emphasize “productivity” gains. Even the word “tariff” is avoided, replaced by terms like “sourcing cost” or “input cost.”</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Target's sluggish first quarter was partly attributed to consumer protests over the company's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies. CEO Brian Cornell cited consumer reaction to "updates" on belonging as a headwind. This reaction compounded ongoing pressure on consumer spending amid declining consumer confidence and tariff uncertainty. In January, Target scaled back its "Belonging at the Bullseye" strategy, which focused on hiring and supplier diversity goals. While Walmart's sales jumped, foot traffic at Costco, which supports DEI policies, increased, contrasting with the decline at Target.</p>

          <p>The State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction is threatening President Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" due to infighting among Republicans. SALT has created a division between GOP House members from high-tax districts and fiscal hardliners, with Trump changing his stance since his first term. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act capped the SALT deduction at $10,000, leading to protests from states that had benefited from the higher cap. Trump now supports ending the cap, but some Republicans oppose raising it. An overnight deal to raise the cap to $30,000 further threatened the bill's passage.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin angler discovered the wreck of the J.C. Ames, an abandoned tugboat submerged in Lake Michigan for over a century. Christopher Thuss found the wreck in nine feet of water off Manitowoc in foggy conditions. The Wisconsin Historical Society confirmed the discovery and identified the J.C. Ames, built in 1881, as one of the largest and most powerful tugs on the Great Lakes. The tug was scuttled in 1923 after falling into disrepair. Storms this winter revealed the shipwreck, previously buried in the sand.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally accepted a Boeing 747 jet gifted by the government of Qatar. The Defense Department will work to ensure the jet fulfills security and mission requirements. The announcement cements the U.S. government's intention to take the plane despite warnings and bribery accusations. While Boeing works to convert two 747s into Air Force Ones, the Qatari jet is seen as a potential quick fix. The move has raised concerns about costs, security risks, and ethical issues.</p>
