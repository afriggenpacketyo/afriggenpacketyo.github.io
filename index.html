          <p>A series of severe weather events, including over 90 reported tornadoes and significant flash flooding, have impacted numerous states across the US, resulting in at least 17 fatalities. The relentless weather conditions prompted emergency declarations and water rescues, with major cities such as Memphis and Little Rock experiencing life-threatening flooding. The storms are expected to move eastward, bringing the threat of flash flooding to areas including Atlanta and Birmingham, while the Tennessee and Ohio River Valleys could see additional heavy rainfall. The widespread damage includes flooded roadways, downed trees and power lines, and damage from possible tornadoes, affecting interstate commerce and potentially causing shipping delays.</p>

          <p>A White House internal investigation revealed that a journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg of *The Atlantic*, was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat discussing US strikes in Yemen due to a series of errors. The incident began when Goldberg emailed the Trump campaign, leading to his number being incorrectly saved in a White House official's phone under the wrong contact. While Trump considered firing National Security Advisor Mike Waltz over the incident, he ultimately decided against it to avoid giving the media satisfaction. The White House authorized the use of Signal due to the lack of a real-time alternative texting platform across agencies.</p>

          <p>The NCAA women's basketball tournament Final Four experienced a significant drop in TV ratings compared to the previous year's record viewership, largely attributed to the absence of Caitlin Clark. This year's broadcasts averaged 3.9 million viewers, a 64% decrease from the 10.8 million in 2024, when Clark's Iowa team reached the championship game. Clark's popularity had previously boosted WNBA viewership, making her team the most-watched in the league and setting records for All-Star votes. The drop in Final Four ratings highlights Clark's impact on women's basketball viewership and overall popularity.</p>

          <p>Following the implementation of new tariffs by the US, Jaguar Land Rover announced a temporary halt to all shipments to the US as it addresses the new trading terms. The 25% levy on car imports, part of broader measures announced by President Trump, has sent shockwaves through global supply chains. Other carmakers, including Nissan and Stellantis, are also considering actions such as moving production or temporarily shutting down plants in response to the tariffs. The United Auto Workers union supports the tariffs, viewing them as a return to policies that prioritize American workers.</p>

          <p>Federal student loan borrowers are navigating a complex landscape as the Biden administration's SAVE plan faces legal challenges and the Trump administration alters other repayment plans. The SAVE plan, which offered lower monthly payments and faster debt erasure, is currently blocked by a U.S. appeals court, leaving millions in limbo. Borrowers placed in interest-free forbearance due to the SAVE plan's legal status can remain in the pause, but it won't count toward loan forgiveness. Borrowers have alternative IDR options, but automatic loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years is currently unavailable under ICR or PAYE due to court concerns.</p>

          <p>A psychologist with 20 years of experience shares four strategies parents can use to raise emotionally savvy and resilient children. These strategies include noticing and honoring emotions, regulating one's own emotions, avoiding labeling emotions as 'good' or 'bad,' and practicing self-reflection. By modeling healthy emotional regulation and validation, parents can teach their children that emotions are valuable messengers that guide them through life. The psychologist emphasizes that emotional resilience is key to protecting a child's mental health and reducing the likelihood of depression, anxiety, and self-criticism.</p>

The response delves into philosophical concepts of interdependence, arguing that true independence is an illusion and that healthy relationships involve embracing vulnerability. It emphasizes that feminism seeks to eliminate unequal power dynamics, not interdependence itself, and encourages a focus on real financial dependence versus perceived dependence.</p>

          <h2>The Comfort Class Doesn't Understand Financial Anxiety</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that America suffers from a class apartheid, where systems are managed by a "comfort class" disconnected from the lives of the majority. This disconnect leads to policies and rhetoric that fail to address the real financial anxieties of working-class Americans. The author highlights the prevalence of class dysmorphia, where well-off individuals underestimate their own wealth, and emphasizes the need for greater awareness and understanding of the challenges faced by those living paycheck to paycheck. The article suggests that the rejection of DEI and the rise of Donald Trump are partly driven by resentment towards the perceived elitism of the comfort class.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire in Galloway, Scotland, has led to evacuations of people and properties as it spreads through the forest.

The fire has moved to nearby hills, and residents in the Loch Doon area have been advised to keep windows and doors closed. Firefighters are also battling another wildfire in the west Highlands.</p>

The speaker contrasts this with the awe-inspiring but distant nature of a hawk and the vastness of the sky. The poem explores themes of loss and separation, ultimately finding solace in the small, fleeting moments of beauty that life offers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has urged Americans to "hang tough" as new tariffs go into effect, calling it an "economic revolution" that will bring back jobs and businesses. The new tariffs include a 10% universal duty on all U.S. imports and higher reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations. The announcement has sent global markets plummeting, with major indexes experiencing their worst week since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. China has retaliated by imposing a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products.</p>

McLaren attempted to undercut Verstappen with an early pit stop for Lando Norris, but Red Bull anticipated the move and responded accordingly. Despite a fast pit stop, Norris was unable to overtake Verstappen upon exiting the pits. McLaren's strategy was further complicated by the resurfacing of the track, which reduced their tyre-wear advantage.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariffs are posing a significant threat to small, heavily indebted countries in the global south, with punitive rates imposed on countries like Cambodia, Bangladesh, and Laos. These tariffs contradict decades of Washington's support for economic development through trade and could exacerbate existing debt crises. Countries like Sri Lanka, already struggling with debt restructuring, face the risk of compromised growth and employment. The tariffs could also lead to social dislocation as multinational brands shift production to countries with lower rates.</p>
