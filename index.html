            <p>The Democratic National Committee is organizing a series of "People's Town Halls" in Republican-held districts during Congress's April recess, focusing on the GOP budget bill and economic affordability concerns. High-profile figures like Sen. Cory Booker will participate, aiming to challenge Republican stances on issues like healthcare and social security. DNC chair Ken Martin criticized Trump and Musk's economic policies, while Republicans defended their budget and constituent engagement. The town halls are a joint effort by the DNC, DCCC, and ASDC, building on previous events with tens of thousands of attendees.</p>

            <p>World markets initially surged following President Trump's decision to pause tariff hikes for 90 days, excluding China, but U.S. futures moved lower. Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped over 9%, while European markets also saw significant gains. However, China faces increased tariffs, creating potential for market volatility. Treasury Secretary Bessent clarified the pause applied to most trading partners but maintained tariffs on China, and the S&P 500 had a strong rally after initial concerns about a recession due to the trade war.</p>

            <p>Democrats are divided on how to respond to President Trump's tariff policies, with some defending aspects of his trade ideology and others criticizing his approach as chaotic. Rep. Chris Deluzio argued for carefully targeted tariffs paired with pro-union policies, while others emphasized the failings of free trade and the necessity of supporting domestic manufacturing. Critics argue that free trade has benefited US workers overall and that tariffs are not a great tool for making the global economy more just. Polling suggests that public opinion on trade is shifting due to Trump's policies.</p>

            <p>The China Film Administration announced plans to reduce the number of U.S. films shown in China as a response to President Trump's increased tariffs on Chinese imports. The administration stated that the tariffs are likely to diminish the Chinese audience's favorable perception of American films. This measure could significantly impact Hollywood studios, as China is the second-largest cinema market globally. The move follows Trump's announcement of further tariff increases for Chinese imports, now standing at 125 percent.</p>

            <p>Demand for warehouses in Southern California is slowing due to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs, potentially damaging the region's industrial real estate market. Despite a temporary pause on tariffs for most nations, increased tariffs on China and other trading partners are causing businesses to hesitate on expansion. Analysts predict a significant drop in imports if tariffs take effect as announced, leading to rising vacancy and slowed construction. Macroeconomic uncertainty is a major challenge for tenants, causing delays in decision-making and impacting the region's economy.</p>

            <p>Anthony Oscar Alcala, a wrestling coach in Orange County, has been arrested on suspicion of grooming and sexually abusing young female athletes. The alleged abuse occurred between 2017 and 2023 while Alcala worked at El Modena and Foothill high schools. He was booked on multiple charges, including statutory rape and sexual penetration of a minor, and has since been released on bail. Investigators believe there may be additional victims, given Alcala's widespread access to minors.</p>

She also stated that it is financially impossible for her to manufacture in the US. She has more than 15 patents for the products she’s created and is desperately trying to figure out how to continue.</p>

While Harris is expected to make a decision by summer, some donors are growing frustrated with the delay.</p>

            <p>The Thomas Mann House and Villa Aurora, homes of German writers who fled the Nazis, survived the Palisades fire, serving as a reminder of their warnings about the rise of authoritarianism. The houses, now cultural centers, had to evacuate and cancel events due to the fire, but the structures remain standing. The situation echoes the COVID years and highlights the importance of heeding Mann's and Feuchtwanger's words in an era of rising strongmen and global crises. Mann's study contains a copy of Sinclair Lewis's novel "It Can't Happen Here."</p>

            <p>Despite campaigning as a "candidate of peace," President Trump is stoking multiple conflicts abroad. He launched a new bombing campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen, supported the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, after he imposed a new siege on Gaza and restarted Israel’s devastating war against the Palestinian territory, and is making little progress toward solving the biggest conflicts he pledged to tackle. Critics argue that Trump's actions are driven by a desire to project strength and avoid pressuring allies.</p>

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department received a report of an assault with a deadly weapon, but deputies found no evidence of a crime upon arrival. This is not the first time Minaj has been targeted by swatters, as deputies responded to false reports at her home in June and July 2023. Swatting calls are a growing problem in Southern California, targeting celebrities like Jennifer Aniston and Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>
