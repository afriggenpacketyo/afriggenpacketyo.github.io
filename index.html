          <p>An Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner, carrying 242 passengers and crew, crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, India, en route to London Gatwick Airport. Initial flight data indicates the aircraft reached a maximum altitude of 625 feet before descending rapidly. Rescue teams have been mobilized to provide medical aid and relief support, and an investigation into the cause of the crash is underway, with Boeing also working to gather more information. The incident has led to temporary suspension of flights at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport, and shares of Boeing have dropped significantly in premarket trading. </p>

          <p>The U.S. is partially evacuating its embassy in Baghdad due to heightened security risks, with non-essential staff and their families being removed. This decision follows reports that Israel is prepared to launch an operation into Iran, raising concerns about potential Iranian retaliation against U.S. sites in Iraq. The U.S. State Department is also restricting travel for its staff within Israel, and President Trump has reiterated that the U.S. does not want Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Amid these tensions, the price of oil initially increased, and the UK's Maritime Trade Operations organization warned of potential impacts on shipping.</p>

Nvidia is a key player in the development of driverless vehicles, providing both hardware and software solutions.

          <p>Despite Trump's success in deterring immigration, the administration is reportedly frustrated by its inability to exceed Biden's deportation numbers, leading to more aggressive ICE tactics. The slowdown in immigration is negatively impacting the U.S. economy, exacerbating labor shortages and threatening economic growth. While some argue immigration restriction promotes political stability, the administration's radical enforcement tactics are increasing social tension and unrest. The article suggests that Trump's policies are causing economic harm without delivering the theoretical benefits of social harmony.</p>

          <h2>UK Economy Shrinks Amid Trump Tariffs and Tax Hikes</h2>

          <p>The UK economy contracted by 0.3% in April, according to the Office for National Statistics, following a 0.2% growth in March, and this decline is attributed to the introduction of global trade tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump and domestic tax increases. The ONS reported a sharp fall in industrial production and services output, noting the impact of Trump's tariffs on UK exports. Despite a more-or-less balanced trading relationship, the UK was hit with a 10% "reciprocal tariff" from the U.S., though it has since struck a trade deal.</p>

          <p>The Trump Administration has signaled that tariffs are not going away, prompting American consumers to prepare for potential price increases. Financial experts advise cutting back on spending and deepening emergency funds to cushion against the impact of tariffs. They also suggest investing in inflation-resilient assets and positioning oneself to earn more to offset potential pay cuts due to rising prices. The Commerce Secretary made it clear that the administration will not extend the current pause on many tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the death of Brian Wilson at 82, numerous stars, including Paul McCartney, Elton John, and Bob Dylan, have paid tribute to the Beach Boys' frontman. Wilson's "musical gifts were unmatched" and "changed the course of music forever," according to former bandmate Mike Love, while McCartney described Wilson as a "musical genius." Wilson was known for his innovative use of the recording studio and his influence on songwriting, and he co-founded the Beach Boys with his brothers and cousin, selling over 100 million records globally.</p>

The latest Consumer Price Index showed a slight 0.1% increase in inflation, delaying any potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve until September. Experts advise comparing mortgage lenders to find the lowest rates and fees, and lower rates are typically extended to those with higher credit scores and lower debt-to-income ratios.

Wilson and his camp were watching "Yo! MTV Raps" and noticed that many rap songs were putting girls down, so Wilson wanted to make something that uplifted women. The beats on "Smart Girls" were handled by legendary hip-hop producer Matt Dike, and Wilson sent out copies of "Smart Girls" as a cassette single that Christmas to fans. Although "Smart Girls" never saw an official release, it has been circulated among Beach Boys fans.</p>

          <p>A group of 105 South Koreans is suing former President Yoon Suk Yeol for emotional damages related to his declaration of martial law, which sent special forces soldiers to occupy the National Assembly. The lawsuit demands compensation of 100,000 won ($73) for each plaintiff, alleging that Yoon's actions violated their basic rights and inflicted mental harm. Attorney Lee Gum-gyu, who has faced off against presidents in impeachment trials, argues that the suit is symbolic and a rebuke of Yoon. The success rate of emotional damages claims against former presidents is not high, but some legal experts believe this suit has a higher chance of success.</p>

Federal troops and California National Guard units joined forces with local law enforcement officers to quell the turmoil in 1992, but the recent federal deployment occurred without request by the state's governor.
