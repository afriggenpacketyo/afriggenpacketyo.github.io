        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece advocates for Eric Tung's confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, portraying him as a crucial conservative appointment by President Trump. The author praises Tung’s exceptional credentials, including clerkships for Justices Gorsuch and Scalia, and his experience as a federal prosecutor. The article argues Tung is a committed constitutionalist whose confirmation is vital for the traditionally liberal court. It also decries what it calls partisan attacks on Tung during his confirmation hearing, suggesting Democratic senators focused on guilt-by-association tactics rather than his extensive qualifications and bipartisan support from legal peers.</p>

          <p>India is undertaking a major upgrade of the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) Road, its primary land access to the contested Galwan Valley, to support heavy military vehicles like tanks and missile carriers. Additionally, a 130km alternative route is nearing completion, aimed at reducing strategic dependence on the existing road and minimizing exposure to Chinese surveillance. The Galwan Valley is a point of contention between Beijing and Delhi, with a de facto boundary separating their controlled areas. Analysts state that India's infrastructure development is intended to enable rapid troop movement in the event of a confrontation with China, prompting calls for Beijing to monitor the situation closely.</p>

          <p>According to recent data, mortgage interest rates are showing unsteady movement, with the 30-year fixed rate decreasing slightly while the 15-year fixed rate has ticked up. The article notes that weak employment data from the July Jobs report has increased market expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, which could lead to lower mortgage rates in the coming weeks. It provides a breakdown of current national average rates for various mortgage and refinancing products, including conventional and VA loans. The piece suggests that while it's a relatively better time to buy a house compared to recent years, high rates remain a significant factor for potential buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 06:00:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that former President Joe Biden is deeply complicit in the starvation crisis in Gaza by failing to act on repeated warnings from the UN and humanitarian groups. The author contends that the Biden administration ignored clear signs of an impending famine and undermined efforts to hold Israel accountable for using starvation as a weapon of war. The article asserts that Biden had the leverage to pressure Israel by enforcing US laws that restrict arms shipments to allies obstructing humanitarian aid but chose not to. Instead, the administration is accused of providing unconditional military support that enabled the crisis, leaving a legacy of complicity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the FBI must not intervene in the Texas redistricting dispute, where Democratic lawmakers have fled the state to block a Republican-led plan. The author asserts that any FBI assistance in locating and returning these lawmakers would be a lawless act, transforming the agency into a political tool for the Republican party. The article explains that the FBI's jurisdiction is strictly limited to federal crimes, and the Texas issue is a civil, state-level matter with no credible federal predicate. Engaging in this political fight would violate the agency's own guidelines and threaten the crucial norm of keeping federal law enforcement separate from partisan politics.</p>

          <p>The Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus, once a vibrant hub of Palestinian identity, remains largely in ruins years after being devastated by Syria's civil war. Volunteer engineers are now assessing the widespread damage to facilitate reconstruction, but only a fraction of its former population has returned. The article details the immense destruction and the complex political history of Palestinians in Syria under the Assad regime, which both championed and oppressed them. With new authorities in Damascus, the future of Palestinian political and military factions is uncertain, and residents are more focused on the immediate, daunting task of rebuilding their homes and lives.</p>

          <p>Community activists, including teachers and retirees, are organizing vigils and patrols outside Home Depot locations in the Los Angeles area to protest federal immigration raids. These groups aim to alert day laborers to the presence of ICE agents and stand in solidarity with immigrant communities, arguing that the enforcement actions are inhumane and destroy families. The article highlights the motivation of these first-time and veteran activists, who feel compelled to act against what they see as unjust policies. Their actions occur despite a recent court order intended to limit indiscriminate, racially-motivated stops by federal agents, which critics claim is being violated by the ongoing raids.</p>

          <p>This opinion column uses Vice President JD Vance's criticism of California's electoral map to highlight the broader issue of partisan gerrymandering, pointing to Texas as a prime example. While Vance lamented that California Republicans receive only 9% of House seats despite winning 40% of the vote, the author notes Texas Republicans hold nearly 70% of House seats with a similar vote share. The article argues that such practices, employed by both parties, distort democracy and can have unintended consequences, such as the elimination of moderate voices like former Representative Adam Kinzinger in Illinois. The piece concludes that gerrymandering ultimately harms the political system by prioritizing power over fair representation.</p>

The commission and SpaceX are already engaged in a lawsuit over previous launch increases, with the state agency arguing that the company is circumventing permit processes.

The move is seen as a reciprocal gesture aimed at reopening dialogue between the two nations, which have experienced heightened tensions in recent years. South Korea's military is continuing to monitor the situation to confirm the extent of the removal, as the two countries remain technically at war after the 1950-53 Korean War.</p>

Guests should be self-sufficient, especially regarding transportation, and avoid assuming the host's invitation to "make yourself at home" means they can treat the space as their own.

          <p>With the implementation of President Trump's new tariffs, the U.S. now faces its highest average tariff rate since 1933, raising questions about the economic consequences. This article explains that while U.S. companies are currently absorbing most of the costs, higher consumer prices are likely inevitable, with one estimate suggesting an average household cost of $2,400 this year. The tariffs are expected to contribute to rising inflation, though not to the levels seen in 2022. A more significant concern is the potential for a weaker labor market, as companies may slow hiring to offset costs, potentially dampening economic growth without necessarily causing a full-blown recession.

          <p>Europe is experiencing a significant increase in tourism from China, with a 13% year-on-year rise recorded in the first half of 2025. According to a report from the European Travel Commission (ETC), Chinese tourists are showing a strong preference for long-haul travel to the continent over other destinations like the U.S. and Japan. This trend is expected to continue, with some analysts suggesting that ongoing political and trade tensions between the United States and China may be redirecting Chinese travelers toward Europe. The influx is a welcome boost for the European tourism industry, which is seeing a strong recovery in this key market.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government has firmly rejected the idea of U.S. military intervention on its territory following reports that President Trump directed the Pentagon to target Latin American drug cartels. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that while the two countries cooperate on security, a U.S. military "invasion" is "absolutely ruled out." The statement came after a report that Trump secretly signed a directive authorizing military force on foreign soil, building on an executive order designating several Mexican cartels as terrorist entities. U.S. officials maintain the designation helps target cartels, while Mexico emphasizes that any cooperation will not compromise its sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the American astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission and safely guided its crew back to Earth after an onboard explosion, has died at the age of 97. Lovell became a hero for his calm leadership during the 1970 crisis, which turned a near-tragedy into what NASA called its "finest hour." He was also part of the historic Apollo 8 crew, the first to orbit the Moon, and was the first person to travel to the Moon twice, though he never landed. Remembered for his unshakeable optimism, Lovell's legacy is immortalized in space history and through his portrayal by Tom Hanks in the film "Apollo 13."</p>

          <p>Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has unexpectedly ended his attempt to switch to the NFL, leaving the Jacksonville Jaguars to return to rugby union. The 24-year-old's American dream was cut short by a combination of a recent back injury and a coaching staff change, which diminished his chances of making the active roster. Despite his athletic talent, experts were divided on his prospects in the highly specialized sport. His return is being hailed as a major boost for Welsh rugby, and he is expected to be named in the upcoming national squad, with speculation also linking him to a proposed new rebel rugby league.</p>

Zelenskyy warned that any peace decisions made without Ukraine's involvement would be "stillborn" and counterproductive. The planned summit marks a significant diplomatic development, but Kyiv remains steadfast that a just peace must respect its territorial integrity and cannot reward Russian aggression.</p>

The raids, including a recent one where agents reportedly used a rental truck as a "Trojan horse," have intensified the debate over immigration enforcement tactics.

Key negotiating points will likely include a ceasefire, the status of Ukrainian territories currently occupied by Russia, and Ukraine's potential NATO membership. Putin seeks to halt NATO expansion and gain permanent control over captured territories. The most contentious issue remains Ukraine's sovereignty and borders, with Kyiv demanding a full restoration of its pre-war boundaries, a concession Russia is unlikely to make.</p>

The solemn commemoration ceremony included a moment of silence and symbolic water offerings for the victims. The mayor's Peace Declaration urged an end to the "vicious cycle of confrontation" and called on nuclear powers to support the international treaty banning such weapons, which Japan has not yet joined.</p>
