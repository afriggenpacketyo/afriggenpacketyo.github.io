          <p>Shares of China's electric vehicle maker BYD experienced a significant drop after the company announced price reductions on 22 of its electric and plug-in hybrid models. Analysts from Citi anticipate that these price cuts will lead to a substantial increase in foot traffic at BYD's dealerships. However, the price cuts have sparked investor concerns about increased competition and a potential price war within the electric vehicle sector, leading to declines in the shares of other Chinese automakers as well. Citi analysts remain optimistic about sales growth for new energy vehicle companies with prices below 200,000 Chinese yuan, citing relatively mild competition in that segment.

          <p>Russia and Ukraine executed a large-scale prisoner exchange, releasing hundreds of soldiers, shortly after Russia launched a major aerial assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian regions. The prisoner swap, the third in a series, involved over 300 soldiers from each side, marking a rare instance of cooperation between the warring nations. The exchange occurred amidst heightened tensions, with Russia launching a massive drone and missile attack, resulting in casualties and widespread damage in Ukraine.

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to major retailers, aiming to reduce soaring rice prices. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi seeks to lower prices to around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June in an effort to alleviate pressure on household budgets amid rising inflation. The government plans to release approximately 300,000 tons of rice through this new system, bypassing the auction system that previously limited government influence over prices. Koizumi's appointment and the new measures come after criticism of the government's handling of rising rice costs, and public opinion appears receptive to the changes.</p>

          <p>Businesses are minimizing the impact of tariffs by utilizing the "first sale rule," a decades-old provision in U.S. customs law. This rule allows importers to calculate customs duties based on the initial sale price from the factory to a vendor, rather than the inflated price from an intermediary. Companies must meet specific criteria, including having at least two sales involving independent parties and proving the item was destined for the U.S. While the rule has been around since 1988, it has gained renewed attention amid increasing tariffs, offering potential cost savings for businesses willing to navigate the additional complexities.</p>

The research published in Cell Metabolism deciphers how hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ), a reactive by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. The team found that when H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to ‚Äúrepair mode,‚Äù prompting restorative slumber.

          <p>As South Korea prepares for its upcoming presidential election, many women are expressing dissatisfaction with the available candidates, feeling that their priorities are being overlooked. Despite their active role in protests against the previous president, issues such as gender-based discrimination and online sexual assault remain largely unaddressed by the leading contenders. With the economy in a slump, many young men feel victimized by reverse discrimination, making feminist agendas a politically sensitive topic. The lack of focus on women's issues has led to disillusionment, with some concluding that meaningful change is unlikely regardless of the election's outcome.</p>
