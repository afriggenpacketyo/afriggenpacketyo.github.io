          <p>Erin Patterson, accused of fatally poisoning three relatives and seriously injuring another with a mushroom meal, testified at her trial, pleading not guilty to three murder charges and one attempted murder charge. Patterson stated that her relationship with the Patterson family had become more distant and that she and her estranged husband struggled with communication. She recounted the traumatic birth of her first child and her decision to discharge herself from the hospital against medical advice after the fatal lunch. The defense argues that Patterson unintentionally served poison and then panicked, while the prosecution claims she intentionally sought out death cap mushrooms and lied to the police. The article provides context on the strained relationships and Patterson's past medical decisions, which are central to the case. Optimism regarding the case's resolution is low due to the severity of the charges and conflicting narratives.</p>
