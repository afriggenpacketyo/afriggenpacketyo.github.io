          <p>Russia has launched its largest air assault on Ukraine, deploying a high number of missiles and drones in a single night, resulting in at least 14 deaths, including three children, and dozens of injuries. Ukrainian officials are urging allies to increase pressure on Moscow to engage in a ceasefire and implement stronger sanctions. The attack, which affected numerous regions, targeted civilian infrastructure and residential areas, causing widespread damage. President Zelensky has condemned the ongoing violence and called for global attention to the continuing war, emphasizing that America's silence will only encourage Putin to continue his attacks on Ukraine. The air force said that since 20:40 on Saturday local time (17:40 GMT), Russia had carried out strikes using 367 missiles of various types, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and drones.</p>

          <p>Syrian families returning to their hometowns after years in displacement camps are finding widespread destruction and a lack of basic services. Nadima al-Barakat, who returned to her village in southern Syria, now lives in a tent on top of the rubble of her destroyed home, emphasizing that while they have lost their homes, they have not lost their will to live. Reconstruction efforts are hampered by financial challenges, with many families lacking the resources to rebuild their homes and infrastructure. Activists and returnees are appealing for international aid to restore essential services like electricity, water, and healthcare, without which normal life remains impossible, and some are trying to rebuild with their own hands and simple tools.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decrease in soaring rice prices following the appointment of a new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi. This expectation follows the dismissal of his predecessor due to a controversial remark about receiving gifted rice, which sparked public outrage. The survey also indicates that many believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, a target recently pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The government plans to sell its stockpiled rice directly to retailers to stabilize prices and make it available at 2,000 yen per 5 kg.</p>

          <p>An attack on a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, has brought attention to the fringe movement of anti-natalism and its more extreme variant, pro-mortalism. Anti-natalism posits that procreation is immoral due to the inevitability of suffering, while pro-mortalism suggests that death should follow birth as soon as possible with consent. This article examines the roots and manifestations of these ideologies, noting their growing online presence and occasional connections to acts of violence. While mainstream anti-natalists disavow violence, the article suggests that the internet allows ideas to be twisted and adopted by individuals with violent tendencies.</p>

          <p>A bombing targeting a school bus in Pakistan's Balochistan province, carrying approximately 40 schoolchildren, has killed eight, including six children, and injured dozens. Pakistan alleges that India is linked to the attack, a claim firmly denied by Delhi, exacerbating existing tensions between the two countries. The incident occurs amidst a fragile ceasefire following a recent conflict involving drone attacks, missiles, and artillery fire. The military has allowed international media to witness the aftermath, as Pakistan's Minister of Information asserts a history of Indian proxies operating in Balochistan, while India accuses Pakistan of harboring militants.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has committed to fully reinstating winter fuel payments to pensioners and abolishing the two-child benefit cap if the party gains power. This move puts pressure on Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has faced internal pressure to address these policies. Reform UK proposes funding these initiatives by cutting net-zero projects and ending the use of hotels for asylum seekers. The two-child benefit cap, introduced in 2017, affects approximately 1.5 million families, while more than 10 million pensioners lost out on winter fuel payments due to recent restrictions.</p>

Despite this, corporate profits are high, the jobless rate is low, and new businesses are flourishing, but the underlying economy is more vulnerable than it was a few years ago. The political instability of the country, whipsawing between two polarized parties, has also left businesses shaky, and now the White House is proactively destabilizing the policy environment.</p>
