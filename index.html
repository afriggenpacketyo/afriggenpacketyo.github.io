          <p>Donald Trump's second term immigration policies are causing foreign students and scholars in the U.S. to feel increasingly restricted in their ability to express their views freely. Many students, who initially came to the U.S. seeking a world-class education and freedom of expression, are now seeking legal advice and considering alternative plans, such as studying in Canada, due to concerns about potential immigration enforcement actions. This chilling effect on speech and academic freedom could negatively impact America's competitiveness and intellectual culture, deterring international students from choosing U.S. universities.</p>

          <p>A recent Microsoft report reveals that 17% of employees are using AI tools more than human colleagues to avoid being judged. Workers are turning to AI for tasks like information search, data analysis, and brainstorming due to its 24/7 availability and endless stream of ideas.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida Democrats believe recent strong performances in congressional special elections signal a potential shift towards regaining swing-state status. Despite no statewide Democratic victories since 2018 and Trump's significant win in the state, the party is encouraged by narrower Republican margins in traditionally conservative districts. Candidates attribute their success to focusing on local issues and directly addressing voters' economic concerns, particularly among veterans and those affected by potential cuts to veteran affairs. The party hopes to replicate this strategy in the 2026 midterms by emphasizing community engagement and addressing kitchen-table issues.</p>

Maps from the University of Connecticut's Cicada Project show the expected areas of emergence, with the insects appearing when soil temperatures reach 64 degrees Fahrenheit. The cicadas typically remain above ground for 4 to 6 weeks, after which they lay eggs and the cycle begins again.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is examining Israel's obligation to ensure and facilitate humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. The case stems from a UN General Assembly request to determine if Israel breached the UN Charter by banning cooperation with UNRWA, which Israel accuses of bias. The hearings occur amidst a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, with aid deliveries frequently blocked and essential services collapsing. The ICJ's advisory opinion is not expected for months.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office have seen the worst stock market performance for the start of a president's term since the 1970s. The S&P 500's significant drop contrasts sharply with the initial post-election surge driven by hopes for tax cuts and deregulation. The market downturn has been attributed to Trump's aggressive approach to trade, raising concerns about inflation and a potential recession. Investors remain wary amid continued uncertainty in Washington.</p>

While Russia expresses openness to negotiations, it insists on addressing the "root causes" of the conflict, which it blames on Ukraine and the West.</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest a strategic approach to managing tax refunds, prioritizing debt repayment or investing based on individual financial plans. For the 2023 taxation year, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) issued over 19 million refunds, averaging $2,294. Individuals with high-interest debt, such as credit card balances, should prioritize paying down that debt first.
