          <p>A building under construction at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear complex may be intended to house advanced centrifuges for uranium enrichment, according to a Japanese expert. The expert, Yuki Kobayashi, noted that Pyongyang is in "desperate need" of such a facility to advance its nuclear program. The International Atomic Energy Agency is monitoring the construction, which has similar features to an existing uranium enrichment plant in Kangson. This development suggests North Korea may be expanding its capacity for uranium enrichment, as a miniaturized hydrogen bomb requires both plutonium and highly enriched uranium for detonation. </p>
