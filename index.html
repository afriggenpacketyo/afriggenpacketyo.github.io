The memo's release further undermines the administration's rationale for using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to El Salvador. The intelligence community based its conclusion on a series of factors, including that Venezuelan security forces have arrested Tren de Aragua members and have “periodically engaged in armed confrontations with TDA, resulting in the killing of some TDA members,” the memo said, showing that the government treats the gang as a threat.

While the Treasury spokeswoman said that the roll back of wasteful Biden-era hiring surges, and consolidation of critical support functions are vital to improve both efficiency and quality of service, experts say the loss of auditors will impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue, given that these agents typically handle cases involving wealthy taxpayers or corporations.
