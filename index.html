          <p>As the Trump administration pursues a nuclear deal with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is reportedly considering military action against Iranian nuclear facilities, causing friction between the two leaders. The article suggests that Netanyahu fears Trump may concede too much to Iran in his eagerness for a deal, while Trump believes Iran's weakness presents an opportunity for negotiation. Israeli officials met with U.S. officials to discuss the situation, but Netanyahu's office dismissed the article as "fake news." This disagreement highlights differing strategies for curbing Iran's nuclear program and managing regional security. Optimism remains uncertain given the conflicting perspectives and potential for escalation.</p>

          <p>Joel Le Scouarnec, a former French surgeon, has been sentenced to 20 years in jail after admitting to sexually abusing hundreds of patients, mostly children, between 1989 and 2014. The trial included testimonies from dozens of victims, detailing how the abuse shaped their lives, with Le Scouarnec admitting to the sexual assaults in a closed-door session. The ex-surgeon kept diaries detailing the assaults, which aided police in tracking down his victims, many of whom had no memory of the abuse. The trial sparked outrage that Le Scouarnec continued to treat children despite a prior conviction for downloading paedophile images, with victims' groups lamenting the lack of political and societal attention to the case.</p>

          <p>Stellantis has appointed Antonio Filosa, the North American chief operating officer, as its new CEO, succeeding Carlos Tavares, who resigned unexpectedly. Filosa aims to mend relationships with partners, especially in the U.S., and balance investments in both internal combustion engines and electric vehicles. The company recently reported a downturn in first-quarter net revenues and withdrew its full-year financial guidance due to uncertainties surrounding trade policy.

          <p>CNBC has selected "Hope for Cynics" by Stanford psychology professor Jamil Zaki as its June book club pick, exploring the idea that believing in the fundamental decency of people is not foolish but supported by science. Zaki argues that a shift towards "hopeful skepticism" leads to better outcomes, a mindset that can be learned by anyone. The book delves into research indicating that cynics experience poorer health, sadness, financial instability, and inaccurate perceptions. This selection aims to offer a positive perspective during complicated times when distrust is prevalent.</p>

          <p>Shares of Abercrombie & Fitch surged despite the retailer slashing its profit outlook due to an expected $50 million impact from tariffs. The company now anticipates lower full-year earnings per share and operating margin, reflecting the effect of tariffs on imports from China and other countries. However, Abercrombie's first-quarter results surpassed Wall Street expectations for both earnings and revenue, with sales reaching a record high. While the company slightly raised its full-year sales guidance, it also anticipates a slowdown at its Abercrombie brand, even though the Hollister brand performed well.</p>

It contrasts the Bismarck and Beveridge models of pension financing, highlighting the pressures on pay-as-you-go systems due to demographic changes and rising life expectancy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics reveals that recent college graduates are facing increasing difficulty finding employment, contributing to a rise in the national unemployment rate. Unemployed recent college grads account for 12% of the increase in the national unemployment rate since mid-2023, despite typically having better job prospects. The report attributes this to a slowdown in hiring in formerly hot sectors, particularly tech, leading to a mismatch between the supply of graduates and business demand. Economic uncertainty, driven by trade policy, may further exacerbate the issue, potentially leading to underemployment among college-educated workers.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has criticized the Republican spending bill, stating it undermines the efforts of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to reduce wasteful government spending. Musk said the "big, beautiful bill" increases the budget deficit, countering DOGE's mission to save taxpayer money by targeting government waste. The bill is projected to raise the federal budget deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years, while DOGE claims to have saved $170 billion since January. Musk has pulled back from his DOGE work to focus on his companies, citing the federal bureaucracy as "much worse than I realized."</p>

          <p>Actor and reality TV star Paul Danan's death has been ruled as misadventure after he took a combination of drugs, including cocaine and heroin. The 46-year-old was found unresponsive at his home in Bristol, with a coroner concluding that the combined effect of the drugs resulted in fatal respiratory depression. Danan had battled addiction since his early 20s and openly discussed his substance abuse issues, and the coroner found no evidence of intent to take his own life.
