        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has imposed sanctions on former Philippine Senate leader Francis Tolentino, a prominent ally of President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr. Beijing cited Tolentino's "egregious conduct" and his role as a principal author of the Philippine Maritime Zones Act, which asserts Manila's claims in the disputed South China Sea. The sanctions, which bar him from entering mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, are a response to what China calls actions that undermine its interests and damage bilateral relations. Tolentino also led a Senate investigation into alleged Chinese espionage within the Philippines.</p>

          <p>A private survey indicated that China's factory activity unexpectedly grew in June, contrasting with official data that showed a third consecutive month of contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 50.4, surpassing expectations and rebounding from May's downturn. This survey primarily covers smaller, export-oriented firms and suggests a boost from front-loading shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariffs. While it points to some resilience in the manufacturing sector, economists note the divergence from the official, broader PMI. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has successfully pushed through significant housing reform legislation aimed at accelerating construction by easing environmental review standards. The new laws, AB 130 and SB 131, exempt most urban housing projects from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a law often criticized for causing delays and litigation. Newsom used a "poison pill" provision in the state budget to force the bills' passage, sidestepping opposition from some labor and environmental groups. Experts believe these are the most substantial CEQA reforms in decades, potentially unblocking numerous housing projects.</p>

          <p>The White House stated that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney "caved" to pressure from President Donald Trump by agreeing to rescind a proposed digital services tax on large U.S. technology firms. After Trump threatened to raise tariffs and halted trade talks, Carney informed him the tax would be dropped. Canadian officials framed the move as part of a broader negotiation, with trade talks between the two countries resuming. The controversial 3% tax would have affected giants like Amazon and Google, and its removal was called a "big victory" by the White House.</p>

          <p>A U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning some California National Guard troops from their controversial deployment in Los Angeles to assist with wildfire preparedness. Gen. Gregory Guillot requested that 200 of the 4,000 Guard members, who were federalized by President Trump to handle immigration-related protests, be shifted to help combat an expected active wildfire season. The initial deployment was legally challenged by Governor Gavin Newsom, who argued it was unnecessary and depleted the state's firefighting resources. This potential shift highlights the ongoing tension between federal directives and state needs during a period of heightened risk.</p>

Abrego Garcia was previously granted a legal status protecting him from removal to El Salvador due to threats from local gangs, making his initial deportation an administrative error.

The family relies on a specific Medicaid waiver program to afford over $4,000 a month in medications and therapies not covered by their private insurance.

          <p>Two brothers from California who had been missing for three weeks were discovered deceased last week, the victims of a previously undiscovered traffic accident. James Fuller, 61, and Eric Fuller, 60, were found in their overturned pickup truck, which was concealed in heavy brush off a state highway. A Department of Transportation employee found the vehicle east of Santa Maria on June 25. The brothers had been reported missing after failing to return from a doctor's appointment on June 6, prompting an extensive search by family, friends, and law enforcement that tragically ended with this discovery.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Identify Compound Produced During Exercise That May Slow Aging</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, may play a key role in slowing the aging process. Their research reveals that betaine acts as a messenger that prevents inflammation and the aging of multiple organs by inhibiting a specific enzyme. This finding helps explain the molecular mechanism behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. The study, published in the journal Cell, suggests that it may be possible to develop anti-aging strategies that simulate the positive effects of exercise by targeting this pathway.</p>

Now, nonprofits that distribute food to underserved communities are facing a massive funding gap, and farmers who expanded operations to meet demand are left with excess supply.

This decline has led to recent outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough.

Jassy also noted that the competitive nature of the Amazon marketplace, with its two million sellers, helps keep prices down as many sellers will absorb costs to gain market share.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to dismantle the long-standing U.S. sanctions program against Syria, a move aimed at supporting the country's path toward stability. The program, in place since 2004, had isolated Syria from the international financial system. While sanctions against former president Bashar Assad and his associates will remain, the order also instructs a review of the terrorist designations for the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Syria's transitional president. The Syrian Foreign Minister welcomed the decision as a "major turning point" that opens doors for reconstruction and development.</p>
