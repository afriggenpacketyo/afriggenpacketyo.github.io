          <h2>Angolan Capital Sees Mass Protests Over Rising Prices and Government Policies</h2>

          <p>Mass anti-government protests erupted in Angola's capital, Luanda, on July 12, driven by a recent surge in fuel prices and widespread public discontent with the ruling MPLA party, which has governed for 50 years. These demonstrations, involving diverse groups from activists to students, were met with a harsh police crackdown, resulting in multiple injuries and arrests. Organizers have vowed to continue protests until the government reverses its fuel price decision, underscoring deep-seated frustrations over economic hardship and a perceived lack of governmental attention to public needs. The article highlights the broader discontent, including issues like rising university tuition and poor school conditions, indicating a significant challenge to the current administration.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates a resurgence in driving in Germany, with total car mileage increasing for the first time since 2018, although the average distance driven per car continues its decade-long decline due to a higher number of registered vehicles. Meanwhile, Germany's Constitutional Court dismissed a lawsuit challenging the use of Ramstein Air Base by US forces for overseas drone operations. The suit, brought by two Yemenis whose relatives were allegedly killed in a 2012 drone attack, argued Germany violated its duty of care, but the court found no clear connection to Germany to support the claim. This article highlights both mobility trends and judicial decisions impacting international relations.</p>

          <p>Russia continued its nightly bombardment of Ukraine despite President Trump's announcement of new military equipment for Kyiv and threats of severe tariffs against Moscow. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, dismissed Trump's "theatrical ultimatum," stating Russia was unmoved by the developments. While Trump announced billions in aid, details remain unclear, with some Patriot systems expected from European allies. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy expressed cautious optimism, hoping for a "maximum pressure" campaign, yet concerns linger about the 50-day deadline potentially escalating Russian offensive operations. This article highlights the complex international reactions to US policy.</p>

          <p>New government guidance for Relationships, Sex and Health Education (RSHE) in English schools will require teaching children how to recognize and act against misogyny. The updated curriculum, to be implemented this autumn and legally binding by September 2026, will also emphasize identifying positive male role models and proactive parental engagement. While specific age limits proposed previously are not imposed, the guidance outlines content for primary and secondary levels, including topics like AI-generated sexual imagery and the link between pornography and misogyny. This article details the significant changes aimed at safeguarding children and addressing modern challenges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has indefinitely halted a Biden-era plan to implement a hydrogen gas-powered blast furnace at an Ohio steel mill, a project that would have significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions and created over a thousand jobs. This setback, attributed to the administration's freezing of clean energy spending and the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies, dashes hopes for improved local health and economic revitalization in Middletown, JD Vance's hometown. Environmental experts and residents express serious concerns about continued air pollution and potential job losses, emphasizing the conflict between environmental goals and current political decisions.

          <p>An Irish tech worker, identified as Thomas, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for approximately 100 days after inadvertently overstaying his US visa by just three days due to a health issue. Despite immediately agreeing to deportation, he was held in three different facilities, including a federal prison, experiencing harsh conditions and a lack of clear communication. This incident, which resulted in a 10-year US entry ban, highlights a broader Trump administration crackdown on immigration, with advocates criticizing the "punitive detention" and "mass detentions" as disproportionate and chaotic.

          <p>A group of Republican lawmakers has formally complained to Canada about wildfire smoke affecting US states, despite recently voting for a bill, signed by President Trump, that significantly slashes renewable energy support and provides new incentives for fossil fuel production. Critics argue this legislation will exacerbate climate change, a major factor contributing to the increasing intensity and duration of wildfires globally. The article highlights the apparent hypocrisy, as the lawmakers attribute the fires to forest management and arson but omit climate change, while experts link current Canadian fires to hotter, drier conditions.

For charitable giving, it aims to encourage everyday Americans but limits deductions for the wealthiest donors. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add over $3 trillion to the deficit, a figure disputed by the administration, highlighting ongoing debate over its true financial implications and the accounting standards used for projections.

Only a fraction of rebuilding permits have been approved, highlighting that environmental laws are often scapegoated. The article explains that real barriers include rising construction costs, labor shortages—exacerbated by Trump administration tariffs and deportations—and complex insurance issues, as companies drop coverage in high-risk areas.

It presents evidence showing immigrants use ERs less than native-born citizens, school funding is attendance-based, and most fentanyl convictions involve US citizens. The article argues Miller's rhetoric is a "Trumpian fantasy" and a "malevolent expression of white privilege" designed to scapegoat immigrants for societal problems.

          <p>President Trump's proposed 100% tariff on "foreign-made" films is criticized for threatening to devastate international cinema, particularly for smaller nations like Armenia where film preserves cultural memory and reaches a scattered diaspora.

It contends that penalizing foreign films punishes American artists, producers, and distributors who thrive on collaboration, leading to a "quieter, flatter, more parochial" domestic market.

          <p>The UK government is introducing grants of up to £3,750 to reduce the cost of eligible new electric cars, aiming to encourage drivers to transition from petrol and diesel vehicles. Funded by a £650 million scheme over three years, these discounts will apply to EVs costing up to £37,000. While carmakers can apply for funding immediately, the RAC anticipates discounted cars will appear in dealerships within weeks. Despite this incentive, some drivers and industry figures emphasize the critical need for more public charging points to truly accelerate EV adoption and meet the 2030 ban on new fossil fuel car sales. The article highlights both the policy and existing infrastructure challenges.</p>

          <p>A SpaceX capsule successfully completed Axiom Space's private Ax-4 mission, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off San Diego after 20 days in space. The four-astronaut crew, led by commander Peggy Whitson, who extended her US record for cumulative time in space, achieved several firsts, including flying SpaceX's newest capsule, Grace. The mission also marked the first time astronauts from India, Poland, and Hungary lived and worked aboard the International Space Station. During their 18 days docked at the ISS, the crew conducted approximately 60 scientific experiments, making it Axiom Space's most research-intensive flight to date. This successful return signifies a continued expansion of private spaceflight.</p>

The report found concerns among Jewish NHS employees and patients, and identified Christian primary school teachers inadvertently using antisemitic tropes. It proposes ten recommendations, including formal antisemitism training qualifications, emphasizing Judaism as an ethnicity and religion, and consistent police approaches to hate crimes.
