          <p>The Supreme Court has issued a brief order allowing the Trump administration to potentially strip nearly half a million immigrants of their right to remain in the United States. These immigrants, primarily from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, had been granted "parole" status by the Department of Homeland Security, allowing them to live and work in the U.S. for up to two years. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, arguing that the Court's decision was premature and an aggressive use of its "shadow docket." The decision highlights an internal dispute within the Court regarding the speed and manner in which it addresses disagreements with lower court rulings.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed subdued figures in April as consumer spending slowed, providing mixed signals for the economy.

          <p>The UK Treasury has announced the sale of its final shares in NatWest Group, marking the end of taxpayer ownership nearly two decades after the bank's bailout during the 2008 financial crisis. The government spent Â£45 billion to acquire an 84% stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), now part of NatWest Group, to prevent its collapse, which would have devastated the UK economy. While the government incurred a loss of Â£10 billion on the investment, officials emphasize that the bailout was a necessary rescue to stabilize the economy, preventing widespread financial catastrophe. The sale signifies a symbolic end to a dramatic chapter in British banking history, raising questions about the safety and resilience of banks in the face of modern threats such as cyber attacks.</p>

          <p>As Poland prepares for a presidential runoff between Rafal Trzaskowski and Karol Nawrocki, Polish voters in Germany are showing a strong preference for Trzaskowski. The first election round revealed that Poles in Germany favor the liberal, pro-European Trzaskowski more than their counterparts in Poland, while the nationalist Nawrocki receives significantly less support. A surprising number of voters in Germany also backed the far-right Slawomir Mentzen, indicating a wariness of the traditional two-party system. The election highlights the differing political views of Poles living abroad and the factors influencing their choices, including a desire for new leadership and a rejection of the established political order.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri topped the second practice session at the Spanish Grand Prix as McLaren demonstrated strong pace in Barcelona. The talking point of the weekend is the new front-wing flexibility test introduced by the FIA, aimed at limiting teams' ability to use flexing wings to control aerodynamic performance. Red Bull and Ferrari hope the tougher restrictions will boost their competitiveness, while McLaren believes it will have minimal impact on their performance. Teams have long utilized front-wing flexibility to enhance speed on straights while maintaining downforce in corners, a technique that has proven useful in tuning cars between high- and low-speed cornering performance.</p>

The Donaldson family has called for a public inquiry into the murder, expressing frustration with the legal proceedings.

Trump claimed that China had "totally violated its agreement," while U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that China had not been removing non-tariff barriers as agreed. China's embassy in Washington expressed concerns over U.S. export control measures in the semiconductor sector. The exchange raises concerns about a potential escalation in trade tensions between the two countries despite recent negotiations in Geneva, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noting that trade talks had become "a bit stalled."</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has successfully reacquired the rights to her first six albums. The master recordings to the pop superstarâ€™s earliest work were sold to Scooter Braun in 2019, and acquired a year later by the investing firm Shamrock Capital. This move marks a significant victory for Swift, who has been vocal about artists owning their work.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant measles outbreak, with confirmed cases exceeding 1,000 nationwide, marking the highest number in a single year since 2019. A substantial portion of these infections has been reported in West Texas, resulting in the deaths of two children. Health officials attribute the increase in cases to declining vaccination rates, emphasizing that the measles vaccine is safe and effective. The CDC reports that about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year, down from 95.2% in the 2019-2020 school year, which is below the critical threshold needed to maintain community immunity.</p>

          <p>President Trump has launched an attack on conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, calling him a "bad person" who "probably hates America."

Trump suggested that the judges' decision was motivated by hatred towards him and expressed disappointment with the Federalist Society, which Leo formerly led. The attacks are notable given the long-standing alliance between Trump, Leo, and the Federalist Society, which played a key role in selecting conservative judges during Trump's presidency.</p>

The CDC still broadly recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children, in addition to most adults.
