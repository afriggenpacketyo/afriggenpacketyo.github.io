          <p>Jurors have started deliberations in the federal trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, who faces charges of racketeering and sex trafficking that could result in a life sentence. Prosecutors allege he used his power, wealth, and violence to coerce women, presenting evidence that included testimony from ex-girlfriends and infamous hotel security footage. The defense has argued the case is motivated by money, not criminal acts, and that the sexual encounters were consensual. Combs did not testify, and his legal team chose not to call any witnesses in his defense.</p>

The manhunt now focuses on the last remaining fugitive, four-time convicted killer Derrick Groves, with a $50,000 reward offered for information leading to his arrest.

The incident has triggered an investigation by the UK's broadcast regulator, Ofcom, and has drawn sharp criticism from government officials and festival organizers.

The author contends that this anti-empathy argument serves as a political tool for conservatives to dismiss compassionate feelings that might conflict with right-wing policies on issues like immigration.

          <p>A new report from Interpol indicates that criminal online scam centers, which force trafficked victims to commit fraud, have expanded from a regional problem in Southeast Asia into a global crisis. These hubs are now being identified in the Middle East, West Africa, and Central America, with victims being lured from 66 different countries with fraudulent job offers. Once captive, victims are often beaten, sexually exploited, and forced to run online scams, a trend that is being amplified by the use of AI technology.</p>
