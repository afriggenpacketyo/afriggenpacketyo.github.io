        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's inflation rate increased to 3.8% in July, marking its highest level since January 2024 and remaining above the Bank of England's 2% target. This rise was primarily attributed to significant jumps in air fares, likely due to school holiday timing, and higher food prices across various categories. The slightly elevated inflation strengthens economists' expectations for the Bank of England to slow the pace of interest rate cuts, balancing inflation control with economic growth. The article highlights the ongoing cost-of-living challenges for households.</p>

          <p>Chinese toymaker Pop Mart saw its shares jump 10% after reporting a near-400% surge in net profit for the first half of 2025, fueled by global demand for its "ugly-cute" Labubu dolls. Despite initial drops, the stock reversed course, with its CEO expressing confidence in reaching ambitious revenue targets. The article notes concerns from Chinese state media about oversight of blind-box toys and analyst skepticism regarding the long-term popularity of Pop Mart's intellectual properties. Nevertheless, the company's international expansion, particularly in Asia-Pacific and the Americas, remains robust.</p>

          <p>Amanda Knox, previously exonerated in a high-profile murder case, is executive producing an eight-part Hulu series titled "The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox," aiming to reclaim her story. She has partnered with Monica Lewinsky, who similarly reentered public life to redefine her narrative after the 1990s White House scandal. The article highlights their shared experiences of public vilification and interrogation at a young age, and their mutual support in overcoming past traumas. Knox, now an advocate for the wrongly convicted, and Lewinsky, an anti-bullying activist, are using their platforms to foster understanding and human connection.</p>

          <p>Health experts are advocating for the mandatory labeling of pine nuts and goat's milk as allergens on food packaging in the UK and EU, citing a rising frequency of allergic reactions. An article in Clinical & Experimental Allergy suggests adding these, along with buckwheat and peas/lentils, to the current list of 14 common allergens. The recommendation stems from an analysis of nearly 3,000 anaphylaxis cases, with a notable number linked to these emerging allergens, including two fatalities. The article emphasizes the importance of clear labeling and ongoing vigilance for new allergy trends, such as pea protein.</p>

The article highlights Ruth's witty and rebellious spirit as she navigates a life where her career, marriage, and even her children's names are chosen for her. The review contrasts this sympathetic portrayal with other works depicting trapped women, emphasizing that Ruth, despite knowing the outside world, does not seek to leave. Ultimately, the article delves into how Ruth finds small joys and experiences universal frustrations, prompting a reflection on whether true happiness is achievable without personal freedom.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that the conservative movement has developed highly effective, well-funded "talent pipelines" to cultivate young thinkers, a model that liberals currently lack. These conservative programs, such as fellowships at National Review and the Claremont Institute, offer intellectual engagement, mentorship, and connections with influential figures, drawing ambitious young graduates into institutional conservatism. In contrast, liberal institutions, often seen as politically neutral, tend to focus on professional training rather than ideological cultivation. The article suggests this disparity stems from liberalism's historical intellectual dominance, leading to a "siloing" of academic and policy work, and a struggle to articulate a comprehensive worldview for the 21st century.</p>

The European Food Safety Authority has classified ten nitrosamines found in food as carcinogenic and genotoxic, indicating that current intake levels pose a public health risk.

The article highlights the historical exploitation of Filipino migrant laborers in Hawaii's tourism industry, making them particularly vulnerable to the economic fallout.

          <p>The authors of "And Tango Makes Three" highlight a dangerous legal strategy emerging in book ban cases: classifying library books as "government speech," which would allow censorship without First Amendment challenges. This argument, previously applied to monuments or license plates, was recently accepted by a federal appeals court in Texas, permitting the removal of 17 books from public libraries. The article warns that if the Supreme Court upholds this, it could empower governments to remove any book they dislike, setting a precedent for widespread censorship.
