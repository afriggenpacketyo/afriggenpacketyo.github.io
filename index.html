          <p>Beijing has strongly criticized a recent threat from the United States to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods, labeling it a typical example of American "double standards." A spokesperson for China's Commerce Ministry stated that the country is not afraid of a trade war and is prepared to implement its own countermeasures if the tariffs are enacted. The dispute follows China's move to tighten export controls on rare earths, a decision the US deemed hostile, further escalating trade tensions and causing concern in global financial markets.

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has urged universities to take decisive action to protect Jewish students from harassment and discrimination, citing an "unacceptable increase in antisemitism." In response, the government is funding training programs to help university staff and students identify and address antisemitism, with Phillipson stating that many Jewish students currently feel unsafe. The call to action follows a report showing a significant rise in antisemitic incidents on campuses and comes amid ongoing tensions related to protests over the conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Amid a prolonged federal government shutdown, hundreds of thousands of US government employees are facing heightened anxiety over threats of mass firings and suggestions that legally guaranteed back pay might be withheld. Workers describe feeling like "political pawns" in a dispute they have no part in, with many living paycheck to paycheck and uncertain about their job security. Union leaders and watchdog groups are condemning the administration's rhetoric, arguing it is a vindictive tactic that inflicts pain on innocent workers and undermines the civil service.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have employed an advanced AI protein language model to investigate the phenomenon of convergent evolution, where unrelated species independently develop similar traits. The study moved beyond traditional methods of examining small sequence similarities to analyze complex 3D protein structures. This innovative approach has helped identify previously hidden sequence-level bases for functional convergence, offering new insights into how distinct species like bats and dolphins both developed echolocation, or how birds and insects both evolved the ability to fly.</p>

Machado, a controversial figure even within the opposition for her alignment with Trump, dedicated the award to the Venezuelan people and to the former US president for his support.</p>

          <p>The Welsh political party Plaid Cymru has endorsed a plan to create a "standing commission" to research and prepare a white paper on Welsh independence. However, party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth clarified that this initiative is not intended for the next government term, suggesting it is a long-term goal contingent on future election victories. This move marks a strategic shift from the party's previous commitment to hold an independence referendum within five years. The commission will first focus on engaging the public and pursuing enhanced devolution for Wales, such as powers over policing and justice.</p>

          <p>Scotland's head coach, Steve Clarke, has expressed his determination to lead the team to the World Cup, viewing it as an opportunity to "put right" the painful 2022 play-off defeat to Ukraine. Having successfully guided Scotland to two consecutive European Championships, Clarke is now focused on ending the nation's 28-year absence from the men's World Cup finals. As Scotland prepares to face Belarus, a victory could secure at least a play-off spot, keeping the team's hopes for automatic qualification alive ahead of a potential showdown with group leaders Denmark.</p>

          <p>Adonis Alkhaled, a reporter for Deutsche Welle, is still awaiting justice one year after being violently assaulted by men believed to be security personnel at a concert in Düsseldorf, Germany. Despite video evidence and international condemnation of the attack, the police investigation into the incident has yielded no concrete results. Alkhaled was assaulted after interviewing Syrian hip-hop star Al Shami, suffering facial injuries and a suspected concussion. The slow pace of the investigation has raised concerns about press safety and the effectiveness of law enforcement in holding the perpetrators accountable.</p>

          <p>An agreement in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein to formalize the option for Muslim students and employees to take unpaid leave for two major Islamic holidays has triggered a national debate. While some media outlets inaccurately framed it as "extra holidays," the policy merely codifies a long-standing practice rooted in constitutional religious freedom, similar to provisions for Catholic and Protestant holidays in various states. The article explains Germany's patchwork of state-regulated religious holidays and how the modest agreement reflects a broader conversation about integration and equality in a culturally diverse society.</p>

          <p>The Philippines has accused a Chinese vessel of deliberately ramming a Filipino government ship near Thitu Island in the highly contested South China Sea. According to Manila, the Chinese ship also used a water cannon against the Philippine vessel, which was anchored as part of a mission to protect local fishermen. China has refuted the claim, stating the Philippine ships "illegally entered" its waters and that it took lawful control measures, blaming Manila for the collision. The incident marks another escalation in maritime tensions between the two nations over territory that Beijing claims despite a 2016 international ruling against it.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in China and the Netherlands say they have discovered how a single plant cell can regenerate into an entirely new plant by flipping two genetic switches. Researchers collaborated to publish their findings in the peer-reviewed journal Cell last month. The formation of an embryo from a single cell is one of the most profound processes in biology, they wrote. This ability was thought to belong only to fertilised eggs, but in plants, differentiated somatic cells can regain this ability and initiate embryogenesis under appropriate conditions.</p>

          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and the Netherlands has identified the mechanism by which a single differentiated plant cell can regenerate into an entire new plant. Published in the journal *Cell*, their research reveals how flipping two specific genetic switches can initiate somatic embryogenesis, a process previously thought to be exclusive to fertilized eggs. This discovery provides a deeper understanding of one of biology's most fundamental processes and could have significant implications for agriculture and plant science, offering new ways to propagate plants from non-reproductive cells.</p>

          <p>BBC presenter Lucy Owen shares her personal journey of understanding body donation after her 86-year-old mother, Patsy, announced her decision to donate her body to medical science. Initially shocked, Owen investigated the process for a documentary, gaining rare access to Cardiff University's anatomy centre. She learned how donated bodies serve as "silent teachers" for medical students, providing invaluable, hands-on learning that cannot be replicated by textbooks. The experience not only gave Owen peace and pride in her mother's decision but also inspired her to pledge her own body for donation.</p>

          <p>Alison Davis was found not guilty of murdering her husband, Kevin Davis, who was found with fatal head injuries at the bottom of their home's staircase. Alison had consistently maintained that her husband fell, while prosecutors argued she beat him to death, though no weapon was ever found. A key detail in the case was the couple's protective dog, Willow, who was in an upstairs bedroom and prevented police from entering, leading investigators to speculate that a weapon might have been concealed there. The jury, however, found the prosecution's case had too many holes and acquitted Alison after 17 months of incarceration.</p>
