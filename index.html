          <p>Retail traders, largely coordinating on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, have shifted their focus to new companies, causing significant stock volatility. Wearable camera maker GoPro and doughnut chain Krispy Kreme saw their shares surge as they became the latest targets of the meme stock phenomenon. Both companies are characterized by low stock prices and notable short interest, attracting traders employing high-risk "YOLO" strategies. This speculative activity coincides with a broader market rally, with some analysts attributing the trend to a removal of economic downside risks and hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts.

          <p>Bryan Kohberger was sentenced to four consecutive life terms in prison without parole for the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. The sentencing followed his guilty plea, which was part of a deal to avoid the death penalty. During the emotional hearing, family members of the victims delivered powerful impact statements, with some addressing Kohberger directly, who declined to speak when given the opportunity. The judge condemned Kohberger's actions as senseless and evil, emphasizing his lack of remorse before imposing the sentence that ensures he will remain imprisoned for life.</p>

          <p>The State Department, led by Secretary Marco Rubio, has initiated an investigation into Harvard University's eligibility to sponsor the Exchange Visitor Program. This move is the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration against the university, citing national security concerns and a need for legal compliance. Harvard has condemned the probe as a retaliatory measure that infringes upon its First Amendment rights. The investigation follows previous attempts by the Department of Homeland Security to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students and legal battles over federal funding cuts, framing a contentious relationship between the university and the administration.</p>

          <p>Hasbro reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, despite a significant decline in its traditional toy business. The company's strength came from its Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming division, with popular titles like Magic: The Gathering and Monopoly Go! driving a 16% revenue increase in that segment. This performance helped offset a 16% drop in the consumer products segment, which has been negatively affected by retailer order timing and the impact of tariffs. Despite an overall net loss attributed to a goodwill impairment, Hasbro raised its full-year guidance, signaling confidence in its gaming-focused strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sales of existing homes fell by 2.7% in June, a larger drop than anticipated, as the housing market continues to grapple with affordability challenges. According to the National Association of Realtors, the decline is primarily driven by high mortgage rates, which hovered near 7% when these sales contracts were likely signed. Despite the slowdown in sales, the median home price reached a new record high for June at $435,300, marking 24 consecutive months of annual price increases. This price growth is fueled by a persistent undersupply of homes, which continues to sideline many first-time buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

Proponents, like the National Association of Realtors, argue that the current tax discourages some homeowners, particularly retirees in high-value homes, from selling and downsizing, thereby limiting housing supply. However, some analysts contend that such a change would primarily benefit high-end homeowners and would not address the core issue facing the market, which they identify as a lack of consumer confidence.

          <h2>Scientists Engineer Mosquitoes with Minor Genetic Change to Block Malaria Transmission</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 13:02:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have successfully used gene editing to make mosquitoes highly resistant to spreading malaria, a breakthrough that could significantly impact the global fight against the disease. By altering a single amino acid in the mosquito's genome, scientists were able to largely prevent the malaria parasite from completing its journey to the insect's salivary glands. The study also demonstrated that this genetic trait can be rapidly spread through a laboratory population using a gene drive. While the technology is still years from field use and faces controversy over potential ecological impacts, it represents a promising new strategy for curbing malaria.</p>

In an emotional interview, Simmons reflected on their friendship, which began in 1975, describing the Black Sabbath singer as a warm, nonjudgmental person with no pretense. He credited Osbourne and Black Sabbath as foundational to the heavy metal genre, stating that countless bands were inspired by their work. Simmons emphasized Osbourne's unique character, noting he was a "pure human being" who never spoke ill of anyone and was a true original in the music world.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to scrap its 2009 "endangerment finding," a scientific conclusion that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare. This finding is the legal foundation for most federal regulations on climate pollution, including limits on emissions from power plants and vehicles. Rescinding it would dismantle the EPA's authority to combat climate change and would likely face significant legal challenges. Climate scientists and activists have condemned the move, arguing it would halt U.S. progress on climate action, while the EPA administrator claims it is necessary to prevent throttling American industry.</p>

Rashford, who had fallen out of favor at his boyhood club under manager Ruben Amorin, expressed his excitement about joining a club where "dreams come true." The move, which sees Barcelona cover his full wages, marks the first time the 27-year-old forward will play outside the Premier League. His departure from Manchester United follows a dramatic drop in form and disciplinary issues after a standout season two years prior.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's government has warned that China is actively trying to interfere in its democratic process ahead of a historic recall vote targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party. The recall campaign was initiated by civic groups who accuse the KMT legislators of being too aligned with Beijing. Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council stated that Chinese state media and officials have been echoing KMT talking points and urging voters to oppose the recall. This comes amid heightened political tensions, as the opposition-controlled legislature has clashed with President Lai Ching-te's government, particularly over defense spending.</p>

In exchange for this softened tariff stance, Japan has agreed to increase imports of certain U.S. agricultural goods and trucks, and President Trump stated the country would also make a $550 billion investment in the U.S. This accord is one of several the White House has pursued as part of a broader strategy to renegotiate trade relationships globally.
