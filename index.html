            <p>The Trump administration has begun terminating the legal status of migrants who entered the U.S. under the Biden administration's CBP One app system, instructing them to leave immediately or face deportation. Over 900,000 migrants had entered the U.S. through this system, receiving notices to appear in immigration court and two-year parole grants. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed the status cancellations, urging affected individuals to self-deport via the CBP Home App, with threats of arrest and permanent reentry bans for non-compliance. The move is part of a broader effort to dismantle Biden-era immigration programs and expand the pool of migrants eligible for deportation.</p>

            <p>Conservative Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett has faced backlash from the far right for siding with liberal justices in a ruling against the Trump administration regarding a 1798 law used to deport alleged gang members. This marks the second time recently that Barrett has drawn their scorn, leading some to label her "Amy Commie Barrett." Trump allies, including Mike Lee, expressed disappointment, while right-wing commentators accused her of supporting cartels and questioned her appointment. The criticism comes amid ongoing attacks and threats against judges who rule against Trump or his administration.</p>

            <p>Following market turmoil caused by President Trump's tariff policies, some lenders are preparing to reduce mortgage rates, anticipating that the Bank of England might implement further interest rate cuts to mitigate economic downturn. TSB Bank is set to decrease certain two-year fixed-rate mortgages by up to 0.25 percentage points, following similar actions by MPowered Mortgages. Financial analysts predict that the Bank of England will cut interest rates more than initially expected this year to bolster economic growth. The expectation is that mortgage companies will price in these potential cuts, leading to a broader decrease in mortgage rates in the coming weeks. (not investment advice)</p>

Lessons on investing also play a crucial role in long-term wealth creation, according to experts.

            <p>Chinese semiconductor and auto parts suppliers expect to benefit from the intensified trade war with the United States. Companies like Suzhou Everbright Photonics and Chipsea Technologies anticipate that retaliatory tariffs on American imports will increase demand for domestic alternatives. The companies believe that China's efforts towards tech self-sufficiency, combined with rising costs and uncertainties in the supply chain for imported chips, will lead to expanded market share for local chips. This reflects increased confidence among Chinese suppliers in providing competitive alternatives to US imports.</p>

            <p>Stocks rebounded on Tuesday after a three-day sell-off triggered by anxieties over the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all experienced significant gains. Investors were encouraged by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's statement that the Trump administration is negotiating tariffs with several countries and believes "good deals" can be reached. Despite the rebound, analysts caution that the tariff overhang remains a threat to long-term economic growth and could lead to higher inflation.</p>

Economists estimate that the tariffs could reduce Vietnam's economic growth this year, despite diplomatic efforts to Washington. Vietnam has become a manufacturing hub for companies like Nike, Adidas, and Apple, and has also benefited from Chinese manufacturers relocating to avoid U.S. tariffs.</p>

            <p>While governments nationwide have received billions of dollars in opioid settlement money, individual victims are often receiving meager payouts, highlighting a sense of injustice. Many victims have received only a few hundred dollars, while their local governments receive hundreds of thousands or millions. State and local governments are supposed to spend settlement money on addiction treatment, recovery, and prevention programs, but some affected individuals and families argue that governments have failed to adhere to that mission. This discrepancy raises questions about the allocation of settlement funds and the support provided to those directly affected by the opioid crisis.</p>
