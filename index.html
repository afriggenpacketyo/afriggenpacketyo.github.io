          <h2>Chamber of Commerce Appeals to Trump for Tariff Relief to Prevent Recession</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 09:58:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has formally requested the Trump administration to implement a tariff exclusion process to prevent a recession and mitigate damage to small businesses. In a letter to key trade officials, the chamber's CEO, Suzanne Clark, urged for automatic tariff exemptions for small business importers and products not domestically available, also requesting a process for businesses to quickly obtain exclusions if tariffs threaten U.S. jobs. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Steven Miller responded that tax relief would be the administration's form of relief for small businesses, stating tariffs only apply to products made outside the U.S.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial advisors suggest a lesser-known 401(k) feature could significantly boost retirement savings by allowing after-tax contributions on top of regular deferrals, with a maximum 401(k) limit of $70,000 for 2025, including employee deferrals, company matches, and profit sharing. While only a small percentage of employer plans offer this feature, and even fewer employees utilize it, converting after-tax funds to Roth periodically is crucial to avoid future tax liabilities on returns. Experts recommend focusing on regular 401(k) deferrals first, but leveraging after-tax contributions and Roth conversions can be an 'amazing outcome' for those who can afford it (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, in his dual role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), described his initial 100 days as 'very intense,' claiming $160 billion in taxpayer savings but admitting progress hasn't been 'as effective as I'd like'. He attributed limitations to 'an entrenched set of interests' and compared reforming federal budgeting to 'changing the direction of a fleet of supertankers'. Musk also spoke about his time in Washington, sometimes staying at the White House, and emphasized the need for more political support to reach DOGE's goal of $1 trillion in cuts.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly reported first-quarter revenue and earnings exceeding estimates due to high demand for weight loss and diabetes drugs like Mounjaro and Zepbound, which saw revenue increases of 113% and over 300% respectively. However, the company lowered its full-year profit guidance due to charges from acquiring an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. CEO Dave Ricks noted that the threat of tariffs is already incentivizing drugmakers to invest in U.S. manufacturing, potentially negating the need for actual tariffs.</p>

          <p>According to Alex Berenson, the proposed Trump administration's ceasefire proposal for Ukraine, despite media criticism, is a strategically sound approach to ending the conflict. The proposal doesn't restrict the size of the Ukrainian military or require Zelenskyy's resignation, while the United States would recognize Crimea as Russian territory. Berenson argues that this deal could lead to a lasting peace, as Putin would have a win and the potential for sanctions to be removed, while Zelenskyy can blame the American betrayal for his failure to evict the Russian army.</p>

          <p>House Republicans, with support from some Democrats, voted to block California from requiring dealers to sell increasing percentages of zero-emission vehicles and from enforcing nitrogen oxide limits on heavy-duty vehicles. These votes challenge California's authority to set stricter pollution standards, a power granted under the Clean Air Act due to the state's history of severe air pollution. The actions are seen as a victory for fossil fuel companies and the trucking industry, while Democrats and public health advocates argue that California's waivers are crucial for reducing pollution and combating climate change.</p>

The study found that 92% of participants' stories about others chronicled karmic punishments, compared to 59% of their own experiences being rewarded for good deeds. Researchers suggest this tendency reflects attribution bias, where people attribute events in ways that make them feel good about themselves and justify others' suffering as deserved.</p>
