          <h2>South African Police Officials Accused of Interfering in Political Murder Investigations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 22:17:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A high-ranking South African police official has accused the country's police minister and other senior figures of obstructing investigations into political assassinations. Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi alleges interference to protect politically connected individuals and impede probes into organized crime, specifically claiming a task team was disbanded after uncovering links between drug cartels, politicians, police, and prosecutors. President Cyril Ramaphosa described the matter as a "grave national security concern," prompting calls from lawmakers across the political spectrum for an urgent parliamentary debate and an independent commission of inquiry. This internal conflict within law enforcement highlights deep-seated issues of corruption and integrity within the South African Police Service, amid a backdrop of high crime rates and a significant increase in targeted political killings, raising serious questions about the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Israel announced it launched airstrikes on Houthi targets in three Yemeni ports, including Hudaydah, Ras Isa, and Saif, following evacuation orders for civilians. Defence Minister Israel Katz confirmed the strikes, part of "Operation Black Flag," targeted a power station and the hijacked commercial ship Galaxy Leader, which Israel claimed was used for maritime monitoring. The Israeli military stated these strikes were in response to repeated Houthi attacks on Israel and its citizens, asserting the targeted ports facilitated Iranian weapon transfers for terror plans against Israel and its allies. Houthi-run media confirmed hits in Hudaydah, with the rebels stating their air defenses confronted the strikes, indicating an escalation of regional conflict.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old survivor, Callie McAlary, described the terrifying experience of catastrophic flash floods at Camp Mystic in Central Texas, where she prepared for the worst by putting on a name tag, fearing she might be swept away. Her mother, Tara Bradburn, praised the heroic actions of counselors and staff who helped save children amidst the rapidly rising "100-year historic flash flood," which came with little warning. The article highlights the emotional toll on survivors and families, with McAlary expressing deep concern and hope for the missing campers, many of whom she knew personally. This personal account underscores the suddenness and devastation of the natural disaster, and the profound impact on those who endured it.</p>

          <p>This personal essay explores the evolving communication between a sister and her quiet brother, who rarely spoke as a child. The author, who often spoke for him, describes their deep attunement and how his non-verbal cues felt like a language. Following shared family tragedies—the loss of their sister and father to suicide—her brother found his voice through learning guitar, expressing profound grief and yearning through music. The article reflects on how trauma can erase memory and how music became his unique, vast vocabulary, allowing him to communicate an intense inner world beyond words, while the sister learned to listen to his melodies.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Central Texas have resulted in at least 81 fatalities, with over 40 individuals still missing, primarily in Kerr County where the Camp Mystic children's summer camp was tragically inundated. The Guadalupe River rapidly rose to two-story heights, catching many by surprise, including hundreds at various summer camps. President Trump issued a major disaster declaration, and extensive search and rescue operations continue around the clock, utilizing air, boat, and ground teams to locate victims. Officials emphasize the unprecedented nature of the flood, which exceeded all forecasts, and the ongoing difficulty in accounting for all victims, especially those camping near the river, underscoring the immense scale of the catastrophe.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has been downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina, though concerns for flash flooding persist in the Carolinas and south-central Virginia. Forecasters predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches, prompting flood watches through Monday. While tropical storm warnings were canceled for portions of the two Carolinas, dangerous surf and rip currents are expected along the coast from northeastern Florida to the mid-Atlantic states for several days. Emergency management officials previously warned residents of isolated tornadoes along the coast and minor coastal flooding, urging drivers to avoid water-covered roads. The system is expected to continue weakening as it moves north-northeast.</p>

          <p>Following the devastating Texas flash floods that killed nearly 80 people, questions are being raised about whether adequate warnings and evacuations were provided. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly stated the severity was unexpected, while Governor Greg Abbott noted residents are accustomed to flash floods, but not a "water wall of almost 30ft high." The National Weather Service (NWS) defended its actions, citing timely flood watches and warnings, including an emergency alert for Kerr and Bandera Counties. However, budget cuts to NOAA and the NWS, along with vacant critical positions, have led to concerns about the accuracy of forecasting and coordination with local emergency managers, despite NWS assurances of adequate staffing.</p>

White House officials confirmed dozens of letters will be sent to countries without agreements, primarily focusing on nations with the largest trade deficits with the U.S., with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicting "a lot of deals very quickly." While the administration asserts it's applying "maximum pressure," experts suggest the complexity of trade deals might lead to further extensions of the tariff pause for some nations. This move follows a previous 90-day suspension of sweeping tariffs, with current 30% tariffs on Chinese imports remaining, impacting global financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

However, this ambitious endeavor faces substantial challenges due to complex state laws, time-consuming ballot access rules, and intense litigation from established Democratic and Republican parties. Experts highlight that each state has different, often difficult, requirements for party recognition, demanding significant financial investment and years of effort. While Musk's vast wealth could fund the initiative, campaign finance laws would limit his direct contributions once the party gains national recognition, making the formation of a truly national third party a multi-year project.</p>

This change, welcomed by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and the Miscarriage Association, aims to ensure individuals experiencing pregnancy loss at any stage are not forced back to work before they are ready to grieve. Currently, bereavement leave is only available for losses after 24 weeks or the death of a child under 18. The extended right will provide "at least" one week of leave, addressing a long-campaigned issue that acknowledges the often very significant emotional impact of early pregnancy loss on both parents.</p>

          <p>Despite a strong overall record, the Los Angeles Dodgers' recent series loss to the Houston Astros has exposed underlying performance and injury concerns. The team was outscored significantly in the sweep, marking their first three-game sweep at Dodger Stadium since 2008. Manager Dave Roberts remains outwardly unconcerned, prioritizing regular season wins, but the article highlights the team's near-.500 record against winning teams, which is problematic for playoff contention. An already crowded injured list, potentially growing with new issues for Teoscar Hernández and Tommy Edman, further complicates the team's outlook, raising questions about their depth and resilience as they approach the All-Star break.</p>

          <p>The looming expiration of a 90-day pause on Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs has already compelled companies to radically rethink their global supply chains. An Illinois toymaker, facing a massive increase in import taxes on Chinese goods, has begun shifting production to Vietnam and India, despite the significant costs and uncertainties involved in vetting new factories and ensuring smooth operations. Similarly, a Canadian fried chicken chain is limiting its menu at new stores due to increased costs for US-imported equipment caused by reciprocal tariffs. The article illustrates how businesses are adapting to the ongoing trade war by altering sourcing and production, leading to potential price increases for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harjinder Butoy, a former sub-postmaster who served 18 months in prison due to the faulty Post Office Horizon IT system, expressed his desire for accountability as the first part of the official inquiry's final report is due. His conviction for theft was overturned in 2021, 15 years after his imprisonment, leading to the loss of his business and home and significant health struggles. The Post Office scandal, considered one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice, saw thousands wrongly blamed and over 900 prosecuted. While over £1 billion has been paid in compensation, many victims, like Butoy, still await final payments and hope to see those responsible face criminal punishment.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after the 7/7 London bombings, this article assesses whether the UK is safer from terrorism, reflecting on missed intelligence opportunities that preceded the attacks. Former officials acknowledge the 7/7 failure prompted significant reforms, including closer MI5-police collaboration, increased funding, and a new "triage" system to prioritize threats. The introduction of the "preparing for acts of terrorism" offense allowed earlier interventions, exemplified by the foiled 2006 liquid bomb plot. However, the rise of self-radicalized "DIY" attackers and the emergence of far-right extremism present new, complex challenges. Legislation like "Martyn's Law" aims to improve public venue security, but the threat remains diverse and evolving.</p>

Toyota, in collaboration with Subaru and Mazda, also emphasizes the engines' hybrid-ready design and compatibility with alternative fuels.
