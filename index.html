          <p>Former President Donald Trump visited the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black in New York to support the U.S. team in their match against Europe. His presence was welcomed by some players, including top-ranked golfer Scottie Scheffler, who suggested it would provide a boost to the American squad. An avid golfer and owner of several courses, Trump's visit highlights his continued engagement with the sport, including his involvement in the ongoing merger talks between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the United Nations General Assembly with a defiant speech, vowing that Israel "must finish the job" against Hamas in Gaza despite growing international pressure. His address was met with a mass walkout by dozens of delegates from various nations, though the U.S. delegation remained. Netanyahu condemned recent recognitions of Palestinian statehood as encouraging terrorism and used his platform to assert Israel's position, even arranging to have his speech broadcast into Gaza via loudspeakers and mobile phones.</p>

          <p>European football's governing body, UEFA, is reportedly considering a suspension of Israel from its competitions, with a majority on its Executive Committee said to be in favor. The potential ban follows accusations of genocide against Israel by a UN-appointed expert group and intensive lobbying efforts, reportedly from Qatar. A suspension would exclude Israel's national team from World Cup qualifying and its clubs from European tournaments, increasing pressure on other international sports bodies like FIFA and the IOC to take similar action.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted former FBI Director James Comey on one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice. The charges stem from his 2020 Senate testimony regarding the FBI's investigation into Russian election interference and whether he had authorized leaks to the media. The indictment marks a significant development in President Trump's long-standing conflict with Comey, whom he fired in 2017, and raises concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department.</p>

For the system to be effective, it will likely need to be paired with stronger labor market enforcement, as similar ID systems in other European nations have not fully eliminated the problem.</p>

          <p>Subscribers to YouTube TV may soon lose access to all NBCUniversal channels, including NBC, Bravo, and USA, due to an ongoing carriage dispute. The current agreement between the two companies is set to expire at the end of the month, and they have so far failed to agree on new pricing terms. If a deal is not reached, it would result in a significant programming blackout for YouTube TV's roughly 10 million customers just as the fall television season gets underway.</p>

The match is a highly anticipated rematch of the 2014 final, which England won, and promises to be a competitive conclusion to the tournament.</p>

          <p>The Detroit Tigers are in the midst of a monumental late-season collapse, having lost a 9.5-game lead in the AL Central in just 16 days.

          <p>A disturbing trend has emerged in recent high-profile shootings where perpetrators leave written messages on their shell casings, magazines, and firearms. Experts analyze this as a "performative" act intended to broadcast a manifesto or signal allegiance to online extremist ideologies, ensuring their motives are widely discussed in the aftermath. This practice, which gained prominence after the 2019 Christchurch massacre, presents a new challenge for investigators and adds to the trauma for victims and their families.</p>

          <p>The ROAD to Housing Act, a bill that passed its Senate committee with unanimous support, signals a potential new federal role in tackling the U.S. housing shortage. The legislation proposes creating model zoning codes to encourage denser housing and providing financial incentives to municipalities that successfully increase their housing supply. Analysts see this as a step toward a "Right-to-Build Zone" concept, where federal guidance could help local governments overcome opposition to new construction and streamline development.</p>
