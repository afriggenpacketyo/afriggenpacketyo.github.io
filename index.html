        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A mother of three, Louise Gleadell, died from cervical cancer after the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust wrongly reported her screening results as negative in 2008 and 2012. An internal review in 2017 revealed the samples were inadequate, but neither Gleadell nor her family were informed. The trust admitted misreporting the results and awarded undisclosed damages to the family, acknowledging the "devastating consequences." Gleadell's sisters are now encouraging women to attend their cervical screening appointments.</p>

          <p>Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks minority owner, discussed his perspective on transgender athletes in women's sports, suggesting that trans inclusion should not be "pushed down people's throats." He emphasized meeting people where they are and allowing athletes to decide if they want to compete against transgender competitors. Cuban, typically a supporter of Democratic policies, joins other left-leaning figures in expressing concerns about the Democratic Party's stance on trans athlete inclusion. A recent survey indicated that the majority of Americans, including many Democrats, believe transgender athletes should not compete in women's sports.</p>

          <p>Two homeowners in the UK experienced drastically different outcomes after waking up to find Banksy artworks on their properties. Sam in Margate became the custodian of 'Valentine's Day Mascara,' which is expected to sell for over £1 million, with proceeds benefiting a domestic violence charity. Gert and Gary in Lowestoft, however, have spent around £450,000 preserving a Banksy seagull artwork, which has yet to be sold, and are frustrated with the challenges and costs involved. The BBC podcast 'The Banksy Story' explores the contrasting fates of these homeowners and the impact of Banksy's art on local communities.</p>

          <p>The United States has revoked visas for all South Sudanese passport holders due to South Sudan's refusal to accept its citizens being deported from the US. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the decision, citing the need for all countries to accept the return of their citizens in a timely manner. The move comes amid growing fears that South Sudan may again descend into civil war, with the US having previously ordered non-emergency staff to leave the country. This action is part of the Trump administration's broader policy of removing unlawful migrants and clashing with countries over deportations.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has placed an attorney, Erez Reuveni, on indefinite paid leave for failing to "zealously advocate" for the government's interests in a case involving a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Reuveni struggled to provide Judge Paula Xinis with details surrounding the deportation and the administration's inability to facilitate the man's return. Attorney General Pam Bondi emphasized that all DOJ attorneys are required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States, and any failure to do so will face consequences.

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imports marks a significant shift away from globalization and free trade, potentially harming the US economy. This move, which takes the US back a century in terms of protectionism, is based on the idea that high tariffs made America great in the past. However, economists argue that free trade and specialization benefit all countries involved. The long-term aim of Trump's policies is to eliminate the US trade deficit, which could lead to messy transitions and economic instability.</p>

Lammy stated that he has communicated to his Israeli counterparts that this is not an appropriate way to treat British Parliamentarians, and the Foreign Office has offered support to the affected MPs.</p>

Abrego Garcia, who had been granted protection from deportation, was sent to a prison in El Salvador despite a previous ruling.

          <p>DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has unveiled a new method to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as anticipation grows for the release of its next-generation model. The technique, developed in collaboration with Tsinghua University, combines generative reward modelling (GRM) and self-principled critique tuning. The resulting DeepSeek-GRM models have demonstrated competitive performance with existing methods. This development comes as DeepSeek prepares to launch its R2 reasoning model, building on the success of its cost-efficient R1 model.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Roki Sasaki delivered his best performance of the season in a 3-1 win against the Philadelphia Phillies, showcasing glimpses of his future star potential. Sasaki displayed improved command and used his splitter effectively, giving up just one run in four-plus innings. The Dodgers' offense provided enough support, and the bullpen contributed scoreless innings. Sasaki's improved performance could serve as a blueprint for the rest of his rookie season as he transitions from Japanese baseball to the major leagues.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student activist facing deportation, has accused the university of suppressing student dissent over Israel's war in Gaza and laying the groundwork for his arrest. Khalil, a green-card holder, is being targeted for deportation under a provision in federal immigration law that permits the state department to deport non-citizens considered a threat to US foreign policy. He claims that Columbia's leadership has suppressed student dissent under the auspices of combating antisemitism and has bowed to pressure from Congress to turn over student disciplinary records.</p>
