            <p>An Israeli military investigation has found "professional failures" in the killing of 15 Palestinian medics in Gaza last month, leading to the dismissal of a deputy commander. The investigation determined that soldiers mistakenly identified ambulances as belonging to Hamas militants due to poor visibility, despite the ambulances having flashing lights and visible logos. The incident involved troops bulldozing over the bodies and vehicles, burying them in a mass grave, which the investigation stated was not an attempt to conceal the event but to clear an evacuation route. While the military expressed regret, Palestinians and human rights groups have criticized the investigation as a whitewash, highlighting the broader issue of Israeli investigations into misconduct by its troops.

Abrego Garcia, accused of gang affiliation, was initially held in a notorious prison, and Van Hollen secured a meeting with him to ensure his safety and communicate with his family.

Instead, the author suggests focusing on data from companies driving consumer spending, capital investment, and employment, such as retailers, banks, and payroll companies.
