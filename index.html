        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the American food supply by the end of next year, contingent on an "understanding" with major food companies for voluntary removal. The FDA is looking to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and work with the food industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic dyes used in various food products, aiming to establish a national standard for transitioning to natural alternatives. While health officials cite studies linking these dyes to health conditions, scientists caution the evidence is not definitive, and the International Association of Color Manufacturers questions the proposed timeline. The Consumer Brands Association indicated its members would cooperate with the administration. Optimism score: 70</p>

          <p>Police chiefs in the UK will gain the authority to automatically dismiss officers who fail background checks, a measure aimed at bolstering public confidence in policing following a report on the Sarah Everard murder. This reform makes passing vetting checks a legal requirement for all serving officers, addressing situations where officers who fail vetting could remain on full pay despite being unable to perform public-facing duties. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper emphasized the necessity of these rules to remove officers who pose a risk or are unfit to serve, ensuring that only individuals of the highest standards wear the uniform. The changes come after a court ruling highlighted the difficulty in dismissing officers deemed unfit through the vetting process. Optimism score: 75</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump stated he has "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite previously criticizing him and expressing a desire for more active interest rate cuts. This announcement follows concerns that Trump was considering dismissing Powell, which had sparked market volatility.

          <p>The L.A. Zoo will temporarily suspend its elephant program and relocate its two remaining elephants, Billy and Tina, to the Tulsa Zoo in Oklahoma due to animal welfare concerns. The decision comes after decades of criticism from animal rights advocates regarding the size of the enclosure and past health issues. The zoo cited the need for elephants to live in larger social groups and the limited availability of Asian elephants as reasons for the relocation. Animal welfare organizations expressed mixed feelings, preferring a sanctuary over another zoo enclosure. Optimism score: 50</p>
