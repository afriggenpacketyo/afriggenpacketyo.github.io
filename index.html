          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 09:22:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eli Lilly reported a 45% surge in sales, driven by high demand for its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Mounjaro revenue reached $3.84 billion, a 113% increase year-over-year, while Zepbound generated $2.31 billion in sales. Despite the strong performance, Eli Lilly lowered its full-year profit guidance due to a $1.57 billion charge related to acquiring an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. CEO Dave Ricks discussed potential tariffs, noting the company is already investing in U.S. manufacturing and would like to see lower tax rates to incentivize domestic production.

          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has requested the Trump administration to immediately implement a "tariff exclusion process" to prevent a recession and avoid "irreparable harm" to small businesses.

          <p>House Republicans, joined by a few Democrats, voted to block California from implementing stricter clean air standards for trucks and a ban on gasoline-powered car sales by 2035. These votes challenge California's authority to set pollution standards tougher than federal ones, permitted under the 1970 Clean Air Act. Republicans argue that California's policies dictate national policy, while Democrats and public health advocates defend the waivers as critical for reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The measures now move to the Senate, where their fate is uncertain due to legal wrangling over the Congressional Review Act.</p>

          <p>North Carolina's Career and College Promise (CCP) program allows high school students, including undocumented immigrants, to earn college degrees for free. The dual enrollment program is a lifeline for first-generation Latino students, enabling them to get ahead and support their families. However, the Trump administration's anti-immigrant policies have created fear among students and educators, who worry about the program being targeted. Despite these concerns, advocates emphasize that helping immigrant students access higher education is not against the law and benefits the state's economy.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggests tariffs could lower or eliminate income taxes, but tax experts are skeptical. There is currently no tax bill in Congress to eliminate federal income taxes for those earning under $200,000. Experts argue tariffs won't generate enough revenue to replace income taxes and would disproportionately affect low- and middle-income Americans. The claim that tariffs can lower taxes is seen as replacing one tax with another, with different distributional effects. (not investment advice)</p>
