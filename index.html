          <p>The South Korean government announced it has successfully negotiated the release of approximately 300 of its citizens who were detained during a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia. The raid, part of the Trump administration's anti-immigration campaign, had strained diplomatic relations, prompting Seoul to dispatch officials to the U.S. to resolve the situation. A chartered flight is being arranged to bring the workers home once administrative procedures are complete, and South Korea plans to address visa access to prevent future incidents.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team achieved a record-breaking 342-run victory over South Africa in the third one-day international match. Young batsman Jacob Bethell scored his first professional century, an elegant 110 runs, supported by Joe Root who also made a hundred, propelling England to a total of 414-5. Bowler Jofra Archer then dismantled the South African batting lineup with a hostile spell, taking four wickets for just 18 runs. The dominant performance provided a significant morale boost for England, despite South Africa having already secured the series win.</p>

Speaking after a record Russian aerial assault on Kyiv, Zelenskyy emphasized that Putin avoids meeting with him but seeks encounters with U.S. presidents for propaganda purposes. He reiterated his call for increased pressure on Russia from the United States and European allies, particularly through halting the purchase of Russian energy, which he described as Putin's primary weapon.</p>

          <p>Joseph Naso, a convicted serial killer on California's death row, has reportedly confessed to a fellow inmate that he murdered 26 women, far more than the four for whom he was convicted. The new claims are detailed in an upcoming documentary, "Death Row Confidential," which features the inmate who spent over a decade building trust with Naso. This inmate compiled a 300-page dossier of clues and partial confessions, which has reportedly helped investigators link Naso to several cold cases. The revelations are prompting law enforcement to re-examine unsolved murders across the state.</p>

          <p>President Trump has intensified his rhetoric about sending federal forces to Chicago, sharing a social media post that referenced a "Department of WAR" and the "smell of deportations in the morning." While he later clarified he is not "going to war" but rather aiming to "clean up" the city, the threats have drawn sharp criticism from local and state leaders. This follows the deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles for similar purposes, a move that a federal court recently ruled was illegal. The Department of Homeland Security is reportedly preparing for a 30-day operation in the Chicago area.</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial criticizes President Trump's new approach to the "war on drugs," arguing it transforms a failed policy metaphor into a dangerous reality of military intervention. The piece points to a recent U.S. military strike that killed 11 alleged drug traffickers from Venezuela, warning that such actions set a precedent for extrajudicial killings without congressional or UN approval. The editorial contends that arbitrarily designating cartels as terrorists and launching military strikes is not only wrong but also counterproductive, as it will likely hinder international cooperation and fail to address the root causes of the drug trade.</p>

Massachusetts residents lead the nation, spending an average of $915 per person annually on lottery tickets, followed by Rhode Island at $573. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 a year, which may be related to fewer purchasing opportunities in rural areas.

Dr. Wright strictly avoids sugar, stating she can physically feel inflammation and "dullness in my brain" when she consumes it. Her anti-inflammatory approach to nutrition is a core component of the advice she provides through her lifestyle program, which aims to change how people experience the aging process.</p>

          <p>After multiple sightings since 2019, police in the Czech Republic have arrested a 51-year-old man for allegedly driving a Formula 1-style racing car on a public motorway. The distinctive red car, which resembles a Ferrari, was tracked to a property after a new video of it on the D4 motorway surfaced. The driver, still in his racing suit and helmet, was taken into custody for questioning. Because the driver's face was always obscured by a helmet in previous sightings, police had been unable to press charges, but he now faces fines and a possible license suspension.</p>

          <p>A recent study by River reveals that corporate adoption of Bitcoin has surged, with businesses purchasing an average of 1,755 BTC daily over the past 20 months. This sustained investment has reportedly added over $1.3 trillion to Bitcoin's market capitalization, with corporate-held reserves growing from 510,000 to 1.3 million BTC since January 2024. The trend, pioneered by companies like MicroStrategy, has expanded across various industries, with businesses now controlling over 6% of Bitcoin's circulating supply. Analysts suggest this institutional inflow could be a key driver for the cryptocurrency's future price movements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jarvis McKenzie, a Black man who was shot at and racially threatened in South Carolina, is publicly calling for the state to enact a hate crime law. South Carolina is one of only two states without such legislation, which limits the penalties for crimes motivated by bias. The alleged attacker was charged under a local county ordinance, but a statewide law would allow for more severe sentences. The incident has renewed pressure on the state's Republican-led senate, which has so far blocked a bill that has passed the house and is supported by business leaders and survivors of the 2015 Charleston church massacre.</p>

Stories of CEOs who started in call centers or on assembly lines may become a relic of the past as AI takes over foundational roles. Data from venture capital firm SignalFire shows a 50% decline in new hires with less than a year of experience at major tech firms between 2019 and 2024. While this trend presents challenges for recent graduates, some experts believe it will lead to a flatter organizational structure and upskill the workforce.</p>

The research, which looked at data spanning from the 1930s to the 1990s, examined nine disorders including depression, anxiety, and ADHD. The phenomenon, known as "spousal correlation," held true across different cultures and generations, suggesting that people with similar psychiatric conditions tend to form partnerships. Researchers theorize this could be due to shared understanding, similar environments, or the limiting effects of social stigma.</p>
