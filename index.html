            <p>An alleged MS-13 gang leader, Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos, is requesting a delay in the dismissal of his criminal case, despite the Justice Department's intention to deport him. Villatoro Santos fears immediate deportation to El Salvador's CECOT prison without due process, following a highly publicized arrest in Virginia. His attorney argues that he needs time to seek immigration counsel due to the risk of unlawful deportation and detention in harsh conditions. Attorney General Pam Bondi had previously identified Villatoro Santos as a top MS-13 leader. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>With escalating tariffs between Beijing and Washington, diplomatic backchannels may play a crucial role in bringing the leaders to the negotiating table. Despite announcing another tariff hike on Chinese imports, President Trump signaled he didn't expect further increases, suggesting China wants a deal but struggles with the approach. Observers suggest that these backchannels “might be the only way to go” to navigate the complex situation and de-escalate the trade war.

            <p>China's consumer prices fell in March as the trade war with the US intensified, with US President Donald Trump imposing a combined 125% in import duties on all Chinese goods. The national consumer price index (CPI) decreased by 0.1% year on year. The decline reflects the risk of deflation to the Chinese economy, with the trade war likely to intensify downward pressure on prices. However, the Chinese government is expected to launch a stimulus to boost domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

The law center is calling for an emergency order to cease the use of the generators and penalize xAI for violating the Clean Air Act.</p>
