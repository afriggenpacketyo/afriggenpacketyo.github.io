          <p>In an unconventional deal reportedly brokered by President Donald Trump, the U.S. government will receive 15% of the revenue from Nvidia and AMD's artificial intelligence chip sales to China. This agreement reverses a previous export ban, allowing the semiconductor giants to resume selling specific, less advanced chips to the significant Chinese market. The move has drawn criticism from national security experts who argue it could accelerate China's AI capabilities, while the administration claims it strengthens U.S. tech dominance. Meanwhile, China has raised its own security concerns about potential backdoors in the chips.</p>

          <p>China's ambassador to the United Nations, Fu Cong, has strongly condemned Israel's plan for a takeover of Gaza City, which would involve the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Speaking at the UN, Fu asserted that military solutions are not a viable path and called for an immediate ceasefire to save lives and secure the release of hostages. He emphasized that Gaza is an inalienable part of Palestinian territory and that any attempts to alter its population or structure must be firmly rejected, urging a return to the two-state solution.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are actively investigating the mystery of how life began on Earth, with two leading hypotheses centering on water-based environments. One theory suggests life originated in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, while another points to shallow tide pools. This focus on aquatic origins is also guiding the search for extraterrestrial life, with researchers exploring the potential of so-called "water worlds" like the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. The presence of abundant water is considered a key ingredient, making these locations prime targets for future scientific exploration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major Turkish football clubs, including Galatasaray and Fenerbahce, are spending record-breaking sums on international stars despite being burdened by massive debt. This lavish spending occurs as Turkey grapples with significant economic challenges like high inflation and unemployment. Some analysts suggest the government tacitly supports these high-profile signings as a form of "bread and circuses" to distract the public from economic hardship and maintain political control over the influential fan bases. Critics argue this model is unsustainable and highlights deep-seated issues between sports, politics, and finance in the country.</p>

In response to the tragedies, the Japanese Boxing Commission announced that all Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation title bouts will be reduced from 12 rounds to 10. The commission is now under significant pressure to implement further safety measures to protect fighters.</p>

Under the proposals, drivers over the age of 70 would be required to pass a compulsory eye test every three years to renew their license. The plan also aims to reduce the drink-driving limit to match the stricter standard already in place in Scotland. These measures follow a coroner's report that called the UK's current licensing system the "laxest in Europe" regarding eyesight standards.</p>

          <p>A large gorse fire that broke out on Arthur's Seat, a prominent landmark in Edinburgh, has been brought under control by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. The blaze spread rapidly across the hill in Holyrood Park on a busy Sunday afternoon, with smoke billowing over the city during its festival season. Four fire appliances were initially dispatched to the scene, and authorities urged the public to avoid the area. Fortunately, no casualties were reported from the incident, which follows several wildfire warnings issued during a warm and dry summer in Scotland.</p>

          <p>The extension of a fragile trade truce between the United States and China hangs in the balance as a key deadline approaches, stoking concerns that tensions could escalate once again. While Beijing has expressed optimism about prolonging the 90-day pause on certain tariffs, the Trump administration has not yet committed to an extension. Key points of friction include China's commitment to purchasing U.S. goods, semiconductor export controls, and potential secondary tariffs over Beijing's imports of Russian oil. The uncertainty reflects the ongoing structural decoupling and complex geopolitical environment between the two economic powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has stated that the club will have to sell captain Marc Guehi this summer to avoid losing him on a free transfer. The England international defender has entered the final year of his contract and appears unlikely to sign a new deal. The club reportedly rejected a £65 million offer from Newcastle in January but now faces the prospect of selling him for a potentially lower fee, with Liverpool said to be interested. Parish emphasized that for a player of Guehi's caliber, the situation requires a resolution through either a new contract or a sale.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has shrunk to approximately 450,000 personnel, a 20% decline over the past six years, primarily due to the country's critically low birth rate. With a rate of 0.75 babies per woman, the world's lowest, the nation faces a significant demographic crisis that directly impacts its national security. This reduction in troop numbers presents a challenge, as South Korea technically remains at war with North Korea and studies suggest a minimum of 500,000 soldiers are needed for effective defense. The situation has prompted debates about increasing the defense budget and potential changes to mandatory service.</p>

          <p>Scores of federal agents from the FBI and DEA were deployed across Washington D.C. on Sunday night, following President Donald Trump's promise of a swift crackdown on crime and homelessness in the capital. Trump stated on social media that homeless individuals must move out immediately and that there would be no "Mr. Nice Guy" in dealing with criminals. The increased federal presence has caused confusion and concern among some residents and homeless individuals, with the article noting that official data shows a decline in the city's violent crime rate.</p>

          <p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said that Beijing had misinterpreted his recent comments about the Philippines' inevitable involvement in a potential Taiwan conflict. After China accused him of "playing with fire," Marcos clarified that his statement was not about seeking war but about the practical reality that his country would have to evacuate over one hundred thousand Filipino citizens from Taiwan if a conflict erupted. He expressed perplexity at China's characterization of his remarks, stating they were used for propaganda purposes amid ongoing maritime tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Two blind women from Florida have reported a distressing experience with Southwest Airlines, stating they were the only two passengers on a flight from New Orleans to Orlando after the airline "forgot about" them. Following a nearly five-hour delay, they discovered that most other passengers had been rebooked onto an earlier flight from a different gate, but they were never informed of the change. The women argue that the airline failed to meet its legal requirement under the Air Carrier Access Act to provide effective communication for passengers with disabilities, highlighting a need for systemic improvement.</p>

          <p>The UK government is expanding its policy to deport foreign criminals before they can appeal the decision, adding 15 new countries to the scheme. Nations including Canada, India, and Australia now join the list, bringing the total to 23. The "deport now, appeal later" policy allows the Home Office to remove foreign nationals who have committed crimes, with any subsequent appeal hearings conducted via video link from their home country. The government states the expansion is designed to prevent criminals from exploiting the immigration system to delay their removal.</p>

          <p>While mature black holes are famously silent, this article explains that newly formed black holes are anything but, as they ring out with a strange, pure music. When a new black hole is created, the distortion of space-time it embodies quickly settles into a stable, mathematically perfect shape. This settling process radiates gravitational waves, akin to the vibrations of a ringing bell, which scientists can detect. This "music" provides a unique way to study these enigmatic objects in their wild youth before they become the introverted giants that let nothing escape.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has introduced a new national childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (US$501) annually for each child under the age of three. An analysis suggests this flat-rate subsidy will have a more pronounced positive effect in less affluent regions, where the amount represents a much larger percentage of average household income. For example, the handout equates to over 13.5% of an average resident's income in the poor province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in wealthy Shanghai. This policy could therefore provide a more significant boost to consumption and potentially birth rates in smaller cities and rural areas. (not investment advice)</p>
