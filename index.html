          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has canceled approximately $500 million in funding for 22 mRNA vaccine development projects. The terminated projects, primarily targeting COVID-19 and influenza, included proposals from major drugmakers like Pfizer and Moderna. Kennedy stated that the administration determined mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for respiratory viruses, a move heavily criticized by leading infectious disease experts who warn it leaves the nation vulnerable to future pandemics. The administration plans to redirect the funds to what it calls "safer, broader vaccine platforms."</p>

          <p>Lebanon's government has directed its army to create a plan by the end of the year to ensure that only state institutions possess weapons, effectively aiming to disarm the militant group Hezbollah. This decision follows significant pressure from the United States and is a key component of a November 2024 ceasefire agreement that ended major hostilities with Israel. The plan is scheduled for cabinet review by the end of August. However, Hezbollah has stated it will not disarm while facing ongoing Israeli attacks, creating a potential impasse in the fragile peace process.</p>

The chipmaker reported adjusted earnings of 48 cents per share on $7.69 billion in revenue. While demand for its data center CPUs and gaming GPUs was strong, the company's AI business revenue was impacted by U.S. export restrictions to China. CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in future AI revenue growth, highlighting the competitiveness of its new Instinct MI350 chips against rivals like Nvidia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from redirecting over $4 billion in FEMA funds intended for natural disaster mitigation projects. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge found that the states showed a likelihood of "irreparable harm" to flood-prone areas if the funds were repurposed. The injunction temporarily halts the reallocation while the court fully considers the states' legal challenge to the program's termination.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy has chosen to skip the St. Jude Championship, the first event of the PGA Tour's postseason, a decision that has raised concerns among tour organizers. Due to his high point accumulation during the season, McIlroy's position in the subsequent playoff events is secure, prompting discussions about potential rule changes to prevent top players from sitting out. A player director on the PGA Tour Policy Board expressed being "very concerned" by the move. Despite his absence from the first leg, McIlroy is expected to compete in the remaining two playoff tournaments and the Ryder Cup.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced it will expand its detention capacity by using the Miami correctional center in Indiana to hold 1,000 detainees. The move is part of a broader expansion of immigration jails under the Trump administration. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem dubbed the facility the "Speedway Slammer," echoing the controversial naming of a similar facility in Florida. Civil liberties groups have previously raised alarms about poor conditions at the Indiana prison, and critics are concerned about the use of state-run correctional facilities for immigration detention.</p>

The Taliban-led government has announced a shift to more costly underground mining to help preserve ancient Buddhist relics at the site. This development signals a major step forward for one of the world's largest untapped copper deposits, with significant economic implications for the region.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy, which had effectively closed the asylum system to most who entered the country illegally, was partially struck down because it did not allow for other humanitarian protections required by U.S. law. While the ruling reopens a pathway for migrants to request refuge, the administration is expected to continue detaining most asylum-seekers and could appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.

The escalation coincides with pauses in U.S. military aid to Ukraine and a significant ramp-up in Russian munitions production.

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District has established a "compassion fund" with a goal of raising $1 million to support students and families affected by federal immigration enforcement actions. The initiative aims to address acute hardships by providing funds for transportation, emergency housing, school essentials, and other urgent needs that create barriers to learning. Superintendent Alberto Carvalho announced the fund amid growing fears in immigrant communities that could impact school attendance. The effort is designed to create a safer, more supportive environment for the district's vulnerable populations as the new school year begins.</p>

          <p>Shares of real estate technology company Opendoor fell over 20% in after-hours trading following the release of its second-quarter earnings and a weak outlook for the current quarter. Despite a recent surge in investor interest, the company projected a significant revenue decline and a reduction in home acquisitions, citing a deteriorating housing market. CEO Carrie Wheeler acknowledged the challenges but highlighted a strategic shift toward a less capital-intensive referrals business. The results indicate that the company's turnaround is not yet gaining traction amid persistently high mortgage rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research from Rwanda reveals the crucial importance of social bonds between female mountain gorillas. A study based on 20 years of data showed that when a female gorilla moves to a new social group, she will actively seek out and join other females she already knows, even if they have been separated for years. This behavior highlights that these same-sex relationships provide significant social benefits, such as helping new arrivals navigate the group's hierarchy and avoid aggression. The findings offer new insights into the evolutionary roots of social decision-making and movement in great apes.</p>

          <p>This article explores the complexities of weather forecasting, explaining why predictions can sometimes be inaccurate despite significant technological advancements. It delves into the "chaotic" nature of the atmosphere, where tiny initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes, a concept known as the Butterfly Effect. The piece also discusses the difficulty of communicating vast amounts of data in a simple format and how public expectations have risen. Forecasters are now exploring new communication methods and leveraging AI, which promises greater accuracy but also presents new challenges in predicting unprecedented climate events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned two advertisements from the fashion retailer Zara, ruling that they were irresponsible for featuring models who appeared "unhealthily thin." The watchdog stated that specific poses, lighting, and clothing choices made the models look "gaunt" and emphasized "protruding" collarbones. Zara, which has since removed the images, said the models had provided medical certificates attesting to their good health. This ruling follows similar bans on ads from other major retailers, reflecting ongoing scrutiny of body image representation in the fashion industry.</p>

          <p>One of the UK's largest debt advisers, Money Wellness, is urging the government to introduce a statutory grant system in England to help low-income families with the high cost of school uniforms. Unlike Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, where support is standardized, only a small fraction of English councils offer dedicated grants, creating a "postcode lottery." With uniform costs averaging over £340 for primary school children, many families face significant financial strain. The call for consistent national support aims to ensure no child is disadvantaged based on their location.</p>

          <p>The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), a prominent UK think tank, has stated that Chancellor Rachel Reeves will need to increase taxes to avoid breaking her self-imposed borrowing rules. The analysis projects the government is on track to miss its debt reduction target by over £41 billion, due to weaker economic growth and scaled-back welfare cuts. Niesr suggests that a "moderate but sustained increase in taxes" is necessary to stabilize public finances. The warning puts the chancellor in a difficult position, caught between her fiscal rules and manifesto promises to avoid tax hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

Conversely, markets in the Northeast and Midwest, such as New York and Milwaukee, have seen prices climb due to more limited housing supply.
