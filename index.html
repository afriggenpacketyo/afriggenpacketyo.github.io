          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant downturn as Bitcoin's price dropped to $115,255.70, following a recent all-time high. This decline was largely driven by macroeconomic concerns, including higher-than-expected July wholesale inflation data, which raised doubts about a September Federal Reserve rate cut. The market saw over $500 million in forced selling of long positions, with over 131,000 traders liquidating assets, pushing prices lower. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's clarification on the strategic bitcoin reserve, limiting it to forfeited bitcoin, also added to investor disappointment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swiss watchmaker Swatch has issued an apology and removed a promotional image globally after it sparked widespread accusations of racism on Chinese social media. The advertisement featured an Asian male model making a "slanted eye" gesture, leading to public outrage and calls for a boycott of Swatch Group brands. Despite the apology, many online users remained unsatisfied, demanding further accountability and criticizing the company's response. This incident highlights the ongoing challenges Western luxury brands face in navigating cultural sensitivities within the crucial Chinese market.</p>

          <p>Javon Riley, 33, has been found guilty for his involvement in a gangland shooting in Hackney that left a nine-year-old girl with life-changing head injuries. The girl was an innocent victim caught in a feud between rival Turkish gangs, hit by one of six bullets fired from a passing motorbike. Riley was also convicted of attempting to murder three men targeted in the attack. The girl's mother expressed profound grief, stating her daughter's future was "torn away," now living with a titanium plate and a bullet fragment in her brain.</p>

The patient suffered severed cervical vertebrae and damaged neurovascular structures, yet miraculously, the spinal cord remained intact despite severe contusions. This complex and unprecedented case, where the patient survived such extensive injuries, has no known precedent in medical literature globally. The successful surgery offers a beacon of hope for extreme trauma cases.</p>

Trump also claimed there would be "no getting back" the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Moscow in 2014. These remarks follow Trump's summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, where he shifted from demanding a ceasefire to calling for a permanent peace deal. Zelenskyy, despite ongoing deadly Russian attacks, reiterated his call for effective security guarantees from allies.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, has re-strengthened to a Category 4 storm, with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. While not expected to make direct landfall in the U.S., the storm is forecast to bring "life-threatening surf and rip currents" to the U.S. East Coast this week. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for Turks and Caicos and the southeast Bahamas. Forecasters anticipate Erin will remain a large and dangerous major hurricane through mid-week, with North Carolina's Outer Banks advised to monitor for strong winds and flooding.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Giants center fielder Jung Hoo Lee delivered an extraordinary play, making what commentators hailed as the "catch of the decade" during a 7-1 win over the Tampa Bay Rays. Lee tracked a ball hit by Yandy Diaz, sliding and somehow securing it between his legs after it appeared to careen off his glove. The unusual yet spectacular catch became a major highlight in the baseball world, leaving his manager concerned he was injured but ultimately celebrating the unique play.

          <p>The "great resignation" trend has evolved into "job hugging," where workers are holding onto their current positions due to stagnation and uncertainty in the labor market. Consultants at Korn Ferry describe this as a stark contrast to previous job-hopping rates, reflecting low hiring, quits, and layoff rates. This shift is attributed to economic, political, and global uncertainties, making workers hesitant to seek new employment. While offering stability, "job hugging" can also pose risks, such as sacrificing potential earnings growth and limiting skill development, particularly as job growth slows.</p>

This has sparked opposition from Native American tribes and environmentalists concerned about permanent landscape scarring, water contamination, and disturbance to sacred sites. Modern gold extraction methods, involving massive pits and chemicals like cyanide, cause irreversible changes to the land. While proponents highlight economic benefits and job creation, critics argue that the long-term environmental and cultural impacts outweigh the short-term gains. (not investment advice)</p>
