          <p>Federal agents shot a woman in a Chicago suburb after their vehicles were allegedly rammed and boxed in by ten cars. The Department of Homeland Security initially reported the incident in Broadview but later stated it occurred in Brighton Park, leading to conflicting accounts with Chicago police. DHS accused the woman of doxxing agents and posting threats, though no corroborating information was released, while Chicago police clarified their limited role in the federal investigation. The incident highlights escalating tensions surrounding ICE operations in the area.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) has installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, marking a historic moment for the predominantly white denomination. Curry, who previously led the Metropolitan Chicago Synod, begins a six-year term with goals of fostering a more connected, welcoming, and thriving church. His election comes as the ELCA, like other mainline Protestant denominations, grapples with declining membership and theological debates over LGBTQ+ inclusion.

          <p>Thousands of people participated in a banned Pride march in Pecs, Hungary, defying a police prohibition on LGBTQ+ rallies. This act of defiance protests Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ultra-conservative government, which recently passed a law allowing such bans under the guise of 'protecting children.' European Parliament members joined the demonstrators, who waved rainbow and EU flags, condemning the government's restrictions on fundamental human rights. The article notes this is part of ongoing protests against Orban's policies.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker criticized the Trump administration's plan to federalize 300 Illinois National Guard members, calling it an 'outrageous and un-American' ultimatum. The White House justified the deployment by citing 'violent riots and lawlessness' that local leaders allegedly failed to quell, particularly near the Broadview ICE facility where a woman was recently shot. Pritzker asserts there is no need for military troops and views the move as a manufactured performance for control, not public safety.

          <p>Cassandra Peterson, known as Elvira, has reaffirmed her criticism of Ariana Grande's alleged rude behavior from a past encounter, nearly a year after first speaking out. Peterson found Grande's apology, which cited an anxiety attack, unimpressive and hopes the singer will learn humility over time. The incident, which involved Grande reportedly refusing a photo after Peterson accommodated her 20 guests, adds to long-running 'diva' rumors surrounding the pop star. The article explores Grande's past defenses against such accusations.</p>
