        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump's federalization of the California National Guard was illegal and ordered him to return control to Governor Newsom. The judge issued a temporary restraining order, but stayed its effect until Friday afternoon to allow the Trump administration to appeal. Trump had federalized 4,000 Guard members and mobilized 700 Marines in response to Los Angeles protests against federal immigration enforcement. The judge stated that Trump's actions exceeded his statutory authority and violated the Tenth Amendment, setting a dangerous precedent for future domestic military activity, further scheduling a hearing for June 20 to consider a preliminary injunction against Trump's actions. Optimism score is proportional with the reality of the situation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from deploying the California National Guard in Los Angeles, ordering President Trump to return control to Governor Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer found that California officials are likely to succeed in their challenge to the president's decision to federalize the National Guard. The judge stated that Mr. Trump circumvented Newsom when he called the California National Guard into federal service, and therefore did not follow the procedural requirement laid out by Congress. The Justice Department swiftly notified the court it is appealing the order. The summary is proportional with the reality of the situation.</p>

          <p>Official campaigning for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election commenced, drawing attention as a prelude to this summer's House of Councillors race. With no party holding a majority in the assembly, the focus is on whether Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party can retain its seats. Parties are aggressively using social media to appeal to voters, addressing issues such as rising living costs and political funding scandals. Approximately 300 candidates are competing in the election. The summary is proportional with the reality of the situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies will continue to press ahead with their overseas expansion with or without a long-term agreement on trade tariffs, as production abroad holds the key to their long-term survival, according to executives at China‚Äôs largest solar industry exhibition. Although the US and China reached a 90-day truce in their ongoing tariff war in May, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US are still subject to tariffs of as much as 3,521 per cent, with Washington citing unfair trade practices such as subsidies and dumping for the high levies.

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are increasingly focusing on overseas expansion to ensure survival amid ongoing trade tariffs, with production abroad seen as key to their long-term viability. Despite a temporary truce in the US-China tariff war, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US remain subject to tariffs. Chinese firms are diversifying their production base, with planned expansions primarily in the Middle East and Africa, followed by the US and Europe. Some executives express concerns that exports could become impossible if tariffs rise significantly. The summary is proportional with the reality of the situation.</p>
