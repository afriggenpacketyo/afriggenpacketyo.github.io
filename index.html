          <p>The UK is set to sign an agreement with Mauritius, transferring sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. The deal allows the US and UK to continue operating a strategically important military base on Diego Garcia for 99 years, with a potential 40-year extension, in exchange for multi-billion pound payments from Britain. Mauritius was separated from the archipelago in 1965, and has long claimed the islands were illegally taken as part of a deal for independence in 1968. Defence Secretary John Healey has emphasized the importance of the Diego Garcia base to UK and US security interests.</p>

The budget package faces opposition from both fiscal conservatives seeking deeper spending cuts and blue-state Republicans concerned about the state and local tax deduction cap.

          <p>Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson rescinded the agency's strategic plan, citing a lack of connection to FEMA's mission, less than two weeks before hurricane season. Richardson intends to develop a new strategy tying directly to FEMA's essential tasks and has also eliminated the agency's Office of Resilience Strategy. Critics argue that these moves will leave FEMA operating in triage mode rather than mitigating future damage. This decision follows an internal presentation noting that FEMA is not ready for the hurricane season due to culture issues, staffing shortages, and coordination problems.</p>

He asserts that the Trump administration believes it has extraordinary plenary power and that the courts should be more deferential to the president's political judgment. Vance's comments reflect the White House's stance that the president has the authority to enact immigration policies, regardless of court rulings.</p>

Instead of focusing on killing mosquitoes with insecticides, the Harvard University team has identified a pair of drugs that can successfully eliminate malaria parasites within the insects. The aim is to coat bed nets with these drugs, allowing mosquitoes to absorb them through their legs. With insecticide resistance increasing, this new method offers a promising alternative for reducing malaria transmission.</p>

A Cambridge University study found that alternative scanning methods, such as enhanced mammograms and fast MRI scans, could significantly increase the number of cancers detected in women with very dense breasts. Dense breasts make it harder to spot cancers using traditional mammograms. The study suggests that implementing these additional scans could identify 3,500 extra cancers per year and potentially save 700 lives.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration defended its controversial tariffs before a trade court in New York, arguing that removing the levies would "completely kneecap" the US president amid trade talks with China. The lawsuit challenges whether Trump's use of a "national emergency" under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act was legally justified to support the tariffs. The administration argued that the president’s emergency declarations were not subject to judicial review because the matter is a “political question” and only the US Congress could intervene.</p>
