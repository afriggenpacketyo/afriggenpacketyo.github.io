          <p>The Trump administration has formally notified 21 countries of new tariffs, ranging from 20% to 40%, set to take effect on August 1. The notifications were sent in letters to leaders in Asia, Africa, and Europe, including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and several others. President Trump stated the new rates are necessary to address trade deficits, a view many economists dispute. This action follows a 90-day pause on previously announced global tariffs and signals a renewed commitment to an aggressive trade policy, creating uncertainty in global markets.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Christian Horner's removal as Red Bull's team principal was the culmination of long-term internal turmoil, not just a sudden decision. The article details a power struggle following the death of Red Bull's co-owner, which led to the departure of key figures like designer Adrian Newey and sporting director Jonathan Wheatley. Horner's leadership was further strained by allegations of misconduct, controversial driver decisions, and the team's declining performance, with star driver Max Verstappen's future also in question. These combined factors ultimately made his position untenable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department has imposed new restrictions on visitor visas for Nigerian citizens, reducing the validity from a five-year, multiple-entry visa to a single-entry visa valid for only three months. This change affects non-immigrant and non-diplomat travel categories. The move is part of a broader review of visa reciprocity and follows President Trump's directive banning entry for citizens of several other African nations. Nigerian officials noted they do not have a similar restrictive policy for U.S. citizens, raising concerns about diplomatic and trade relations.</p>

The world number one did not have his serve broken and displayed a crisp returning game throughout the victory.

          <p>A man and two children, aged four and seven, were killed after record-breaking flash floods swept through the village of Ruidoso, New Mexico. The flooding was caused by intense monsoonal rains falling on burn scars from previous wildfires, causing the Rio Ruidoso to crest at an unprecedented 20 feet. Emergency crews rescued over 65 people, with some found in trees or trapped in their homes, and an estimated 35 to 50 homes were damaged or destroyed. Officials have issued further flood watches for the area as the threat of more rain continues.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against California's education department and a state sports organization, alleging their policies on transgender athletes violate federal civil rights laws. The complaint argues that allowing transgender girls to compete in girls' sports eviscerates equal opportunities and creates a hostile environment for female athletes. This legal action follows threats from the Trump administration after a transgender student won two state track-and-field events. The administration contends that California's policies, which allow participation based on gender identity, are unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz is facing criticism for actions taken just before deadly floods devastated his home state of Texas. The article reports that Cruz ensured a Republican spending bill cut $150 million from a NOAA fund for improving weather forecasting research and systems. This occurred shortly before a flash flood in central Texas killed over 100 people, a disaster critics argue was exacerbated by inadequate forecasting and warnings. Cruz, who was also reportedly on vacation in Greece as the disaster unfolded, has defended his actions and dismissed the criticism as partisan.</p>

          <p>This personal essay describes the fears of a mother whose 7-year-old daughter, Izzy, has a rare chromosomal anomaly and relies on a robust support system of special-education services. The author expresses deep concern over the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the Department of Education and cut Medicaid, which funds many of these essential school-based services. She argues that these cuts threaten the progress of millions of students with disabilities by removing the teachers and therapists who are crucial for their development. The author frames this support network as a form of shared mothering, essential for both her daughter and her own ability to parent effectively.</p>

          <p>President Trump's intensified efforts to influence monetary policy are raising concerns about the credibility of his future nominee for Federal Reserve chair. The article suggests that any successor to current chair Jerome Powell could be perceived as being appointed solely to enact Trump's demands for interest rate cuts, undermining the Fed's traditional political independence. Trump is reportedly even considering naming a "shadow chair" to pressure the Fed in the near term, a move that could create institutional challenges and market uncertainty by linking rate decisions to government debt costs rather than economic data.

          <p>Colorado State University researchers are forecasting an above-average Atlantic hurricane season for 2025, with 16 named storms, eight of which are expected to become hurricanes. Three of these are predicted to reach major hurricane status (Category 3 or higher). The forecast attributes the heightened activity primarily to warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures, though less extreme than last year. While there is still uncertainty regarding the El Niño-Southern Oscillation cycle, the likely absence of a strong El Niño suggests conditions will be more conducive to storm formation this year.</p>

          <p>CIA Director John Ratcliffe has released a report reviewing the "analytic tradecraft" used in the 2016 intelligence assessment on Russian election interference. Ratcliffe claims the review proves that Obama-era officials manipulated intelligence to target Donald Trump, a charge the report itself does not explicitly support. The document does critique the process, noting a short timeline and unusual involvement from top leaders. However, it does not refute the core findings of Russian interference, which have been validated by other inquiries, including a bipartisan Senate report, leading to accusations that the new review is politically motivated.</p>

Past state-level immigration crackdowns have resulted in significant labor shortages and economic losses, casting doubt on the viability of the plan. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision formally rests with the Assembly of Experts but is heavily influenced by Khamenei and the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

This practice is described by legal experts as a flagrant violation of international law, moving beyond military necessity to the destruction of entire neighborhoods. The piece argues that this outsourcing, along with restrictions on journalists, helps obscure the scale of what is happening on the ground.</p>
