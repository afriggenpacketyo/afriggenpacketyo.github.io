          <p>Jim Lovell, the astronaut renowned for commanding the perilous Apollo 13 mission and safely guiding its crew back to Earth in 1970, has passed away at the age of 97. NASA and his family remembered him for his unshakable optimism and for turning a potential catastrophe into one of the space agency's most celebrated successes. As the first person to fly to the Moon twice, Lovell became an American hero, famously portrayed by Tom Hanks in the film "Apollo 13," yet he never had the chance to walk on the lunar surface. His long and distinguished career included service in the U.S. Navy and roles on the Gemini and other Apollo missions.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska next week to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The discussions may involve territorial concessions, with reports suggesting a proposal where Russia would retain the Donbas region and Crimea in exchange for withdrawing from other occupied areas. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that while he is ready for a lasting peace, any solution made without Ukraine's involvement would be against peace, and his country will not cede land to occupiers. The meeting marks the first direct talks between the two leaders since Russia's full-scale invasion.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that his country will not "give their land to occupiers" following President Trump's suggestion that a peace deal could involve "swapping of territories." As Trump prepares to meet with Putin in Alaska, Zelenskyy emphasized that any decisions made without Ukraine's participation would be counterproductive to achieving a genuine and lasting peace. His comments underscore the deep divisions and high stakes involved in the upcoming talks, as Ukraine maintains that its constitutional sovereignty is non-negotiable. The Ukrainian leader reiterated his readiness to work with partners but only on solutions that respect his nation's integrity.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has confirmed that key midfielder Rodri has suffered an injury setback and is not expected to be fully fit until after the September international break. The Spanish international, who was the 2024 Ballon d'Or winner, had just returned from a major ACL injury sustained last season. This new issue, believed to be a groin problem, occurred during a Club World Cup match over the summer. The news is a blow to the team as they navigate the start of the new season without one of their most influential players.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The planned meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska is framed by starkly different objectives for ending the war in Ukraine. Trump seeks a significant diplomatic victory, aiming for at least a ceasefire and potentially a three-way meeting with President Zelenskyy to bolster his image as a dealmaker. Conversely, Putin's goals likely include preventing Ukraine's NATO membership, securing permanent control over captured territories, and installing a Russia-friendly government in Kyiv. The primary points of contention will be the status of Ukraine's borders and its potential military alliances, making a mutually agreeable long-term solution highly challenging.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses are preparing for their upcoming match against France, viewing it as a critical step in their journey towards the Women's Rugby World Cup final. Wing Abby Dow described the team's mindset as climbing "Everest," an analogy reinforced by a talk from a mountaineer who summited the peak. The team is focused on learning from their narrow Six Nations victory over the same opponent, where they nearly let a large lead slip. Head coach John Mitchell has emphasized that the priority is performance over simply extending their 26-match winning streak, as they build towards their ultimate goal in September.</p>

          <p>A DeKalb County police officer was killed and the suspected shooter is dead following an active shooter incident near the CDC headquarters and Emory University in Atlanta. The officer, David Rose, was fatally shot while responding to reports of gunfire and was later pronounced dead at a hospital. The suspect was found deceased from what may have been a self-inflicted gunshot wound after exchanging fire with police. While no civilians were shot, the incident prompted a campus-wide shelter-in-place order and caused damage to the CDC building, where 92 children were in a daycare at the time.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in Southern California, named the Canyon Fire, has grown rapidly to nearly 5,400 acres, forcing evacuation orders for thousands of residents near the border of Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Igniting on Thursday, the blaze was fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions, though favorable weather overnight allowed firefighters to achieve 28% containment. One firefighter sustained major injuries when their truck rolled down a hillside while battling the flames. With temperatures forecast to remain high, authorities are urging residents in nearby communities like Santa Clarita to remain on high alert as the fire continues to pose a threat.</p>

The key moment came when Mookie Betts hit a go-ahead two-run homer off Scherzer in the fifth inning, breaking a scoreless tie.

          <p>The European Union's recent sanctioning of an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude has introduced a new dynamic into its trade relationship with New Delhi. However, experts suggest this move is largely symbolic and that the greater pressure on India comes from the threat of significant U.S. tariffs on Indian goods. This complex geopolitical situation could paradoxically strengthen the EU-India partnership, as India may be more motivated to finalize a long-delayed free trade agreement with the EU to diversify its economic ties. The EU is seen as understanding India's political sensitivities, particularly in agriculture, better than the current U.S. administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has reformed its prestigious civil service summer internship program to exclusively accept applicants from lower socio-economic backgrounds, sparking a debate among students. The change is intended to make the civil service more representative of the broader population and improve decision-making. Some students from working-class families who now qualify have praised the move, saying it gives them a fair chance against more privileged peers. However, other students from state schools and modest backgrounds, whose parents' occupations fall just outside the new "working class" criteria, feel unfairly excluded and deflated by the new rules.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully synthesized high-purity hexagonal diamonds, a rare variant first discovered in a meteorite in 1967. This type of diamond, which has a distinct atomic structure compared to common cubic diamonds, was long believed to form only under the extreme pressure and heat of a meteorite impact. Publishing their findings in the journal Nature, the researchers detailed how they created macroscopic crystals of the material, a feat that had eluded previous international efforts which often resulted in mixed or impure samples. This breakthrough provides definitive proof of the material's existence and opens new possibilities for advanced material science.</p>

          <p>China's consumer price index (CPI) showed no year-on-year change in July, indicating persistent weak domestic demand within the world's second-largest economy. This flat reading narrowly avoided deflation and was slightly better than market forecasts, with the National Bureau of Statistics attributing the result to policies aimed at expanding domestic demand. While consumer goods prices fell by 0.4%, this was offset by a 0.5% rise in service prices. The data, combined with ongoing producer price deflation, suggests that China's post-pandemic economic recovery continues to face significant headwinds and has not yet achieved stable momentum.

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is on the rise, as people spend on everything from small pick-me-ups like lipstick to major experiences like concert tours to boost their morale during uncertain economic times. This phenomenon, an evolution of the classic "lipstick effect," sees consumers making everyday sacrifices to afford moments of joy, whether it's a new home accessory or a high-priced ticket to see Taylor Swift. Analysts note that with traditional life milestones like home ownership becoming less attainable for many, people are instead celebrating smaller "inch-stones" and investing in experiences that provide an immediate sense of well-being and enrichment.

          <h2>Chinese Authorities' Response to Chikungunya Outbreak Draws Comparisons to COVID-19 Tactics</h2>

          <p>China's public health response to a recent chikungunya outbreak is raising concerns due to its similarity to the stringent measures used during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mosquito-borne illness has prompted authorities to implement intrusive actions, such as task forces forcibly entering homes to eliminate stagnant water where mosquitoes breed. In one reported incident, officials insisted on taking a blood sample from a child with a fever despite parental refusal. These heavy-handed tactics have sparked public complaints and debate over whether the response is proportional to the threat posed by the disease, which is typically less severe than COVID-19.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is demanding a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and has suspended $584 million in federal research grants. The move follows a Department of Justice investigation that concluded UCLA was "deliberately indifferent to a hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli students" during campus protests in the spring of 2024. University and state officials have condemned the action as an unprecedented attack on academic freedom and a form of extortion that would devastate the public university system. This marks a significant escalation in the administration's targeting of universities over alleged civil rights violations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reportedly signed a secret directive authorizing the Pentagon to use military force against Latin American drug cartels, which his administration has designated as terrorist organizations. According to reports, the order provides a legal basis for direct military operations on foreign soil and at sea, an unprecedented escalation in U.S. strategy in the region. The move has prompted concern in Mexico about potential unilateral U.S. military action. This directive aligns with Trump's focus on combating drug trafficking organizations, including five powerful Mexican cartels that were labeled as foreign terrorist groups by the State Department in February.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration agents conducted two separate raids outside a Home Depot in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, detaining multiple day laborers in a single day. Critics and immigrant advocates argue the operations may violate a recent court order that prohibits agents from using racial profiling or targeting individuals based on their location without reasonable suspicion. The action, which involved unmarked vans, has been described as a clear violation of the temporary restraining order. A U.S. Border Patrol chief defended the raids, stating that agents always act legally and were targeting known criminal activity, not conducting an indiscriminate sweep.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and other prominent state Democrats hosted Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled their state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan. At the event in Sacramento, Newsom declared that California would take emergency measures to "nullify what happens in Texas" by pushing its own redistricting plan to increase Democratic seats if the GOP plan proceeds. This meeting highlights a deepening political battle over congressional maps, with California leaders vowing to "fight fire with fire." The Texas Democrats have been staying in various blue states to deny their home legislature a quorum, prompting Texas Republicans to seek arrest warrants.</p>

          <p>Almond growers across Central California are facing a massive rat infestation that has spread across more than 100,000 acres of orchards, causing significant economic damage. The rodents are burrowing under trees, damaging root systems, consuming nuts, and destroying irrigation equipment, with estimated losses ranging from $109 million to $311 million. According to the Almond Board of California, some growers have reported devastating crop losses and have had to replace entire irrigation systems. Farmers are employing various strategies like baiting, trapping, and fumigation to combat the surging pest population, which threatens a key state industry.</p>

He would then return "dummy books" with forged labels in their place, according to an FBI affidavit. Ying was arrested before an alleged attempt to flee to China, and investigators believe he may have been traveling to sell the stolen manuscripts abroad.</p>
