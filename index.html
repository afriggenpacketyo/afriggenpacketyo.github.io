          <p>The Powerball jackpot has soared to an estimated $1.7 billion for Saturday night's drawing, after no tickets matched the winning numbers for Wednesday's $1.4 billion grand prize. This colossal sum, with an estimated cash value of $770.3 million before taxes, would become the third-largest in U.S. lottery history, trailing only two previous Powerball jackpots. The current run of 41 consecutive drawings without a winner ties a game record, with the upcoming drawing marking the 42nd. As ticket sales intensify, there's a possibility Saturday's prize could climb even higher, captivating hopeful players nationwide. The daunting odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he is "giving serious thought" to stripping actress and comedian Rosie O’Donnell of her U.S. citizenship, a move he has threatened in the past but cannot legally carry out. The 14th Amendment of the Constitution guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the U.S., and O’Donnell was born in New York. This declaration is the latest development in a nearly two-decade-long feud between the two public figures, which began with O'Donnell's criticism of Trump in 2006. O'Donnell, who has Irish grandparents, recently moved to Ireland and is seeking dual citizenship, citing the current political climate as her motivation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets mostly saw gains on Thursday, tracking an overnight tech rally on Wall Street that propelled the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite higher. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 1.56%, primarily driven by domestic tech stocks, including SoftBank Group. However, shares of Kyoto-based Nidec Corp plunged significantly after the company announced a probe into allegations of improper accounting. The broader market sentiment remains influenced by growing fears around the economy and ongoing global bond market pressures. Traders are also assessing the fate of President Trump's trade tariffs after a federal court recently deemed most of them illegal, adding a layer of uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Nidec Corp, a prominent Japanese electronics components manufacturer, plummeted as much as 22.44% on Thursday, marking its largest one-day drop. This significant decline followed the company's announcement of an independent third-party committee probe into allegations of improper accounting within its Chinese subsidiary, Nidec Techno Motor. An internal investigation revealed multiple documents suggesting potential malpractice, possibly with the involvement or knowledge of management across the company and its group. Nidec had previously delayed its financial report submission due to "potentially erroneous declarations" regarding country of origin for certain motors, which may have resulted in unpaid import tariffs.

          <p>France is currently grappling with unexpected political and fiscal instability, leading economists to draw unfavorable comparisons to Italy's historical periods of upheaval. Persistent infighting among France's main political parties and unresolved arguments over the 2026 budget have contributed to a rapid succession of prime ministers in recent years. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou has called a confidence vote for September 8th, aiming to pass a contentious budget that includes around 44 billion euros in cuts. Failure to win this vote would likely result in another government collapse, necessitating the appointment of a fifth Prime Minister in less than two years and raising material concerns about France's debt sustainability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally petitioned the Supreme Court to swiftly reverse an appeals court ruling that declared most of the president's tariffs an illegal use of emergency powers. Solicitor General D.

However, small businesses, battered by tariffs and economic uncertainty, have twice prevailed in lower courts, advocating for a prompt resolution. This case places a centerpiece of Trump's trade policy before the Supreme Court, raising fundamental questions about the balance of presidential authority and congressional power over tariffs.</p>

          <p>Victims of Jeffrey Epstein shared emotional accounts of sexual abuse on the steps of the US Capitol, urgently calling for lawmakers to release more files related to the convicted sex offender. One accuser, Lisa Phillips, announced that the group has begun confidentially compiling a list of Epstein associates who they allege were involved in abuse, created by and for survivors. The event highlighted ongoing calls for transparency from the Department of Justice, with victims expressing fear of repercussions if they publicly named individuals themselves. Marina Lacerda, speaking publicly for the first time, detailed her abuse from ages 14 to 17, describing it as "the worst nightmare."</p>

          <p>Former Republican Senator John E. Sununu is seriously exploring a bid to return to the Senate in his home state of New Hampshire, with senior White House officials reportedly giving their blessing. The influential figure, part of the Sununu political dynasty, is seen as a top recruit for Republicans ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, as Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen is not seeking re-election. Sununu, who served one term in the 2000s before losing in 2008, stated he will "seriously consider a run" and aims to appeal broadly across the political spectrum. He faces a potential GOP primary challenge from Scott Brown and State Sen. Dan Innis.</p>

          <p>A bizarre and unfortunate sequence of events unfolded in Los Angeles when an ambulance, transporting a patient from an earlier car crash, was struck by another vehicle. This initial collision occurred at 9:06 a.m. in Reseda. Even more remarkably, a battalion chief arriving at the scene to investigate the first crash was subsequently involved in another collision at the very same intersection just 40 minutes later. Fortunately, no Fire Department personnel were injured in either incident, though the patient in the ambulance sustained minor injuries. Police and fire officials are now actively investigating the causes of these back-to-back collisions.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Ronny Jackson of Texas announced that the Navy has reinstated his retired rank of rear admiral, overturning a 2022 demotion. The demotion followed a Pentagon inspector general investigation into his behavior as a White House physician, which alleged "sexual and denigrating" comments about a female subordinate and alcohol policy violations. Jackson, who served under Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump, vehemently denied the allegations, claiming he was subject to a "political hit job." This decision aligns with a recent trend of the Pentagon offering benefits and consideration to Trump supporters, including military funeral honors for Ashli Babbitt, a rioter killed on January 6th.</p>

          <p>A controversial Texas bill, which would allow residents to sue out-of-state abortion pill providers for up to $100,000, has advanced to Governor Greg Abbott's desk. This measure aims to enforce the state's abortion ban by targeting providers who comply with laws in their own states, with critics decrying it as an effort to intimidate and encourage vigilantism. The bill includes provisions protecting women who receive pills for their own use and explicitly bars men who committed sexual assault from suing. If signed into law, it is expected to face immediate legal challenges, potentially impacting "shield laws" enacted in Democratic-led states to protect medical providers.</p>

          <p>A long-lost 18th-century Italian painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, which was looted by the Nazis during the Second World War, has been successfully recovered in Argentina. The artwork, valued at approximately $50,000, belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker before his extensive collection was stolen after his death in 1940. The painting was discovered last month after being spotted in an online real estate listing belonging to a daughter of Friedrich Kadgien, a Nazi lawyer who escaped to Argentina. Authorities have placed Kadgien's daughter and her husband under house arrest on charges of concealment and obstruction of justice, bringing a measure of closure to this historical injustice.</p>

The administration had linked funding to demands for reforms, including ending diversity programs and screening international students for ideological biases, citing antisemitism concerns. Burroughs stated that while Harvard could have done more to address antisemitism, the administration's "true aim" was not combating it, but rather using it as a "smokescreen" for political motives.</p>
