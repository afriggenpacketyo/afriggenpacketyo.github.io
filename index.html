          <p>Stock markets experienced a downturn, and oil prices saw a significant increase following Israel's military action against Iran. S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq Composite futures all declined, while U.S. benchmark crude oil and Brent crude prices surged. The attack raised concerns about potential disruptions to global energy markets, particularly the Strait of Hormuz, which could impact oil supplies. A sustained rise in energy prices could hinder the U.S.'s progress in reducing inflation, despite recent positive trends in the Consumer Price Index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is adjusting welfare reforms to alleviate concerns among Labour MPs regarding planned disability benefit cuts. Changes include a 13-week transitional payment period for those losing Personal Independence Payment (Pip), instead of the usual four weeks. Carer's allowance will continue during this transition, and benefits recipients with severe health conditions will not be reassessed, receiving extra income support. A scheme allowing disabled individuals to try employment without losing benefits will also be introduced, with Kendall emphasizing these protections as "non-negotiable."</p>

          <p>Following Israel's attack on Iran, Hezbollah issued a statement condemning the action but did not offer to join in retaliation. Analysts suggest this restraint may be due to Hezbollah's losses in the previous year's war with Israel or a prioritization of internal restructuring. Some experts believe Iran cannot easily retaliate from Lebanon due to Hezbollah's weakened state. The group may be focusing on local arms production to become more independent from Iranian supplies, amid growing pressure for disarmament.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the emergence of a tech right, exemplified by Elon Musk, and its support for Donald Trump, exploring the reasons behind this shift and its subsequent failure. The author argues that three factors contributed to this change: the "Great Awokening," the macroeconomic environment, and a deliberate effort by liberals to target the tech scene. Despite some deregulation, the Trump administration largely failed to deliver on the tech right's priorities, leading to a fractured coalition.</p>

          <p>The article explores President Donald Trump's growing frustration with judges appointed through the Federalist Society, particularly after a ruling against his tariffs by the US Court of International Trade. Trump criticized Leonard Leo, a key figure in the conservative legal movement, and questioned why his judicial nominees were not supporting his agenda. This rift highlights the conflict between Trump's demands and the originalist legal philosophy of Federalist Society judges, who prioritize the Constitution over political loyalty.</p>

The Trump administration deployed the troops to Los Angeles to address immigration raids. California Governor Gavin Newsom opposed the move, calling it an unnecessary provocation. The appeals court will hold a hearing on the matter next week. The Trump administration cited a law allowing the president to call the National Guard into federal service during a "rebellion."</p>

          <p>The High Court has dismissed a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees. The challenge argued that the policy was discriminatory and violated human rights law. The government welcomed the judgment, stating that the policy would generate Â£1.8 billion annually to support pupils in state schools. The court found that while the legislation interferes with some human rights, the government was entitled to prioritize revenue for public services.</p>

The expert highlights that many dads face challenges such as divorce, incarceration, or mental health issues that impact their ability to be present. Instead, offering support and recognizing their importance can make a significant difference.
