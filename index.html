          <p>A new cryptocurrency, WLFI, launched by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial, has increased their on-paper wealth by approximately $5 billion. Despite the token's value dropping nearly 50% from its peak shortly after its debut, the family's substantial holdings account for the massive valuation. This development occurs as President Trump pivots to a more pro-crypto stance, aiming to position the U.S. as a global leader in the digital asset space, though these ventures have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest.

          <p>The United States military has conducted a lethal strike on a vessel in the southern Caribbean Sea that originated from Venezuela and was allegedly carrying drugs. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the boat was operated by a designated narco-terrorist organization. The action follows the U.S. deployment of warships near Venezuela for an anti-drug mission, a move President Nicolás Maduro labeled a threat. This event heightens existing tensions between the two nations, as the U.S. has previously accused the Maduro government of narco-terrorism.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price saw a modest increase, reclaiming the $110,000 level while the broader stock market experienced a downturn and gold surged to a new record high of around $3,500. Market analysts suggest that while Bitcoin benefits from some safe-haven interest, its performance has been partly constrained by a significant rotation of capital into Ethereum. This divergence highlights a market seeking both safety in traditional assets like gold and yield in the cryptocurrency space, with crypto increasingly competing as a safe-haven asset.

          <p>President Trump has stated that federal forces are "going in" to Chicago to address gun violence, escalating a conflict with Illinois Governor JB Pritzker. Pritzker has firmly rejected the idea of requesting federal troops and accused the administration of planning to raid Latino communities without local coordination. The governor anticipates that federal agents, potentially including the Texas National Guard, will be deployed, expressing concern that the administration is seeking a pretext to put active-duty military on the city's streets.</p>

          <p>The rapper Drake has placed a $300,000 bet on world No. 1 Jannik Sinner to win the US Open, a wager that would yield a $507,000 payout. This move defies the so-called "Drake Curse," a phenomenon where athletes and teams he supports often experience unexpected losses. Drake's betting history includes a significant loss on Taylor Fritz in the 2024 US Open final against Sinner. The rapper's high-stakes gambling has become a recurring cultural subplot during major sporting events, regardless of the outcomes.</p>

          <p>For individuals facing substantial credit card debt, such as a $20,000 balance, several effective repayment strategies are available. Options include working with a debt relief company for management or settlement, or obtaining a debt consolidation loan to combine multiple balances into a single payment with a potentially lower interest rate. Alternatively, individuals can employ self-directed payment methods like the debt avalanche or snowball strategies, supplement their income with a side hustle, or make disciplined budget cuts to free up funds for accelerated repayment.</p>

          <p>This opinion column posits that President Trump is more interested in being perceived as a dictator than in enacting durable policy changes. The author argues that many of Trump's actions, such as his executive orders on flag burning and tariffs, are designed to project strength and provoke reactions from both supporters and opponents, rather than to create legally sound laws. By avoiding collaboration with Congress, he maintains an image of unilateral power, even though this ensures his policies can be easily reversed by a future administration.</p>

          <p>In Argentina, the daughter of a former Nazi official and her husband have been placed under house arrest amid an investigation into a missing 17th-century painting. The artwork, "Portrait of a Lady," was stolen by the Nazis from a Dutch-Jewish art dealer in 1940 and was recently spotted in a real estate advertisement for the couple's home. When authorities raided the property, the painting was gone, leading to charges of obstructing the investigation and potential charges related to the concealment of theft in the context of genocide.</p>

Savers should also avoid letting existing CDs automatically roll over upon maturity into new accounts with likely lower rates. Instead, they should actively monitor the rate climate and have a plan for their maturing funds. (not investment advice)</p>
