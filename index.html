        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the first quarter of the year, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports, according to preliminary government data. This contraction exceeded economists' expectations, with exports falling by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, significantly impacting the GDP. Domestic demand, however, showed strength, growing by 0.6% and contributing positively to the GDP. Amid ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S., uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade policies are seen as a factor affecting Japan's export-dependent economy, while the Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current rates, potentially hiking them later in the year.</p>

The company stated that it is taking measures to enhance the chatbot's transparency and reliability, and will publish the system prompts used to inform Grok's responses on GitHub. xAI will also implement additional checks to prevent unapproved modifications and create a team for 24/7 monitoring of Grok's responses to address incidents that automated systems might miss. This comes after users posted screenshots of Grok providing unprompted answers on the topic of "white genocide", leading to widespread criticism.</p>

Combs' defense attorney presented text messages suggesting Ventura willingly participated in "freak-offs," while Ventura maintained that these were initiated out of fear and a desire to make Combs happy. The defense also questioned Ventura about her jealousy and Combs' state of mind during violent episodes, referencing a 2016 video showing Combs assaulting Ventura.

          <p>A strike by unionized locomotive engineers has brought New Jersey Transit's rail network to a halt, impacting tens of thousands of commuters in the New York City metropolitan region. The strike, the first by transit workers in the state since 1983, stems from a dispute over pay, with the union demanding wages on par with other regional railroads. NJ Transit has implemented a contingency plan, including additional bus service and cross-honoring tickets on buses and light rail lines, but expects to accommodate only a fraction of displaced train riders. The strike has also led to warnings of increased congestion and disruptions to other transit systems, with commuters urged to work from home if possible.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit engineers initiated a strike due to a pay dispute, resulting in a complete shutdown of rail service and inconvenience for over 300,000 daily commuters.

          <p>Green Tea Group's shares had a lackluster debut in Hong Kong, with traders focusing on the upcoming IPO of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest maker of battery packs for electric vehicles.

          <p>Former FBI director James Comey is under investigation by the Secret Service after sharing and then deleting a social media post that Republicans alleged was an incitement to violence against President Trump. Comey posted a photo of seashells that spelled the numbers "8647", which he captioned: "Cool shell formation on my beach walk." The number 86 is a slang term whose definitions include 'to reject' or 'to get rid of', according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, which also notes that it has more recently been used as a term meaning 'to kill'. Trump is the 47th US president. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem alleged the message was a call for the assassination of Trump, but Comey said he opposed violence.</p>

          <p>Northern California's commercial Dungeness crab season is under threat due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in crab fishing ropes. Traditional crab fishing methods have led to numerous whale injuries and deaths, prompting the implementation of new technologies and regulations. Some fishermen are experimenting with remote-controlled pop-up devices to reduce rope usage and minimize whale entanglements, but the cost and tradition present challenges. Regulators have also shortened the crab season to protect migrating whales.</p>
