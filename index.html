        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article presents a critical view of California's fiscal management, using the troubled high-speed rail project as a central example. It argues that despite the state's large economy, it faces significant financial issues, including a high poverty rate and a projected budget deficit. The author contends that the project, now massively over budget and behind schedule, symbolizes broader problems of bureaucratic incompetence, regulatory burdens, and questionable fiscal practices that are driving residents and businesses away from the state, suggesting fundamental reforms are needed.

          <p>Columbia University has agreed to a major settlement with the federal government, paying a $200 million fine and an additional $21 million to resolve investigations into antisemitism on campus. The agreement restores Columbia's access to approximately $1.3 billion in federal research funding, which had been frozen during the dispute. As part of the deal, the university will implement several measures to combat antisemitism, including amending its anti-discrimination policies and appointing new faculty. While Columbia did not admit to any wrongdoing, the settlement marks a significant development in the ongoing debate over discrimination on college campuses.</p>

          <h2>Medical Experts Urge FDA to Re-evaluate Warning Labels on Menopause Hormone Treatments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of prominent doctors is urging the Food and Drug Administration to remove its "black box" warning labels from low-dose estrogen treatments for menopause symptoms. They argue the current warnings, which list risks like cancer and dementia, are unsupported by science for locally-applied treatments and unnecessarily scare women away from beneficial medication. This push comes amid a broader re-evaluation of hormone replacement therapy, which fell out of favor two decades ago due to overstated risks. While many specialists support this change, some express caution about systemic therapies, stressing the need for careful patient-doctor conversations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is grappling with persistent questions and political pressure regarding the unreleased files on Jeffrey Epstein, a controversy that has become a significant challenge for the president. Despite employing various deflection tactics, including attacking the media and political opponents, public dissatisfaction with the handling of the files remains high, even among some of his supporters. The issue has become a complex political storm, fueled by conspiracy theories that the president himself has previously encouraged. Recent developments, including a DOJ interview with Ghislaine Maxwell, ensure the matter will continue to command national attention.</p>

          <p>The traditionally male-dominated world of timber sports is seeing a significant rise in female competitors, known as "lumberjills." At this year's Lumberjack World Championships in Wisconsin, nearly half of the athletes were women, competing in demanding events like speed chopping, sawing, and log rolling. These athletes are breaking world records and elevating the level of competition, transforming the sport's image from the classic burly lumberjack to one of inclusive, professional athleticism. The growth in participation and skill reflects a broader evolution in the sport, pushing it toward greater recognition for its female stars.</p>

          <p>Recent legislative changes and policy shifts under the Trump administration are poised to increase healthcare costs for many Americans, particularly those with lower incomes.

Additionally, the administration is rolling back regulations that protect consumers from the impact of medical debt on their credit reports. Consumer advocates warn that these moves will undermine financial security, making it harder for families to afford necessary care. (not investment advice)</p>

This concern has intensified following policy shifts at the Department of Health and Human Services, including changes to the CDC's vaccine advisory committee.

          <p>A new provision in a major federal tax bill is causing significant concern among professional poker players and other gamblers. The law alters how gambling losses are deducted, making them only 90 percent deductible, which means players could owe taxes even in years where they break even or lose money. Prominent players argue this change is illogical and could make a professional career in poker financially unviable for many. Bipartisan efforts are now underway in Congress to reverse the provision, which some lawmakers acknowledge may have been an unintended mistake. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Retail sales in the United Kingdom saw a 0.9% increase in June, a rebound attributed to a month of warm weather, according to the Office for National Statistics. The sunny conditions boosted sales of fuel as more people traveled, and supermarkets reported stronger trade in items like drinks and summer clothing. This rise follows a revised 2.8% drop in May, and while it indicates a recovery, some economists found the increase disappointingly small. Overall, retail spending momentum appears to be slowing, suggesting that broader economic growth in the second quarter may have been lackluster.</p>

          <p>As England prepares to face Spain in the Euro 2025 final, key tactical battles are expected to determine the outcome. A crucial element for England will be exploiting Spain's high defensive line, a weakness Germany exposed in the semi-finals, which will require strong hold-up play from forward Alessia Russo and connected runs from supporting attackers. Conversely, England's midfield must remain compact to neutralize Spain's talented playmakers, Aitana Bonmati and Alexia Putellas, by cutting off supply lines. While Spain is expected to dominate possession, England's strength in transition could prove to be the decisive factor in the highly anticipated match.</p>

          <p>With an August 1 deadline looming for India to finalize a trade deal with the U.S. before tariffs potentially increase, New Delhi appears unfazed. Analysts suggest India's confidence stems from its strategic importance to Washington as a counterbalance to China in the Indo-Pacific and within the BRICS bloc. India has also been actively pursuing other trade agreements, such as its recently finalized pact with the U.K., as part of a multi-alignment strategy. This diversification provides India with leverage, allowing it to protect sensitive sectors like agriculture while negotiating from a position of strength. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision was made to avoid the area out of respect for the affected farmers and to ensure the race could proceed smoothly.

The move aims to "de-medicalise" the process and give individuals more choice and dignity.
