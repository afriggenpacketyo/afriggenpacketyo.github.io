          <p>NBA star LeBron James has addressed rumors about his future after a photo of him practicing at the Cleveland Cavaliers' facility sparked speculation among fans and media. James, who is from nearby Akron, clarified on social media that he has trained at the facility every summer since it was built and still lives in the area. He dismissed the chatter as people being "bored," emphasizing his long-standing connection to his home region. The speculation arose amid ongoing conversations about whether James will retire or be traded from the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>

          <p>Local officials in Texas have stated they were caught off guard by the deadly flash floods that occurred on July 4th. The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the night, while many residents were asleep. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly admitted the county lacks a river warning system and that the severity of the flood was not anticipated, despite a flood watch being in effect. This rapid and unexpected deluge has led to a significant death toll and a large-scale search and rescue operation for dozens of missing people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ, arguing it created the concept of a 'citizen.' He emphasized that the nation was born from a bloody and divisive civil war, a complexity that he believes makes its founding ideals even more inspiring. Burns suggests that understanding the founders' flaws and the nation's historical divisions can provide perspective and optimism for today's polarized society. He advocates for embracing this complicated history rather than sanitizing it, viewing it as a source of strength and meaning.</p>

          <p>Over 20 individuals were arrested in London during a protest supporting the group Palestine Action, which has recently been proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government. The protesters were detained in Parliament Square on suspicion of offenses under the Terrorism Act 2000 for showing support for the banned group. The designation, which makes membership or support a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison, followed what the government called a history of "unacceptable criminal damage" by the activist group. The ban has been criticized by some as an "authoritarian abuse" of power.</p>

          <p>At least 27 people have died, including nine children, after catastrophic flooding along Texas's Guadalupe River, with over 20 children from a summer camp still missing. The river reportedly rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes, overwhelming the area. A hydrology expert from the UK's University of Reading stated that the downpour was predicted by forecasters and that it is "not good enough for authorities to say they were not aware." This international viewpoint criticizes the apparent lack of an effective warning system to inform residents in harm's way, framing the tragedy as a potentially preventable failure of preparedness.</p>

The legislation actually provides a temporary tax deduction that phases out for higher earners, rather than a permanent elimination of the tax itself.

Participants from Kent constituencies expressed frustration over a perceived lack of progress on key promises, particularly regarding immigration. While some were forgiving, acknowledging the need to "steady the ship," others felt the government had not been transparent about its plans and criticized its frequent policy U-turns.

The article explores whether such rhetoric, which includes menacing opponents' citizenship or threatening arrest, constitutes an attack on freedom itself, regardless of whether the threats are carried out. Experts argue that the president's actions are designed to instill fear and silence dissent, creating an environment where citizens are no longer truly free to speak their minds.

Experts suggest that Pyongyang may view the U.S. actions as evidence that only a robust nuclear deterrent can guarantee regime survival against an unpredictable American foreign policy. This perception is likely to terminate any remaining possibility of denuclearization talks. Instead, North Korea may be driven to make its nuclear weapons more mobile and dispersed, prioritizing a second-strike capability to counter potential threats, a development that could worry neighboring China.</p>

          <h2>Can the Viral 'Cortisol Cocktail' on TikTok Actually Reduce Stress?</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A non-alcoholic beverage known as the "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on social media, with proponents claiming it can lower the stress hormone cortisol. The drink typically contains coconut water, citrus juice, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there are no scientific studies to support these claims. Doctors note that while the individual ingredients are generally harmless and can aid hydration, they are unlikely to have a direct impact on cortisol levels. They caution that tracking and medically lowering cortisol is rarely necessary and advise focusing on proven stress-reduction techniques like sleep and exercise.</p>

          <p>The only known prototype of the MingKwai typewriter, an innovative Chinese-language machine invented by Lin Yutang in the 1940s, has been discovered in a New York basement. Scholars are excited because the machine's design, which breaks down Chinese characters by shape rather than sound, laid the conceptual groundwork for modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean computing. The typewriter was an ambitious attempt to bridge Eastern and Western cultures and preserve the Chinese language in a technological age. Now acquired by Stanford University, the machine is seen as a crucial artifact in the history of global technology and communication.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's highest-ranking military commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, has warned that Russia may be preparing a new offensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region. After spending two days assessing the situation on the ground, Syrskyi noted that Russian forces are attempting to use their numerical superiority in troops and munitions to press forward. This warning comes as Moscow's forces have been making slow but steady gains along the front lines this summer, including establishing a small foothold in the neighboring Sumy region. Syrskyi emphasized the need for Ukraine to be ready with appropriate tactical and technological solutions to halt any advance.</p>

The ban, in place since 1923 due to pollution, was lifted following a $1.5 billion cleanup project linked to last year's Olympics. On Saturday, residents eagerly took a plunge in the river near the Eiffel Tower, with Mayor Anne Hidalgo present to celebrate the historic moment.

          <p>Elon Musk has elaborated on his idea for a new political party, suggesting it could gain significant influence by focusing on a small number of key congressional races. In a post on his social media platform X, Musk proposed targeting just two or three Senate seats and eight to ten House districts to become the decisive voting bloc in a narrowly divided Congress. This strategy follows his public feud with President Trump over a new spending bill, which prompted Musk to threaten forming the "America Party" to challenge the two-party system.

This marks the first time Xi has missed the gathering of major emerging economies, with the official reason being a "scheduling conflict." Some analysts suggest the absence points to domestic turbulence or friction with other BRICS members like India and Brazil, which have recently imposed tariffs on Chinese goods.

          <p>A renter in Scottsdale, Arizona, was fined $4,000 by his property management company after posting negative online reviews about his rental experience, which included issues like black mold. The fine was based on a "non-disparagement" clause in the lease agreement that penalized tenants for reviews rated three stars or less. However, this practice is illegal under the 2016 federal Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA), which protects a consumer's right to share honest feedback. After being contacted by local news, the company stated it would remove the clause from future leases, highlighting a critical issue of consumer rights.</p>

          <p>Former Google X executive and happiness researcher Mo Gawdat advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage emotional responses to upsetting events. Based on neuroscientific findings, the rule acknowledges that the physiological response to anger or stress, such as the release of cortisol, lasts about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any continued distress is a result of consciously or unconsciously re-running the negative thought. Gawdat suggests using this 90-second buffer to consciously choose a different, more constructive response, thereby preventing prolonged periods of unhappiness and gaining control over one's emotional state.</p>
