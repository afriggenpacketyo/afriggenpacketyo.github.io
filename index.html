          <h2>Microsoft Warns of Active Cyberattacks Targeting SharePoint Software</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 12:16:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Microsoft is addressing active cyberattacks targeting a vulnerability in its on-premises SharePoint collaboration software, which affects businesses and governments globally. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned the flaw allows unauthenticated access and could let attackers execute malicious code. While Microsoft has issued fixes for two versions of the software, a 2016 version remains vulnerable as a patch is still being developed. Security researchers warn the breach could lead to widespread data theft, as attackers who gain access can impersonate users and establish persistent backdoors even after the system is patched.</p>

          <p>Inspiring stories of altruism feature a man who became a rare double living organ donor and a teenager who invented a product to help others with her condition. After donating a kidney to a stranger, Brian Flynn also donated part of his liver to a 4-year-old boy, finding profound meaning in saving lives. Separately, teen Rachel Bee, diagnosed with Crohn's disease, created the 'Infusion Hero' sweatshirt with zippered sleeves to provide warmth and comfort to patients during IV treatments. Both individuals have turned personal challenges into impactful ways of helping their communities and finding purpose through their actions.</p>

          <h2>UK Regulator Suggests YouTube Should Prioritize Public Service Media Content</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 12:11:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK media regulator Ofcom has proposed that YouTube should give greater prominence to content from public service broadcasters like the BBC and Channel 4. The recommendation comes amid concerns that the future of public service media is at risk, as younger audiences increasingly favor platforms like YouTube over traditional television. Ofcom's report suggests broadcasters must urgently collaborate with YouTube to ensure their content, especially news and children's programming, is easily discoverable. The regulator also raised the possibility of new government legislation to enforce this prominence, aiming to preserve the role of trusted, UK-made content in the digital age.</p>

          <p>A summer wave of COVID-19 is underway in the United States, with CDC data showing that cases are growing or likely growing in at least 26 states and Washington, D.C. While the latest variants, Nimbus and Stratus, are not considered more deadly, health officials advise caution, especially for vulnerable populations like young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. Medical experts note that while seasonal spikes are now typical and overall severity has decreased, the public should not be complacent. Current vaccines are effective against the circulating variants, and officials are encouraging shared clinical decision-making for vaccinations, particularly for at-risk groups.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has confirmed it received a criminal referral from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard concerning allegations against Obama-era officials. Gabbard claims that these officials manipulated intelligence to fabricate the narrative of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, with the goal of undermining the Trump presidency. The referral is based on over 100 unclassified documents that Gabbard asserts provide evidence of a conspiracy directed by former President Obama.

          <p>Elon Musk's social media platform, X, has refused to comply with a demand from French authorities to hand over data as part of a criminal investigation. The French probe, which X claims is "politically-motivated," concerns alleged data tampering and the fraudulent extraction of data, potentially for foreign interference. X stated it categorically denies the allegations and believes the investigation is an attempt to restrict free speech. The company also raised concerns about the impartiality of the experts assigned to analyze its algorithm, noting their public hostility towards the platform, and has therefore not acceded to the data request.</p>

          <p>The pilot of a SkyWest flight bound for Minot, North Dakota, performed what he described as an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a mid-air collision with a U.S. Air Force B-52 bomber. In a calm announcement to passengers, the pilot explained that the military aircraft was on a converging course and had not been announced by air traffic control. He apologized for the sudden turn, stating it was the safest option to avoid the much faster aircraft. The Air Force confirmed a B-52 was in the area for a state fair flyover, and both the FAA and SkyWest are investigating the serious incident.</p>

While prioritizing the deportation of serious criminal offenders, Lyons confirmed that non-criminals will also be subject to arrest during enforcement operations. He attributed this to "sanctuary" city policies that prevent local law enforcement from cooperating with ICE. Lyons also promised a crackdown on companies that employ unauthorized workers, stating that these businesses would be held accountable for exploiting labor and that such enforcement actions would continue across the country.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that children who lived near a St. Louis creek contaminated with radioactive waste from the Manhattan Project had a significantly higher lifetime risk of developing cancer. The research, published in JAMA Network Open, validates long-held fears of residents near Coldwater Creek, where waste was stored in the 1940s. The study revealed an 85% higher likelihood of radiosensitive cancers for those living within one kilometer of the creek as children. These findings provide scientific backing for recent legislation aimed at compensating families affected by radiation-linked illnesses in the St. Louis area and other contaminated sites.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines experienced a major operational disruption on Sunday evening, leading to a system-wide ground stop for all its flights due to an IT outage. The grounding lasted for approximately three hours before the airline was able to resume operations.

While flights are back in the air, the airline apologized to guests for the inconvenience and warned of residual delays and impacts on its schedule as it works to recover from the disruption.</p>

His comments follow a week of conflicting reports about the job security of Fed Chair Jerome Powell and criticism from the administration over the central bank's interest rate policy.
