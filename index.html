          <p>Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, falling below $79,000, as investors reacted to increased financial market volatility following President Trump's implementation of restrictive global tariffs. This decline mirrored a broader downturn in U.S. equities, marking the worst decline since 2020. The cryptocurrency market faced substantial losses, with Ether and Solana tokens also experiencing declines, and this situation led to a wave of liquidations as traders betting on price increases were forced to sell assets to cover losses.

          <p>Former NFL linebacker Anthony Barr has voiced his opposition to a potential ban on the 'tush push' play, arguing that it could create a 'slippery slope' for future rule changes in the league. The Green Bay Packers submitted a proposal to effectively ban the play, citing safety concerns, but the discussion was ultimately tabled until May. Barr contends that banning the play would set a precedent for further restrictions, and the NFL has acknowledged that there is not enough data to definitively determine whether the 'tush push' is a dangerous play.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's tariffs on imported cars and the upcoming 2030 ban on petrol and diesel vehicles, the UK government is relaxing regulations for car firms to protect and create jobs. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander announced that mandates imposed on car firms transitioning to electric vehicle production will be eased to help them avoid fines. Smaller UK firms like Aston Martin and McLaren will be allowed to continue making petrol cars beyond the 2030 deadline, and some hybrid vehicles will be able to stay on the market until 2035.</p>

          <p>The United States, under Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has revoked visas for all South Sudanese passport holders and will block arriving citizens at US ports of entry due to South Sudan's refusal to accept its citizens being deported from the US. This action reflects the Trump administration's policy of 'mass deportations' and its insistence that countries accept the return of their citizens. The decision comes amid growing concerns about the stability of South Sudan, which has faced civil war and challenges in implementing a peace deal, and it raises questions about the impact on South Sudanese individuals in the US, including Duke University basketball player Khaman Maluach.</p>

          <p>After President Trump's announcement of punitive tariffs triggered a 10.5% market decline in two days, this strategist advises against wholesale selling, suggesting instead to 'buy the non-tariffed winners'. While acknowledging the potential for further downside and a possible recession, they believe selling at current levels would be ill-advised unless funds are needed within the next year. The strategy involves nibbling if the S&P 500 reaches 4,000, while remaining cautious of potential European retaliation, and the strategist emphasizes the need to reassess earnings estimates and valuation multiples due to the tariffs.

          <p>This article addresses whether to pay off a $5,000 loan with a 2.5% interest rate, weighing the appeal of becoming debt-free against potential financial downsides. Paying off loans early can save money on interest and improve creditworthiness by lowering the debt-to-income ratio, but some lenders charge prepayment penalties, and it could negatively impact credit score by affecting the length of credit history. The article suggests considering alternative uses for the money, such as building an emergency fund, before deciding to prepay the loan.

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has condemned derogatory chants directed at Phil Foden's mother by Manchester United fans as a 'lack of class'. Guardiola emphasized that the issue was with the individuals involved and not the club itself. The incident occurred during a goalless Manchester derby, leaving City fifth in the Premier League and United in 13th.</p>

          <p>A 52-year-old Chinese woman detained by US border patrol in Arizona for overstaying her visa has died by suicide, raising concerns about the conditions at detainment facilities. Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal stated that initial reports suggest border patrol agents failed to perform required welfare checks, and surveillance footage indicated a significant delay in medical response after the woman created a noose. The incident has sparked criticism of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and the treatment of detainees.</p>

          <p>Thousands of probationary federal workers, initially fired as part of President Trump's downsizing efforts, face an uncertain future due to ongoing legal challenges. Court orders have led to their reinstatement, but many are on administrative leave with unclear prospects for long-term employment. The Justice Department is appealing one of the orders, and a judge has issued a preliminary injunction blocking terminations in several states, leaving workers in a state of stress and confusion as they navigate potential job losses and reinstatement offers.</p>

          <p>A federal justice department attorney, Erez Reuveni, has been placed on leave by the Trump administration for purportedly failing to defend the administration vigorously enough after it says it erroneously deported a Maryland man to El Salvador. The action came after Reuveni struggled to answer questions from a judge about the circumstances of the deportation, acknowledging an 'absence of evidence' justifying the action. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that Reuveni was no longer working on the case, emphasizing the need for attorneys to 'vigorously argue on behalf of their client'.</p>

          <p>Amid federal inaction on climate change, California has an opportunity to invest in climate-smart agriculture practices, such as planting perennials and using cover crops, to reduce emissions and improve climate resilience. These methods can increase soil carbon and improve farmers' ability to capture and store moisture, but state programs are essential to help farmers cover initial costs. The legislature has a chance to reallocate state climate funds, potentially allocating 15% of the State Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to these programs, which also benefit farmers by saving them money on energy, water, fertilizers, and pesticides.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered all national parks to remain open despite severe staffing shortages, raising concerns among conservation groups about visitor safety and park maintenance. The order requires National Park Service officials to seek approval before closing or reducing hours at park sites, a move criticized as micromanagement that sidelines the expertise of park staff. This decision comes after the administration slashed National Park Service workers, making it more difficult to welcome visitors and maintain the parks.</p>

          <p>As Alex Ovechkin surpassed Wayne Gretzky's NHL career goals record, the event sparked reflection on Gretzky's legacy and evolving Canadian identity. While Gretzky, once a symbol of Canadian pride, has become increasingly associated with American politics and culture, Ovechkin's achievement raises complex emotions given his support for Vladimir Putin. This shift prompts questions about who Canadians consider their heroes and how national identity is shaped by sports and politics, and the article suggests that Gretzky's records, like his faults, are singular, and the loss is his and his alone.</p>
