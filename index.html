          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.8 billion for Saturday's drawing, making it the second-largest in U.S. lottery history, trailing only the $2.04 billion record from 2022. This substantial sum follows 41 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner, tying the game's record for such a streak. The estimated cash value for a single lump-sum payout is $826.4 million before taxes. If won, the purchaser could choose between this lump sum or an annuity of $1.8 billion paid over 30 years, increasing annually. Tickets are sold in 45 states, with odds of winning the top prize at 1 in 292.2 million, fueling widespread anticipation.</p>

          <p>China strategically used the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin to articulate its vision for a multipolar global order, aiming to elevate its geopolitical standing as a stable alternative in international governance. This typically low-profile event became a significant diplomatic triumph for President Xi Jinping, particularly as the credibility of the United States is seen to be faltering. A symbolic moment featured Xi in cordial conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, underscoring a surprising display of unity despite past bilateral tensions and their collective experiences with U.S. criticism. The SCO, a ten-member Eurasian institution, focuses on counter-terrorism, combating extremism, and integrating economic projects like China's Belt and Road Initiative, signaling a concerted effort to reshape global power dynamics.</p>

          <p>OutKick offered an immersive report from a Professional Bull Riding (PBR) event in California, emphasizing the thrilling spectacle of 2,000-pound bucking bulls and the audacious riders. Streamed by FOX Nation, the "Toughest Sport on Dirt" showcased pyrotechnics, intense competition, and a fervent "red-blooded American" crowd, even in Southern California. The Arizona Ridge Riders emerged victorious, with coach Colby Yates expressing excitement about the local fan support. A particularly dramatic moment saw OutKick's reporter inside a "shark cage" when a rogue bull crashed into it, providing a visceral experience of the sport's inherent danger and excitement, underlining its unique appeal.</p>

          <p>Israel's military has expanded operations in Gaza City, instructing residents to move to a designated humanitarian area in southern Muwasi, anticipating intensified urban warfare. Aid groups warn this mass evacuation will worsen the dire humanitarian crisis, as many Palestinians are already displaced and facing famine. The military detailed plans for field hospitals and aid in the "safe zone," despite previous instances of such areas being struck. The conflict, which began with Hamas's October 2023 attack, has led to over 64,000 Palestinian deaths, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The article underscores the human toll through the story of Shamm Qudeih, a severely malnourished toddler now receiving treatment in Italy, highlighting the profound suffering and the struggle for basic necessities.</p>

Forecasters warn that significant swells generated by Kiko are anticipated to impact the Hawaiian Islands by Sunday, persisting through midweek, creating life-threatening surf and rip currents. While direct impacts such as strong winds and heavy rainfall are primarily projected for Tuesday, Acting Hawaii Governor Sylvia Luke has already declared a state of emergency, urging residents and visitors to monitor updates and prepare accordingly. The National Weather Service in Honolulu is closely tracking the hurricane's path and potential for widespread flooding early next week.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan received special baseball memorabilia after a viral incident where an adult woman seemingly took a home run ball from him at a game. During a Phillies-Marlins matchup, the ball landed near the boy, and his father initially secured it for him. However, a woman, dubbed "Phillies Karen," intervened, claiming the ball was hers, leading the father to return it to her. Both the Phillies and Marlins organizations responded by gifting the boy a Marlins swag bag and arranging a meeting with Phillies outfielder Harrison Bader, who gave him an autographed bat, ensuring a memorable experience despite the initial disappointment.</p>

These individuals are being positioned to take on more prominent roles and contest future elections, including the London mayoral election in 2028. Farage emphasized the need for 5,000 vetted candidates for upcoming polls, highlighting a rigorous selection process to avoid past scandals and build a "people's army" for significant electoral gains.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing her upcoming Budget amidst a tumultuous period marked by market fluctuations and cabinet reshuffles, all of which will influence her financial decisions. Despite recent bond market fragility, which saw long-term borrowing rates rise, Reeves remains confident, asserting that global trends, rather than UK-specific issues, were the primary drivers. Her team intends to use this market volatility to argue against increased borrowing, suggesting any fiscal gaps must be filled by higher taxes or reduced spending. The Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) judgment on UK productivity will be crucial in determining the scale of necessary adjustments, with potential haggling expected over its forecasts. This article suggests the Chancellor aims for long-term, pro-growth reforms to the tax system, but market realities and political pressures will dictate the final outcome. (not investment advice)</p>

The indigenous Bedouin Jebeleya tribe has been displaced, with homes and cemeteries removed for construction with little compensation. Despite Egyptian claims of sustainable development and boosting tourism, UNESCO and campaigners have voiced concerns about the lack of consultation and impact on the site's spiritual and environmental integrity, urging a halt to developments.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is extensively using decoy military equipment, such as plywood tanks and inflatable guns, to deceive Russian forces and conserve valuable ammunition. These full-scale models, ranging from small radars to tanks and even fake soldiers, aim to trick the enemy into wasting resources. Volunteer groups play a crucial role, supplying hundreds of easily assembled M777 howitzer decoys, costing around $500-$600, which are frequently targeted by expensive Russian Lancet kamikaze drones. Effective deployment involves meticulously recreating real positions with details like wheel ruts and ammunition crates, sometimes even fooling visiting commanders. Russia also employs similar tactics, using cheap imitation drones to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses.</p>

Eighty-eight postal operators have suspended services to the U.S. for parcels valued at $800 or less, as they lack the infrastructure to comply.

The festival's second-highest honor, the Silver Lion Grand Jury Prize, was awarded to Franco-Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania's "The Voice of Hind Rajab," a film about a five-year-old Palestinian girl killed by Israeli forces.

          <p>Sean Dickson delivered a heroic performance, leading Somerset to a dramatic victory over the Bears and securing their record-equalling 11th appearance at T20 Blast finals day. Requiring 19 runs from the final over, Dickson smashed two sixes and a four off Ed Barnard, clinching the win with one ball to spare. He arrived at the crease with Somerset at 80-3, needing 11 runs per over, and, after supporting Tom Abell's half-century, took charge with an unbeaten 71 off just 26 balls. The Bears had posted a strong 190-6, but their "quarter-final curse" continued as Dickson's late fireworks denied them a semi-final spot against Lancashire.</p>

          <p>China's recent Victory Parade, commemorating the 80th anniversary of Japan's WWII defeat, showcased the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) advanced weaponry and significant command structure reforms. The parade notably featured newly established branches: the Information Support Force, Military Aerospace Force, and Cyberspace Force, alongside their latest equipment for electronic countermeasures and information support. Observers view the debut of these new arms as a clear signal of Beijing's strategic shift to integrate advanced technologies into cross-force joint operations. Experts like Timothy Heath of the Rand Corporation suggest these developments demonstrate the PLA's transformation into a military force capable of operating across all domains of modern warfare.</p>

Three individuals survived the accident, and a search operation is underway. This event underscores the danger posed by hippos in the region, which a 2022 study identified as the species most frequently involved in fatal or injurious human interactions in Ivory Coast, where an estimated 500 hippos reside. Boat accidents are common due to frequently overloaded, handcrafted vessels used for transport between riverside communities, highlighting ongoing safety concerns in the area.</p>

Health Secretary Wes Streeting criticized Reform for providing a platform for these "shockingly irresponsible" lies, which he warned could undermine public health.

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected double bomber on the FBI's most wanted list, is facing an extradition hearing in London after evading authorities for 21 years. San Diego, linked to animal rights extremist groups, is the prime suspect in 2003 bombings in the San Francisco Bay Area. Former FBI agents revealed "missed opportunities" to arrest him before his disappearance, including discovering a suspected "bomb-making factory" in his abandoned car after a high-speed chase. He was finally apprehended in an isolated cottage in north Wales last year, having used an alias. His capture, after two decades, underscores the FBI's long-term commitment to accountability, regardless of the time elapsed.</p>

The Metropolitan Police reported an "exceptional level of abuse" and assaults on officers, while organizers accused police of "violently assaulting peaceful protesters."
