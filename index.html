            <p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink expressed concerns about the U.S. economy, suggesting it might already be in a recession due to weakening growth and uncertainty stemming from President Trump's tariffs. Fink highlighted that businesses are slowing down investment and acquisitions until there is more clarity on trade policies, even after a temporary pause on reciprocal tariffs. Despite these concerns, he doesn't foresee a financial crisis and anticipates the persistence of megatrends like artificial intelligence. BlackRock's first-quarter results showed mixed performance, with earnings per share exceeding expectations but revenue falling short, reflecting the uncertain market conditions.

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador, must be returned to the United States. The ruling came after Garcia was mistakenly sent to a mega-jail in El Salvador, prompting legal challenges. The court instructed a lower court judge to clarify her order for the government to facilitate Garcia's return, emphasizing deference to the executive branch in foreign affairs. The government conceded that Garcia's deportation was due to an administrative error, but alleges he is a member of MS-13 gang.</p>

The film explores the challenges of education amidst political conflict and grief, as Basem grapples with the loss of his son and mentors a student who lost his brother. It highlights the senselessness of their losses and the power of relationships in harrowing circumstances. Though filmed before recent events, the film captures the intimate horrors of life under occupation and the importance of forging connections.</p>

            <p>Ja Morant, facing fines and warnings for mimicking gun gestures, has switched to a grenade-tossing celebration after scoring. The NBA fined Morant $75,000 for his previous actions, deeming them inappropriate. Morant's new celebration, which involves pretending to pull a grenade pin and toss the device, has drawn criticism. Morant's history includes a 25-game suspension for displaying a gun in a video, raising concerns about his behavior.</p>

            <p>Peter Navarro, a trade advisor to President Trump, encouraged Americans to invest in stocks, a day after downplaying a steep market drop caused by tariff fears. Navarro anticipates market gains from Trump's proposed tax cuts and potential trade deals. He argued that people who own stock that has dropped in value only have paper losses, saying, "If you don't sell, you don't lose." Navarro's comments align with other officials who are talking up the stock market despite recent volatility.</p>

            <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari suggested that rising bond yields and a falling dollar indicate investors are moving away from the U.S. due to President Trump's escalating trade war. Kashkari noted that these trends run counter to expectations, as normally tariff increases would strengthen the dollar. He sees these market movements as reflecting a shift in investor preferences, with America no longer viewed as the safest place to invest. Kashkari emphasized the importance of keeping inflation expectations anchored amid the uncertainty.</p>

            <p>Nearly two dozen U.S. law firms have quietly removed references to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) from their websites, likely in response to pressure from the Trump administration. Some firms have also revised descriptions of pro-bono work to align more closely with Trump's priorities. This comes as the Trump administration has attacked DEI programs and sought to punish firms that challenge him in court. Some firms have reached agreements with the administration not to use DEI in hiring.</p>
