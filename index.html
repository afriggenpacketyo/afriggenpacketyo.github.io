          <h2>Federal Judge Halts Trump Administration's Funding Cuts to Sanctuary Cities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 14:22:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding federal funding from dozens of "sanctuary" cities and counties, including major hubs like Los Angeles and Chicago. This ruling expands on an earlier decision that found the president's attempt to freeze funds for local governments limiting cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to be unconstitutional. Cities involved in the lawsuit argue these policies are an abuse of power and violate the Tenth Amendment, asserting their right to choose not to assist ICE, often citing the need to build trust between police and local residents. The administration, however, maintains that sanctuary cities impede federal law enforcement and compromise public safety by making it harder to arrest undocumented immigrants, including violent criminals, and looks forward to ultimate vindication on the issue.</p>

          <p>FBI agents reportedly raided the Bethesda, Md., home and D.C. office of former national security adviser John Bolton, allegedly in connection with a probe into classified documents. A Trump administration official cited a directive from FBI Director Kash Patel for the raid, linking it to allegations that Bolton sent classified materials to his family via a private email server. The incident marks a new low in Bolton's contentious relationship with President Trump, who publicly disparaged his former adviser as a "lowlife" and "not a smart guy." Vice President JD Vance stated the investigation is in its early stages and denied it was politically motivated, while a source close to the probe noted Bolton's prior criticism of Trump's handling of classified information.</p>

          <p>U.S. immigration officials have reportedly notified Kilmar Abrego Garcia of their intent to deport him to Uganda, according to his attorneys. This development follows Abrego Garcia's refusal of a plea deal that would have allowed deportation to Costa Rica in exchange for a guilty plea and extended jail time. His lawyers accuse the Trump administration of pressuring him, asserting that the choice is between pleading guilty for relative safety in Costa Rica or forced rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be threatened. Abrego Garcia, previously wrongfully deported to El Salvador, denies federal human smuggling charges and alleged MS-13 gang ties.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new thriller "Relay," directed by David Mackenzie, presents a smart and paranoid narrative centered on Ash, a solitary off-the-grid fixer played by Riz Ahmed. Ash specializes in helping potential whistleblowers disappear or negotiate settlements with powerful entities, using a text-telephone relay service for traceless communication, which keeps identities secret. The article praises the film's unique premise, moving beyond the typical assassin trope to explore cynical choices in an online world. As Ash aids a rattled biotech scientist, Sarah, the film builds a dizzying cat-and-mouse chase, while subtly revealing Ash's own vulnerabilities and questioning his chosen crusade.</p>

Despite the success stories, conservation biologists express concern over species disappearing at alarming rates, emphasizing the cascading effects of losing even one species within an ecosystem. The institute's crucial work, including preparing 60 ferret kits for release into the Colorado wild, highlights ongoing global wildlife preservation efforts.</p>

          <p>The ongoing conflict in Ukraine is significantly altering geopolitical alignments across former Soviet states, as evidenced by a US-brokered peace deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia. This US involvement, alongside Azerbaijan's strengthened ties with Turkey and Central Asian nations, signals a potential decline in Russia's traditional influence in the region. Tensions between Russia and Azerbaijan, exacerbated by incidents like a downed plane and alleged oil depot attacks, further underscore this shift. Other ex-Soviet states, like Tajikistan, are also openly challenging Moscow's authority, while China quietly expands its economic and security presence, creating a multi-vector foreign policy landscape.</p>

While large crowds are anticipated for events like Notting Hill Carnival and music festivals, travelers may face disruption due to ongoing rail strikes and engineering works.

Merz's stance is seen as an attempt to appeal to his base and those who have shifted to the far-right, while the SPD is likely to resist major cuts to avoid further electoral losses.

Prosecutors had sought a nine-month jail sentence, but Judge Michael Schwartz found that Kemp acted in self-defense, citing the men's provocation by allegedly stealing Kemp's truck, cellphone, and memorabilia. Kemp, who pleaded guilty to an assault charge, expressed regret and plans to advocate against gun violence, particularly among youth. The article notes the support from family and friends, including former NFL star Marshawn Lynch.</p>

          <p>A massive landslide in Alaska’s Tracy Arm fjord triggered a powerful tsunami that reached 1,400 feet up the opposite side of the fjord, but miraculously caused no casualties due to fortunate timing. Scientists estimate up to 100 million cubic meters of rock fell, creating a 100-foot wave that barreled down the inlet. Experts like Dennis Staley of the US Geological Survey express relief but warn that such events may increase as glaciers retreat due to climate change, potentially destabilizing mountainsides. The incident highlights the growing risk of natural disasters in popular tourist areas and the need for improved monitoring and understanding of these phenomena.</p>

          <p>Experts are concerned that a surge in retail investor exuberance within the exchange-traded fund (ETF) market may be signaling an overheating market. Billions of dollars are pouring into risky, non-traditional ETFs like single-stock, leveraged, or inverse strategies, which are overwhelmingly owned by retail investors rather than institutions. ETF Action's Mike Akins warns that product proliferation and the high flows into these volatile, yield-focused products, reminiscent of the 2020-2021 market peak, could lead to a "train wreck" if underlying stocks falter. This trend is seen as a contrarian indicator, suggesting caution for the broader market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 66-year-old employee, Alex, planning to retire next month after giving a year's notice, is now asked by his company to stay on for two months as a part-time consultant to train his replacement. This request arises because management hired the replacement just weeks before Alex's retirement date, leaving insufficient time for proper handover. The article advises Alex to consider the impact on his Social Security benefits, as working while collecting benefits before full retirement age can temporarily reduce them.

This trend follows a Trump administration executive order and increasing legal and regulatory risks to hospitals and providers. While advocates and many medical organizations emphasize the positive mental health impact of such care and decry government interference in patient-doctor decisions, some experts argue the evidence base for interventions in minors is weak.

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard personnel patrolling Washington D.C. to be armed, intensifying the Trump administration's crime crackdown in the capital. This decision reverses an earlier stance that troops would not carry weapons, despite their primary role being non-law enforcement support near landmarks. President Trump praised the mission, claiming it brought "total safety" to D.C. and considering expanding it to Chicago. However, the deployment is deeply unpopular with D.C. residents, and Chicago's mayor expressed "grave concerns" about federal intervention, warning it could inflame tensions and undermine local progress on crime reduction.</p>

During two days of hearings, commissioners questioned the brothers on their childhood abuse, mindsets surrounding the murders, and prison transgressions, including repeated use of illicit cell phones. The board cited Erik's past involvement with a prison gang and drug use, and Lyle's "antisocial personality traits" and rule-breaking as reasons for denial. Despite family support and a "moderate risk" assessment, the commissioners emphasized concerns over the callousness of their mother's killing and their failure to seek help.</p>

The eruption, contained within the Halemaumau Crater, poses no threat to homes and offers spectacular views for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain the continuous spattering and lava fountains are due to magma rising through narrow vents, building pressure like a shaken Champagne bottle. While the eruption's future is uncertain, it continues a pattern of repeated lava fountain episodes seen only a few times in 200 years, offering a powerful connection to Native Hawaiian traditions.</p>
