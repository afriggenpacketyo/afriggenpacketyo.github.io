          <p>Boeing's CEO, Kelly Ortberg, announced that airplane deliveries to China will resume next month after a pause due to trade tensions. Ortberg downplayed the impact of tariffs, noting Boeing pays tariffs on imported components but can recoup much of it upon exporting the planes. The company will also ramp up production of its 737 Max aircraft. This resumption is a positive sign for Boeing, as China is a significant market for its airplanes, and increased production will help meet global demand. Optimism is seen with the company's ability to navigate trade challenges and increase output.</p>

          <p>A recent US court ruling against President Trump's tariffs does not significantly alter the existing US-UK trade deal. The tariffs deemed illegal do not include those on cars, steel, and aluminum, which constitute the bulk of UK exports to the US. While a deal to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs is in place, it has not yet been implemented. The ruling does block a 10% tariff on other UK goods like salmon and whisky, though the White House intends to appeal the decision. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a U.S. court ruling that President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing sweeping tariffs, the administration is exploring alternative legal avenues. Goldman Sachs economists suggest options including Section 122 of U.S. trade law, Section 301 investigations, and Section 338 of the Trade Act of 1930. Section 122 could allow for a quick replacement of the 10% tariff with a similar one up to 15% for 150 days, while Section 301 investigations could lay the groundwork for future tariffs. The administration's appeal of the ruling suggests a determination to maintain its trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats are urging the Department of Homeland Security to reinstate the legal status of a 4-year-old girl from Bakersfield who faces deportation and potential death due to a rare medical condition. The girl, S.G.V., has short bowel syndrome and requires specialized medical treatment unavailable outside the U.S. Lawmakers argue the family's situation warrants humanitarian aid and criticize the Trump administration's termination of their legal status.

          <p>America's trading partners reacted cautiously to a U.S. court decision blocking some of President Trump's tariffs. Despite the ruling, which offers a fragile chance at reprieve, economists pointed out that Mr. Trump could turn to other legal routes to enact across-the-board tariffs. Trading partners such as Australia and Britain stated they would study the ruling but noted that it may be subject to further legal processes. The European Commission declined to comment altogether, as the decision does not roll back sector-specific tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a federal agency adequately considered the environmental impact of a proposed 88-mile railway in Utah, limiting the scope of environmental reviews required by federal law.

Justice Kavanaugh stated that an agency may weigh environmental consequences as it reasonably sees fit.

          <p>Lincoln Center is undertaking a $335 million project to overhaul Damrosch Park, aiming to open it to the surrounding neighborhood and address past civic injustices. The park, currently hidden and in decline, will be renovated with a new amphitheater and tiered gardens. The project seeks to rectify the urban renewal campaign led by Robert Moses, which displaced a largely Black, Afro-Caribbean, and Puerto Rican neighborhood called San Juan Hill. The redesign includes a subtle geometry inspired by the landscape at Amsterdam Houses, symbolizing a new civic orientation.</p>

          <p>China will downgrade its representation at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, skipping an opportunity for Defence Minister Dong Jun to meet counterparts from the United States and across Asia. China will send a delegation from the National Defence University to attend the forum. Observers said China’s decision was not surprising given the ongoing talks to resolve the US-China tariff war, and there were probably multiple reasons for the move, including internal reshuffles and reduced interest in the “Western-centric” security dialogue.</p>

          <h2>Stocks Rise After Court Blocks Trump's Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 09:53:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stock markets experienced gains after a panel of U.S. judges blocked President Trump from imposing some of his steepest tariffs. The S&P 500 index rose 0.8 percent in early trading, with Nvidia contributing significantly to the market's upward movement. Analysts noted that the court ruling suggested extreme tariffs and rapidly changing tariffs are less likely, which reduces uncertainty. However, White House officials conveyed that they have other avenues for pursuing tariffs, potentially leading to continued market fluctuations.</p>
