          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James announced the indictment of five top executives from RCI Hospitality Holdings, a major strip club operator, for an alleged multi-million-dollar tax fraud and bribery scheme. The executives are accused of bribing a New York state tax auditor with complimentary trips and services at their clubs to avoid paying over $8 million in taxes between 2010 and 2024. The indictments led to a significant drop in RCI's stock price. James stated the action is part of a broader effort to combat corruption and ensure tax compliance.</p>

          <p>Shares of Webtoon Entertainment experienced a significant surge of nearly 39% after the company announced an expanded partnership with Disney to create a new digital comics platform. The deal will bring over 35,000 comics from Disney's Marvel, Star Wars, and other properties onto a single subscription service. As part of the agreement, Disney will also acquire a 2% equity stake in Webtoon. Analysts view the move as a major validation of Webtoon's platform, potentially diversifying its revenue and attracting other major intellectual property holders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to growing concerns over political violence, highlighted by the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk, House Republicans are proposing an additional $30 million for security funding. The proposal is part of a stopgap government funding bill and aims to reimburse local law enforcement for protecting lawmakers in their home districts. Lawmakers from both parties have expressed fear and reported adjusting their public activities due to the heightened threat level.

If the court rules in his favor, it could grant the executive branch near-total control over fiscal and monetary policy, effectively bypassing traditional checks and balances.

          <p>A fire broke out early Tuesday morning on the seventh floor of the Rosslyn Lofts, a high-rise apartment complex in downtown Los Angeles, resulting in one fatality. Over 100 firefighters responded to the challenging blaze, which was contained to a single unit where the deceased individual was later found. No other injuries were reported. The building, formerly the Rosslyn Hotel, has a history of building code violations, including numerous citations for roach infestations, though it is unclear if these issues contributed to the fire. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While mortgage purchase rates have been declining, interest rates for refinancing remain relatively high, making it costly for many homeowners to tap into their home equity through a traditional cash-out refinance. As an alternative, financial experts suggest considering a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a home equity loan. These options allow homeowners to borrow against their equity without altering their existing low-rate primary mortgage. A HELOC offers a variable-rate revolving line of credit, while a home equity loan provides a lump-sum payment with a fixed interest rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that President Trump's credible threat to let TikTok "go dark" in the U.S. was the key factor that motivated China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent explained that while the commercial terms were largely settled months ago, China stalled negotiations after the U.S. imposed new tariffs. Trump's willingness to sacrifice the popular app over national security concerns ultimately "turned the tide," leading to the current agreement being finalized. The White House has extended the divestiture deadline to December 16 to allow the deal to be completed.</p>

However, mental health experts interviewed by NPR counter these claims, stating that universal screenings actually reduce stigma by normalizing conversations about mental health.
