            <p>President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador has proposed a prisoner swap with Venezuela, offering to repatriate 252 Venezuelan deportees from the U.S., who are currently imprisoned in El Salvador, in exchange for the release of 252 political prisoners held in Venezuela. Bukele directed his proposal to President Nicolás Maduro via social media, listing family members of opposition figures, journalists, and activists detained in Venezuela. The proposal comes amidst international scrutiny of El Salvador's treatment of deportees, who are held in a "mega-prison." Venezuela's prosecutor's office responded critically, demanding a list of the detainees and their legal status. Optimism score: 40</p>

            <p>After reports surfaced that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used a second Signal chat to discuss last month's airstrikes in Yemen with his wife, brother and personal lawyer, Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois called for him to “resign in disgrace”. Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, also issued a statement, saying that he has “grave concerns about Secretary Hegseth’s ability to maintain the trust and confidence of U.S. servicemembers and the Commander-in-Chief.” Reed called on the Department of Defense's Office of the Inspector General to include this incident in its ongoing investigation of Hegseth’s handling of classified information.

JPMorgan expects President Donald Trump's tariff blitz to yield "some deals" between the US and its trade partners, but says tax rates will still multiply in size.

            <p>The Atlantic reviews the second season of HBO's "The Last of Us", noting its deviation from the game's storytelling, particularly in the depiction of Joel's death. While the show previously expanded on the game's characters and themes successfully, Season 2's plot detours feel awkwardly inserted, diminishing the shock and impact of key events. The reviewer argues that the show has become a punishing watch, leaning too far into characters' anguish and losing the elegant insights of the first season. Optimism score: 40</p>
