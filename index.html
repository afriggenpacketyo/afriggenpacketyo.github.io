          <p>Zhigang Peng's election as the next president-elect of the Seismological Society of America marks a growing trend of China-born scientists taking leadership roles in US academic societies. Peng, a geophysicist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, will be the first Chinese-American to hold the position. This reflects increasing representation despite historical under-representation, with virologist Shan-Lu Liu also set to lead the American Society for Virology. These milestones highlight the expanding impact and service of Chinese-American researchers within the broader scientific community, encouraging further leadership and contribution from this demographic.</p>

          <p>A significant explosion at Shahid Rajaee, a major Iranian port near Bandar Abbas, has resulted in at least 18 fatalities and 800 injuries, causing widespread damage to nearby buildings and infrastructure. The cause of the blast is disputed, with initial reports suggesting improper handling of flammable materials in unsealed containers. A maritime risk consultancy suggests the explosion was linked to solid fuel destined for ballistic missiles, while Iranian officials point to a fire in a chemical storage depot. The incident prompted the closure of schools and offices in the region and raised concerns about safety protocols at the port.</p>

          <p>Brian Fanion, a Massachusetts detective, was convicted of first-degree murder in the death of his wife, Amy Fanion, after investigators uncovered incriminating internet searches on his work computer. These searches, which included topics such as household poisons, methods to make a murder look like suicide, and gunshot residue testing, occurred in the months and days leading up to Amy's death. The prosecution argued that these searches, combined with Fanion's affair and inconsistencies in his statements, proved his premeditation. The defense argued that Amy suffered from mental health issues and that the searches were related to unrelated household concerns.</p>

The absence of gunshot residue on Amy's wound further fueled suspicion, leading to Brian's arrest and subsequent conviction for first-degree murder, though some family members continued to support him, believing Amy took her own life.</p>

Leno admitted it was a mistake to allow the humiliation to air, but he chose not to edit it out because it happened and he took responsibility. The feud stemmed from the "Tonight Show" debacle involving Conan O'Brien, and while they have publicly traded barbs over the years, Kimmel revealed in 2017 that they had made peace after Leno reached out following his son's heart surgery.</p>

While acknowledging the challenges of impeaching or removing Trump, the piece emphasizes that his biggest enemy is himself, and his hubris will ultimately lead to his self-destruction.

          <p>The European pharmaceutical industry is bracing for potential tariffs as President Trump threatens to impose higher levies on pharmaceuticals as part of his trade agenda. This move could significantly impact the flow of drugs from the EU to the US, affecting products like Ozempic, cancer treatments, and cardiovascular drugs. The consequences of such tariffs are uncertain but could lead to higher drug prices for American consumers and disruptions in the pharmaceutical supply chain.</p>

          <p>Australia is considering capping the number of international students as a measure to address unaffordable housing, driven by political pressure and voter concerns. This marks a significant shift for the country, which has historically viewed international education as a major export sector. Politicians argue that limiting international student numbers will reduce demand for rentals and starter homes, but critics warn it could negatively impact the economy and Australia's reputation as a welcoming destination for overseas students.</p>
