          <h2>Cardiologist Explains How Extreme Summer Heat Can Harm Heart Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 05:00:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cardiologist warns that extreme summer heat significantly strains the cardiovascular system, increasing the risk of cardiac events, especially for individuals with pre-existing conditions. As the body works to cool down, blood vessels widen, forcing the heart to pump faster and harder, which can lead to dehydration or thickened blood. The article highlights that even minor increases in body temperature can elevate heart rates and raise the risk of heart attacks and arrhythmias. To mitigate risks, it is advised to stay hydrated, avoid strenuous activity during peak heat, and seek cool, shaded environments.</p>

          <p>A vast tomb site from the Western Xia dynasty (1038–1227) in China has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. Located west of Yinchuan, the 40-square-kilometer area includes nine imperial mausoleums and over 270 subordinate tombs belonging to the Tangut people. The site also features extensive ancient flood control systems and a large architectural complex used for worship and administration. The World Heritage Committee recognized the site as a significant testament to the cultural fusion and interaction among diverse traditions along the ancient Silk Road.</p>

The event, which topped an all-female card, was celebrated as a major milestone for women's boxing, with Taylor expressing pride in their shared history-making moments.

          <p>President Trump visited Texas to praise the response to catastrophic flooding that has claimed over 100 lives, meeting with officials, first responders, and victims' families. During the visit, he deflected questions about the adequacy of local flood alert systems while emphasizing the supportive role of the federal government. This occurs against a backdrop of uncertainty regarding his administration's plans to overhaul or potentially eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its current form. State officials highlighted local leadership in recovery efforts, promising to review solutions for future disasters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is sending letters to foreign leaders detailing new tariff rates set to take effect, continuing an unpredictable trade policy. These letters, which follow a 90-day "pause" on previously announced tariffs, leave room for negotiation, suggesting rates could be lowered if countries reduce their own trade barriers. So far, only one new deal has been signed with the U.K., while many other major trading partners face significant new tariffs.

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the Air India crash that killed 260 people in Ahmedabad found that the plane's engines were starved of fuel just seconds after takeoff. The report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) reveals that cockpit voice recordings captured one pilot asking the other why the fuel was cut off, with the other denying he had done so. Both fuel control switches moved to the "cut-off" position, causing a total loss of power from which the aircraft could not recover. The investigation is ongoing, with a final report expected in about a year.</p>

          <p>A farm worker has reportedly died from injuries sustained during an immigration raid at a cannabis farm in Southern California. According to the United Farm Workers union, the individual died as a result of the enforcement action, during which about 200 undocumented migrants were arrested. The Department of Homeland Security stated the man was not being pursued by law enforcement when he climbed onto a greenhouse roof and fell 30 feet. The incident is part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration, which has sparked protests and a court order temporarily restricting certain aggressive arrest tactics.</p>

A late try from fly-half Ioan Edwards, who scored 16 points in his first start, ultimately sealed the much-needed win for the tourists. The victory provides a significant morale boost for Wales and levels the series at 1-1 ahead of a new permanent head coach being appointed.</p>

          <p>France's far-right National Rally party is carefully managing its relationship with the Trump administration, balancing ideological alignment with potential political risks as it aims for the 2027 presidential election. While sharing nationalist and anti-immigration views, the party maintains a distance due to French voters' general skepticism of Trump and concerns over the economic impact of US tariffs. Analysts suggest the National Rally seeks to appear moderate to attract mainstream voters, avoiding overly close ties with a leader who could harm the interests of its core electorate and its efforts to normalize its image.</p>

          <p>A proposal by German Education Minister Karin Prien to consider a quota for students with immigrant backgrounds in schools has ignited a national debate on education and integration. Prien suggested a cap of 30-40% could be a "conceivable model," but the idea has faced sharp criticism from educators, researchers, and student groups. Opponents argue it is impractical, discriminatory, and stigmatizes children, while supporters believe it could lead to better educational outcomes in mixed classrooms. The debate highlights broader challenges in Germany's education system, where a lack of German language skills is seen as a key problem.</p>

          <p>Jane Ragsdale, the well-known and loved owner and director of the Heart O' the Hills camp for girls, was among those killed in the catastrophic flooding in Kerrville, Texas. Ragsdale, who was in her late 60s, was a central figure in the community, known for her generosity, leadership, and dedication to the generations of girls who attended her camp. Friends and community members remember her as embodying the spirit of the region, teaching campers essential life skills and leading mission work abroad.

          <h2>Analysis Warns Alliance Between US Tech and MAGA Movement Could Complicate China Rivalry</h2>

          <p>Chinese academic analysis suggests that the growing "uneasy alliance" between US tech titans and the MAGA movement could intensify the rivalry with China but may ultimately backfire. Researchers note that tech leaders backing former President Trump are pushing for continued pressure on China's tech sector and further decoupling. However, they also point to potential tensions between the tech elite and the broader MAGA camp that could undermine these efforts. The analysis highlights a trend of US tech firms deepening cooperation with the defense industry, potentially creating more assertive "tech hawks" in foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Evacuation orders have been issued for parts of Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona due to multiple lightning-sparked wildfires. The Dragon Bravo Fire inside the park and the larger White Sage Fire to the north have forced the evacuation of all residents and hundreds of visitors from the North Rim area. Firefighting efforts are being challenged by strong winds, low humidity, and dry conditions in rugged terrain, with both fires currently at 0% containment. The fires are part of a broader trend of increased wildfire risk across the western US due to hot, dry weather.</p>
