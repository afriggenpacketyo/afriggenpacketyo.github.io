          <p>As the death toll from catastrophic flash floods in Texas continues to rise, officials are facing scrutiny regarding the timeliness and adequacy of their emergency response. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the "streamlined" FEMA response, while sharing an emotional account of consoling grieving families at a local summer camp. The story of a man searching for his missing parents highlights the immense personal tragedy amid the widespread devastation. President Trump has announced plans to visit the disaster-stricken area on Friday to survey the damage.</p>

          <p>Two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz secured his spot in the Wimbledon semifinals with a dominant straight-sets victory over Britain's Cameron Norrie. The Spanish second seed showcased his grass-court prowess, extending his winning streak to 23 matches and ending British hopes in the men's singles draw. Alcaraz is set to face American fifth seed Taylor Fritz, who reached his first Wimbledon semifinal by defeating Russia's Karen Khachanov in a hard-fought four-set match. Fritz is now the last American man hoping to end the country's long drought for a men's Grand Slam title.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is expected to announce an end to the mandatory "shoes-off" policy for many travelers at U.S. airports, according to Department of Homeland Security sources. This change would extend the convenience currently enjoyed by TSA PreCheck members to passengers in standard security lines. The policy was originally implemented in 2006 following the attempted "shoe bomber" incident in 2001. This move is part of a broader effort by the current administration to reduce travel hassles, following other recent changes like a new dedicated security lane for active-duty military members.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a forthcoming 50% tariff on all copper imports, a move aimed at revitalizing domestic production of the essential metal. The announcement caused copper futures to surge to a record high, while shares of U.S. copper miners like Freeport-McMoRan also rose in anticipation of benefiting from the new protectionist measure. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the completion of a national security investigation into copper imports, stating the goal is to bring production home. The U.S. currently imports nearly half of its copper, primarily from Chile. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Justice Department and FBI memo stating no evidence of a Jeffrey Epstein "client list" was found has sparked outrage among President Trump's supporters, with many directing their anger at Attorney General Pam Bondi.

The White House and Bondi have since clarified she was referring to the entire case file, not a specific list.

          <p>As Americans face record credit card debt with average interest rates around 22%, debt consolidation has become an increasingly popular strategy for financial relief. Before pursuing this option, consumers should understand that strategies extend beyond personal loans to include balance transfer cards and specialized debt consolidation programs. Even with current interest rates, consolidating high-rate debt can lead to significant savings. It is also important to recognize that there are limits on the amount and types of debt that can be consolidated, as these options typically apply only to unsecured debts like credit cards and medical bills.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday his intention to impose tariffs of up to 200% on imported pharmaceuticals, stating the move could happen "very soon." However, he also suggested that pharmaceutical companies would be given a grace period of approximately a year and a half to move their production to the U.S. before the steep levies take effect. This is the president's most significant threat of pharmaceutical-specific tariffs since initiating a national security investigation into these imports in April.

          <p>New research from UC San Diego reveals that feral western honeybees, which are not native to the Americas, are dominating ecosystems in Southern California and crowding out native bee species. The study, conducted in a San Diego biodiversity hotspot, found that these non-native bees now constitute about 90% of all bees in the area. Researchers observed that the aggressive foraging of honeybees removes over 80% of available pollen from certain native plants daily, leaving little for native pollinators like bumblebees. This competition threatens native bee populations and may negatively impact the fitness of the local plant community.</p>

          <h2>Jon Stewart Criticizes Paramount's $16 Million Settlement with Trump as a 'Shakedown'</h2>

          <p>On "The Daily Show," Jon Stewart sharply criticized parent company Paramount Global for its $16 million settlement of a lawsuit brought by President Trump against CBS News' "60 Minutes." Stewart and guest Steve Kroft characterized the payment as a "shakedown" and "protection money" intended to ensure Trump's FCC would not block Paramount's pending merger with Skydance Media. Trump had sued over an interview with Kamala Harris, claiming it was edited unfairly. Stewart contrasted this with what he described as a more egregious edit of a Trump interview on Fox News, questioning the double standard.</p>

          <h2>Consumer Inflation Expectations Decline to Pre-Tariff Levels, NY Fed Survey Shows</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 13:22:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A monthly survey from the New York Federal Reserve indicates that consumer fears about tariff-driven inflation have subsided, with short-term inflation expectations falling back to levels seen before the recent trade policy announcements. In June, respondents anticipated an inflation rate of 3% over the next year, down from a peak of 3.6% in March and April. While the overall outlook has eased, consumers still expect significant price increases in specific categories like medical care, college education, and rent. The survey also showed improved sentiment regarding the labor market, with fewer people expecting to lose their jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant policy reversal, the IRS has stated in a federal court filing that churches and other houses of worship can endorse political candidates without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. This new interpretation effectively upends the Johnson Amendment, a 70-year-old provision of the tax code that has historically barred such political activities by nonprofits. The statement was part of a proposed settlement in a lawsuit brought by the National Religious Broadcasters and two Texas churches. This development aligns with a long-standing goal of President Trump to repeal the amendment, raising new questions about the intersection of religion and politics.</p>

          <p>Despite a 2-1 loss to Mexico in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final, U.S. men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino found a silver lining in his team's performance. Fielding a young and inexperienced roster due to missing starters, the team demonstrated grit and determination throughout the tournament, which Pochettino viewed as a crucial test of character ahead of the World Cup. Players like Diego Luna made a strong case for future inclusion on the national team roster. While the team was outplayed in the final, the coach believes the experience helped forge a new, non-negotiable standard of effort and pride for the program.</p>
