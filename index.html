          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, speaking at an expo in Beijing, predicted that artificial intelligence and robotics will replace most human labor in factories within the next ten years. He described AI as a fundamental infrastructure, similar to electricity or the internet, that is set to revolutionize global supply chains by optimizing how goods are designed, built, and moved. Huang also noted that the U.S. government has indicated it will grant licenses for Nvidia to export its less powerful H20 chips, which are specifically designed for the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>Adelita Grijalva, the daughter of the late Representative Raul Grijalva, has won the Democratic primary for Arizona's 7th Congressional District. Backed by prominent establishment and progressive figures, she defeated several other candidates in the heavily Democratic district. The race was seen as a significant contest, reflecting the ongoing dynamics within the Democratic Party between its different ideological and generational wings. Grijalva is now the strong favorite to win the special election in September and serve the remainder of her father's term.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to create national standards for Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) compensation for college athletes. This move follows the recent advancement of a House bill, the "SCORE Act," aimed at superseding the various state laws that currently regulate how student-athletes can earn money. The NIL rule changes, enacted by the NCAA in 2021 after legal and political pressure, have already dramatically reshaped college sports by allowing athletes to profit from endorsements and other deals, creating a multi-million dollar industry.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a preliminary trade agreement with Indonesia, stating it includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian imports into the U.S. while granting American goods tariff-free access. According to Trump, the deal also involves significant Indonesian purchases of U.S. energy, agricultural products, and Boeing aircraft. However, officials in Jakarta have not yet confirmed these terms, leaving the final details of the agreement unclear. This announcement follows a similar pattern to a recent trade deal touted with Vietnam, where official confirmation was also delayed. (not investment advice)</p>

This action is part of a broader and controversial U.S. policy to send deportees to third countries that are not their country of origin.

The board resisted the demand, arguing in a letter that Moul's short tenure has aligned with the administration's energy goals. This conflict arose after President Trump was influenced by country singer John Rich's campaign against a proposed TVA gas plant near Nashville.

          <p>Amid an ongoing immigration crackdown by the Trump administration, some migrant workers are using mobile applications that crowdsource and display the locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. One such app, Coqui, allows users like Oscar, a Venezuelan worker with temporary protected status, to check for nearby ICE activity and alter their travel routes to avoid potential detainment. While users say the apps alleviate fear, an ICE official described them as dangerous, potentially impeding law enforcement efforts and creating ambush risks for agents. The app's developer created it after his own employees became too scared to leave home for work.</p>

          <p>Brazil's top prosecutor has formally recommended that the Supreme Federal Court find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of attempting a coup following his 2022 election loss. The prosecutor's filing accuses Bolsonaro and seven others of forming an "armed criminal association" to "violently overthrow the democratic order." The charges relate to Bolsonaro's unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud and the subsequent storming of government buildings by his supporters on January 8, 2023. If convicted, Bolsonaro could face up to 40 years in prison for the charges, which he has dismissed as a "witch hunt."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of central banks are bypassing international markets and buying gold directly from domestic mines to bolster their reserves. According to the World Gold Council, this strategy allows countries like Ghana, Colombia, and the Philippines to acquire gold using local currency, preserving their foreign exchange reserves. This method is often cheaper than buying on the global market and supports the local mining industry. The trend is driven by soaring gold prices and a desire among central banks to hedge against geopolitical risks and strengthen their financial buffers. (not investment advice)</p>

However, he expressed disappointment with the negative market reactions to earnings reports from asset manager BlackRock and Wells Fargo, despite what he saw as underlying strengths.

His conviction was overturned in 2021 after efforts from the California Innocence Project and the L.A. County District Attorney's Conviction Integrity Unit.

Murdoch was serving a life sentence for shooting Falconio and attempting to kidnap his girlfriend, Joanne Lees, on a remote highway. Despite his conviction, Murdoch never revealed the location of Falconio's body, an act of silence that authorities said denied the victim's family closure. Under a "no body, no parole" law, he would not have been eligible for parole without disclosing the remains' location.</p>

          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision allowing the Trump administration to proceed with dismantling the Department of Education, an education policy expert weighed in on the potential impacts. Michael Petrilli of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute noted that the Office for Civil Rights and the Financial Aid Office have faced the most significant cuts. While he believes most students and teachers won't feel a direct daily impact due to the federal government's limited role in local schooling, he expressed concern that the smaller civil rights office may struggle to handle discrimination complaints.

The review, authored by Professor Gillian Leng, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors, and states they should not be diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow a heated debate over the roles and responsibilities of these positions, which were introduced to support doctors but have led to concerns about blurred lines and patient safety.</p>

The ambitious project will involve replacing 16,000 panes of glass and repairing the corroded ironwork of the 175-year-old Victorian structure. The renovation will also aim to make the building net-zero by replacing its gas boilers with heat pumps. In preparation, horticulturalists have begun the complex process of moving over 1,300 tropical plants, including a 250-year-old cycad that weighs more than a tonne.</p>

Trump cited a Fannie Mae memo which noted "possible occupancy misrepresentation" but did not accuse Schiff of fraud.
