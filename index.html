        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nicole Daedone and Rachel Cherwitz, leaders of the sex-focused women's wellness company OneTaste Inc., were convicted on federal forced labor charges after a Brooklyn jury found them guilty of coercing employees into performing demeaning tasks with little or no pay. Prosecutors argued that Daedone and Cherwitz ran a yearslong scheme that used economic, sexual, and psychological abuse to force OneTaste members into sexual acts they found uncomfortable. Witnesses testified they were coerced into becoming a "handler" for OneTaste's first investor, performing demeaning sexual acts at his direction under the guise of achieving "freedom" and "enlightenment." The defense argued that the witnesses chose to participate and were not forced to do anything, but the jury ultimately sided with the prosecution, unmasking Daedone and Cherwitz as grifters who preyed on vulnerable victims. The optimism score for this article is relatively low due to the severity of the crimes and exploitation involved.</p>

          <p>Approximately 700 active-duty Marines have arrived in Los Angeles to support the National Guard troops responding to protests over federal immigration enforcement. The Marines, based out of Twentynine Palms, will integrate with the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property, having received training in de-escalation and crowd control. California Governor Gavin Newsom has expressed strong opposition to the deployment, suggesting he may take legal action, deeming it an illegal use of military force for political purposes. Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDowell voiced concerns about the lack of coordination and the logistical challenges posed by the arrival of federal forces, emphasizing the need for clear communication between all agencies to prevent escalation. The deployment follows tense protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests, with the Trump administration arguing it's necessary to protect federal agents from violence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the Karen Read murder trial, a defense expert, Dr. Elizabeth Laposata, testified that John O'Keefe did not sustain fatal injuries on the lawn as prosecutors claim, suggesting he hit his head on an uneven surface instead. Laposata argued that the tear in O'Keefe's scalp and the absence of grass in the wound contradicted the prosecution's theory of a fall on a flat surface. While she agreed that blunt force trauma caused O'Keefe's death, she disputed signs of hypothermia, contradicting the official autopsy's second cause of death. This testimony challenges the prosecution's narrative presented by Dr. Aizik Wolf, who stated that O'Keefe's injuries were consistent with a backward fall on ice. The article's optimism score reflects the uncertainty surrounding the case and the conflicting expert opinions.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that he is "not writing a blank cheque" for the Sizewell C nuclear project, despite the government's commitment of Â£14.2 billion to the development. The project, aimed at creating 10,000 jobs over the next decade and ensuring energy security, faces opposition due to potential costs and environmental impacts. The government hopes the investment will attract private funding, but critics like Alison Downes from Stop Sizewell C argue that ministers have not been transparent about the project's total cost. Despite the government's assurances, completion is expected in the mid-2030s, with the project intended to power six million homes.

          <p>President Trump federalized the California National Guard without Governor Gavin Newsom's request, marking an unprecedented move in the context of urban unrest. This decision, made in response to protests against ICE raids in Los Angeles, overrides Newsom's authority over the Guard. Experts argue that deploying the military as a hostile force is a recipe for trouble, and that these deployments have historically been of limited value, even with agreement between the president and governor. The deployment has been criticized as unwise and unhelpful, with the Pentagon appearing unprepared and lacking clear rules of engagement. The optimism score is low due to the potential for escalation and the disregard for state sovereignty.</p>

The number of available jobs fell by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate increased from 4.5% to 4.6%, the highest in almost four years. This trend is attributed to rising employment costs, including increased National Insurance contributions paid by employers and a rise in the minimum wage.

          <p>The Trump administration plans to appeal a court order requiring it to allow hundreds of noncitizens deported to El Salvador to challenge their detentions. A judge ruled that these individuals, deported under the Alien Enemies Act, have the right to challenge the government's claims against them.

          <p>Apple announced iOS 26 at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, showcasing a new user interface enhancement called Liquid Glass. This update, described as Apple's "broadest design update ever," features a dynamic interface that mimics the qualities of glass, making apps and widgets appear translucent. Other updates include enhancements to existing apps like Facetime, Photos, and Safari, as well as new AI-powered features like Live Translation and Visual Intelligence.
