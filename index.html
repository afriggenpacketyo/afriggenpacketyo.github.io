          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 00:00:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's defense ministry announced the opening of three new military academies, sparking significant interest among young Chinese citizens, with the announcement garnering over 8 million views on Weibo. While recruitment numbers will remain consistent with previous years, these new academies represent a restructuring effort to create a more efficient military education system focused on war preparation. This restructuring includes merging units from existing military schools and removing the requirement for work experience before students can become commanders, allowing them to pursue postgraduate studies immediately after graduation, streamlining the path to leadership roles within the military. The move reflects China's ongoing efforts to modernize its military and attract talented individuals to serve their country. Optimism surrounding the ability to serve the country is palpable.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump asserted that the damage to Iran's nuclear sites was accurately described as "obliteration," disputing Iranian attempts to downplay the strikes. General Dan Caine, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed severe damage and destruction to facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, but stopped short of using the term "obliteration." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that precision munitions struck their intended targets with the desired effect. The UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi expressed caution, stating that assessing the damage to the Fordo facility was not yet possible, while reports indicated some highly enriched uranium had been moved prior to the strikes. The operation, code-named Operation Midnight Hammer, involved multiple aircraft and munitions, including bunker-buster bombs and Tomahawk missiles.</p>

The restructuring is designed to create synergies across Alibabaâ€™s consumer-facing businesses, reinforcing the e-commerce group's role as the companyâ€™s main profit engine, and streamlining operations.</p>

          <p>A man opened fire outside CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan, before being fatally shot by church staff, preventing a potential mass shooting. The gunman, a 31-year-old with no known connection to the church, was spotted driving recklessly and wearing a tactical vest while carrying a rifle and handgun. He shot one person in the leg before a parishioner struck him with their vehicle, giving security staff time to engage and neutralize the threat. Police believe the suspect was suffering from a mental health crisis, and about 150 people were inside the church at the time of the incident.</p>

          <p>Narciso Barranco, an immigrant father of three Marines, was violently detained and injured by masked federal agents in Orange County, according to his son, Alejandro Barranco. A video circulating online shows Barranco being taken down, pinned, and repeatedly punched while working outside a Santa Ana IHOP. His son reported that Barranco was pepper-sprayed and beaten, resulting in a dislocated shoulder, and was denied medical treatment, food, and water for over 24 hours in detention. The Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have not yet responded to requests for comment regarding the incident, which has sparked outrage and a GoFundMe campaign to support Barranco's legal representation.</p>

The possibility of Iran blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a critical artery for global oil trade, has further fueled market anxiety.

          <p>A federal judge in Nashville ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia can be released on bail, but he will likely be taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody instead. Despite the judge's decision that the government failed to prove Abrego Garcia was a flight risk, she acknowledged that he would likely remain in custody due to an ICE detainer. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was previously deported to El Salvador's CECOT prison despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation to that country. Prosecutors allege he conspired to transport thousands of migrants without legal status across the U.S., while the defense argues the charges are a distraction from the lack of due process in his case.</p>

          <p>Pentagon officials revealed details about Operation Midnight Hammer, the U.S. mission to bomb Iranian nuclear sites, calling it the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history." Seven B-2 Spirit bombers flew from Missouri to Iran, while others acted as decoys. The mission involved in-flight refuelings, U.S. fighter jets, and the launch of Tomahawk cruise missiles. The B-2s dropped GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) on sites at Fordo and Natanz, and officials claim Iran's air defenses did not engage. Initial assessments indicate severe damage to the targeted facilities, and the U.S. has warned Iran against retaliation.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, former President Donald Trump addressed the issue of regime change in Iran, suggesting that if the current regime cannot "MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN," a regime change may be necessary. In a post on Truth Social, Trump applied his "MIGA" rhetoric to the Middle East. This statement follows Trump's decision to bomb three Iranian nuclear sites, which he described as a "spectacular military success," and indicates a continued hardline stance toward Iran.</p>

Decisions on leasing pandas abroad are typically revealed during high-level bilateral talks, and experts suggest a new loan may be announced during a possible visit by a Chinese political leader to Japan. Currently, Japan hosts six pandas, but four are set to return to China, with the remaining two due to return next February. Amidst rising tensions with the United States, this gesture could serve to stabilize China's relations with Japan.</p>

          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships revealed that parents who rarely face defiance avoid threats, bribes, and harsh consequences, instead using language that encourages cooperation. Traditional parenting phrases often trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, while language that honors a child's autonomy while still holding boundaries fosters cooperation. The article suggests alternative phrases to replace toxic ones, focusing on respect, emotional safety, and involvement to create conditions where cooperation feels natural. By shifting from control and criticism to empathy and leadership, parents can reduce power struggles and raise emotionally resilient children.</p>
