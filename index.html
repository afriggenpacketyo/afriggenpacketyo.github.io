          <p>Moldova's Central Electoral Commission has barred the pro-Russia party, Heart of Moldova, from participating in the upcoming parliamentary elections. The decision follows a court ruling that limited the party's activities amid an investigation into illegal financing and allegations of a Russian-backed vote-buying scheme. This exclusion is a significant development in a critical election for the EU-candidate nation, as the ruling pro-European party faces a challenge from a bloc of Russia-friendly parties.</p>

The decision is based on a long-term turnaround strategy under CEO Elliott Hill, which focuses on core products and key markets after a period of decline attributed to issues in China, a flawed direct-to-consumer strategy, and increased competition. The club is optimistic about Nike's recovery, citing leadership changes, restored retail partnerships, and a cleaner inventory outlook as positive signs for future growth and margin improvement.

The program has generated immediate, strong interest from wealthy individuals globally, particularly from China and India, positioning it as a competitive option in the "golden visa" market. However, the program faces potential legal challenges and logistical hurdles, as its implementation relies on workarounds of existing immigration law and there is currently no formal application process available.</p>

          <p>Howard Rubin, a 70-year-old former bond trader, has been arrested on federal charges of sex trafficking and transporting women across state lines for commercial sex acts. The indictment alleges that over a decade, Rubin and his former assistant operated a network where women were brutalized in encounters that went beyond their consent, sometimes resulting in significant injuries. This criminal indictment follows a 2022 civil verdict where Rubin was found liable for sex trafficking and ordered to pay millions in damages to six women.</p>

          <p>During a contentious speech at the UN General Assembly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sharply criticized Western nations for recognizing a Palestinian state, calling the move a "mark of shame" that rewards terrorism. His address prompted a walkout by dozens of diplomats, leaving the hall partially empty. Netanyahu reiterated Israel's staunch opposition to a Palestinian state, rejected UN findings of genocide in Gaza, and claimed his speech was being broadcast into Gaza to reach remaining Israeli hostages.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has confirmed that the FDA is conducting a review of the safety and efficacy of the abortion pill mifepristone. This review comes in response to concerns raised by Republican attorneys general and anti-abortion groups, particularly regarding the increased accessibility of the drug through telehealth and mail services. While advocates for the pill maintain its strong safety record, the review could potentially lead to new restrictions on its availability, though an outright ban is considered unlikely.</p>

          <p>Decades after France concluded 193 nuclear tests in French Polynesia, the region continues to suffer from the long-term consequences, including high cancer rates and environmental contamination. Activists and local politicians like Hinamoeura Morgant-Cross are raising global awareness, stating their people were used as "guinea pigs" for France's geopolitical ambitions. Despite a 2010 compensation law, victims face significant hurdles in proving their illnesses are linked to the tests, and calls for a formal apology and better medical support from France persist.</p>

          <p>Following comments by President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., this article analyzes the scientific basis for claims associating acetaminophen (Tylenol) with autism. While some observational studies suggest a possible link, no high-quality research has established a causal relationship, and a major study of 2.4 million births found no association. Medical experts caution against drawing definitive conclusions from the existing data and advise pregnant women to consult their doctors, noting that acetaminophen remains the only approved painkiller for use during pregnancy.</p>

With a slump in the property sector and limited overseas investment options, more Chinese retail investors are returning to stocks, though the market's retail-driven nature means volatility remains a risk.

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a 100% tariff on imported branded drugs has raised significant concerns for the UK's pharmaceutical industry. The UK was not included in a broader tariff deal agreed upon with the U.S. five months ago, leaving the sector vulnerable despite previous promises of preferential treatment. While some analysts believe major UK firms with U.S. manufacturing plans may be exempt, the move highlights the incomplete nature of the UK-US trade relationship and creates economic uncertainty for a critical British industry.</p>
