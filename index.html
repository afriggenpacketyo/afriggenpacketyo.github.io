Baldwin Park Police Department officers were responding to a call about a person "shooting with a rifle" when the shooting occurred. The injured officer was transported to a local hospital in stable condition, marking a tragic event for the community and law enforcement.

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly reached an agreement with Wolves to sign Brazilian striker Matheus Cunha for £62.5m.

Cunha, who scored 31 goals in 76 appearances for Wolves, underwent a medical in Manchester before joining the Brazilian national side.

The Home Office reported that 1,194 people made the journey in 18 small boats, contributing to a year-to-date total of 14,811 arrivals, a 42% increase from last year. Defence Secretary John Healey criticized the situation, describing scenes of migrants being transported by smugglers as "shocking" and emphasized the need for improved cooperation with French authorities to intercept smugglers.

          <p>This article contrasts Western media portrayals of South Africa with local perspectives on violence and land ownership. It highlights South Africa's high murder rate, disproportionate attacks on farmsteads, and disapproval of the chant 'Kill the Boer, Kill the farmer.' The article challenges the common narrative about land ownership, noting that while white South Africans own a significant portion of land, much of it is in arid regions, and land distribution is influenced by the government's denial of individual title in Black communities. Polling data indicates that South Africans prioritize job creation over land redistribution and oppose expropriation legislation.</p>

The article connects these disparities to historical exclusion of women from intellectual spaces and the persistent gender pay gap, arguing that achieving true equality requires addressing these imbalances in domestic arrangements.</p>

Around 220 emergency workers responded to the blaze, treating over 35 injured people. The fire brigade reported that they could not reach the three victims during the rescue effort, and they died at the scene. Two people were taken to another hospital for treatment, one with life-threatening injuries, and others suffered serious and minor wounds.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an infrared contact lens that allows humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lenses combine conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred due to light scattering, tests showed that humans could recognize patterns and signals in the dark, even with closed eyes. Potential applications include surgical procedures, encryption, and rescue operations, although critics note that existing night vision devices are more powerful.</p>
