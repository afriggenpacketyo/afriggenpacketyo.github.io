          <h2>Nick Saban Downplays Rumors of a Return to Coaching</h2>

          <p>Former Alabama coach Nick Saban has largely dismissed speculation about his return to college football, stating he is content with his current life and new roles. In a recent interview, he humorously recounted a moment of considering a return while doing chores, but affirmed his commitment to his family and his new work involving the sport's integrity. Saban, who retired after the 2024 Rose Bowl, emphasized his enjoyment of spending more time with his family and grandchildren, suggesting a return to the sidelines is not imminent.</p>

          <p>A new executive order by President Trump addressing homelessness has sparked controversy and confusion among local officials and advocates. The order promotes the civil commitment of individuals with mental illness and funds for encampment removal, while deprioritizing "housing first" and "harm reduction" strategies. While some see potential funding for programs like Mayor Karen Bass’s Inside Safe, critics from organizations like the National Homelessness Law Center decry it as a punitive measure that criminalizes homelessness and will ultimately worsen the crisis.</p>

          <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has allocated over $600 million in grant funding for states and local governments to detain undocumented migrants. This new program aims to alleviate overcrowding in federal facilities and supports the administration's mass deportation objectives. The move represents a significant shift from a previous FEMA program that provided shelter and services for released migrants, drawing criticism amid a broader restructuring of the agency that has seen numerous staff departures.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already serving life in Idaho for the murder of her two children, received additional life sentences in Arizona for conspiring to murder her estranged husband, Charles Vallow, and her niece's ex-husband, Brandon Boudreaux. During the emotional sentencing, family members, including her only surviving son, described her as a "monster" and the cause of their family's tragedy.

          <p>President Trump has indicated that the U.S. may not secure a new trade deal with Canada, suggesting a tariff-based approach might be the alternative. The statement comes as an August 1 deadline approaches for Canada and other nations to renegotiate trade terms with the U.S. as part of the administration's global tariff strategy. Canadian officials have maintained they will not be rushed into a "bad deal." Without a new agreement, the U.S. has threatened a 35% tax on Canadian goods not covered by the existing North American free trade pact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UN's World Food Programme has issued a stark warning about the escalating hunger crisis in Gaza, stating that almost one in three people are going for days without eating. Malnutrition is reportedly surging, with 90,000 women and children in urgent need of treatment, and the Hamas-run health ministry has reported more deaths from starvation. Amid mounting international pressure on Israel to lift aid restrictions, a US security contractor has alleged witnessing war crimes by the IDF and US contractors at food distribution sites, claims which the involved foundation denies.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Health Service (NHS) is bracing for significant disruption as resident doctors in England commence a five-day strike over a pay dispute. Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged the challenges but stated efforts are being made to minimize the impact on services, urging patients to attend appointments unless canceled. The British Medical Association (BMA) initiated the strike after failing to reach an agreement with the government, warning that staff are stretched thin. The union has already agreed to some requests for doctors to return to work in critical hospital units under pressure.</p>

This phase is now 98% complete and expected to open later in 2025. The full seven-station expansion, aiming for completion by the 2028 Olympics, is a critical project for one of Metro's most heavily used rail lines.</p>

The move highlights CEO Elon Musk's increasing focus on autonomous technology as the company's future, especially as its electric vehicle sales have declined.

An internal investigation found that players and personnel were selling tickets to "bundlers," violating league rules that prohibit reselling tickets above face value. According to a league memo, the policy is in place to prevent individuals from profiting from their NFL affiliation at the expense of fans.

          <p>"Diciannove (Nineteen)," a new Italian film from director Giovanni Tortorici and producer Luca Guadagnino, is reviewed as a vibrant and messy coming-of-age story. The film follows Leonardo, a 19-year-old literature student in Siena, as he navigates intellectual arrogance, loneliness, and the chaotic temptations of youth. The review praises the film's playful and energetic filmmaking style, which mirrors the protagonist's turbulent inner world, and highlights a compelling lead performance by Manfredi Marini. While the technical brio can sometimes feel tiring, the film effectively captures the missteps and confusion of being on the cusp of adulthood.</p>
