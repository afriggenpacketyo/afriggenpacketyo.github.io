          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved plans for a second runway at London Gatwick Airport, a privately-financed £2.2bn project. This expansion aims to boost economic growth, create thousands of jobs, and increase annual flight capacity significantly by the late 2030s. Despite government support and economic benefits, the plan faces strong opposition from climate campaigners who deem it an environmental disaster, while local residents have secured stricter noise controls and compensation measures.</p>

          <p>European stocks experienced a slight decline, with auto manufacturers facing significant losses, most notably Porsche, whose shares fell by approximately 6.7%. This drop followed the luxury sportscar manufacturer's decision to slash its 2025 profitability outlook and delay electric car model launches due to weak demand. The broader market was also influenced by the Trump administration's surprise increase in H-1B visa application fees, impacting companies reliant on international talent.</p>

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has warned Israel against annexing West Bank territories in response to the UK's recognition of Palestinian statehood, a significant policy shift announced by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. This move, coordinated with Canada, Australia, and Portugal, aims to revive the two-state solution amid ongoing conflict and devastation in Gaza. While welcomed by the Palestinian Authority, Israel condemned it as a reward for terrorism, and the US described it as a diplomatic gift to Hamas.</p>

          <p>"Silent Hill f" is hailed as a triumph in the iconic psychological horror series, marking a strong return for the franchise after a decade of neglect. Set in 1960s Japan, the game explores themes of mental fragility and societal pressures through its protagonist, Hinako, battling both internal and external horrors. Critics praise its bold narrative risks, artfully crafted cutscenes, relentless pacing, and smart puzzles, solidifying its place as one of the best entries since "Silent Hill 2."</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that global leaders are projected to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels by 2030 than is consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius, despite Paris Agreement commitments. The 2025 Production Gap Report indicates that the 20 most polluting countries, including China and the US, plan to increase fossil fuel production, with China driving much of the coal increase. This stark reality underscores a significant failure to meet climate targets, despite pledges made at international conferences.</p>
