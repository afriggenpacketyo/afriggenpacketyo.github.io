          <p>In a direct response to new U.S. fees on Chinese ships, Beijing has announced it will impose its own charges on American vessels docking at Chinese ports, effective the same day. China's Ministry of Transport stated the U.S. fees violate international trading principles and will harm maritime trade between the two nations. The retaliatory measure is seen as another escalation in the ongoing tit-for-tat trade dispute. Analysts predict this move could lead to increased costs for U.S. consumers and reduced profits for shipping companies, further straining economic relations.</p>

          <p>Venezuela's government has requested an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council, citing what it calls "mounting threats" from the United States. Caracas alleges that recent U.S. military strikes on supposed drug boats off its coast are a pretext for a potential armed attack and part of a broader 'regime change' policy. The request accuses the Trump administration of threatening regional peace and stability. This move highlights the severely deteriorated relations between the two countries, with Venezuela expressing fears of an imminent military confrontation.</p>

          <p>Russia has conducted a massive wave of drone and missile strikes across Ukraine, primarily targeting the country's energy infrastructure and causing widespread blackouts. The attacks, which also damaged residential buildings and resulted in civilian casualties, are seen as a calculated effort to cripple Ukraine ahead of the winter heating season. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strikes as cynical acts of terror against civilians. He has urgently appealed to international allies, including the U.S. and Europe, for more advanced air defense systems to counter the ongoing threat.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has officially designated Google's search and search advertising services with "strategic market status," activating new regulatory powers. This move follows a nine-month investigation that concluded Google has "substantial and entrenched market power," with over 90% of UK searches on its platform. While not a finding of wrongdoing, the designation allows the CMA to impose conduct requirements on Google. Potential changes could include enforcing fairer search rankings and giving publishers more control over their content.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire agreement has officially gone into effect in Gaza, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirming troops have started moving to pre-agreed deployment lines. This initial phase is part of a broader U.S.-brokered peace plan that sets a 72-hour timeline for Hamas to release all remaining living hostages. In exchange, Israel is set to release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. International bodies like the Red Cross are urging that the releases be handled safely and with dignity, while humanitarian aid is expected to resume at full capacity.</p>

          <p>Colonial Williamsburg, the largest living-history museum in the United States, is actively working to provide a more accurate and comprehensive depiction of America's founding, including the brutal reality of slavery. This article examines the museum's evolution from a nostalgic and patriotic portrayal of the past to one that confronts its difficult truths. It also explores the significant emotional challenges faced by the site's Black interpreters, who often endure visitor harassment while educating the public about the history of enslavement and the lives of African Americans in the colonial era.</p>

          <p>A new biography, "Pride and Pleasure," by Amanda Vaill, offers a fresh perspective on the American Revolution by focusing on the lives of sisters Angelica, Eliza, and Peggy Schuyler. The book argues that understanding the domestic sphere is crucial to understanding the political events of the era. It particularly highlights the often-overlooked contributions of Eliza Schuyler Hamilton, who, after her husband Alexander's death, lived for another 50 years. During her long widowhood, she became a key philanthropist and the primary archivist of her husband's and other Founders' historical papers.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi's bid to become Japan's first female prime minister has been complicated by the sudden departure of the Komeito party from the country's ruling coalition. The split ends a political alliance with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that had lasted for over two decades, leaving the LDP without a majority in parliament. Komeito's leadership cited unresolved issues related to a political funding scandal as the reason for their withdrawal. While the LDP remains the largest party, it will now need to negotiate with other opposition parties to pass legislation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed the defamation lawsuit filed by Drake in response to Kendrick Lamar's highly successful diss track, "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that the song's lyrics, which included accusations of pedophilia against Drake, were protected as "nonactionable opinion" and "hyperbolic vituperations" within the context of a rap battle. The court determined that a reasonable listener would not interpret the track as conveying verifiable facts. Drake had filed the lawsuit against Universal Music Group, the label for both artists, rather than against Lamar directly.</p>

          <p>Letitia James, the Attorney General of New York, has been indicted on federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. The charges stem from a mortgage she obtained for a property in Virginia, which prosecutors claim she improperly used as a rental investment instead of a secondary residence as required by the loan terms. James has vehemently denied the allegations, calling the case a politically motivated act of revenge orchestrated by President Donald Trump, whom she previously prosecuted in a high-profile civil fraud case.</p>

Although the letters can be accessed online, many beneficiaries are elderly or have disabilities that make using digital tools difficult.
