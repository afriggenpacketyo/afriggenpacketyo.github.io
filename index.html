          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has publicly condemned the Trump administration's plan to deploy federal agents for an immigration crackdown in Chicago, calling it a dangerous and disruptive "invasion." Pritzker stated that his administration has not been contacted by the White House and argued that such actions, especially if they involve military troops, are illegal without a state of emergency. He emphasized that local and state authorities are successfully managing crime and that the federal government's uncoordinated actions could inflame tensions rather than provide genuine help.</p>

          <p>A new tropical storm, named Kiko, has formed in the eastern Pacific Ocean over 1,000 miles from the coast of Mexico, posing no immediate threat to land. The U.S. National Hurricane Center reported that the storm currently has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and is moving westward. Forecasters expect Kiko to continue strengthening over the next few days, likely reaching hurricane status by Tuesday. This marks the 11th named storm to form in the Eastern North Pacific region during the current season.</p>

          <h2>Trump Announces Plan for Executive Order Mandating Voter Identification</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has declared his intention to issue an executive order that would require identification for all voters in U.S. elections, a move that is expected to face immediate legal challenges over its constitutionality. The U.S. Constitution primarily grants states, not the president, the authority to regulate elections. Critics argue that such a mandate would disproportionately disenfranchise minority, low-income, and disabled voters, who are less likely to possess the required forms of ID, while proponents cite concerns over election integrity.</p>

          <p>Israel's defense minister has announced that an Israeli airstrike in Gaza killed Abu Obeida, the prominent spokesperson for Hamas's armed wing, the Qassam Brigades. The claim comes as Israel escalates its military offensive in Gaza City, which it has declared a combat zone. The operation is part of Israel's ongoing effort to dismantle Hamas's capabilities following the October 7th attack. Meanwhile, Palestinian officials report dozens of casualties from recent strikes, and humanitarian conditions continue to worsen, with the U.N. warning of a devastating situation.</p>

The author suggests that Trump has an opportunity to secure a historic legacy by using U.S. power to force Putin to back down, but risks enabling Russian imperial ambitions if he fails to establish a clear and firm policy.</p>

It advises individuals to carefully calculate the total long-term value of their lost retirement benefits before accepting a severance package, which often requires waiving the right to sue. While companies cannot legally fire employees solely to prevent them from collecting retirement benefits, proving such intent can be challenging.

          <p>European Union foreign ministers are brainstorming new ways to bolster support for Ukraine, moving beyond existing aid packages. Among the ideas discussed at an informal meeting were the possibilities of imposing secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners and implementing a comprehensive tariff scheme on Russian goods. Additionally, proposals were floated to establish Ukrainian arms production facilities within the "safe haven" of the EU and to consider using the principal of frozen Russian central bank assets, not just the interest, to aid Kyiv's reconstruction efforts.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated Old Firm derby between Rangers and Celtic ended in a forgettable 0-0 draw, characterized by a lack of quality and creativity from both sides. While Rangers showed defensive resilience and fight, a welcome change for manager Russell Martin, they failed to create significant scoring chances. Celtic's performance was particularly feeble, with Brendan Rodgers' side struggling to generate any meaningful attack and looking disorganized. The result leaves both managers with significant work to do as they try to improve their teams' inconsistent form early in the season.</p>

          <p>The article from The Economist details a growing focus from Donald Trump and his allies on reshaping America's public universities, which they often portray as bastions of "woke" ideology. This campaign follows a pattern of targeting institutions perceived as hostile to their political agenda, from cultural bodies like the Smithsonian to corporations. The push involves challenging diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, scrutinizing curricula, and potentially leveraging federal funding to enforce ideological changes on campuses, raising concerns about academic freedom and the politicization of higher education.</p>

          <p>In response to widespread anti-government protests across Indonesia, President Prabowo Subianto has announced that political parties have agreed to scale back some state-funded perks for politicians. The demonstrations were fueled by public anger over a range of issues, most notably a new monthly allowance for lawmakers that is nearly ten times the minimum wage in Jakarta. While the government hopes this concession will quell the unrest, which has at times turned violent, student leaders have stated the move is insufficient to address deeper-rooted problems like low wages and corruption.</p>

          <p>One of the world's largest and most successful kelp restoration projects has revived a vital marine ecosystem off the coast of Southern California. Led by The Bay Foundation, divers spent over a decade manually smashing nearly six million voracious purple sea urchins that had created barren underwater landscapes. This effort cleared over 80 acres, allowing the giant Pacific kelp, known as the "sequoias of the sea," to regrow rapidly. The thriving underwater forest now provides critical habitat for hundreds of species and serves as a model for ecological restoration efforts worldwide.</p>

          <p>White House trade adviser Peter Navarro strongly criticized a recent federal appeals court decision that ruled most of President Trump's tariffs are illegal, calling the judgment "weaponized partisan injustice." Echoing the president's sentiments, Navarro warned that if the ruling is upheld by the Supreme Court, "it will be the end of the United States." The 7-4 decision found that Trump overstepped his authority in using emergency economic powers to justify the broad tariffs. The administration remains optimistic it will win on appeal, viewing the case as pivotal to its economic agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan aims to "maximise extraction" by removing burdens on producers, which she claims will lower energy bills for households. This move directly contrasts with the current Labour government's commitment to ban new exploration licenses and has been criticized by opponents as "irresponsible environmental vandalism" that would accelerate the climate crisis.
