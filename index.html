          <p>Paul Dabbar, nominated for deputy secretary of commerce, emphasized the need for America to re-industrialize and decrease its dependence on China in vital technologies like semiconductors, 6G, and quantum computing. Dabbar's confirmation hearing coincided with bipartisan efforts in Washington to curb Beijing's influence over global supply chains and emerging technologies. He argued that China's entry into the WTO negatively impacted the U.S. economy, resulting in significant job losses. Dabbar outlined a trade strategy with China focused on national security, re-industrialization, tariff leverage, and revenue.</p>
