            <p>Former Trump administration border czar Tom Homan defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, alleged MS-13 gang member, stating the administration followed the Constitution and the law. He criticized Senator Van Hollen's visit to El Salvador to meet with Garcia, asserting that Van Hollen had been silent on border issues under the Biden administration. Homan invoked the Alien Enemies Act, arguing it allows for limited due process rights when removing national security threats. Van Hollen rebutted, claiming he has long fought MS-13 and that defending constitutional rights is not mutually exclusive with combating gang violence.</p>

Another fatality was reported on the 405 Freeway in the North Hills area involving two cars, although the freeway remained open. The California Highway Patrol is investigating both incidents, but details are limited, and it is unclear if impairment was a factor in the wrong-way collision.</p>

            <p>Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo have revised the death toll from a boat fire in Equateur province to 33, significantly lower than initial reports of up to 148 fatalities. The incident occurred at the confluence of the Congo and Ruki rivers, with around 400 people believed to be on board. According to the mayor of Mbandaka, "confusion" led to the varying accounts. Police indicate that cooking onboard the vessel likely caused the deadly blaze.</p>

            <p>The CEO of Back Market, a marketplace for used and refurbished tech devices, reports a sales surge following President Trump's tariff announcements. Sales tripled in a week as consumers feared price increases on new electronics manufactured in China. The CEO believes this presents an opportunity for Americans to shift towards used or refurbished devices. Prolonged tariffs could lead to a "huge uptick" in the used device market, although some analysts predict consumers will eventually return to buying new tech when affordable.

This decision followed an emergency appeal from the ACLU, which argued that immigration authorities were moving to restart removals under the wartime law. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented. The ACLU cited concerns about the conditions in El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison, where other Venezuelan migrants had been sent under the Act.</p>

            <p>A new study proposes that the Step Pyramid of Djoser, the oldest of Egypt's monumental pyramids, was constructed using a hydraulic lift system. Evidence suggests the pyramid's internal architecture, landscape, and waterways support the use of hydraulic engineering to maneuver the massive stone blocks. The hydraulic-powered mechanism could have lifted stones from the pyramid's interior, pushing them into place using water pressure. If confirmed, this would indicate that the Egyptians possessed advanced hydraulic knowledge earlier than previously thought.</p>
