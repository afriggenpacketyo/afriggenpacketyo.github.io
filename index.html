          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated widespread layoffs, cutting 1,353 civil and foreign service employees as part of a major reorganization under the Trump administration. The move, aimed at reducing the workforce by 15%, has drawn sharp criticism from Democratic senators who argue it weakens America's diplomatic capabilities. Offices focused on human rights, refugees, and foreign assistance were significantly impacted, raising concerns about the future of U.S. foreign policy and humanitarian programs. The administration contends the cuts are necessary to eliminate redundancy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared that a 30% tariff will be imposed on all goods imported from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1. In letters to the respective leaders, Trump warned of even higher duties if either trading partner chose to retaliate. The announcement escalates trade tensions, with the EU stating it will take necessary steps to protect its interests, including potential countermeasures. This move is part of a broader tariff strategy that has also targeted other key U.S. trade partners. (not investment advice)</p>

His extradition marks a significant moment for Ecuador, which has been battling powerful drug cartels, and represents a major victory in President Daniel Noboa's crackdown on organized crime and lawlessness.</p>

          <p>Amid rising trade tensions, companies are increasingly using U.S. Customs-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce the financial impact of tariffs. These zones allow businesses to store or assemble imported goods without immediately paying duties, which are only collected when the products enter U.S. commerce. This strategy helps preserve cash flow and provides a buffer against trade war uncertainty. However, recent executive orders have eliminated some benefits, creating new challenges for manufacturers relying on these systems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least six people were killed in a series of widespread Russian attacks across Ukraine, involving hundreds of drones and cruise missiles. The overnight and morning strikes targeted multiple regions, including Chernivtsi, Lviv, Kharkiv, and Dnipropetrovsk, causing civilian casualties and wounding many more. Ukraine's air force reported shooting down a significant number of the projectiles, but the barrage continues a pattern of intensified Russian bombing campaigns. These attacks are straining Ukrainian defenses and causing further devastation in cities far from the front lines.</p>

          <p>Health officials in Coconino County, Arizona, have confirmed that a local resident has died from pneumonic plague, a rare but serious bacterial infection. This is the first recorded death from the disease in the state since 2007. While plague is treatable with modern antibiotics, it can be deadly if not addressed quickly, with the pneumonic form being the most dangerous. The bacteria is naturally present in rodent populations in the western U.S. and can be transmitted to humans through infected fleas or sick animals.</p>

          <p>Martin Frizell, the husband of British TV presenter Fiona Phillips, has spoken out about the social isolation their family has experienced since her Alzheimer's diagnosis at age 61. He described feeling "invisible" as friends have become distant, possibly unsure of how to react or confronted by their own mortality. Frizell also expressed frustration with the lack of support available for families dealing with the disease, which has "decimated" Phillips' family over generations. Phillips is releasing a memoir about her experience with the illness.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old Palestinian-American, Saif Musallet, was reportedly killed in the West Bank after being beaten by Israeli settlers during a confrontation over his family's land.

Meanwhile, in Gaza, Israeli airstrikes killed at least 28 Palestinians, including women and children, as the conflict continues.

          <p>The recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" will significantly reform the U.S. federal student loan system, creating major changes for millions of borrowers. The law streamlines the seven existing repayment plans down to two: a standard plan and a new income-driven option. It also introduces new borrowing caps for Parent PLUS and graduate student loans, and tightens eligibility for Pell Grants. While the White House promotes the changes as simplifying a broken system, critics worry some provisions could harm borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A boom in unregulated rare earth metal mining in Myanmar is causing a severe environmental disaster, with toxic pollution affecting rivers that flow into neighboring Thailand. Residents and activists report that rivers like the Kok and Sai have become contaminated with hazardous metals like arsenic, posing a threat to public health and ecosystems. The mining, largely controlled by an armed ethnic militia in a conflict-ridden region, is fueled by global demand, particularly from China. This has created a "wild west" scenario with devastating consequences for the Mekong region.</p>
