          <p>A high-ranking Department of Justice official announced plans to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence for her involvement in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking network. The meeting aims to determine if Maxwell has information about other individuals who may have committed crimes. This development follows public criticism of the Trump administration for not releasing more files related to the Epstein investigation. Maxwell's lawyer has confirmed that discussions are underway and stated that she will always testify truthfully.</p>

          <p>Facing significant financial losses and a sharp decline in ridership, public bus companies across China are adopting innovative business models to stay afloat. With passenger volume at just over half of pre-pandemic levels, companies like Zhengzhou Public Transport Group are partnering with courier services to use idle buses for deliveries. Other unorthodox strategies include repurposing buses to allow pets as passengers. These moves highlight the severe economic pressures on traditional public transit as commuters increasingly shift to other transportation methods.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are continuing to fund corporate travel, but they are becoming more strategic with their spending due to trade tensions and economic uncertainty. A new report shows that while overall spending increased 15% year-over-year, growth is more moderate than previously forecast. Companies are prioritizing essential, relationship-building trips, such as individual client meetings, while cutting back on larger group outings. This cautious approach reflects a "wait and see" mode among C-suite leaders, who are focused on ensuring every trip delivers a clear return on investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average UK household is projected to spend an additional £275 on food and drink this year due to a significant jump in prices. Food price inflation reached 5.2% over the past month compared to last year, prompting shoppers to seek out cheaper own-brand goods and simplify their meals to cut costs. According to market researcher Worldpanel, this is the highest rate of increase since early last year, with items like chocolate, butter, and fresh meat seeing the sharpest rises. The trend is contributing to the UK's overall inflation rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analyst Suggests Trump's Silence on Epstein Controversy Indicates Fear</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 08:18:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>MSNBC analyst Lawrence O'Donnell has proposed that President Trump's recent silence regarding the Jeffrey Epstein files controversy is a significant indicator of his fear. O'Donnell argues that while Trump often reacts to threats with a barrage of social media posts, silence is another characteristic response when he is most afraid. This interpretation contrasts with the president's public dismissiveness of the issue. The analysis suggests that the growing calls for transparency, particularly from his own base, may be creating significant private anxiety for the president.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst expectations, largely due to strong performance in its Europe, Middle East, and Africa division. The beverage giant posted adjusted earnings of 87 cents per share on revenue of $12.62 billion. However, global unit case volume, a key measure of demand, fell by 1% as growth in Europe was offset by weakness in other regions. The company also officially announced its plan to launch a cane sugar version of its classic soda in the U.S. this fall. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Phillies defeated the Boston Red Sox in a highly unusual fashion, winning the game on a walk-off catcher's interference call with the bases loaded. In the 10th inning, Phillies batter Edmundo Sosa's swing struck the glove of Red Sox catcher Carlos Narvaez. After a review confirmed the contact, Sosa was awarded first base, forcing in the winning run. This marked the first time a Major League Baseball game has ended on a walk-off catcher's interference since 1971, providing a strange and memorable conclusion to the contest.</p>

          <p>The cost of renting a home in the UK has surged by an average of £221 per month over the past three years, creating significant financial pressure on tenants. According to property portal Zoopla, the sharp increase is forcing some individuals to turn down job opportunities or move to more affordable areas. The crisis is also leading more parents to provide financial assistance to their adult children to cover high living costs. While the rate of rent increases has recently slowed in some cities, the overall affordability challenge remains a major issue.</p>

          <p>The United States and Taiwan are discussing a potential collaboration on a spaceport focused on suborbital flight technology. According to the American Institute in Taiwan, this partnership could drastically reduce travel times, with a flight from Taipei to Houston potentially taking as little as 2.5 hours. Suborbital flights, an emerging technology where a vehicle briefly enters space before landing, could revolutionize long-distance travel and cargo delivery. The proposed cooperation, which is still under evaluation, marks a significant step in US-Taiwan technological partnership.</p>

Up to $140 million in funding for the Overdose Data to Action program is allegedly being withheld. This program is crucial for surveillance of the drug supply and implementing life-saving interventions, which contributed to the first decline in overdose deaths in 2023. Officials fear these cuts represent a significant step backward and could lead to a resurgence in fatal overdoses.</p>

The novel challenges the sentimental myth of childhood friends, revealing the secrets and misunderstandings at the core of their bond. The story follows the characters from their school days into their adult lives in the New York art world, where their unhealthy patterns of obsession and codependence persist.
