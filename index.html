          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper has announced an $18 billion acquisition of Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, a strategic move aimed at revitalizing the U.S. giant's coffee division. The deal, which involves a 33% premium for JDE Peet's shareholders, is projected to generate $400 million in cost synergies over three years. Following the acquisition, Keurig Dr Pepper plans to separate its beverage and coffee units into two distinct, U.S.-listed companies, effectively undoing their 2018 merger. This restructuring intends to enhance focus and competitiveness in both sectors, with the coffee company expected to achieve $16 billion in annual net sales. (not investment advice)</p>

This warm spell, following a summer already marked by four heatwaves, is predicted to be short-lived. The remnants of Hurricane Erin are set to bring wet and windy conditions across the UK overnight, starting in Northern Ireland. The article notes potential travel disruptions due to strikes and engineering works, and highlights the ongoing water shortage across southern England, which has led to hosepipe bans and concerns for the harvest.

          <p>Singapore's inflation rate cooled to a lower-than-expected 0.6% in July, marking its lowest point since January 2021, as the city-state prepares for slower economic growth. Core inflation, excluding private transport and accommodation costs, also dipped to 0.5%. The Monetary Authority of Singapore attributed this moderation to falling retail and other goods prices, alongside reduced electricity and gas inflation. The central bank anticipates inflation to remain moderate in the near term due to easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity hikes.
