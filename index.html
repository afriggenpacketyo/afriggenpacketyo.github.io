          <p>A social media post showing audience members wearing brain-reading devices at a university dance performance in China has gone viral, sparking both fascination and unease. The experiment, conducted during a dance drama called "Wing Chun" at Tsinghua University, involved eight students wearing electrode-covered hats to monitor their brain responses. While some commenters expressed horror and bewilderment, scientists explained that the brain-computer interface technology was intended to enable direct communication between the brain and external devices. The incident highlights the growing interest in and ethical concerns surrounding brain-computer interface technology in China. The technology is becoming more prevalent and as such, is more controversial in the public's eye.</p>

          <p>An Iranian missile struck a hospital in southern Israel, causing injuries and significant damage, as the conflict between Israel and Iran intensifies. In response, Israel conducted strikes on Iran's Arak heavy water reactor, a key part of its nuclear program. The hospital, which serves approximately 1 million residents, had partially evacuated prior to the strike, minimizing casualties. These events unfolded as President Trump considered direct U.S. involvement in the conflict. The escalating attacks have resulted in numerous casualties on both sides and raised concerns about regional stability.</p>

          <p>The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran has led to a sharp increase in shipping insurance costs in the Middle East. Marine insurers are now charging significantly higher rates for ships traveling through the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, reflecting the deteriorating security environment. War risk insurance rates for the Red Sea have also risen, and coverage for ports in Israel has more than tripled. This scramble to reassess shipping insurance costs underscores the growing concerns of a broader conflict in the region, impacting global trade and maritime operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's policy to make high school tuition free, even at private institutions, is causing concern among educators who fear it could lead to an exodus from public schools. Critics argue that the government has not provided adequate support for struggling public schools, which already face enrollment and budget challenges. While the policy aims to ease financial burdens for households, it risks undermining the role of public schools as safety nets for students with diverse needs. The policy's impact on the overall education system and the role of public schools is a subject of ongoing debate.</p>

          <p>During a White House visit, former President Donald Trump engaged Juventus players and staff in an awkward exchange about transgender athletes in sports. Trump, who signed an executive order banning transgender participants from women’s sports, questioned the team about whether a woman could play on their team. The Juventus general manager attempted to deflect the question, highlighting the team's successful women's team. Trump's comments come amid increasing hostility toward trans people in the U.S., as demonstrated by a recent Supreme Court ruling on gender-affirming care for minors. This incident reflects the ongoing debate and political tensions surrounding transgender rights in the United States.</p>

          <p>A recent study suggests that a passing star could potentially disrupt the orbits of planets in our solar system, including Earth. Computer simulations indicate that these passing stars could cause more instability than previously believed. While the probability of Earth being involved in a planetary collision or ejection is relatively low at 0.2 percent, it is still higher than previous estimates. The gravitational tug from such a star could destabilize even stable objects like Pluto. While none of these events are probable, the study highlights the potential vulnerability of our solar system to external forces.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is resuming the processing of student visas for foreign applicants, but with a new requirement: applicants must unlock their social media accounts for government review. Consular officers will be looking for posts and messages deemed hostile to the U.S., its government, culture, or founding principles. Refusal to comply may result in visa rejection. The move raises concerns about privacy and freedom of expression, with critics comparing it to Cold War-era ideological vetting. The policy change aims to enhance screening measures for individuals seeking to study in the United States.</p>

          <p>New Zealand has halted NZ$18.2 million in funding to the Cook Islands due to concerns over wide-ranging deals the Cook Islands made with China. The deals cover infrastructure, tourism, technology, and deep-sea mineral exploration. New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters stated that funding relies on a high-trust bilateral relationship, which has been compromised by the Cook Islands' agreements with China. The move highlights growing tensions in the Pacific over China's increasing influence. The Cook Islands has said it will address the issue as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <p>Analysts caution that regime change in Iran is a complex and potentially destabilizing endeavor. While the desire to remove Iran's theocratic regime is understandable, history shows that such interventions often lead to enduring troubles and miseries. The success of regime change requires more than just destruction; it demands a plan for rebuilding and addressing the potential for civic instability. The overthrow of the Iranian regime would remove an international threat, but it could also result in a weakened and angry Islamic republic, making the outcome uncertain.</p>
