        <h2>Appeals court temporarily allows Trump's anti-DEI executive orders</h2>

        <p>A federal appeals court temporarily lifted a block on Trump's executive orders aimed at ending government support for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.  The decision allows the orders to be enforced while a lawsuit challenging them continues.  The court acknowledged potential First Amendment concerns but found the lower court's injunction too broad.  The orders direct federal agencies to terminate DEI-related grants and contracts and require federal contractors to certify they don't promote DEI.  The city of Baltimore and other groups sued, arguing the orders are unconstitutional.</p>
