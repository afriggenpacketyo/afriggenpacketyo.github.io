        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia's economic growth in the first quarter of 2025 was lower than anticipated, with a year-on-year expansion of 1.3%, missing the Reuters poll estimate of 1.5%. The Australian Bureau of Statistics attributed the slowdown to reduced public spending, weakened consumer demand, and decreased exports, exacerbated by extreme weather events affecting mining, tourism, and shipping. The Reserve Bank of Australia had previously cut rates to 3.85% to stimulate growth amid global trade uncertainties, and the weak GDP figures could prompt further monetary policy easing. The S&P/ASX 200 index rose 0.83% following the GDP release, while the Australian dollar remained steady. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Toyota Industries experienced a significant drop after the Toyota Group announced a $33 billion deal to take the company private, reflecting investor concerns about the offer's attractiveness. The deal, involving a tender offer of $26 billion for shares at 16,300 yen apiece, is part of a broader trend of Japanese firms unwinding cross-shareholding ties under regulatory and investor pressure. Despite the offer price being below the valuation range suggested by independent financial advisors, the Toyota Group views the deal as positive for long-term growth investments and capital returns. Toyota initially employed cross-shareholding to safeguard against acquisition threats, but is now restructuring in response to evolving market dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

The funding allocation, spanning from 2027/28 to 2031/32, will significantly increase current spending, with Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander highlighting it as a watershed moment for improving transport across the North and Midlands.

          <p>The UK Prime Minister has been warned that the government will fail to meet its target of halving violence against women and girls without significant investment in support services. Two senior government watchdogs, the Domestic Abuse Commissioner and Victims Commissioner, jointly wrote to Sir Keir Starmer, highlighting that victim support services are being pushed to the brink due to funding cuts and rising costs. The intervention comes ahead of the chancellor's spending review, which is expected to feature cuts to some areas of public spending. Senior police chiefs have also warned that they will face "stark choices" about which crimes to investigate if their budgets are cut.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's government, under President Nayib Bukele, is facing criticism for extending special powers initially intended to combat gangs to address a wider range of alleged crimes. The arrest of an anticorruption lawyer and two members of an agricultural cooperative exemplifies this trend, raising concerns about the scope and application of these emergency measures. Critics argue that the government is using these powers to suppress dissent and target individuals unrelated to gang activity. This situation has raised alarm about the rule of law and human rights in El Salvador.</p>

          <p>A California man, Thomas Eugene Streavel, has pleaded not guilty to three felony counts of making threats against President Trump on Facebook. The indictment details several posts in which Streavel allegedly threatened to assassinate Trump, expressing violent intentions and hailing himself as an "assassin". The Justice Department is taking the threats seriously, emphasizing the need to prosecute such crimes to the fullest extent of the law. The Secret Service is also investigating the matter, citing concerns about the rhetoric and threats made by the defendant. The defendant is out on a $10,000 bond and is expected back in court July 28.</p>

          <p>A counter-narrative suggests the so-called "China shock" may have had positive effects on America, despite claims of mass job losses in the manufacturing sector. While acknowledging the negative impact on some blue-collar workers and regional manufacturing, the analysis points out that cheap Chinese goods have made life easier and more affordable for the average American. Research challenges the notion that China has stolen millions of American jobs, arguing that the benefits of trade outweigh the costs. This perspective contrasts with the anti-China sentiment often expressed by politicians and media pundits.</p>

          <p>The US Navy is considering renaming the USNS Harvey Milk, a ship named after gay rights leader and Navy veteran Harvey Milk, as part of a broader effort to realign the military with the Trump administration's goal of "re-establishing the warrior culture". The directive also includes potential renaming of other vessels honoring civil rights leaders, such as the USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg and USNS Harriet Tubman. This decision coincides with Pride Month and follows a directive to stop hosting events tied to heritage or awareness months.

The US's changing priorities in Asia, focusing on containing China, could also put South Korea in a difficult position.
