        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy showed signs of faltering in July as key indicators like retail sales and industrial output missed forecasts, signaling a loss of momentum. The slowdown is attributed to persistent weak domestic demand, challenges from the external environment, and government efforts to curb excess production capacity in certain sectors. Despite solid growth in the first half of the year, economists warn that the full-year target is at risk without new policy support, as unemployment rates also edged higher.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet at a military base in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential resolution to the war in Ukraine. The hastily arranged summit comes after Trump has pushed for a peace deal, even setting a deadline for a ceasefire that has since passed. The White House has framed the meeting as a "listening exercise," while analysts note the strategic importance of the location and the historical context of the U.S. purchasing Alaska from Russia.</p>

Historical experts also weighed in on the significance of Alaska as the meeting location, highlighting the deep historical ties between the U.S. and Russia in the region.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, located in the eastern Atlantic, is forecast to intensify and become the season's first hurricane by Friday, potentially reaching major hurricane status over the weekend. The storm is currently moving west-northwest and is projected to pass near or north of the Caribbean's northern Leeward Islands, where tropical storm watches have been issued. While it poses no immediate threat to the U.S. mainland, its long-term path remains uncertain, aligning with NOAA predictions for an above-normal hurricane season this year.</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have issued new guidelines for managing high blood pressure, advocating for more aggressive and earlier intervention. The updated recommendations suggest that individuals with systolic pressure in the 130-139 range should first try lifestyle changes, with medication added if blood pressure doesn't lower within three to six months. Notably, the new guidelines also recommend complete abstinence from alcohol, a shift from previous advice that permitted limited consumption, citing growing evidence of its negative impact on blood pressure.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally requested that Prime Minister Keir Starmer allow him to appoint party members to the House of Lords, arguing the current composition is undemocratic.

He described his request as modest and necessary to address the "democratic disparity" that has emerged from recent shifts in British politics.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its federal takeover of Washington, D.C.'s law enforcement by appointing DEA chief Terry Cole as the city's "emergency police commissioner."

          <p>Numerous Instagram users are expressing frustration after their accounts were suspended, often for alleged violations of child sexual exploitation rules, only to be reinstated later without clear explanation. Many users have lost access to cherished photos and business contacts, and they report significant personal distress over the serious but unfounded accusations. Despite acknowledging a related issue with Facebook Groups, parent company Meta has not commented on the wider problem, though it has frequently restored accounts after being contacted by the media.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new high-speed jet drone with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, a technological breakthrough that could effectively turn any warship into a small aircraft carrier. The uncrewed aircraft is designed to launch from the decks of vessels like destroyers and frigates, even in rough seas, and then transition to fast, long-range flight. According to the project's research team, the drone's speed is far superior to other mainstream VTOL drones, potentially giving the Chinese navy a significant strategic advantage.</p>

          <p>President Trump shrugged off concerns about Latin American nations, including Brazil, increasing their coordination with China in response to U.S. trade policies. When asked about this geopolitical shift, Trump asserted that the U.S. economy is outperforming every other country, including China, and that the Latin American nations in question are not doing well. His comments follow Brazil's efforts to work with Beijing on a multilateral response to the steep tariffs the U.S. imposed on a wide range of Brazilian exports.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors will seek the death penalty for a woman accused of murdering a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Vermont during a traffic stop in January. A grand jury indicted the 21-year-old woman on charges of murder and assault with a deadly weapon.

          <p>As students in Los Angeles return to school, many undocumented families are living in fear due to increased immigration enforcement activity in the area. Recent raids and a high-profile mistaken detention of a student have created an atmosphere of uncertainty, with some parents considering keeping their children home from school. In response, the LAUSD has implemented "safe zones" around 100 schools in predominantly Latino neighborhoods to monitor for federal immigration activity and reassure families of their safety on school grounds.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by ConsumerAffairs has ranked Oregon as the fourth-worst state to move to in 2025, citing significant challenges in affordability, safety, and economic strength. The report highlights that Oregon scores poorly on access to healthcare and education and is highly vulnerable to environmental risks like wildfires and drought. While neighboring Washington also faces challenges, it performed better overall. The ranking suggests Oregon may struggle to attract and retain residents as people increasingly prioritize cost of living and quality of life in relocation decisions.</p>

          <p>Youngstown, Ohio, once a symbol of industrial decline after the collapse of its steel industry, is now experiencing a steady economic revival. Local entrepreneurs are repurposing old, abandoned factory buildings into new businesses, such as a brewery and a flea market, bringing new life and commerce to the city. While the city's population has stabilized and unemployment has fallen, the comeback is described as a slow and steady process rather than a dramatic boom. This revitalization effort showcases a potential model for other post-industrial American cities.</p>
