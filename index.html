Hui, who faces criminal charges related to the 2019 protests, confirmed that he and his family members received visas from the Australian government. While expressing gratitude, Hui also voiced sadness about being a political refugee unable to return to his hometown and urged Australia to do more to help other activists who remain jailed in Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>The British Horseracing Authority has announced an unprecedented strike for September 10th, canceling all scheduled races for the day in protest of a proposed government tax hike. The industry is campaigning against a plan to increase the remote gambling tax on horse racing, which they argue would be catastrophic for the sport. An economic analysis by the BHA predicts a revenue loss of £330 million and the endangerment of over 2,700 jobs in the first year alone.</p>

          <p>A new judicial interpretation in China, set to enforce mandatory social insurance contributions from employers, is expected to increase the hiring of retirees who are exempt from these payments. This trend, highlighted by McDonald's recruitment practices, has sparked widespread concern among the public, particularly as a record number of university graduates struggle to find employment. While the stricter enforcement aims to address the country's pension crisis, it is creating fears of shrinking job opportunities for younger generations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, stating it is more than a "regular protest group." Cooper cited incidents of alleged violent disorder and aggravated burglary for which the group claimed responsibility, noting the Crown Prosecution Service assessed these charges as having a "terrorism connection." This defense comes as the Metropolitan Police announced 60 more individuals will be prosecuted for supporting the group, adding to the over 700 arrests made since the ban was enacted.</p>

The decision follows the 76-year-old's recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder that affects his balance, vision, and hearing. This health issue also prompted Joel to cancel all of his tour dates for 2025 and into 2026 as he undergoes physical therapy and recovery.</p>

          <p>The states of West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio are deploying hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington D.C. at the request of the Trump administration. This move is intended to support a federal initiative to overhaul policing and address crime and homelessness in the nation's capital. The deployment significantly escalates the federal intervention, which has been met with protests from demonstrators who decry it as a "fascist takeover" and an overreach of presidential power.</p>

          <p>More than 2,500 migrants have crossed the English Channel in small boats in the eleven days since a new "one in, one out" agreement between the UK and France was initiated. The pilot scheme proposes that for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept one person with a strong asylum case, but removals have not yet begun. The continued crossings, which now total over 28,000 this year, are putting pressure on the government, with concerns also rising about smugglers using larger, more dangerous "mega dinghies."</p>

The author initially dismissed masterpieces like Piero della Francesca's Madonna del Parto, but later found resonance in the works of artists like Caravaggio after experiencing trauma. The article suggests that life experience, from trauma to pregnancy, can open one's emotional capacity to understand and be moved by the profound human stories within classical art.</p>
