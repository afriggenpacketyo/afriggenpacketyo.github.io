          <p>David Kaczynski, who turned his brother Ted (the Unabomber) in to the FBI, has formed a deep friendship with Gary Wright, one of the victims injured by a bomb. The article explores David's difficult decision and subsequent journey to make amends, highlighting how his connection with Wright provides a powerful example of compassion emerging from immense violence and tragedy. Their shared story, told through joint appearances, offers a surprising glimmer of hope and healing, even as they reflect on the prophetic nature of the Unabomber's anti-technology manifesto in the age of AI.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation highlights the growing problem of AI-powered "nudify" applications that allow users to easily create nonconsensual explicit images of people from their social media photos. The article focuses on a group of women in Minnesota who were targeted and discovered they had little legal recourse because the images were not distributed. Their story underscores the emotional trauma caused by such deepfakes and the legislative gap that lawmakers are now trying to close, as the technology for creating this harmful content becomes more accessible.</p>

          <p>Climate activist Greta Thunberg has rejected claims that her participation in a Gaza-bound humanitarian aid flotilla is a mere publicity stunt, stating that no one would risk their life for attention. Speaking from a vessel off the Greek coast, she emphasized the mission's goal is to break Israel's maritime siege on Gaza and deliver essential supplies to a population facing famine. The flotilla has reportedly faced drone attacks, which Thunberg attributes to baseless threats from Israel, reinforcing the activists' message that ordinary people must act when governments fail.</p>

          <p>Self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi explains that many people fail to increase their income not due to a lack of intelligence or desire, but because of limiting background beliefs. He identifies three key psychological hurdles: the shame of admitting you don't know how to earn more, the false expectation that success should come easily if you're talented, and the habit of procrastinating by telling yourself you'll start later. Sethi argues that overcoming these mindsets is crucial for taking the practical steps needed to achieve financial growth, such as learning new skills or starting a side business.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has committed to starting the construction of three new towns in England before the next general election, positioning housebuilding as a central part of its economic growth strategy. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced the plan at the party's annual conference, identifying Tempsford, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill as the most promising initial sites. This initiative, aiming to build 1.5 million homes by 2029, emulates the post-war Labour government's efforts to create new communities, though it faces challenges from the construction industry and concerns from local residents about a lack of consultation.</p>

          <p>The master of ceremonies hired to entertain the Ryder Cup crowd, comedian Heather McMahan, has stepped down after being recorded leading a profane chant against European player Rory McIlroy. The incident occurred on the first tee Saturday morning, contributing to what was described as a toxic and ugly atmosphere at the Bethpage event. The crowd's hostility toward McIlroy became so intense that state police were brought in to escort his group, and several spectators were ejected for personal abuse during the day's play.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A popular TikTok trend suggests that applying magnesium lotion to the feet at bedtime can significantly improve sleep quality and balance hormone levels, but health experts remain skeptical. Dermatologists point out that the skin on the soles of the feet is very thick, making significant systemic absorption of magnesium unlikely. Sleep psychologists suggest that any perceived benefits are more likely due to the relaxing ritual of a foot massage rather than the magnesium itself, and they recommend focusing on evidence-based sleep hygiene practices instead of unproven social media fads.</p>

          <p>A California proposal to redraw the state's congressional map, aimed at creating five new Democratic seats in response to gerrymandering in Texas, is facing a fierce fight ahead of a special election. The plan puts the seat of seven-term Republican representative Doug LaMalfa in a conservative northern district at risk, energizing both Democratic and Republican bases. Supporters see the measure, Proposition 50, as a necessary move to counter the national Republican agenda, while opponents argue it's a partisan power grab that would dilute the representation of rural communities.</p>

Since 1980, the per-capita death rate from fires has fallen by roughly two-thirds, and the total number of reported fires has been cut in half. This significant improvement is not due to a single breakthrough but rather the accumulation of smaller, crucial changes such as the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms and automatic sprinklers. Safer furniture standards, a decline in smoking, and better electrical codes have also played vital roles in making homes and buildings far less vulnerable.</p>

Following the Pentagon's decision to take an equity stake and provide a price floor for rare earth miner MP Materials, industry leaders argue that supporting multiple companies is necessary to mitigate risk. Other miners like Energy Fuels and Lithium Americas have seen their stock prices surge on speculation they could be next, as the government signals a willingness to break with free-market principles to counter China's market manipulation.

          <p>The UK government is guaranteeing a £1.5 billion loan for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to help the carmaker and its supply chain weather a nearly month-long production shutdown caused by a major cyber-attack. Production at JLR's UK facilities has been halted since early September, raising concerns that some suppliers could collapse. A local MP and chair of the Commons Business and Trade Select Committee warned that further government assistance might be necessary and called the incident a "wake-up call" for UK businesses to improve their cyber-defenses against increasingly frequent attacks.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece suggests that jury nullification, a historic practice where a jury acquits a defendant despite evidence of guilt because they believe the law is unjust, could be a crucial defense against the Trump administration's perceived weaponization of the Justice Department. The author argues that as the president targets political enemies for prosecution, ordinary citizens serving on juries have the right to refuse to convict if they see the cases as corrupt or tyrannical. Citing the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, the article posits that nullification can serve as a final check on executive overreach and protect the rule of law.</p>

The U.S. Treasury's potential offer of a dollar swap line or direct bond purchases is seen as a move to prop up a political ally and counter China's growing influence in Latin America.

The piece contrasts the U.S. situation with Brazil, where a former president was held accountable for similar actions, and calls for peaceful citizen action to restore the principle that government requires the consent of the governed.</p>

Unlike the more than 450 other ancient canoes found in the state, this one is made of mahogany and likely originated outside of Florida, possibly in the Caribbean. Tool marks suggest it was crafted with iron tools, placing it in the historical period after European contact, with one theory suggesting it could be a 16th-century vessel made by Spanish settlers. The discovery adds to Florida's status as a leading location for ancient boat finds in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
