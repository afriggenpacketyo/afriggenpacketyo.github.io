          <p>A Seattle man, Earl Henderson Riley IV, has been charged with multiple counts of residential burglary and one count of robbery for targeting the homes of professional athletes, including Blake Snell, Julio Rodriguez, Luis Castillo, and Richard Sherman. The King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office coordinated with six police jurisdictions during the investigation, which began in early 2025. The suspect is currently held on $1 million bail, and the investigation is ongoing, with the possibility of additional charges against other defendants. The defendant was previously released on Feb. 7 after pleading guilty to three robbery counts.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty triumphed over Journalism in the 157th Belmont Stakes at Saratoga Springs, New York, marking a repeat of the Derby's top two finishers.

This victory makes Sovereignty the first horse to win the Derby, skip the Preakness Stakes, and then win the Belmont, with Journalism finishing second after winning the Preakness. The Belmont took place at Saratoga Race Course due to renovations at Belmont Park, shortening the race to the same length as the Derby.</p>

The proposed budget would slash funding for science projects by nearly half, potentially halting 40 missions already in development or operation. Trump has also threatened to withdraw federal contracts from Musk's SpaceX, a key partner for NASA in resupplying the International Space Station and future lunar missions. Critics argue that these cuts would repurpose NASA primarily for lunar and Martian astronaut missions, while others defend the focus as providing a clear objective.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert, Susan Dominus, identifies five common traits among parents who raise highly successful children, based on interviews with numerous families and experts. These traits include fostering optimism, tailoring motivational approaches to individual children, recognizing learning opportunities in everyday tasks, nurturing a genuine love for knowledge, and motivating children with love rather than being a coach. Dominus emphasizes that academic strengths alone are insufficient without a sense of possibility and that parents should support their children's growth with love and joy. She also notes the importance of fostering a love of learning and curiosity.</p>

          <p>Confusing and inconsistent baggage rules among budget airlines have led to a legal dispute in the EU, with consumer groups pushing for fairer regulations. A passenger's humiliating experience with EasyJet's baggage policy highlights the common issues faced by travelers. EU transport ministers have proposed standardized sizing for free underseat baggage on EU airlines to address passenger confusion. The European Consumer Organisation believes the proposals do not go far enough and that the EU should not allow airlines to charge for overhead cabin bags.</p>

          <p>Doctors in the UK are testing "poo pills" containing freeze-dried feces from healthy donors to combat dangerous superbug infections. These pills aim to replace harmful gut bacteria with a healthy mix, offering a new approach to tackling antibiotic resistance. Early data suggests that superbugs can be flushed out of the bowel using this method, potentially reducing the risk of infections. The trial has shown promising signals, indicating that donor bacteria may compete with superbugs for resources, ultimately reducing their presence in the body.</p>

          <p>Victoria McCloud, a transgender former judge, argues that the Supreme Court's ruling on gender, which led to updated guidance on shared public spaces, puts transgender people at risk. McCloud fears that the ruling, defining a woman by biological sex, could lead to dangerous situations for trans individuals in gendered spaces. She plans to challenge the ruling at the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that the court did not hear from trans people before its decision. The EHRC has suggested trans people should use their "powers of advocacy" to campaign for so-called third spaces that are gender-neutral to avoid these sorts of dilemmas.</p>
