          <h2>EU Preparing Countermeasures Against Potential US Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 12:06:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is set to unveil its proposed countermeasures against potential tariffs imposed by the United States. European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic announced that further details would be released on Thursday, outlining possible rebalancing measures and areas for future discussions. The EU aims for a negotiated solution that respects their interests and regulatory autonomy, but requires the U.S. to demonstrate readiness for a fair deal. These actions are in response to Trump-era tariffs on goods from the EU, including those on foreign cars, steel and aluminum imports, with the EU having previously paused its retaliatory measures targeting U.S. goods.

          <p>The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) released its first J7 Annual Report on Antisemitism, detailing a significant rise in antisemitic incidents across countries with large Jewish populations outside Israel, including the U.S., the U.K., Argentina, Canada, France, Germany, and Australia. The report highlights increases in violent attacks, online antisemitic rhetoric, and growing fear among Jewish communities, particularly following Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks. Each country's report documents rising antisemitism directly impacting Jewish communities, including Argentina, where antisemitism is embedded in social media and academic institutions, and Australia, which saw a 316% increase in antisemitic incidents. The report calls for enhanced law enforcement, stricter regulations on online hate speech, and comprehensive educational programs to combat antisemitism. Optimism Score: 20</p>
