          <p>In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, former President Donald Trump criticized the organization and recalled his unsuccessful 2005 bid to manage the renovation of its New York headquarters. He claimed he could have completed the project for a fraction of the cost with superior materials, such as marble floors and mahogany walls. Trump also used the speech to critique the UN's effectiveness, calling it full of "empty words," and mentioned technical difficulties with an escalator and teleprompter as further evidence of the building's issues. He asserted that his predictions are often correct and that the UN has failed to live up to its potential.</p>

          <p>Foreign ministers from Estonia and Lithuania have strongly criticized the United Nations Security Council, labeling it powerless because Russia, a permanent member, holds veto power while waging war in Ukraine. In interviews, they argued that Russia uses its position to evade accountability for its aggression, including recent military incursions into NATO airspace over Estonia and Poland. The leaders expressed little hope for reform, noting that Russia's veto prevents any binding resolutions condemning its actions. They emphasized that Russia only respects decisive action, not diplomatic statements, and called for a stronger NATO response to deter further escalation.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, the most powerful storm of 2025, has resulted in at least two fatalities in Taiwan after causing a mountain lake to overflow and flood a nearby township. Rescue operations are underway for scores of trapped or missing individuals in Hualien county. The storm, equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane, is now heading towards southern China, prompting the evacuation of hundreds of thousands in Guangdong province and the issuance of a maximum-level typhoon warning in Hong Kong. Authorities are preparing for catastrophic conditions, including severe storm surges, widespread flooding, and significant travel disruptions across the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called off a planned meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, citing their "unserious and ridiculous demands" for funding the government. With an October 1 deadline looming, both parties have failed to agree on a short-term spending bill, raising the risk of a government shutdown. Democrats' proposal includes extending enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, which Trump opposes. In response to the cancellation, Democratic leaders accused the president of avoiding negotiations and warned that he will be responsible for the consequences of a shutdown.</p>

          <p>A bull moose was successfully rescued in Pembroke, Maine, after it became trapped in a 9-foot-deep abandoned well on private property. The landowners discovered the animal after noticing its antlers and alerted the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife. A team of wardens and a biologist sedated the moose, attached straps, and used an excavator to carefully lift it to safety. The entire operation took five hours, after which the moose recovered from sedation and ran off, seemingly unharmed by the ordeal. The family has since secured the well to prevent future incidents.</p>

          <p>Police are investigating a hate crime after a man was recorded on security cameras drawing a swastika on the sidewalk outside El Rodeo School in Beverly Hills. The incident occurred on Monday, which marked the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah. The Beverly Hills Unified School District condemned the act, stating that antisemitism is meant to intimidate and that hate of any kind is unacceptable on its campuses. The symbol was promptly removed, and the Los Angeles Police Department has increased patrols around Jewish community centers and places of worship during the High Holy Days.</p>

          <p>International health agencies, including the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency, are forcefully rejecting President Trump's recent claims that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, is linked to autism when taken during pregnancy. Officials stated there is no consistent scientific evidence supporting this association and reiterated that the medication remains an important and safe option for treating pain and fever in pregnant women. Health leaders from the U.K. and Australia also issued statements urging the public to disregard the president's comments, emphasizing that untreated fever can pose risks to an unborn baby and that vaccines do not cause autism.</p>

          <p>England has announced its squad for the upcoming Ashes tour in Australia, featuring what is being described as its most aggressive fast-bowling attack since the victorious 1970-71 series. The lineup, which includes pacers like Mark Wood and Jofra Archer, signals a strategic shift away from reliance on traditional swing bowlers, aiming to counter Australia's formidable pace on home soil. Key concerns remain over the fitness of captain Ben Stokes and the durability of the bowling unit, many of whom have recent injury histories. The performance of veteran batsman Joe Root, who has yet to score a Test century in Australia, will also be critical to England's chances.</p>

Prosecutors successfully argued that Routh had clear intent and took substantial steps to carry out the attack, despite never firing his rifle at Trump's golf course. Evidence presented during the trial included Routh's surveillance of the former president and his setup of a "sniper's hide." Routh, who represented himself, claimed he never intended to pull the trigger, but the jury delivered a guilty verdict after a two-and-a-half-week trial. He now faces a potential life sentence.</p>

The system, which has been tested in the minor leagues since 2019, aims to increase accuracy and reduce on-field disputes, as a majority of ejections are related to ball and strike calls.

          <p>The Medigap "birthday rule" is a state-specific provision that allows Medicare beneficiaries an annual window around their birthday to switch Medigap plans without undergoing medical underwriting. This is significant because outside of the initial enrollment period, insurers can typically deny coverage or charge higher premiums for pre-existing conditions. Currently available in about 18 states, this rule enables seniors to switch to a plan with equal or lesser benefits, potentially saving hundreds of dollars per year on premiums. The article explains that these rules vary by state and offer crucial flexibility for seniors to adapt their coverage as their health and financial needs change over time.</p>

          <p>During a speech in Rhode Island, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell remarked that equity prices, by many measures, appear to be "fairly highly valued." While acknowledging the elevated asset prices, he clarified that he does not believe this is a time of high financial stability risks. Powell explained that the Fed monitors overall financial conditions to ensure its policies are achieving their intended effects. His comments come after a recent stock market rally, which was fueled by the central bank's decision last week to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant point of contention at this year's Ryder Cup is the decision to pay each member of the U.S. team $500,000, while their European counterparts continue to play without direct compensation. Of the U.S. players' fee, $300,000 must be donated to charity, but the remaining $200,000 is a personal stipend. This has allowed Team Europe to claim the moral high ground, emphasizing that they play for pride and tradition rather than money. While some U.S. players like Keegan Bradley and Scottie Scheffler have confirmed they will donate their entire fee, the ambiguity around others' intentions has fueled a narrative of American commercialism versus European passion.</p>

This strong early demand suggests that a long-awaited upgrade cycle may finally be underway, as many consumers still use older iPhone models. Analysts note that while the iPhone 17's new features are incremental, the increasing demands of AI applications and attractive carrier trade-in deals are likely motivating consumers to upgrade their devices.

Five of the current Fresh locations are expected to be converted into Whole Foods stores, the upscale chain Amazon acquired in 2017. This withdrawal from the U.K. physical grocery market mirrors a slowdown of Fresh store expansion in the U.S. as Amazon continues to refine its broader grocery ambitions. (not investment advice)</p>

It points to a chaotic recent meeting of the vaccine advisory committee as further evidence of an ideology-first approach that is fracturing public health guidance. An interview with an epidemiologist from Johns Hopkins explains that while parents' concerns should be heard, underestimating the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases is dangerous.

While some conservatives like Sen. Ted Cruz have warned that such actions could be used against them by future Democratic administrations, the author argues this misses the fundamental point. The piece contends that using government power to punish critical speech is inherently wrong, regardless of which party is in power. Arguing for retaliation based on perceived past wrongs only lowers the standard for acceptable behavior and ultimately undermines the principles of free speech for everyone.</p>

He argues that if Kimmel and his network capitulate to government pressure, it will set a dangerous precedent that will be used against other media figures.

          <p>Reports have emerged that Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, sent an apologetic email to Jeffrey Epstein in 2011 after he allegedly threatened to "destroy her" in a menacing phone call. A former spokesperson claims the call came after Ferguson had publicly disavowed Epstein and described him as a paedophile. In the subsequent email, she called him a "supreme friend" and apologized for her public comments. The revelation of this email has led several charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust, to sever their long-standing ties with the Duchess. Epstein was found dead in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.</p>

The lawsuit claimed that after the man, Jesus Plasencia, had an initial "mini stroke" at the gate, his wife's concerns were dismissed by the flight crew, who cleared the plane for takeoff without seeking medical help. He then suffered a more severe stroke mid-flight, and the crew failed to divert the plane, delaying critical medical care for nearly eight hours. The jury found the airline liable under the Montreal Convention for failing to follow its own medical emergency protocols.</p>

          <p>A High Court judge has ordered actor Noel Clarke to pay an initial £3 million towards The Guardian's legal costs after he lost his libel lawsuit against the newspaper. Clarke sued the publisher for defamation after it published a series of articles in 2021 containing sexual misconduct allegations from multiple women. In August, a judge dismissed his claim, finding the newspaper's reporting was substantially true and in the public interest. During the hearing, Clarke, who represented himself, stated that he has lost his work, savings, and ability to support his family, but the judge ruled he must make the substantial payment within 28 days.</p>
