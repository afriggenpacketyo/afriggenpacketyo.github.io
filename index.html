          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urgently called on Western allies to fulfill their commitments regarding air-defense systems and missiles, stressing that all agreements must be honored 100% before winter. This appeal comes after a night of severe Russian attacks involving over 100 drones and 150 glide bombs, which tragically killed two people and injured 18 others across various Ukrainian cities. Zelenskyy underscored the critical need for a robust, multi-layered air defense system to protect European skies from Russia's escalating aerial terror, citing thousands of drones, missiles, and aerial bombs launched in the past month. Poland also reported recent Russian drone incursions, prompting calls for strengthened NATO deterrence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of recent public violence, including the deaths of Charlie Kirk and Iryna Zarutska, psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert addresses the profound trauma experienced by witnesses, whether directly or through media. He outlines common mental health effects such as shock, fear, hypervigilance, and difficulty sleeping, which can evolve into more entrenched issues if persistent. Alpert advises coping strategies like grounding techniques, social connection, and limiting news exposure, noting that constant violent imagery can desensitize individuals. He stresses that "trauma isolates and connection helps," urging awareness for red flags indicating a need for professional intervention to navigate such overwhelming experiences.</p>

          <h2>Smoke-Dried Human Remains in Asia Identified as Potentially World's Oldest Mummies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 07:00:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have uncovered smoke-dried human remains in Southeast Asia, dating back up to 12,000 years, which may represent the world's oldest known mummies. Found in crouched positions with cuts and burn marks across various sites in China, Vietnam, and other regional countries, the bodies were likely preserved over fires by hunter-gatherer communities. This discovery pushes back the timeline for mummification practices, previously attributed to the Chinchorro people 7,000 years ago. Researchers theorize this tradition allowed ancient peoples to maintain physical and spiritual connections with ancestors, a practice that remarkably continues in some Indigenous communities today. The findings offer a significant contribution to understanding prehistoric funerary rituals.</p>

          <p>Meta is set to unveil its most advanced AI-powered smart glasses, codenamed Hypernova, at its Connect 2025 event, marking a strategic shift from its costly virtual reality endeavors. These new glasses, expected to cost $800, will feature a small display controllable via hand gestures through a neural wristband, building on Meta's partnership with EssilorLuxottica. Despite billions in Reality Labs losses, investors are seeking progress, and smart glasses are seen as a more mass-market and impactful investment than niche VR headsets. Analysts anticipate that the integration of AI features into this hardware could make the glasses a significant portal for artificial intelligence, potentially challenging smartphones as the next major computing platform.</p>

Dabhoiwala highlights that "free speech absolutism" often ignores harm and context, leading to societal corrosion when misinformation and conspiracy theories proliferate. She advocates for a more nuanced understanding, distinguishing between artistic and political speech, and addressing the power of amplification by modern media platforms.</p>

          <p>A Kenyan High Court has issued an arrest warrant for a British national implicated in the 2012 murder of Agnes Wanjiru, whose body was discovered in a septic tank after she was last seen with British soldiers. Justice Alexander Muteti confirmed sufficient evidence for the suspect to face trial in Kenya, initiating extradition proceedings from the UK. This development is a crucial step for Wanjiru's family, who have tirelessly sought justice for over a decade in a case that has generated significant public anger. Both Kenyan and UK authorities are cooperating, with British witnesses expected to participate, underscoring the international attention on this long-unresolved crime.</p>

          <p>A self-proclaimed "African tribe," the Kingdom of Kubala group, consisting of three individuals, was evicted from privately-owned woodland near Jedburgh, Scotland, only to immediately set up a new camp metres away across a wire fence. Sheriff officers, supported by police, carried out the eviction after the group ignored previous orders to leave the land. The group, which has a significant online following, claims ancestral rights to the land, asserting it was stolen 400 years ago. However, Scottish Borders Council maintains they are breaking the law, and the landowners successfully applied for the eviction. Despite the eviction, the group remains defiant, having previously moved locations after an initial removal in July.</p>

          <p>Former US President Donald Trump announced his intention to sue The New York Times for $15 billion, alleging defamation and libel. In a Truth Social post, Trump accused the newspaper of consistently lying, smearing, and defaming him, specifically criticizing its endorsement of Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election as a "mouthpiece for the Radical Left Democrat Party." This lawsuit, to be filed in Florida, follows previous legal actions by Trump against media outlets, including successful multimillion-dollar settlements from ABC News and CBS News, and an ongoing case against The Wall Street Journal. Trump's history with The New York Times includes a dismissed $100 million lawsuit over his tax records and a failed $475 million defamation suit against CNN.</p>

          <p>The number of UK pensioners receiving winter fuel payments plummeted to 1.3 million last year, a drastic drop of 9.3 million, following a controversial government decision to means-test the benefit. This policy change by the Treasury restricted payments, typically up to £300 per household, to only low-income individuals on specific benefits. However, a significant public and political outcry prompted Chancellor Rachel Reeves to reverse the policy in June. As a result, over three-quarters of pensioners, specifically those with an annual income of £35,000 or less, will once again be eligible for the payment this winter, ensuring broader support for energy bills.</p>

The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, marks the first confirmed instance of Pollock utilizing manganese blue, a pigment historically used by artists and for materials like swimming pool cement, before its discontinuation due to environmental reasons.

          <p>The UK state pension is projected to rise by 4.7% next April, potentially increasing the new flat-rate state pension by over £500 annually, according to the latest average earnings data. This increase is determined by the "triple lock" policy, which guarantees the state pension rises by the highest of 2.5%, inflation, or average earnings growth. With inflation forecast at 4%, the 4.7% average earnings growth for the three months to July is expected to be the determining factor. However, this rise, coupled with a frozen personal tax allowance, means more pensioners could pay income tax by 2027, raising concerns about the net benefit for retirees. (not investment advice)</p>

The Division of Reproductive Health, responsible for Prams, has lost most of its staff, rendering 2024-2026 data collection unusable, according to a lawsuit.

          <p>Despite his unexpected and decisive victory in the New York City mayoral primary, rising Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani has largely been withheld endorsements from top New York Democratic figures like Senators Schumer and Gillibrand, and House Minority Leader Jeffries. Governor Kathy Hochul offered a qualified endorsement, acknowledging policy differences. This hesitation, criticized by progressives like Bernie Sanders, stems from Mamdani's progressive platform, including taxing the wealthy and his stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict, which concerns centrist Democrats and wealthy donors. Some believe party leaders fear associating with a socialist mayor could harm national Democratic prospects, especially with looming midterm elections and President Trump's potential interference.</p>

          <p>China's advanced Fujian aircraft carrier has commenced "scientific research experiments and training missions," leading to strong speculation that its home port will be Sanya, Hainan, within the strategically vital PLA Southern Theatre Command. This operational phase mirrors the 2019 deployment of the Shandong carrier, which subsequently made Sanya its base. Should the Fujian also be stationed there, it would position two of China's three active carriers in the South China Sea, significantly impacting regional power dynamics. While the navy describes these movements as standard for carrier construction, the choice of homeport carries substantial geopolitical implications for the contested waters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that cultivating "awe" is crucial for liberal democracy, serving as a counterweight to the "dark passions" exemplified by recent political violence, such as Charlie Kirk's assassination, and the divisive rhetoric of figures like Donald Trump. Drawing on political theory and psychology, the piece describes awe as a complex, pro-social emotion that reduces anxiety, fosters generosity, and expands empathy by diminishing self-preoccupation. It highlights awe's historical and religious significance, suggesting it reawakens higher aspirations and refines sensibilities. The author advocates for intentionally nurturing awe through nature, art, music, and spiritual practices, believing it can help humanity navigate chaotic times and perceive the world's inherent beauty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's efforts to shape American arts and history, including redirecting Smithsonian reviews and federal arts funding, are being compared to the CIA's covert cultural propaganda during the Cold War. Trump seeks to promote "patriotic" and representational art, downplaying critical historical narratives like slavery. This mirrors the CIA's mid-20th-century strategy to project an image of American high culture abroad, funding Abstract Expressionists and literary journals while suppressing art that exposed American societal flaws, particularly regarding race. Both instances highlight government interference in the arts, aiming to control national image, though Trump's approach is more overt and populist, contrasting with the CIA's sophisticated, discreet methods.</p>

          <p>At 85, Ojai artist Alice Matzkin has experienced a remarkable resurgence in her creative output, painting like never before, despite a 2017 wildfire incinerating most of her life's work, including about 100 paintings and family pictures. After an extended fallow period following the devastation and the pandemic, a voice inspired her to return to the studio. Using black charcoal paper and pastels, she began creating "bizarre drawings" and has since completed 55 large abstract paintings, now on display. Matzkin, known for portraits of figures like Chelsea Clinton and Betty Friedan, embraces aging and finds gratitude in life, seeing her new abstract works as "good vibes" for the world.</p>

The article highlights shared elements like beleaguered daughters, meticulous attention to period detail in world-building and costumes, and an exploration of class struggles.

          <p>Elon Musk's proposed trillion-dollar pay package from Tesla, subject to shareholder approval, is under scrutiny for containing benchmarks that are less "daunting and challenging" than presented. Critics argue these goals, such as 20 million vehicle deliveries by 2035 (including past sales) and 1 million "robotaxis" (loosely defined), are "watered-down versions" of Musk's previous unfulfilled promises. The package, defended by Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm, aims to motivate Musk to transform Tesla into an AI and robotics company, potentially increasing his voting control. However, the board's independence is questioned, and the financial targets are unadjusted for inflation, raising concerns about the actual value created for shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Today's date, September 16, 2025 (9/16/25), is being celebrated by mathematicians for its rare and beautiful numerical properties, occurring only once a century. All three entries—9, 16, and 25—are perfect squares (3², 4², 5²), derived from consecutive numbers. Most notably, 3, 4, and 5 form a Pythagorean triple, meaning 3² + 4² = 5² (a² + b² = c²), the most famous theorem in mathematics. This geometric significance, representing the sides of a right triangle, adds to its elegance.

While there's a recent increase in violent offenses, particularly among young men, experts emphasize that migration itself doesn't cause criminality; rather, factors like unemployment and lack of prospects are key. Studies also suggest migrants commit crimes less often than the national population, and much crime, especially sexual assault, remains unreported.</p>
