          <p>Dave Parker, a celebrated outfielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates and a soon-to-be-enshrined Hall of Famer, has passed away at the age of 74.

The Pirates organization and MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred both released statements mourning his death and celebrating his legacy as a gifted and intimidating player.

          <p>The Senate is advancing a massive spending package that includes extensions of Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts and introduces new temporary tax breaks for tip income and overtime pay. The 940-page bill also contains a controversial $5 trillion debt ceiling increase and significant changes to the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction, raising the cap to $40,000. Additionally, the legislation proposes deep cuts to Medicaid, including work requirements, and eliminates the tax credit for electric vehicles. The bill's passage remains uncertain due to divisions within the Republican party over its fiscal impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Heavy rains triggered a mudslide in southern West Virginia, trapping thousands of motorists on the state's turnpike for more than eight hours. The slide blocked a storm drain, flooding the northbound lanes and creating a 12-mile traffic backup with no detours provided. The West Virginia Parkways Authority has taken full responsibility for the failure to reroute traffic, promising policy revisions to prevent future occurrences. While no injuries were reported, stranded drivers expressed frustration over the lack of information and basic necessities during the overnight ordeal.</p>

Scientists have expressed alarm, warning that losing this tool, which accounts for nearly half of all microwave instruments, will severely degrade the accuracy of hurricane forecasts.

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is forcing a full, word-for-word reading of the 940-page Republican spending bill on the Senate floor, a procedural move expected to take up to 15 hours. This delay tactic is intended to slow the GOP's push to pass the legislation and give Democrats more time to scrutinize its contents. While the all-night reading will postpone debate, it is not expected to ultimately prevent a final vote on the bill. The move highlights the intense political maneuvering surrounding the massive legislative package, which will be followed by a debate and a "vote-a-rama" amendment process.</p>

Police used pepper spray after flares were thrown near a counter-protest held by Vucic supporters. The protests, initially sparked by a deadly rail station collapse last year, have been ongoing for months, with students now playing a leading role. President Vucic has refused calls for a snap election, blaming foreign influence for the unrest and vowing that the country will be defended from what he termed "thugs."</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied another motion by Donald Trump to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by the men wrongfully convicted in the 1989 Central Park jogger case. The plaintiffsâ€”Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, and Korey Wiseâ€”sued Trump for statements he made suggesting they were guilty, despite their exoneration for a brutal sexual assault and assault. Judge Wendy Beetlestone ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which Trump's legal team invoked, does not apply in federal court. This decision allows the lawsuit, which addresses Trump's false claims about the case, to proceed.</p>

Experts warn that the increased use of plainclothes and masked ICE agents for arrests may be making it easier for criminals to impersonate them. Several cases have been reported nationwide, including instances of kidnapping and sexual assault, where perpetrators allegedly pretended to be immigration officials to target vulnerable individuals.

Speaking at the Welsh Labour Party conference, Starmer affirmed his commitment to the welfare safety net but stated it should not become a trap for those able to work. The government reversed plans to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) for existing claimants and will now increase some benefits in line with inflation.

The couple, now married for over a decade, shared their story of facing obstacles in healthcare and daily life, emphasizing the importance of their fight for their children.

The court's conservative majority granted states more authority on issues like transgender medical treatments and Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood, reflecting a states-rights approach. The justices also reined in the power of district judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a procedural win for the Trump administration.

This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring remained connected to the family home. The findings, which also show females received significantly more grave goods than males, challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal societal structures in the ancient world.</p>

          <p>A photograph has surfaced showing a captured American-made M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) that has been retrofitted by Russia with a domestic 30mm 2A72 cannon. The original vehicle is armed with a 25mm Bushmaster cannon, and the modification suggests Russia is exploring ways to utilize captured Western military hardware despite lacking compatible ammunition. It is unclear if this modified Bradley is intended for battlefield use, testing, or propaganda purposes. While Russia has deployed some captured Bradleys, their operational use is limited by logistical challenges and a lack of spare parts.</p>

Although she did not see what bit her, experts who analyzed photos of the injuries believe they are consistent with a juvenile sand tiger shark. Swimming was temporarily suspended, but patrols will remain in place, though officials note that unprovoked shark bites on humans remain a rare occurrence globally.</p>

While the full extent is still being assessed, he confirmed a significant setback to Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities. Grossi emphasized the urgent need for diplomatic talks and for IAEA inspectors to regain access to verify remaining materials and activities, noting that Iran's nuclear knowledge cannot be destroyed.

          <p>One week after the U.S. attacked three Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions from the Trump administration have created confusion about the mission's success. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed Iran's nuclear program was "obliterated," initial intelligence reports suggested a more modest setback of only a few months. As the week progressed, officials appeared to shift their focus, emphasizing that the strikes successfully prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel rather than achieving total destruction of the nuclear facilities. This has led to ongoing questions about the actual extent of the damage and the primary objectives of the military action.</p>

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, some airbags may have improperly sealed seams, which could prevent them from holding enough pressure during deployment to adequately protect passengers in certain crashes. Chrysler's parent company, Stellantis, stated it is not aware of any related injuries or accidents. Dealers will inspect the vehicles and replace the airbags free of charge if necessary.</p>

          <p>Opener Smriti Mandhana scored a brilliant maiden T20 international century, leading India to a decisive 97-run victory over England in the series opener. Mandhana's stunning 112 from 62 balls powered India to a formidable total of 210-5, the second-highest score England has ever conceded in the format. England's chase faltered early, as they collapsed to 113 all out, with captain Nat Sciver-Brunt providing the only significant resistance with a score of 66. The comprehensive win gives India a strong start to the five-match series and highlights areas for improvement for the English side.</p>

          <h2>Massive Crowd Marches in Budapest Pride in Defiance of Government Ban</h2>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, openly defying a government ban in a significant rebuke to Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n. The event, which organizers called the largest in the country's history, proceeded despite a new law prohibiting gatherings that "promote" homosexuality to minors, which carried the risk of heavy fines for attendees. The massive turnout was seen as a blow to OrbÃ¡n's prestige amid slumping poll numbers. Participants and EU officials who joined the march framed it as a defense of not only LGBTQ+ rights but also broader democratic freedoms in Hungary.</p>
