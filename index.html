This partnership ensures that the premier tournament in women's football will remain available free-to-air for audiences across the United Kingdom. The broadcasters will divide the coverage of the group and knockout stages, with both networks airing the final, reflecting the sport's significant and unprecedented growth in popularity and commercial interest. This deal underscores the commitment to keeping major women's sporting events accessible to the public.</p>

          <h2>New Biography Explores Jackie Kennedy's Concerns Over Marilyn Monroe</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography by author J. Randy Taraborrelli claims that while Jackie Kennedy was aware of her husband's infidelities, she viewed Marilyn Monroe as a unique threat, allegedly warning JFK that the actress 'could be trouble.' The book delves into this dynamic, suggesting Jackie deliberately missed the 1962 birthday event where Monroe famously sang to the president. However, Taraborrelli also casts doubt on the long-rumored affair between JFK and Monroe, citing a lack of credible evidence and testimony from Monroe's close friend and publicist, Pat Newcomb.</p>

          <p>Following Paramount's decision to cancel 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,' prominent comedians have launched a powerful satirical response, questioning the stated financial motivations behind the move. Jon Stewart on 'The Daily Show' and the creators of 'South Park' delivered pointed critiques of corporate censorship and self-censorship in the face of political pressure. Colbert himself has also joined the pushback, using his monologues to mock the decision and reaffirm his commitment to uninhibited commentary, highlighting a moment of significant defiance from satirists within the media landscape.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market has surged to record highs, a surprising trend given the widespread anxiety among businesses and consumers about massive tariffs threatened by the Trump administration. This apparent contradiction is fueled by a resilient economy with low unemployment, better-than-expected corporate profits, and a growing investor belief that the president’s aggressive tariff rhetoric may not fully translate into action. However, market experts remain cautious, warning that the economy could still slow down and that stocks are priced for perfection, making them vulnerable to a significant pullback.

          <p>A mother from Apple Valley, California, has experienced a remarkable coincidence, giving birth to all four of her children on the same calendar day, July 7th, across different years. Nauzhae Drake's four children were born on 7/7 in 2019, 2021, 2022, and now 2025, with none of the births being induced or intentionally scheduled for that date. A mathematics professor calculated the odds of such an event occurring for four random individuals as astronomically low, making the family's shared birthday a uniquely heartwarming and statistically improbable story.</p>

          <p>Fan Chunli, a 50-year-old woman from rural China, has become an unlikely stand-up comedy star by candidly joking about her abusive ex-husband and patriarchal social norms. Her viral performance on a popular televised contest has won widespread public acclaim but has also drawn a veiled warning from a provincial government, which cautioned against jokes that 'provoke' gender conflict. Fan's rise highlights both the growing appetite for social commentary in China and the official sensitivity surrounding feminist themes and open discussions of domestic abuse.</p>

          <p>Four people, including a husband and wife, have been arrested in Fort White, Florida, and charged with aggravated child abuse involving nine children in their care. Authorities allege that some of the children, aged 7 to 16, were kept in locked plywood cages built under bunk beds and were subjected to punishments like being beaten with canes and sprayed with vinegar. The investigation was initiated after a legally mandated reporter from their local church raised concerns, leading to the removal of all nine children from the home.</p>

          <p>A senior official in China's Jilin province has called for a clear historical presentation of ancient kingdoms that existed in the region, referring to them by their Chinese names and as part of China's history. These remarks risk reigniting long-standing historical and territorial sensitivities with South Korea, which knows the kingdoms of Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae by their Korean names and considers them a core part of its own national heritage. The statement touches on a deeply contested academic and nationalist debate between the two nations over the historical lineage of the area.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is increasingly suppressing media coverage of mass casualty attacks, such as recent incidents where drivers have struck pedestrians, with authorities quickly scrubbing detailed reports and images from the internet. While police often issue brief and vague statements, the clampdown on information under leader Xi Jinping has led to growing frustration among some citizens. In several recent cases, people have taken to social media to complain about the lack of transparency and demand the truth about events that impact public safety.</p>
