          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) is taking over the investigation into claims that South Yorkshire Police officers sexually abused children involved in grooming gangs during the 1990s and early 2000s. This decision follows calls for transparency, as the local police force was initially investigating its own former officers. The inquiry, part of the broader Operation Stovewood, addresses serious allegations, including testimony that a serving officer committed sexual assault in a marked police car. Three former officers have been arrested in connection with the claims.</p>

          <p>Following the launch of GPT-5, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated the company will continue to operate at a loss to prioritize growth and investment in computing power and model training. Despite projections of passing $20 billion in annual recurring revenue, the company remains unprofitable by choice, a strategy Altman believes is rational as long as the AI models continue to improve rapidly. OpenAI is reportedly in talks for a stock sale at a valuation around $500 billion, indicating strong investor confidence in its long-term vision. Altman noted the flexibility of being a private company allows this focus on aggressive expansion over immediate profitability.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed revoking a 2009 "endangerment finding" that legally underpins regulations on greenhouse gas emissions for vehicles. If enacted, this would repeal emissions standards and ease pressure on automakers to produce electric vehicles, allowing them to align production more closely with current consumer demand. While the auto industry is reviewing the proposal, experts note that companies have long-term EV plans and compete globally, suggesting immediate shifts would be minimal. The move reflects a broader deregulatory push, but consumer preference and international markets will remain key drivers for automakers.</p>

          <p>The music industry is remembering the lives and legacies of two influential figures, Sly Stone and Brian Wilson, who both passed away this week at the age of 82. Sly Stone, born Sylvester Stewart, was the frontman for Sly and the Family Stone, a pioneering funk and soul band known for its integrated lineup and socially conscious hits. Brian Wilson was the creative genius behind The Beach Boys, crafting a unique sound that defined the California surf-rock era and became an indelible part of American pop culture. Both artists left a revolutionary and lasting impact on the course of modern music.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued a strong warning against any court ruling that might block his tariff policies, claiming such a move could trigger a severe economic downturn comparable to the Great Depression of 1929. He argued on social media that the tariffs have been a "huge positive" for the U.S. economy and stock market, and that reversing them now would jeopardize immense wealth creation. This comes as a federal appeals court considers the legality of his tariff strategy, with some experts suggesting the Supreme Court could ultimately disqualify duties imposed under emergency economic powers.

          <p>The German government has announced it will halt exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in its Gaza operations. The decision is a direct response to Israel's plan to expand its military actions in Gaza City, which Germany stated makes it difficult to see how strategic goals can be achieved without further civilian suffering. As Israel's second-largest arms supplier, Germany's move is a significant policy shift, reflecting mounting international pressure over the humanitarian crisis. The suspension, however, may not affect systems unrelated to the Gaza offensive, such as missile defense or naval equipment.</p>

The situation remains uncertain, with reports of ongoing U.S.-Russian talks aimed at brokering a deal that could end the conflict.

          <p>President Trump's proposal for a comprehensive missile defense system called "Golden Dome," inspired by Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" initiative, is facing scrutiny over its feasibility and strategic implications. Critics argue that the concept, reportedly based on Israel's Iron Dome, misunderstands the vast difference between defending against short-range rockets and intercepting intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Pentagon has been notably quiet about the project's details, leading to speculation that the plan is not yet well-defined. Experts warn that pursuing such a system could be destabilizing, provoking adversaries like Russia and China to build more offensive weapons to overwhelm it.</p>

The changes, which include deleting information and removing entire websites, have primarily targeted data related to environmental justice, diversity, and climate change. For example, the federal climate research site globalchange.gov was shut down, and multiple tools for identifying disadvantaged communities were removed.

The case involves an ongoing and extraordinary confrontation between the executive and judicial branches over the court's power to control foreign policy and immigration enforcement.

          <p>The Trump administration is deploying an increased number of federal law enforcement officers in Washington, D.C., following a recent high-profile assault and a threat from the president to "federalize" the city. The seven-day operation, which could be extended, will involve multiple federal agencies like the FBI, U.S. Marshals, and ICE, focusing on tourist areas and crime hotspots. The move comes despite D.C. police data showing a significant decrease in violent crime in 2025 compared to the previous year. The White House stated the deployment is intended to protect citizens and make the nation's capital safer.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Department of Commerce to begin work on a new census methodology that would exclude undocumented immigrants from the population count used for congressional apportionment. This move revisits a contentious issue from his first term, when his administration's attempt to add a citizenship question was blocked by the Supreme Court. The Constitution mandates a decennial count of all persons, and changing the process is a massive undertaking with significant legal and political hurdles. The move could dramatically impact the allocation of congressional seats and federal funding across the country.</p>

          <p>Iran is reportedly planning to integrate with China's BeiDou satellite navigation system, a move seen as an effort to bolster its security and reduce reliance on Western technology. The decision comes after Iran experienced significant military and nuclear facility losses during its recent conflict with Israel and the U.S. Analysts suggest this strategic shift could expand Beijing's technological footprint in the Middle East, as Iran seeks more reliable alternatives to the GPS system. An Iranian official stated that migrating to BeiDou is a key part of ongoing negotiations for a long-term agreement between Tehran and Beijing.</p>

          <p>A group of burglars broke into a Los Angeles-area store and specifically targeted its inventory of Labubu dolls, stealing merchandise valued at thousands of dollars. The store's co-owner believes the theft was planned, as the burglars bypassed other items and the break-in occurred shortly after the store announced a restock on social media. Labubu dolls, mischievous monster figures, have surged in popularity this year, leading to high demand, significant resale markups, and a growing black market. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is investigating the incident and has recovered the abandoned vehicle used by the thieves.</p>

The defendant, who cannot be named, had admitted to manslaughter but denied murder, claiming he "snapped" and lost control.

          <p>Robert Gordon, the former Michigan health director who oversaw the implementation of Medicaid work requirements in 2020, is warning other states about the potential for massive coverage losses. He recounts how, despite spending $30 million and making extensive efforts to prevent errors, an estimated 80,000 people were on track to lose their insurance in Michigan before a court blocked the law. With a new federal law mandating an expansion of these requirements, the Congressional Budget Office estimates 4.8 million people could become uninsured by 2034. Gordon argues the policy is wasteful and harmful, leading to people losing coverage due to bureaucratic hurdles rather than ineligibility.</p>

Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for the "utmost effort" in rescue operations and urged regions to be vigilant against extreme weather events. The floods have also cut off power and communication services in some areas, stranding thousands of villagers. This event is part of a pattern of common natural disasters in China during the summer, which scientists link to the increasing frequency of extreme weather driven by climate change.</p>
