          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced a curfew for downtown L.A. from 8 p.m. Tuesday to 6 a.m. Wednesday, encompassing a one-square-mile area, due to ongoing anti-ICE protests. The curfew aims to prevent vandalism and looting, with exemptions for residents, workers, credentialed media, and those experiencing homelessness. Protests, sparked by immigration raids, have led to nearly 200 arrests and looting of 23 businesses, prompting the deployment of the California National Guard and U.S. Marines by President Trump, a move challenged by Governor Newsom as illegal and immoral. The Trump administration argues the deployment is necessary to protect federal property and ICE agents from violence, while Newsom is taking legal action, deeming Trump's actions an abuse of power. The curfew is intended to address unrest isolated to downtown L.A. and is not reflective of a city-wide crisis.</p>

          <p>Fire departments are increasingly using artificial intelligence to detect and respond to wildfires more quickly. In Aspen, Colorado, AI-powered cameras provide a 360-degree view of the landscape, detecting smoke before 911 calls are even made. The system alerts fire officials with the exact location and weather data, enabling a faster response. Aspen Fire was the first department to adopt this technology, which is now used across 10 states to improve wildfire response and coordination.</p>

          <p>In Santa Ana, approximately 120 protesters gathered outside a federal building in response to multiple ICE raids in the city. Raids occurred at Home Depots, restaurants, and industrial areas. Protesters held pro-immigrant and anti-Trump signs and waved Mexican flags. The crowd chanted slogans and confronted federal agents, leading to some clashes with pepper balls. The protests evolved into a larger gathering with over 500 participants, eventually resulting in police declaring an unlawful assembly.</p>

          <p>An appellate court has ruled that President Trump's tariffs can remain in place until at least the end of July, pending the outcome of a legal battle. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Trump administration's request to pause a lower court ruling that had blocked the tariffs. Oral arguments in the case are scheduled for July 31. The tariffs, imposed on virtually every country, have faced legal challenges from businesses and state governments arguing that the president lacks the authority to impose them.</p>
