          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S. draft ceasefire proposal, conveyed by U.S. envoy Witkoff, by requesting amendments while reiterating demands for a permanent truce, complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and guaranteed humanitarian aid flow, none of which are currently part of the proposed deal. Witkoff expressed that Hamas's response was unacceptable and insisted that Hamas accept the framework proposal as the basis for further talks, which Israel has already agreed to. Israel maintains its right to resume hostilities after any temporary ceasefire, while Hamas seeks guarantees that the truce will lead to a permanent end to the war. The health ministry in Gaza reports 60 Palestinians killed and 284 injured in recent Israeli strikes, bringing the total since the conflict began to over 54,381 fatalities.</p>

The BBC acknowledged the Doctor's regeneration, hinting at the mysterious circumstances surrounding Piper's return. Gatwa reflected on his unforgettable journey and the role's lasting impact. Piper, who first appeared in 2005 alongside Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant, has enjoyed a successful acting career since her initial run on the show. Gatwa's 18-month tenure as the Doctor is the shortest since Christopher Eccleston's departure after one series in 2005.</p>

Norrie expressed that the fireworks were difficult to manage for both players, and he will now advance to the last 16 of the clay-court Grand Slam for the first time in his career. With Jack Draper also advancing, this marks the first time since 1968 that two British men have reached the French Open last 16.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Philippines' National Greening Program (NGP), an ambitious reforestation initiative, faces scrutiny due to satellite data and field reports suggesting it may not be effectively restoring forests. An analysis indicates that some NGP lands have experienced deforestation, with native trees being cleared for cash crops. Local communities often lack long-term access to the land and are pressured to grow single cash crops, undermining sustainable livelihoods. Independent audits suggest issues like poor site selection, limited community support, and weak long-term planning remain unaddressed, potentially leading to "greenwashing."</p>

          <p>Israel has announced the death of Muhammad Sinwar, a top military leader of Hamas, who is also the younger brother of the former Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, who was killed last year by Israel. Hamas has not yet confirmed the claim of his death. The reported death is another development in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. The event is another demonstration of the ongoing struggle between the two factions.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Mookie Betts was sidelined for a game against the New York Yankees due to a fractured toe sustained while walking to the bathroom in the dark.

In response, China accused the U.S. of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace.

          <p>The price of a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, a New York City staple, has increased at a Brooklyn bodega due to rising costs of ingredients, particularly eggs. The owners of El Vacilon Grocery had to raise the price from $4.50 to $5, the first increase since 2019, due to soaring egg prices. The bodega owners, who own their building, have seen their revenue decline over the years, but they also collect rent from apartments above the store. The sandwich, a ubiquitous and no-frills offering, is a key part of the city's bodega culture.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the nation's top health official, has declared autism an "epidemic" and launched a federal effort to find its cause, focusing on environmental toxins. However, many autism scientists argue that Kennedy is misdirected, as extensive research points to genetics as the primary driver of autism's development. Experts say the increase in autism rates is largely due to expanding definitions, more awareness, and better screening, rather than a single environmental toxin. Researchers fear Kennedy's fixation on outside toxins could distract from genetic research that has facilitated the development of exciting new therapies for those with profound autism.</p>

Milwaukee has continued its own inspections and water line replacements, but lacks the expertise and resources to fully address the crisis without federal assistance.
