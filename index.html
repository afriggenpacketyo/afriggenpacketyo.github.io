          <p>A significant gorse fire that spread across the landmark Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh has been successfully brought under control. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service deployed multiple units to tackle the blaze, which occurred during a busy festival weekend in the city. While the fire caused considerable smoke and led to park closures and public warnings, there were no reported casualties from the incident. This event follows a series of wildfire warnings in Scotland, which has experienced an unusually warm and dry summer, highlighting the growing risk of such occurrences.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are nearing the expiration of their 90-day tariff truce, with no clear indication of an extension. Tensions persist over issues like semiconductor export controls, China's purchases of U.S. goods, and its trade with Russia. Despite a fragile stability, experts suggest a long-term decoupling remains likely, even if a new deal is reached. A potential agreement could resemble the previous Phase One deal, with China committing to increased purchases of American products to de-escalate the ongoing trade conflict.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has indicated that the club may have to sell team captain Marc Guehi during the current transfer window. This decision comes as Guehi enters the final year of his contract with no new agreement in sight. The club aims to avoid losing the valuable England international defender on a free transfer next year. Parish confirmed that Crystal Palace rejected a £65 million offer from Newcastle United in January, but the circumstances have now changed, making a sale a reluctant necessity.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has seen its personnel numbers fall by 20% over the past six years, dropping to approximately 450,000 soldiers. This decline is primarily attributed to the nation's critically low birth rate, the lowest in the world, raising concerns about its defense capabilities. The country, which is still technically at war with North Korea, faces a significant challenge in maintaining troop levels considered necessary for national security. This demographic crisis has prompted discussions about increasing the defense budget and even the controversial possibility of conscripting women.</p>

          <p>The government in England and Wales is planning a significant overhaul of road safety laws, which could include mandatory eye tests for drivers over 70. The proposed strategy also considers lowering the drink-driving limit to align with Scotland's stricter standard and introducing penalty points for unbelted passengers. This initiative follows a coroner's report that criticized the UK's licensing system as the "laxest in Europe" after several fatal accidents involving drivers with poor eyesight. The changes aim to reduce the high number of road fatalities and injuries.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 532 people during a weekend protest by supporters of Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed as a terrorist organization. The majority of arrests were for showing support for the banned group, in what was a deliberate test of the government's new anti-terror law. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the ban, stating the group was involved in violence and significant criminal damage, distinguishing its actions from the right to peaceful protest. The arrests, which included many elderly activists, have sparked a debate about freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced that his country will officially recognize a Palestinian state, a decision to be formalized at the United Nations in September.

The recognition is conditioned on commitments from the Palestinian Authority, including no governmental role for Hamas and the demilitarization of Gaza.

However, astronomers warn that viewing conditions will be significantly compromised by a bright, 84% full waning gibbous moon. This moonlight is expected to obscure most of the fainter meteors, reducing the visible rate from a potential 50 per hour to just 10-20. For better viewing, experts suggest observing a week after the peak when the moon is less luminous, allowing more of the debris from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle to be seen.</p>

          <h2>The "Music" of Newly Formed Black Holes Explained</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of newly formed black holes emitting "music" in the form of gravitational waves. While mature black holes are known for letting nothing escape, the process of their formation—such as from a collapsing star or merging objects—creates massive ripples in spacetime. As the new black hole settles into a stable, mathematically perfect shape defined by its mass and spin, it radiates away any initial instabilities. These vibrations are not sound but are a pure, predictable signal that scientists can detect and will soon be able to experience.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of China's New Childcare Subsidy and Its Potential Regional Impact</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (about $501) annually for each child under three years old. This policy is expected to have a more significant impact in poorer regions and rural areas, where the subsidy represents a larger percentage of the average household income. For example, the handout equates to over 13% of an average resident's income in Gansu province, compared to just 4% in Shanghai. The program aims to boost consumption and potentially encourage higher birth rates. (not investment advice)</p>

This strategy involves major investments across the AI ecosystem, including chip designers like Arm and Ampere, and a significant planned investment in OpenAI. Son's long-standing interest in AI, dating back to his early vision of "brain computers" and robots, is now the central focus of the firm. Despite past investment setbacks with the Vision Fund, Son is aggressively positioning SoftBank to be a leader. (not investment advice)</p>
