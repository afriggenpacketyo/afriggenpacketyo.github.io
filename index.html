          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn a court order that reinstated Education Department employees who were laid off as part of efforts to dismantle the agency. The administration argues that a U.S. District Judge lacked the authority to require the rehiring of over 1,300 employees. These staff cuts led to the closure of civil rights enforcement offices and the elimination of the team supervising the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The administration maintains that the staff reduction aligns with the policy of streamlining the Department and delegating discretionary functions to the states.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering selling his red Model S Tesla after his relationship with Elon Musk soured. Trump initially purchased the electric vehicle to show support for Tesla and Musk, who faced criticism for working with the administration on cutting government spending. The decision to potentially get rid of the Tesla comes after a dramatic rupture in their alliance, marking a significant shift in their relationship. The move reflects the growing tension between the two figures and the potential fallout for Trump's personal choices. Optimism surrounding the future relationship of the two has plummeted.</p>

          <p>An auditor's report has revealed a "pervasive fraud environment" within Unite, one of the UK's largest trade unions. The report by BDO indicated that "dominant personalities and a weak control environment facilitated opportunities to commit fraud" during the 2021 financial year. The auditors noted "unusual relationships" between former senior staff and Unite's customers and suppliers, along with a culture that did not challenge financial transactions. The probe was ordered by General Secretary Sharon Graham, who has vowed to uncover the truth about alleged corruption related to a Birmingham hotel project that cost the union Â£112m, later valued at a fraction of that sum.</p>

          <p>With credit card balances rising, experts recommend several strategies for users to manage their debt effectively. Using cash and debit cards more frequently can help curb overspending and reliance on credit. Exploring debt consolidation options, such as balance transfer cards or personal loans, can lower interest rates and accelerate debt repayment. Speaking with a debt relief service provider can provide personalized solutions for managing high balances, including credit counseling and debt management programs. These steps can help individuals regain financial independence and improve their credit card usage habits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts are divided on whether President Trump's tariffs can effectively fund his tax bill, with the success contingent on the consistency of the tariff policy. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the tariffs could reduce the deficit by $2.8 trillion over a decade, but this assumes the tariffs remain permanent. Some analysts argue that the tariffs' shifting application and legal challenges make any projected benefits unlikely. Others criticize the CBO's scoring, emphasizing the importance of preventing the expiration of tax cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Job Market's Influence on Market Rally Highlighted</h2>

          <p>The stock market's reliance on jobs data is evident in Friday's rally, driven by positive nonfarm payrolls. The U.S. economy added 139,000 jobs in May, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2% and hourly wages increasing by 3.9%. While the job additions were partially offset by downward revisions to previous reports, the market responded favorably, indicating investor confidence. The report suggests a stable labor market, crucial for the consumption-based U.S. economy, influencing consumer spending and market performance.</p>

          <h2>Swiss Government Proposes Stricter Capital Rules for UBS</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 12:11:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Swiss government has proposed new capital rules requiring UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital following its acquisition of Credit Suisse. These measures aim to stabilize the bank and ensure it fully capitalizes its foreign units. While UBS shares initially jumped on the announcement, the bank expressed disagreement with the "extreme" increase in capital requirements. The new regulations could potentially impact UBS's growth abroad and its ability to carry out share buybacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Used vehicle prices have decreased slightly from their April highs, influenced by consumer tariff fears, but remain elevated compared to last year. Cox Automotive's Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index decreased 1.5% from April to May, but is still 4% higher than the previous year. The changes in new vehicle prices, production, and demand, influenced by President Trump's tariffs, affect the used car market. Inventory levels for used vehicles remain low, sustaining relatively strong demand.</p>
