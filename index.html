          <p>Palestinian militants opened fire at a bus stop in north Jerusalem, resulting in the deaths of six people and injuring several others. The attack, which took place at the Ramot Junction, was one of the deadliest in the city since the start of the war in Gaza. Israeli police confirmed that two assailants were neutralized at the scene by a security officer and a civilian. Hamas praised the attack, calling it a natural response to the ongoing conflict and occupation.</p>

          <p>The UK's new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has stated that the government may suspend visas for countries that do not cooperate with migrant return agreements. This policy consideration was discussed during a Five Eyes intelligence group meeting in London, which included security officials from the US, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. The announcement comes as the UK faces mounting pressure to address the increasing number of small boat crossings in the Channel, which has surpassed 30,000 this year.</p>

          <p>Protests in Kathmandu against a government ban on social media platforms like Facebook and X have turned deadly, with at least 13 people killed and dozens injured in clashes with security forces. The government imposed the ban, citing the need to regulate fake news and hate speech, but demonstrators, largely from "Generation Z," argue it is an authoritarian move. Authorities used tear gas, water cannons, and rubber bullets after protesters breached a restricted area near the parliament building, leading to a curfew being imposed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US housing market is experiencing a significant slowdown, forcing many sellers to lower their asking prices and offer concessions to attract a smaller pool of buyers. High home values and mortgage rates have priced many shoppers out of the market, leading to an increase in housing inventory, particularly in Southern and Western states. While the national median home price saw a slight increase, metro areas like Austin and Miami experienced declines. This shift in market dynamics marks a change from the seller-dominated environment of recent years. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced his resignation after his ruling coalition lost its majority in both houses of parliament. The decision precedes a party vote that would have likely forced him out, creating political instability as Japan confronts significant domestic and international challenges. The upcoming leadership election in the Liberal Democratic Party is expected to be contentious, with potential candidates like Sanae Takaichi and Shinjiro Koizumi emerging. This leadership change could signal a period of rotating prime ministers and a potential "national reset" for Japanese politics.</p>

          <p>England's cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has stated that the team for the first Ashes Test against Australia, beginning November 21st, has not yet been finalized. A key position in question is the number three batter, with a choice between vice-captain Ollie Pope and 21-year-old Jacob Bethell, who recently scored his first professional century. McCullum praised Bethell's potential and leadership qualities, noting he will captain an under-strength side against Ireland. The coach also emphasized the need for player rest, pulling key players from upcoming T20 matches.</p>

          <p>A report from the Crime Prevention Research Center claims that President Trump's federalization of the D.C. police led to a 13-day period with zero homicides, a statistically significant event. The article argues this crackdown disproportionately benefited Black Americans, who constitute the vast majority of homicide victims in the city. The report's author, John Lott, contrasts this outcome with criticism from Democratic politicians who have labeled such federal interventions as racist. The federal operation has resulted in over 1,900 arrests since it began in August.</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques President Trump's executive order to rename the Department of Defense back to its original name, the Department of War. The author argues that while Trump claims the change revives a "warrior ethos," it more accurately reflects an aggressive and interventionist foreign policy that has continued under his administration. The piece lists recent military actions in Syria, Somalia, and Yemen, and an attack on Iranian facilities as evidence that contradicts Trump's "peace president" promises. The author suggests the name change celebrates the president as an unrestrained aggressor.</p>

The National Development and Reform Commission plans to roll out at least five industry-specific AI models for power grids, coal, oil, and gas industries. By 2027, the goal is to establish a comprehensive framework, develop over 100 application scenarios, and create innovation platforms to train specialists.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While artificial intelligence is causing some disruption, labor economists assert that its overall impact on the job market remains small, with broader economic uncertainty being the main driver of recent hiring slowdowns. Experts note that most AI-related layoffs have been confined to the tech industry, which represents a relatively small portion of the total workforce. A Stanford study found that AI's negative employment effects are concentrated among early-career workers in automatable roles. Meanwhile, demand for workers with AI skills is increasing, suggesting a trend towards augmentation rather than replacement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's decorative choices, such as adding extensive gold to the Oval Office, as part of a larger effort to rebrand America in his own image. The author connects Trump's ostentatious, 1980s-era New York aesthetic to a political project aimed at intertwining his personal brand with the state itself. The analysis argues this rebranding seeks to promote a specific vision of America that is nostalgic for a whiter, more culturally conservative past. This is manifested through policies targeting immigration, gender norms, and free speech.</p>

          <p>Private equity firms are aggressively recruiting for fundraising and investor relations roles as they anticipate a rebound in dealmaking, leading to a talent war with investment banks. After a period of slowdown due to rising interest rates, firms are now investing in their distribution teams to secure capital from limited partners. This hiring spree is global, with firms like Apollo and Carlyle expanding in Asia, and is particularly focused on junior talent, prompting banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan to implement new rules to prevent poaching.
