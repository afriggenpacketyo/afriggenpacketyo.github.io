          <p>A former assistant to Kanye West, also known as Ye, is reportedly in hiding out of fear after filing an amended lawsuit against the rapper. The lawsuit, initially for sexual harassment, now includes allegations of sex trafficking, stalking, and sexual assault. The assistant's lawyer stated she has deleted her internet presence and is suffering while the case proceeds. West's legal team has denied the claims, calling them "fantasy fiction" and stating they are prepared to contest them in court.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is expected to face significant protests during a private five-day visit to his golf resorts in Scotland. Organizers anticipate demonstrations across the country, citing what they describe as widespread anger over his policies. While the visit is private, UK Labour leader Keir Starmer is scheduled to hold talks with Trump. Police Scotland is preparing for a large-scale operation to manage the events, though they do not anticipate disorder, while police federations warn of stretched resources.</p>

          <p>After a decade-long legal fight, the rate-rigging convictions of two former London traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have been quashed. The ruling overturns their jail sentences for manipulating the Libor interest rate and opens the door for other convicted traders to appeal. The case raises significant questions about potential compensation, the basis of the original prosecutions by the Serious Fraud Office, and the role of senior bank managers. Calls for a broader public inquiry into the matter are now intensifying.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's effort to end birthright citizenship, affirming a lower court's nationwide block on the policy. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the executive order, which sought to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizen or temporary resident parents, to be unconstitutional. The decision is based on the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment and marks a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration agenda. The case could be appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Donald Trump will visit the Federal Reserve, a move seen as a significant escalation of his public pressure campaign against its chairman, Jerome Powell. This marks the first official presidential trip to the central bank in nearly two decades, challenging the traditional independence of the institution. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates and has even suggested he might try to fire him. The visit is a symbolic act that brings the president's criticism directly to the Fed's headquarters.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has released more declassified documents related to the 2016 Russia investigation, claiming they show Obama administration officials "manufactured" false intelligence to undermine Donald Trump. The release, a 2017 House Republican report, has prompted sharp criticism from Democrats and former intelligence officials, who argue it misrepresents findings and risks exposing sensitive sources. Gabbard asserted the action was taken to prevent the politicization of intelligence, while critics accuse the administration of creating a distraction and endangering national security.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Giants' Rafael Devers, after making his debut at first base, made a surprising admission about his role on the field. Previously, with the Boston Red Sox, Devers had been adamant about serving exclusively as the designated hitter. However, he now states that he prefers playing a defensive position because it keeps him active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. This marks a significant shift from his stance during a tense spring training where he reportedly resisted a move to first base with his former team.</p>

While fan groups feel the current political climate makes them feel unsafe, Garber maintained that the league itself will not take a political stance.

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced a House resolution to stop a federal plan to shoot approximately 450,000 barred owls in the Pacific Northwest. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service approved the culling to protect the native northern spotted owl, which is being outcompeted and is in rapid decline. Proponents of the resolution argue the plan is inhumane, unworkable, and a waste of taxpayer money. However, some scientists warn that blocking the culling will likely lead to the extinction of the spotted owl, creating a difficult environmental dilemma.</p>

However, city officials have raised alarms, warning that the loss of revenue would be an "assault on public safety" and could force drastic cuts to police and fire services.
