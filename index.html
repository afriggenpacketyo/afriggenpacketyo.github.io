          <p>The three-year mystery of missing cyclist Tony Parsons was solved thanks to the quick thinking of his killer's girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead. After Alexander McKellar confessed to a fatal hit-and-run, he led Muirhead to the shallow grave, where she secretly dropped a Red Bull can to mark the location for police. Parsons, who was on a charity ride, was struck and left without medical aid by McKellar and his twin brother. The case, detailed in a new documentary, highlights the family's long wait for justice and their gratitude for Muirhead's crucial intervention.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia has reduced its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.6%, the lowest level since April 2023. This move was accompanied by a downgrade in the country's annual economic growth forecast from 2.1% to 1.7%. The central bank cited a significant drop in inflation and weaker-than-expected public demand as key factors for the decision. While the RBA noted that risks from a global trade war have diminished, the lowered GDP outlook is primarily attributed to a weaker forecast for productivity growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent polls indicate a significant shift in Israeli public opinion, with a growing majority now favoring a deal with Hamas to secure the release of all remaining hostages, even if it means ending the war in Gaza. This sentiment is fueled by ongoing protests and the fears of hostages' families that continued military operations endanger their loved ones. However, surveys also reveal a stark disconnect, as most Jewish Israelis express little concern for the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza, highlighting a complex public focus on internal security.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals that thousands of North Koreans are being sent to Russia to work in what are described as slave-like conditions, filling a labor shortage caused by the war in Ukraine. Workers interviewed described grueling 18-hour days on construction sites, constant surveillance, and having the majority of their earnings confiscated by the North Korean state. South Korean intelligence suggests over 10,000 laborers were sent last year, with many more expected, in a system that appears to bypass UN sanctions by using student visas.</p>

          <p>Spain is charting a foreign policy course that is creating friction with the Trump administration, notably by rejecting U.S. aircraft purchases and resisting NATO's 5% defense spending target. The Spanish government, led by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, is also pursuing closer economic ties with China, further straining its relationship with Washington. Analysts suggest Spain's left-leaning government feels shielded by its EU membership from direct U.S. trade retaliation and is using foreign policy to distract from domestic issues, positioning it as a rare challenger to the U.S. agenda.</p>

          <p>A specific model of the NexGen knee implant, used in thousands of UK operations, was known to have a high failure rate for eight years before its manufacturer, Zimmer Biomet, withdrew it. An investigation found that patients suffered severe pain, immobility, and addiction to painkillers after the implant component loosened from the bone. The National Joint Registry first flagged concerns in 2014, but the product remained on the market until 2022, costing the NHS millions in corrective surgeries and causing long-lasting health problems for patients.</p>

Scott Sherman's testimony casts doubt on the administration's legal justification, which cited a "rebellion" to invoke Title 10 authority.

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist and central bank adviser, Wang Yiming, has urged the government to guide, rather than stifle, the country's intensely competitive "quick commerce" sector. As e-commerce platforms engage in fierce price wars for rapid delivery services, Wang advised that policy should curb excessive cash burn but not eliminate competition itself. He argued that the sector creates vital new consumption opportunities and that the goal should be to elevate competition toward innovation and quality, helping drive long-term economic growth.

          <p>An 11-year-old girl is recovering in the hospital after being attacked by a mountain lion outside her family's home in Malibu. The incident occurred Sunday evening while the girl was doing chores in her backyard. Her mother and sibling rushed out after hearing screams, which scared the animal away. Officials from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife later located and killed a mountain lion found hiding on the property. DNA samples are being tested to confirm it was the animal responsible for the rare but serious attack.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost tourism, Nepal has announced it will waive climbing fees for 97 Himalayan peaks for the next two years. The selected mountains are located in the country's remote and less-developed western provinces. This initiative contrasts with a recent decision to increase the permit fee for Mount Everest to $15,000 during peak season, its first hike in nearly a decade. Officials hope the fee waiver will attract mountaineers to unexplored destinations, creating jobs and strengthening local economies, though questions remain about supporting infrastructure.</p>

The chase began in Lancaster with the carjacking of a pickup truck and involved the suspects firing shots at the original victim. They later abandoned the truck, stole a big rig which they drove the wrong way on a freeway, and then carjacked a third vehicle in downtown L.A. The suspects ditched the final truck and disappeared, with authorities believing accomplices may have assisted their escape.</p>

The staffer, who reportedly worked for the House Intelligence Committee, told the FBI in 2017 that he attended a meeting where Schiff greenlit a plan to leak derogatory information. According to the documents, the whistleblower described the plan as "illegal" and "treasonous."

          <p>President Donald Trump has asserted control over Washington D.C.'s police force and deployed the National Guard to the capital, bypassing the city's elected leadership. Trump justified the move as necessary to "rescue" the city from what he described as lawlessness, a portrayal that critics say is based on misleading claims. D.C. officials have condemned the action as an illegal overreach of federal power, while protesters gathered outside the White House. The president also warned that other Democrat-led cities could face similar federal intervention.</p>

Some local businesses have resorted to locking their doors during business hours to protect their customers.

The unusual post-conviction attempt to drop the charges, which had already been reduced from a felony, came after a new U.S. Attorney was appointed and triggered the resignation of several prosecutors in protest.</p>
