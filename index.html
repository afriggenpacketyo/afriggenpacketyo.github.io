          <p>A man in his 40s has died after falling from a height during an Oasis concert at London's Wembley Stadium. The Metropolitan Police and medics responded to the incident on Saturday night, but the man was pronounced dead at the scene with injuries consistent with a fall. The band expressed their shock and sadness, offering condolences to the victim's family and friends. Police are appealing for witnesses who may have seen the incident or captured it on video, as the stadium was crowded for the sold-out reunion show. The investigation is expected to be handed over to the Health and Safety Executive.</p>

          <p>More than 3,000 Boeing defense workers in Missouri and Illinois have initiated a strike after rejecting the company's latest contract offer concerning pay, schedules, and pensions. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) is leading the walkout, which affects the production of F-15 fighter jets and other military aircraft. Boeing expressed disappointment, stating its offer included a 40% average wage growth, and has implemented a contingency plan to continue operations. This marks the first strike at Boeing's defense unit since 1996, adding another challenge for the aviation giant already grappling with safety and production issues.</p>

          <p>At 40 years old, former Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla is set to play his final professional season with Real Oviedo, the club he supported as a child. This comes after he helped the team achieve promotion to Spain's La Liga for the first time in 24 years. Cazorla reflects on his grueling recovery from a near career-ending ankle injury, which required 11 surgeries and almost led to amputation, crediting his family's support for his return. He describes his comeback and the opportunity to end his career on his own terms with his hometown team as a fairytale finish to a remarkable journey.</p>

The victims were identified as Daniel Baillie, Nancy Kelly, David Leach, and Tony Palm, all local residents. The small, tight-knit community has been shaken by the violence, with the suspect's niece stating he has struggled for years with mental illness, including PTSD from his military service.</p>

          <p>China's leading electric vehicle manufacturer, BYD, reported its first monthly decline in deliveries this year, signaling the impact of a fierce price war in the market. The company shipped 341,030 units in July, a drop from the previous month, while competitors like Li Auto and Nio also saw declines. In contrast, Xpeng achieved a record delivery month, and brands like Xiaomi and Leapmotor showed growth. The downturn for major players highlights the intense competition and market reshaping caused by significant discounts, which have prompted warnings from Chinese policymakers to curb excessive rivalry.

          <p>Billionaire hotelier Ong Beng Seng has pleaded guilty to abetting the obstruction of justice in a major corruption case involving Singapore's former transport minister, Subramaniam Iswaran. Ong admitted to helping Iswaran cover up evidence related to expensive gifts, including a private jet trip, that he had provided while they were engaged in official business. Due to Ong's poor health from a rare bone marrow cancer, prosecutors have agreed to recommend a fine instead of a jail sentence, citing the need for "judicial mercy." The case has sent shockwaves through Singapore, a country known for its low tolerance for corruption among public officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester City's hiring of Pep Lijnders, Jürgen Klopp's former right-hand man at Liverpool, may signal a significant tactical evolution for the club. This article suggests that coach Pep Guardiola is adapting to a Premier League trend favoring more direct, high-octane transitional play over his traditional possession-based 'positional play'. The club's recent signings, such as Omar Marmoush and Rayan Ait-Nouri, are strong ball-carriers who excel in fast breaks, a departure from City's typical player profile. This strategic pivot indicates Guardiola may be rebuilding his team to embrace a more dynamic and vertical attacking style.</p>

          <p>A commentary in The Guardian posits that the UK is experiencing a "permacrisis" where the political establishment, particularly the Labour and Conservative parties, can no longer solve major issues but remains in power.

However, due to the electoral system, these new forces struggle to enact real change, leading to a volatile status quo of escalating public anger and an impotent government unable to address foundational problems.</p>

          <p>Germany is grappling with a continued decline in its birth rate, which fell to an average of 1.35 children per woman in 2024, fueling a debate about the country's future. Experts attribute the trend to multiple overlapping crises, including economic uncertainty, climate change, and high inflation, which particularly affect the younger generation's decision to have children. While some view the choice to be childless as a sign of female self-determination, others fear dwindling prosperity and a shrinking population. Analysts suggest that improving the work-life balance and providing more reliable, state-supported childcare could help bridge the gap between the desired number of children and the actual birth rate.</p>

          <p>A tragic shipwreck off the coast of Yemen has resulted in the deaths of more than 60 migrants, with dozens more still missing. The boat, which was carrying approximately 150 people, sank in bad weather in the southern province of Abyan. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that 68 bodies have been recovered and most of the victims are believed to be Ethiopian nationals. This incident highlights the extreme dangers of the migration route from the Horn of Africa to Gulf states, which remains a major pathway for people seeking work despite the risks.</p>

          <p>With diplomatic efforts stalled, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly advocating for a "military solution" to rescue the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. An Israeli official indicated a growing belief that Hamas is not interested in a deal, prompting Netanyahu to push for expanded military operations. This development comes as thousands protested in Tel Aviv, demanding the government secure the hostages' release, spurred by a recent Hamas video showing a captive looking severely emaciated. It is believed that approximately 20 living hostages remain in captivity since the October 7th attack.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotech companies Innovent and BeOne are on track to achieve their first full-year profits in 2025, marking a significant milestone for the country's biotech industry. This success is partly driven by strong sales from new products, including Innovent's weight-loss drug mazdutide, which is expected to generate substantial revenue. The profitability of these firms, which went public under a Hong Kong rule allowing pre-revenue companies to list, signals a maturation of the sector. It suggests they may no longer need to rely on investor funding for their operations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, a group of Chinese defense researchers has proposed a technological upgrade to enhance the survivability of combat drones. The concept involves fitting small or medium-sized drones with side-mounted rocket boosters for "terminal evasion." This system would allow a drone to perform an instantaneous, high-G maneuver in the final moments before an anti-aircraft missile impact. According to simulations published in a Chinese defense journal, this innovation could dramatically increase a drone's survival rate to nearly 90%, making it extremely difficult for even sophisticated missiles to intercept.</p>

Evidence found by the BBC includes UK-based members discussing adopting kittens from shelters for the purpose of abuse. Animal rights activists have documented the network's horrific scale, with one torturer believed to have filmed the killing of over 200 cats, highlighting a deeply troubling online subculture of extreme animal cruelty.</p>

Native to Eastern Cuba, these snails are being pushed toward extinction by the illegal shell trade, as their beauty makes them highly desirable to collectors. The project aims to better understand the snails' genetics and evolution while establishing a captive breeding program in Cuba to bolster their population. This conservation effort seeks to protect the six known species from threats including poaching, climate change, and habitat loss.</p>
