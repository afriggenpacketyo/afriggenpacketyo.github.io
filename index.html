          <p>The U.S. consumer price index rose to an annual rate of 2.7% in June, an increase from 2.4% in May, aligning with economists' expectations. This rise was driven by higher grocery prices, which were partially offset by a decrease in gasoline costs. Economists anticipate that the full impact of the Trump administration's tariff policies has not yet been felt, with many predicting that higher import duties will lead to further price increases for consumers in the latter half of the year. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, was reported at 2.9%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly restricted the ability of immigrants in detention to be released on bond while awaiting deportation proceedings. By reinterpreting a 1990s law, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) now argues that most noncitizens who entered the U.S. illegally are ineligible for bond hearings before an immigration judge. This policy expands mandatory detention beyond recent border-crossers and those with certain criminal convictions. Critics argue this change will lead to the prolonged detention of hundreds of thousands of people without judicial review of their flight risk.</p>

          <p>Two men have been sentenced to four years and three months in prison for criminally damaging the historic Sycamore Gap tree in Northumberland, England. Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers were convicted of using a chainsaw to fell the iconic, centuries-old tree, which stood next to Hadrian's Wall. The judge rejected their claim of "drunken stupidity," stating the act required significant planning and was an act of "sheer bravado." The National Trust, which owned the landmark, described it as an irreplaceable symbol of the region's natural beauty.</p>

          <p>Widespread air quality alerts have been issued across much of Canada and the northern United States due to smoke from ongoing wildfires. Major cities like Toronto and Chicago are experiencing significantly degraded air quality, with officials advising residents, especially vulnerable populations, to limit time outdoors. The smoke originates from fires burning in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and northern Ontario, which have forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes. Scientists continue to link the increasing intensity and frequency of wildfire seasons to the effects of climate change.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proceeding with its plan to dismantle the Department of Education after a Supreme Court ruling allowed it to lay off over 1,000 employees, about half of the department's workforce. Conservatives have long sought to eliminate the agency, which oversees federal student loan programs, grants for low-income students, and civil rights enforcement in schools. While a complete shutdown requires congressional approval, the administration aims to shrink its reach and transfer authority to state and local governments, a move that has faced significant legal and political challenges.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked U.S. immigration agents in seven Southern California counties from using racial profiling to conduct arrests, a significant challenge to the Trump administration's immigration sweeps. The ruling came after a lawsuit alleged that agents were unlawfully targeting individuals based on race, location, and language. The administration has already appealed the order, arguing it is an untenable judicial takeover of federal enforcement. Legal experts note that while the law seems clear, the ideological nature of the issue makes the outcome of the appeal difficult to predict.</p>

The canceled studies were investigating how these "forever chemicals," often spread through contaminated sewage sludge used as fertilizer, accumulate in crops and livestock. The decision halts crucial research aimed at understanding a widespread food contamination source, which has already forced some farms in Maine to close. The EPA stated it will continue to work to protect human health and the environment.</p>
