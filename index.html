        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wharton professor Ethan Mollick, a leading AI expert, states that the future impact of generative AI on jobs and the economy is largely unknown, even among top research labs. He highlights that no worker currently possesses five years of experience with gen AI, emphasizing a significant knowledge gap in the workforce. Mollick advocates for a cultural shift in leadership and education, moving from rewarding definitive answers to valuing brilliant questions, information editing, and rapid decision-making. He stresses the importance of continuous learning, adaptability, and soft skills like empathy and curiosity in an AI-driven world. Mollick advises leaders to personally engage with AI tools for at least 10 hours weekly to discover practical applications.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has strengthened into a Category 2 storm off Mexico's west coast, with forecasters anticipating it could reach Category 3 major hurricane status soon. Its outer bands are already affecting Baja California Sur, bringing heavy rains and gusty winds, with a tropical storm watch in effect for coastal areas. The storm's projected path shows it moving parallel to the coast, remaining offshore, but dangerous swells are impacting coastal regions, posing life-threatening surf and rip current risks. Moisture from Priscilla is also expected to bring heavy rainfall and flash flood risks to parts of the U.S. Desert Southwest later this week.</p>

          <p>Police have arrested a 17-year-old boy and a 22-year-old man in connection with a cyber-attack on the Kido nursery chain in London. The hackers, calling themselves Radiant, allegedly stole photographs, names, and addresses of approximately 8,000 children, along with parents' contact details, in a ransomware attempt. The BBC previously reported that the hackers initially posted some children's images on their darknet site to extort Kido for £600,000 in Bitcoin, an act cyber experts called a "new low." Although the hackers later removed the data and claimed deletion, the arrests mark a significant step in the ongoing investigation into this concerning data breach.</p>

          <p>The relics of St. Francis of Assisi, one of history's most revered saints, will be publicly displayed in Italy from February 22 to March 22, 2026, marking an extraordinary event nearly 800 years after his death. His body will be moved from its crypt to the papal altar in the Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi. Vatican News reported this rare veneration, which is expected to draw a large influx of pilgrims and tourists requiring online reservations. The Franciscan community views this exposition as a profound invitation to prayer and reflection on the saint's enduring legacy of peace, fraternity, service, and care for creation.</p>

          <p>Two years into the conflict, the article explores the profound personal and societal costs of Israel's war with Hamas on its citizens. Families of hostages continue to pressure Prime Minister Netanyahu for a deal, feeling abandoned by the government. The war has eroded national unity, with a significant portion of Israelis desiring its end, leading to a mental health crisis marked by increased anxiety and trauma, even among soldiers. A concerning loss of empathy for Palestinian suffering has also emerged among some Israelis, while global fury and accusations of war crimes contribute to feelings of isolation and insecurity for Israelis traveling abroad.</p>

          <p>David Lira, son-in-law of disgraced attorney Tom Girardi, received a four-month prison sentence for covering up Girardi's theft of settlement funds from victims of a 2018 plane crash. Lira, a former attorney at Girardi's firm, pleaded guilty to contempt of court for defying a judge's order to distribute funds to Indonesian widows and orphans. Prosecutors had sought a longer sentence, arguing Lira's lies perpetuated Girardi's fraud. However, the judge considered Lira's efforts to get clients paid and over 240 letters attesting to his character. In addition to prison, Lira will serve home confinement and community service.</p>

          <p>New research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association indicates that inhalers for asthma and COPD generated an estimated 24.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in the U.S. over the past decade. This amount is comparable to the annual emissions of about 530,000 gas-powered cars, exacerbating climate change and potentially worsening respiratory conditions. Metered-dose inhalers, which use potent hydrofluoroalkane propellants, are the primary contributors. The study suggests a significant opportunity to mitigate this environmental impact by shifting towards lower-emission alternatives like dry powder or soft mist inhalers, benefiting both patient health and the planet.</p>

During the first eight months of the Trump administration, fewer than 9,000 illegal crossings were recorded monthly, a stark contrast to the previous administration. This significant reduction, the lowest since 1970, is attributed to President Trump's immigration executive orders, including troop deployments, ending asylum requests, and expanding ICE's powers.

          <p>Los Angeles residents are set to experience a substantial increase in trash collection fees following a City Council vote, aimed at addressing the city's nearly $1-billion budget deficit.

Single-family home and small apartment residents will see fees more than double or increase by 50%, with further annual hikes planned. While some low-income residents qualify for reductions, many Angelenos are already struggling with rising living costs and view the fee increase as an additional burden. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla has launched stripped-down Standard versions of its Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan, now available for order on its U.S. website. The Model Y Standard starts at $39,990 with an estimated 321-mile range, while the Model 3 Standard is priced at $36,990 with the same range. These new models, which omit certain premium features like front/rear light bars and ambient lighting, were released following the expiration of the federal EV tax credit. While Tesla's stock dipped after the announcement, these cheaper vehicles are expected to help boost sales volume for the automaker, which has seen recent dips despite a Q3 sales jump.

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is facing unprecedented pressure, including two no-confidence votes within three months, from both far-right and left-wing groups in the European Parliament. Critics accuse her of lacking transparency, failed migration and climate policies, and a centralized leadership style that bypasses cooperation. While her ousting is unlikely, the votes highlight the increasing political fragmentation and fragile trust within the parliament, particularly among traditional centrist alliances. The article suggests von der Leyen must focus on engaging the center to maintain her coalition, as the outcome will significantly impact future budget, trade, and climate legislation.</p>

          <p>Democrats are initiating legal challenges against the Trump administration for using partisan language like "the Radical Left Democrat Shutdown" on federal websites and in government emails. This practice, seen on sites like the Forest Service, is argued to violate the 1939 Hatch Act, which prohibits executive branch employees from engaging in partisan political activity while at work. A former Idaho state legislator filed a complaint, asserting the language constitutes a prohibited political message on public infrastructure. The American Federation of Government Employees union also sued the Department of Education over similar automated emails, highlighting concerns about chilling civil servants' work and politicizing federal agencies.</p>

While the ODNI states this reinforces existing regulations, critics argue it could create a "chilling effect" on whistleblowers and press freedoms, potentially disrupting agency operations.

          <p>Drugmakers are increasingly shifting to direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales models, often leveraging telehealth platforms, a trend encouraged by the Trump administration's efforts to lower U.S. drug prices. Amgen recently joined this movement, offering its cholesterol-lowering drug Repatha at a 60% cash discount. This follows similar initiatives from Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Novartis, many of whom are offering significant discounts by bypassing traditional middlemen. The administration aims to tie U.S. drug prices to lower international rates and launched TrumpRx.gov for discounted direct purchases.
