          <h2>Debate Surrounds Proposed Elimination of Federal Income Tax on Tips</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 16:29:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposal to eliminate federal income taxes on tips, championed by President Trump, is gaining bipartisan support, though concerns remain about its potential impact. While tipped workers could see an average tax cut of $1,260, some economists and restaurant groups argue that the policy could create wage disparities between tipped and non-tipped workers. The article also explores the complexities of who would truly benefit, noting that lower-income workers already owing no federal income taxes might not see additional relief. The debate highlights the challenges of crafting tax policies that benefit specific industries without creating unintended consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is pressuring major companies like Walmart to absorb the costs of his tariffs rather than passing them on to consumers.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose after Moody's downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing the increasing burden of financing the government's budget deficit and the high cost of rolling over existing debt. The 30-year Treasury yield briefly topped 5% before retreating slightly. Investors initially reacted negatively to the downgrade but later shook it off with bond buying. The downgrade puts Moody's in line with other major credit rating agencies that had already given the U.S. their second-highest available rating. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study projects that climate change-related extreme weather could lead to a significant increase in foreclosures across the U.S. over the next decade. The study estimates that climate-driven events could account for up to 30% of all foreclosures by 2035, leading to billions in losses for lenders. Low- to moderate-income households are particularly vulnerable, and rising insurance premiums are already shaping foreclosure trends. The study suggests integrating climate risk into loan assessments to help lenders and homeowners better prepare for weather-related disasters, but acknowledges that it could tighten lending conditions.</p>

Solutions include controlled burning, restoring ecosystems, and educating the public about the changing nature of fires.

          <p>An inquest has opened into the death of West Midlands Fire Service (WMFS) chief fire officer Wayne Brown, who took his own life after months of alleged harassment and questions over his qualifications. Brown was found dead after an internal investigation was launched into claims he had lied about having an MBA. His partner stated that attention from the national press was the "final straw". The inquest also revealed concerns about the lack of support and policies in place for senior employees within the fire service.</p>

          <p>Federal officials are investigating an incident at New York's LaGuardia Airport where a Republic Airways jet had to abort takeoff to avoid colliding with a United Airlines plane still taxiing across the runway. The incident occurred despite the airport being equipped with an advanced surface radar system designed to prevent such close calls. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the incident. This near miss highlights ongoing concerns about runway incursions and the need for improved safety measures, including technology that directly warns pilots about traffic on the runway.</p>
