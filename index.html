          <p>Numerous world leaders and royals, including Prince William, Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and Emmanuel Macron, attended Pope Francis's funeral in Rome, marking a significant moment for international diplomacy. Trump and Zelensky met inside St Peter's Basilica before Pope's funeral. Trump was seated near Zelensky, separated by other dignitaries. The seating plan placed VIPs in a separate section from the public, with leaders like Javier Milei and Giorgia Meloni in prime seats. The funeral occurred during a fragile time for international diplomacy, with Trump and Zelensky engaging in discussions before the service, adding a layer of political significance to the event.</p>

          <p>Iran and the United States have commenced in-depth negotiations in Oman regarding Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, focusing on limiting Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for the easing of economic sanctions. These talks, led by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, seek to address concerns over Iran's uranium enrichment. The negotiations are taking place against a backdrop of regional tensions, including the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict and a recent explosion at a port in southern Iran.

          <p>Analysts suggest that the U.S. faces high costs and complexities in realizing the Trump administration's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, designed to counter China's expanding arsenal. The project involves building and launching numerous satellites to detect and track missiles, along with attack satellites to intercept them. SpaceX, Palantir, and Anduril have reportedly met with top officials to pitch their plan, though Elon Musk has disputed the Reuters article on social media. Boeing is also vying to contribute its products to the program, adding to the competition and potential challenges of the ambitious project.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Americans are using buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans to finance grocery purchases, with more people falling behind on payments, according to Lending Tree data. Around half of U.S. consumers have used BNPL services, and 25% of them are using it for groceries, up from 14% in 2024. Rising inflation, high interest rates, and economic uncertainty are driving consumers to seek ways to extend their budgets. Experts caution against over-reliance on BNPL loans, as late fees and multiple loans can create financial strain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's policies, including high-profile deportations and border detentions, are deterring overseas tourists from visiting the United States, leading to significant economic losses for the travel and tourism industry. The number of overseas visitors dropped by 11.6% in March compared to the previous year, with a 17.2% decline from Western Europe. Experts predict a $10 billion loss in international travel spending this year due to antipathy towards the US and concerns about safety. The decline affects various industries, from hotels and tour guides to retail and transportation, impacting both Democratic and Republican states.</p>

          <p>Mexican drug cartels are increasingly using social media platforms like TikTok to broadcast their activities, shape their public image, and expand their reach. They post content ranging from high-speed chases with customs agents to displays of wealth and power, attracting attention and recruiting new members. Cartels also use social media for tactical purposes, such as coordinating operations and spreading misinformation during conflicts. Social media companies struggle to effectively moderate cartel content due to the rapid rebranding and proliferation of smaller groups.

The author argues that the freedom of the press, enshrined in the Bill of Rights, is essential for ensuring government accountability and preventing the suppression of truth. The piece highlights historical examples, such as the Watergate scandal, to illustrate the consequences of public unwillingness to believe the truth.

          <p>Aimee Semple McPherson, a religious innovator, arrived in Los Angeles in 1918 and established herself as a prominent figure by founding the Angelus Temple in 1923 and starting a Christian radio station in 1924. McPherson's theatrical sermons and integration of popular culture made her a pioneer of Christian entertainment. Her success was marred by scandal when she disappeared in 1926 and later returned with a story of being kidnapped, leading to a highly publicized trial. Despite the controversy, McPherson continued to preach and grow her audience, leaving a lasting impact on Los Angeles's religious landscape.</p>

          <p>Dunsmuir, California, faces a challenge in providing public access to Mossbrae Falls, a breathtaking natural wonder located near the city limits. Despite its beauty and potential as a tourist attraction, there is no easy or legal way for the public to reach the falls. Trespassing along train tracks is common, leading to safety concerns and near-miss incidents with trains. City officials are working to negotiate with private landowners to build a short hiking trail, but the effort has been hampered by property rights issues and bureaucratic hurdles. The city aims to create a safe and designated pathway to the falls, boosting tourism and reclaiming its connection to the natural wonder.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office is embroiled in a contentious leak investigation that has led to the firing of three senior aides, exposing vicious interpersonal conflicts. The investigation centers on the disclosure of classified information to a reporter, allegedly by senior adviser Dan Caldwell, who denies the accusations. The internal rivalries have created a divided atmosphere within Hegseth's team, with factions supporting and opposing chief of staff Joe Kasper. The situation has raised concerns about Hegseth's ability to manage the Pentagon and his handling of sensitive information.</p>

          <p>This article argues for a left-wing perspective on space exploration, emphasizing its benefits for Earth science, crisis response, and environmental monitoring. Space-based technologies are crucial for understanding and combating climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution. The author criticizes the "anti-space" ideology emerging on some parts of the left, which views space-faring as a distraction from terrestrial injustices. They contend that space exploration is more likely to succeed under left-wing economics and should remain primarily a public-sector-led endeavor, serving all humanity rather than private profit.</p>

          <p>The annual White House Correspondents' Dinner is expected to have a somber tone due to the absence of President Trump and a comedian, reflecting the challenges faced by legacy media in responding to Trump's tactics. The WHCA withdrew an invitation to comedian Amber Ruffin to avoid political division, drawing criticism for capitulation and cowardice. The media ecosystem has shifted, with Trump controlling access and prominence given to far-right influencers. Some observers predict the dinner will be a "collective bitch fest" among a neutered and embarrassed media, while others emphasize the importance of celebrating quality journalism and the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>Cocaine use is rapidly increasing in Germany, spreading from the wealthy to all social classes, with serious consequences for the health system. The Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has warned of a "cocaine surge," attributing it to a saturated North American market and increased drug trade concentration in Europe. Wastewater analyses and police statistics confirm the rise in cocaine consumption and seizures. Factors contributing to the increase include a shortage of heroin due to the Taliban's ban on opium cultivation in Afghanistan, the legalization of cannabis in Germany, and the ease of ordering cocaine through messenger services.</p>

          <p>This article criticizes members of the Trump administration for engaging in a "Cosplay Cabinet," where they appear to be acting out a made-for-television version of their jobs rather than actually performing them. Officials like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are highlighted for their public displays and social-media posts that emphasize a certain type of MAGA masculinity. The author argues that this focus on image distracts from the actual work of governance and raises concerns about the competence of these officials. The article suggests that Trump himself is a cosplayer, fueled by his persona on The Apprentice.</p>

Nandy cited problems with the annual charge, with "fewer and fewer people" paying the fee, and concerns about enforcement practices. The BBC currently receives most of its income from the license fee, but the government is open to exploring alternative funding systems. Nandy has ruled out using general taxation to fund the BBC but has kept open the possibility of a subscription model.</p>

Trump had claimed to have spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the issue, promising to disclose details at an appropriate time.

          <p>A Durham University study has revealed that chimpanzees exhibit more empathy than commonly assumed, comforting each other when in distress through actions like embracing and holding hands. Researchers found that chimpanzees were as likely to console one another as bonobos, despite bonobos typically being considered the more "empathic" primate. The study, involving 1,400 hours of observation across both species, concluded that younger apes were more likely to offer consolation than older ones. The findings suggest that emotional sensitivity to others emerges early in ape development.</p>

Eubank, who is naturally larger than Benn, had to pay a fine after missing the weight by a small margin on Friday, but was successful on Saturday. This fight occurs over 30 years after their fathers' rivalry, and was originally scheduled for 2022 but cancelled due to Benn failing a drugs test.</p>
