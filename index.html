          <p>Hasbro reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, largely due to the strong performance of its digital gaming division, including popular titles like Magic: The Gathering and Monopoly Go! This growth helped to offset a 16% decline in its traditional consumer products segment, which has been struggling with the impact of tariffs and shifts in retailer orders. Despite reporting a significant net loss due to a goodwill impairment, the company raised its full-year guidance, signaling confidence in its strategy to navigate current market headwinds.

          <p>Tesla is set to release its second-quarter financial results, with Wall Street anticipating a significant drop in both revenue and earnings per share compared to the previous year. The company has faced a 14% year-over-year decline in vehicle deliveries, partly attributed to a consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities and increased competition from other automakers. Investors will be closely watching for updates on the company's robotaxi ambitions, plans for a more affordable vehicle, and how it will navigate ongoing tariff challenges and the end of certain EV tax credits.

          <p>Bryan Kohberger received four consecutive life sentences without parole for the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, avoiding the death penalty through a plea deal. During the emotional three-hour hearing, more than a dozen family members delivered powerful impact statements, confronting Kohberger, who declined to speak and showed no remorse. The judge called him a "faceless coward" and criticized his failure to provide any motive for the slayings, which remain unexplained. This sentencing brings a legal conclusion to a case that has captivated and horrified the nation since the brutal stabbings occurred.</p>

          <p>Shares of Texas Instruments fell sharply after the semiconductor manufacturer provided a third-quarter earnings forecast that disappointed investors, despite beating expectations for the second quarter. CEO Haviv Ilan warned of a "shallow" recovery in the automotive sector and expressed concerns that customers may be worried about geopolitical uncertainty and the lingering effects of tariffs. The company's second-quarter strength may have been artificially inflated by customers pulling demand forward to build inventory ahead of potential trade restrictions, adding to investor caution about future performance.

His announcement clears the field for other potential GOP challengers to incumbent Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul, most notably Rep.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the political maneuvering of Republican Senator Josh Hawley regarding recent Medicaid cuts, which he publicly opposed before ultimately voting in favor of the larger legislative package containing them. After being a vocal critic, arguing the cuts were "morally wrong," Hawley supported the bill and then immediately introduced new legislation to repeal some of the very reductions he had just helped enact. This has led to accusations of political cynicism from Democrats and a lukewarm response from his own party. The piece frames Hawley's actions as an attempt to balance populist rhetoric with party loyalty, possibly with an eye on future national ambitions.</p>

          <p>A massive and dangerous high-pressure system, known as a heat dome, is currently impacting over 160 million Americans, bringing extreme temperatures and perilous humidity. This weather phenomenon works by trapping sinking, compressing air, which heats up and prevents clouds from forming, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of misery. The situation is exacerbated by high humidity, which makes it harder for the human body to cool itself and raises the "feels like" temperature significantly. Climate change is making these heat waves longer, more intense, and more likely, with warming nighttime temperatures offering little relief and increasing health risks.</p>

          <p>The appointment of Alina Habba, one of Donald Trump's personal lawyers, as the interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey has led to a legal and political standoff. After Habba's legally mandated 120-day term expired, the federal district court in New Jersey appointed a career prosecutor to replace her, citing a lack of confidence in Habba, who has no prosecutorial experience and initiated several dubious cases against Democrats. The Trump administration responded by claiming to have removed the court's appointee, creating an unclear situation over who is lawfully in charge of the office. The conflict highlights the tensions between the administration and the judiciary over politically-motivated appointments.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, have filed a defamation lawsuit in the U.S. against right-wing podcast host Candace Owens. The suit alleges that Owens knowingly spread false and malicious claims that the first lady was born a man and has engaged in a "campaign of global humiliation" for profit and notoriety. The complaint, filed in Delaware, states that Owens refused multiple retraction demands and continued to push the unfounded conspiracy theories. The Macrons are seeking unspecified damages, hoping the lawsuit will end the campaign of disinformation that has targeted their family.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released a comprehensive AI Action Plan aimed at accelerating artificial intelligence development in the United States while reducing regulatory hurdles. The plan includes promoting the construction of data centers, stripping away "ideological bias" from AI systems, and repealing policies that the administration claims hinder innovation. President Donald Trump is expected to sign executive orders to implement the plan, which critics, such as the AI Now Institute, have argued is a giveaway to big tech companies that prioritizes corporate interests over public welfare.

          <p>In a historic advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that countries can be sued for their contributions to climate change, including historic emissions. The landmark decision, which is non-binding but legally influential, clears a path for climate-vulnerable nations to seek compensation from historically high-emitting countries for climate-related damages. The ruling stated that all nations, even those not signed on to the Paris Agreement, have an obligation under international law to protect the climate system. This is seen as a major victory for developing nations and activists who have been frustrated by the slow pace of global climate action.</p>

This aggressive enforcement, fueled by a sweeping mandate and new funding, is part of Trump's campaign promise for a mass deportation effort.

          <p>Real estate experts are skeptical that eliminating the capital gains tax on home sales, an idea floated by President Donald Trump, would solve the nation's housing affordability crisis. Proponents, like the National Association of Realtors, argue that the current tax disincentivizes some homeowners, particularly retirees, from selling, and that changing it could increase housing inventory. However, analysts counter that the tax primarily affects higher-end homeowners and those who have owned for decades, not the broader market. They suggest that what is truly needed to unlock the housing market is a return of consumer confidence, not a niche tax cut. (not investment advice)</p>

The study showed this genetic tweak could be rapidly spread through a lab-based mosquito population using a gene drive.
