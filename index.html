          <p>Typhoon Bualoi made landfall in Vietnam, causing floods, airport closures, and the evacuation of thousands. The storm, hitting north of Vietnam's largest province, weakened to 88 km/h after initially reaching over 130 km/h. One person died in floodwaters, with a dozen fishermen missing, and another person died from electrocution, adding to 11 deaths in the Philippines.

The suspect, 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, was later shot dead by police in the church car park. Authorities are investigating the incident as an 'act of targeted violence,' with the motive remaining unclear. The FBI is leading the investigation, and Michigan's Governor Gretchen Whitmer condemned the violence, calling it unacceptable in a place of worship.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has withdrawn from the mayoral reelection race, citing constant media speculation and a Campaign Finance Board decision to withhold funds. His departure creates a three-way contest between Democrat Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams, who faced a federal corruption scandal and criticism over his relationship with the Trump administration, maintained he was 'wrongfully charged.' His opponents and New York leaders reacted, with some acknowledging his accomplishments despite the controversies.</p>

          <p>Deliveries of China's C919 narrowbody passenger jet to major domestic airlines might be behind schedule, sparking concerns about potential engine supply disruptions. Air China and China Eastern Airlines have received only one C919 each this year, falling short of their stated goals of ten aircraft. China Southern Airlines reported 'financially leased' three jets, not ownership, despite expecting twelve. This suggests Comac, the manufacturer, is encountering difficulties in securing engines for its new model, which aims to challenge Western dominance.</p>

          <p>This article discusses 'energy vampires' in friendships—individuals who drain one's energy through excessive complaining, self-focus, or lack of interest in others. Psychologist Suzy Reading and journalist Radhika Sanghani identify signs like an excessive need for attention and subtle mood-chipping. They suggest strategies for handling such friendships, including honest conversations about feeling unheard, setting clear boundaries on time or topics, and changing shared activities to reduce dominance. The goal is to protect one's well-being while potentially maintaining the relationship.</p>

          <p>Over 100,000 federal workers are expected to resign on Tuesday, marking the largest mass resignation in U.S. history, as part of a Trump administration program to significantly cut the federal workforce.

          <p>President Trump is seeking an expedited Supreme Court review of his executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship, challenging over a century of legal precedent. Despite two federal courts blocking the order, Trump argues the government has a compelling interest in restricting citizenship to those 'lawfully entitled.' The 14th Amendment's citizenship clause has long been interpreted to include anyone born in the U.S., regardless of parents' immigration status. Legal experts widely view the order as unconstitutional, anticipating an 'earthquake' if the Supreme Court rules in Trump's favor.</p>

          <p>Europe secured a 15-13 Ryder Cup victory over the United States at Bethpage, New York, following a sensational Sunday singles tussle. Despite holding a record seven-point lead, Europe faced a fierce American comeback before Tyrrell Hatton secured the winning half-point. Shane Lowry's crucial birdie putt ensured Europe would at least retain the trophy. Captain Luke Donald, who also won as a player, made history by leading Europe to consecutive home and away victories, cementing his legendary status.</p>

          <p>Two eyewitnesses to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk—Hunter Kozak, a liberal who debated Kirk, and Jeb Jacobi, a conservative admirer—are calling for a return to civilized debate in America. Kozak, the last person to speak with Kirk before he was fatally shot by a sniper, and Jacobi, who witnessed the event, both emphasize the need for mutual respect and conversation despite differing viewpoints. Utah Governor Spencer Cox echoed this sentiment, promoting unity and constructive disagreement on campus.</p>

          <p>The historic Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, known for its windmills, plans to charge tourists a €17.50 entry fee starting next spring to manage overcrowding. With 2.6 million visitors annually—a massive number for its 100 residents—the influx has led to privacy issues, with tourists entering gardens and houses. The fee, which includes museum and windmill access, aims to reduce numbers and fund maintenance and infrastructure. Local businesses, however, fear a significant loss of shoppers due to the increased cost for visitors.</p>

          <p>Weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro are creating a two-tier system for obesity treatment, disproportionately benefiting the wealthy due to high private costs and restrictive NHS access. While these drugs offer significant weight loss, thousands of NHS patients miss out due to a 'postcode lottery' of eligibility criteria. Pharmaceutical price increases further exacerbate the issue, with concerns that health inequality will worsen. Experts debate whether medicalizing obesity overlooks broader social factors like the 'broken food system' and its impact on poorer areas. (not investment advice)</p>
