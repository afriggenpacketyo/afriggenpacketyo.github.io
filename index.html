          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 00:38:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has overtaken China as the primary exporter of smartphones to the United States, with its share of U.S. imports jumping from 13% to 44% in the second quarter. This significant shift is largely driven by Apple accelerating its manufacturing move to India amid ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions and tariffs. While total iPhone shipments have declined, major manufacturers like Apple, Samsung, and Motorola are increasingly using Indian facilities for final assembly to serve the U.S. market. This change highlights a broader realignment of global technology supply chains away from China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Singapore Airlines' Profits Plunge, Causing Significant Stock Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 00:35:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore Airlines experienced a more than 8% drop in its stock value after reporting a 59% decline in first-quarter net profit. The company attributed the sharp fall in earnings to reduced interest income and losses from associated companies, particularly its 25.1% stake in Air India. Analysts note that Air India's deeper-than-expected losses, exacerbated by reputational damage following a recent incident, are a significant drag on SIA's financials. While the airline reports that overall travel demand remains strong, it faces challenges from normalizing margins and increased competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A gunman opened fire in a high-rise office building in Midtown Manhattan, killing four people, including an on-duty police officer, before taking his own life. The suspect, identified as a 27-year-old from Las Vegas, used an MR rifle in the attack at 345 Park Avenue, which houses the NFL and Blackstone. Officer Didarul Islam, an immigrant from Bangladesh and father of two with a third child on the way, was fatally shot in the lobby while working security. The incident prompted a massive police response and shut down parts of the city as a motive remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>In a landmark ruling, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been found guilty of witness tampering and bribery, facing a potential 12-year prison sentence. The court determined that Uribe conspired to influence testimony from jailed former paramilitary members who had accused him of having links to their groups. The verdict is a major moment for Colombia, where Uribe is a deeply polarizing figure, celebrated by some for his hardline security policies and condemned by others for alleged human rights abuses. The decision has drawn mixed reactions, with U.S. and Colombian politicians offering sharply contrasting views on the outcome.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump clarified that he is not actively pursuing a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping but confirmed he might visit China if an official invitation, which he says has been extended, is followed through. This statement comes amid discussions between aides from both nations about a potential face-to-face meeting later this year, possibly around the APEC summit in South Korea. Such a meeting would be the first between the two leaders during Trump's second term, occurring at a time of high trade and security tensions. The outcome of ongoing trade talks could influence whether a leaders' summit materializes.</p>

Tamura, who held a concealed carry permit and a private investigator license, is believed to have acted alone, and his motive for targeting the specific building remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address its demographic crisis, the Chinese government has introduced its first nationwide subsidy to encourage more births. The policy will provide parents with 3,600 yuan (about $500) annually for each child under the age of three, a program expected to assist around 20 million families. This move follows various local initiatives and comes as China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, despite the abolition of the one-child policy nearly a decade ago. High child-rearing costs are a major factor in the declining birth rate, and Beijing is also urging free preschool education.</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed to challenge a new Trump administration policy that mandates detention without bail for immigrants in the U.S. illegally while they await deportation hearings. This policy reverses a long-standing practice of allowing release on bond for those not considered a flight or safety risk. Advocacy groups argue the change is a misinterpretation of the law and violates due process rights, causing catastrophic harm to families.

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a formal misconduct complaint against U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, escalating a conflict over the administration's deportation policies. The complaint alleges the judge made improper public comments critical of the Trump administration, thereby undermining judicial impartiality. This action follows Judge Boasberg's finding of probable cause that the administration committed contempt of court by ignoring his order to halt deportation flights to a controversial prison in El Salvador. The move represents a significant clash between the executive and judicial branches over immigration enforcement and judicial authority.</p>

          <p>School districts across the U.S. are facing a potential crisis in student mental health services due to the abrupt discontinuation of millions of dollars in federal grants by the Trump administration. Citing concerns over diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the Department of Education suspended the funding, leaving many districts that had hired counselors and social workers in a precarious position. A CBS News analysis shows a severe shortage of child mental health professionals in 47 states, a problem especially acute in rural areas. Sixteen states are now suing the administration over the cuts.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old U.S. citizen has spoken out after video of his violent arrest by immigration agents in Florida drew widespread condemnation. Kenny Laynez, who was born and raised in the U.S., recorded an officer telling him, "You got no rights here. You're an amigo, brother," during the traffic stop. The incident, which occurred as Florida is set to expand the role of local law enforcement in immigration crackdowns, has heightened concerns among advocates about racial profiling and the violation of civil rights. U.S. Customs and Border Protection stated the individuals resisted arrest but did not acknowledge that a U.S. citizen was detained.</p>

          <p>Economic experts are analyzing the new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union, with some concluding it is an "asymmetric and unbalanced deal" that will harm the EU's economy. The pact imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while U.S. goods will face no new tariffs, a move expected to reduce the EU's annual GDP. Despite this, the deal provides some certainty by avoiding the 30% tariff President Trump had threatened, and it includes EU commitments to purchase U.S. energy and make significant investments. European industries like automotive and wine are still bracing for a negative financial impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland provided invaluable, direct access to the American leader, but also highlighted significant political risks. The free-wheeling, unpredictable nature of the discussions forced Starmer to carefully interject on key issues like Gaza and immigration. For Downing Street, the face time is crucial for burnishing a key relationship and aligning on global issues, such as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. However, the optics of engaging with Trump's unconventional diplomatic style presents a delicate balancing act for the Prime Minister on the world stage.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests the stock market failed to rally after major U.S. trade deals were announced because investor focus is dominated by other factors this week. He argues that Wall Street is currently preoccupied with upcoming Big Tech earnings reports, the Federal Reserve's meeting on interest rates, and Friday's employment data. According to Cramer, many investors have developed "tariff ennui," as trade negotiations tend to follow a predictable pattern of high threats followed by a deal. Until the market weathers this week's storm of earnings and Fed news, trade policy is unlikely to be a significant driver of stock movement. (not investment advice)</p>

Workers at Precious Garments have already seen their hours and pay cut in half, and thousands of jobs in the country's textile industry are at risk.
