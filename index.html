        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed a new community policing initiative that would establish police counters in public venues like supermarkets, shopping centers, and libraries across England and Wales. The party argues this would enhance public confidence and make it easier for citizens to report crimes and share information with law enforcement. To fund this increased presence, the Liberal Democrats suggest abolishing the roles of Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs), an estimated cost-saving measure. The proposal comes as the party seeks to appeal to more voters by addressing concerns over the decline in traditional police station accessibility.</p>

          <p>A shooting at the Mango nightclub in Birmingham has left one man in critical condition and three other individuals wounded. West Midlands Police responded to the incident early in the morning, discovering three men and one woman with gunshot injuries. Shortly after the event, authorities arrested three suspects in their 20s and 30s on suspicion of violent disorder after locating their vehicle on the M6 motorway. A major road into the city center, Bristol Street, has been closed for the ongoing investigation, and police are appealing to the public for any information or dashcam footage.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order adding a substantial $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for the H-1B visa program, which is designed for skilled foreign workers. The order, which cites program "abuse," aims to compel companies to prioritize hiring American workers over foreign talent. This move has drawn sharp criticism from immigration lawyers and business groups, who argue it will devastate small businesses and startups that rely on the program to fill critical roles and could push companies to move operations overseas. The policy marks a significant shift from previous administrative fees, which totaled around $1,500. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia is reviving 'Intervision,' a Soviet-era song contest, positioned as a conservative and traditional values-oriented alternative to the Eurovision Song Contest. This move comes after Russian artists were banned from Eurovision following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Moscow frames the event as a platform to foster "national identity" and avoid the "perversions" it associates with Eurovision's pro-LGBTQ+ stance. The competition includes participants from former Soviet republics and BRICS nations like Brazil, China, and India, reflecting a broader geopolitical alignment and an effort to create cultural platforms outside of Western influence.</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, who are in their 70s and 80s and have lived in the country for decades running a charity, were reunited with their daughter in Qatar following negotiations brokered by the Qatari government. Their son expressed immense gratitude for their release, noting his parents' deep affection for Afghanistan and their desire to continue their charitable work there.

          <p>Estonia has formally requested consultations with its NATO allies under Article 4 after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace over the Gulf of Finland. The Russian aircraft, which had their transponders off and no flight plan, were intercepted by Finnish and Italian jets operating as part of NATO's Baltic Air Policing mission. This incident is the latest in a series of provocations that have heightened tensions along NATO's eastern flank, with Russia denying any violation occurred. The move by Estonia signals a serious concern about Russian aggression and the need for a unified alliance response.</p>

While some try remedies like lotions and supplements, plastic surgeons state that surgery is the only effective solution for significant loose skin.

          <p>Comedic actress and personality Lilly Singh describes her perfect Sunday in Los Angeles as a day dedicated to self-love and resetting for the week ahead. Her routine is intentionally structured, beginning with journaling and stretching, followed by a visit to the Studio City Farmers Market for specific items like kefir yogurt and fresh flowers. A key part of her day is a solo brunch at Sweet Butter Kitchen, which she treats as a personal date. The rest of her Sunday involves planning her social calendar, enjoying the outdoors, and often catching a movie alone at the theater.</p>

          <p>A historic global agreement to protect marine biodiversity in international waters, the High Seas Treaty, is set to become law after reaching the required 60-nation ratification threshold. The treaty, two decades in the making, will allow for the creation of marine protected areas in the high seas, which cover over two-thirds of the world's oceans and are currently largely unregulated. Environmental groups have hailed this as a monumental achievement for ocean conservation and a critical step toward the goal of protecting 30% of the world's oceans by 2030. The treaty will officially take effect in January.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has resigned from his post following public pressure from President Trump. The resignation came after concerns were raised that Siebert might be fired for not pursuing a criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James for alleged mortgage fraud. When asked about the situation, President Trump confirmed, "Yeah, I want him out," citing Siebert's support from two Democratic senators as his reason. The event has fueled concerns about political interference within the Department of Justice and its prosecutorial independence.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz has strongly criticized Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Brendan Carr for his role in the suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. Cruz compared Carr's threat to review ABC's broadcast license over Kimmel's monologue about slain activist Charlie Kirk to the tactics of a mobster, calling it "dangerous as hell." While stating he was glad Kimmel faced consequences, Cruz warned that using government power to regulate media speech sets a dangerous precedent that could be used against conservatives in the future. President Trump defended the FCC chairman and disagreed with Cruz's assessment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A prominent Japanese defense researcher has warned that weakening ties between the United States and India, coupled with waning U.S. interest in regional alliances, are creating a strategic vacuum that China could exploit. The researcher highlighted the importance of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), which includes the U.S., India, Japan, and Australia, as a key diplomatic tool to balance against China. President Trump's decision not to attend a recent Quad summit in New Delhi is seen from a Japanese perspective as a potentially dangerous development that could undermine the stability of American-led alliances in Asia.</p>

          <p>A U.S. court has sentenced Qingzhou Wang, an executive of the Wuhan-based company Amarvel Biotech, to 25 years in prison for trafficking precursor chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl. Wang and a colleague were convicted of importing hundreds of kilos of these chemicals into the United States, often disguising them as everyday goods and using cryptocurrency for transactions. This case marked the first time the U.S. has prosecuted Chinese companies for trafficking these chemicals directly into the country, rather than to cartels in Mexico, highlighting a direct approach to combating the fentanyl supply chain.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals Widespread Counterfeit Products on Walmart's Online Marketplace</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 21:25:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive investigation has uncovered significant issues with Walmart's third-party online marketplace, where shoppers are frequently receiving counterfeit and potentially hazardous products. The report found that Walmart relaxed its seller vetting process to compete with Amazon, leading to fraudulent sellers using stolen identities of legitimate businesses to list fake goods, particularly in health and beauty categories. Despite customer complaints and businesses reporting their identities stolen, the fraudulent accounts often remained active for extended periods. This growth-focused strategy has exposed consumers to risks and raised questions about the platform's liability for the harmful products sold on its site.</p>
