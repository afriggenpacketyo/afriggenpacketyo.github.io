        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Supreme Court has quashed the convictions of former City traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo for manipulating Libor and Euribor interest rates. This decision, following a 10-year legal battle, found their trials unfair due to incorrect jury directions. The Serious Fraud Office will not seek a retrial, and the bankers may pursue compensation. This outcome highlights broader questions about accountability in the 2008 financial crisis, as central bankers and officials who pressured similar conduct were never prosecuted.</p>

          <p>Uber is launching a new pilot program next month in select U.S. cities, allowing women drivers and riders to request matches with other women. This feature aims to enhance safety and comfort on the platform, building on previous tests in other countries. While the preference isn't guaranteed, it increases the likelihood of gender-matched pairings. The initiative comes as ride-hailing companies continue to address safety concerns, including incidents of sexual assault and harassment, on their platforms.</p>

          <p>Four U.S. cruise ship passengers were arrested in Bermuda, accused of possessing and intending to distribute a significant quantity of illegal drugs, including cannabis and the highly potent synthetic opioid carfentanil. Authorities stated that even tiny amounts of carfentanil can be deadly, emphasizing that the seizure may have prevented a potential tragedy. The suspects were detained by Carnival security officers before being arrested by Bermuda police upon arrival, with Carnival reiterating its zero-tolerance drug policy.</p>

          <p>Over 100 aid organizations have issued a joint statement warning of "mass starvation" in Gaza, attributing the crisis to Israel's siege and restrictions on aid. The World Health Organization confirmed dire water shortages and rising child malnutrition deaths, with over 70 children dying from malnutrition this year. Israel denies a famine, blaming Hamas for disrupting aid distribution, and states that thousands of aid trucks have entered Gaza. The situation remains critical, with aid workers themselves facing risks to feed their families.</p>

          <p>The U.N. human rights office reported that over 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since May while attempting to obtain food in Gaza, primarily near aid distribution sites. Desperation is escalating in the territory, facing famine risks due to Israel's blockade and ongoing offensive. While Israel claims it only fires warning shots and blames Hamas for aid diversion, a joint statement from 28 Western countries condemned the "inhumane killing of civilians" and the aid delivery model.</p>

          <p>James Talarico, a 36-year-old progressive Texas state representative, gained significant national attention after appearing on Joe Rogan's podcast. Talarico, a former teacher and aspiring minister, discussed his views on Christian nationalism and his combative approach to conservative legislation, which resonated with a broader audience. His appearance sparked speculation about a potential U.S. Senate bid, signaling a shift in Democratic strategy to engage with diverse media platforms and embrace progressive values more assertively in traditionally red states.</p>

          <p>China's global shipbuilding market share decreased slightly in the first half of the year, securing 68.3% of new vessel orders compared to 74.7% last year, with order volume falling 18.2%. Analysts attribute this dip to caution among shipowners regarding oil and LNG tanker orders, given the U.S.'s significant role as an exporter and potential port fee threats. Despite the decline, China maintains its competitive advantages in the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a new AI-powered design platform that overcomes the "dimensionality curse" in aviation, allowing for numerous design variables without increasing computing load. This breakthrough, illustrated using the U.S. Navy's canceled X-47B stealth drone, enables dramatic improvements in aircraft design by optimizing factors like flight drag, radar signature, and engine thrust. The innovation could significantly advance military and civilian aircraft development, addressing complex trade-offs that previously hindered progress in advanced aerospace projects.</p>

          <p>BBC Economics editor Faisal Islam suggests that President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff strategy is achieving tangible results, citing a new trade deal with Japan. This agreement, setting a 15% tariff on Japanese goods, is seen as a win for the Trump administration, potentially influencing other economic blocs like the EU. While tariffs are generating significant revenue for the U.S. Treasury, concerns remain about who ultimately bears the cost (U.S. consumers) and the declining value of the U.S. dollar.
