          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 16:58:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned from her position as a government whip in protest against the government's plans to cut disability benefits. In her resignation letter to the prime minister, Foxcroft expressed her understanding of the need to address the rising welfare bill but argued that cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit should not be part of the solution. A government spokesman defended the reforms, stating that they aim to fix a broken welfare system and ensure that those who can work are supported while protecting those with the most severe disabilities. The government's bill proposes stricter criteria for personal independence payments and reduces the sickness-related element of universal credit, sparking concern among Labour MPs and potential rebellion from within the government's own ranks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Fordo nuclear facility in Iran, buried deep within a mountain, is a major concern for international monitors due to suspicions of clandestine nuclear weapons development. Despite denials from Iranian leaders, Israel claims to have intelligence indicating a secret program focused on building nuclear weapons. President Trump has been briefed on the risks and benefits of bombing Fordo and is expected to make a decision within two weeks. Experts believe that destroying the facility would require a U.S.-produced "bunker-buster" bomb, potentially necessitating U.S. military involvement, and the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency has declared Iran non-compliant with its monitoring efforts for the first time in 20 years.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new meta-analysis by French researchers suggests that cannabis use is associated with a significantly increased risk of major cardiovascular events (MACE), including heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular death. The study, which reviewed data from over 400 million patients, found that the risk was elevated even in people who used cannabis at least once a week. Compared to other illicit drugs like cocaine and opioids, cannabis was identified as a larger predictor of heart attack in one study. While medical marijuana can provide relief for certain conditions, the review concluded that these findings warrant further investigation of cannabis use in patients presenting with serious cardiovascular disorders.</p>

Researchers analyzed over 600 bag policies and 45,000 shoreline cleanups, finding that plastic bag litter decreased by 25% to 47% in areas with bag policies compared to those without. Fees on plastic bags appear to be more effective than bans, particularly partial bans, in limiting shoreline litter.

The B-2 Spirit bomber is the only aircraft in the U.S. Air Force equipped to carry and deploy the MOP due to its weight.

          <p>Oil prices rose approximately 3% following Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's order to intensify attacks on Iran. The global benchmark for oil, Brent, closed at its highest settlement since January 22, while U.S. crude oil also experienced a notable increase. The escalation comes after an Iranian missile reportedly struck a hospital in Beersheba, prompting threats from Israel. JPMorgan warned that regime change in Iran, a major OPEC producer, could significantly impact global oil prices. (not investment advice)</p>
