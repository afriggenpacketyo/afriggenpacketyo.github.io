          <p>Alibaba Cloud has developed Aegaeon, a computing pooling solution that reportedly cut Nvidia GPU usage by 82% for its AI models. Beta-tested in Alibaba Cloud’s marketplace, the system reduced the need for H20 GPUs from 1,192 to 213 for dozens of models. This innovation addresses resource inefficiency in serving concurrent large language model (LLM) workloads, where many GPUs are underutilized. Researchers from Peking University and Alibaba Cloud presented these findings, highlighting Aegaeon's potential to optimize AI infrastructure costs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has set a June 1, 2026, deadline for prosecutors to retry Pedro Hernandez, convicted in the 1979 kidnapping and murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz. If jury selection does not commence by this date, Hernandez, whose body was never found, will be released. This would be his third trial, following a hung jury in 2015 and a guilty verdict in 2017, which was later overturned due to incorrect jury instructions regarding his confession. Hernandez's defense maintains he has mental illness and falsely confessed.</p>

          <p>At least 15 individuals were detained after confrontations between Illinois state police and protesters outside the Broadview ICE detention center in Chicago. Tensions escalated when officers cleared roadways, pushing back crowds who had advanced toward the facility. Demonstrators, including a congressional candidate, reported being struck by batons, with videos of the clashes circulating online. This incident follows weeks of unrest at the facility, where federal agents have previously used chemical agents against protesters and journalists.</p>

          <p>A popular Chinese spy drama, "Silent Honour," has inspired an outpouring of public praise and visits to the tomb of a real-life agent, Wu Shi, in Beijing. Wu, an underground Communist Party member, was a Kuomintang lieutenant general in Taiwan who was executed in 1950. The show's narrative, focusing on "unsung heroes" like Wu, has led to a "sudden surge" of visitors leaving flowers and thank-you notes at his grave.

          <p>Billionaire investor Bill Ackman has intensified his involvement in the New York City mayoral race, publicly urging Republican Curtis Sliwa to drop out. Ackman argues that Sliwa's continued candidacy is significantly boosting democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani's chances of victory, citing prediction market data. Ackman, a supporter of independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, believes a two-person race would be more competitive. Sliwa's campaign, however, rejects donor influence, insisting voters, not billionaires, should decide the outcome.</p>

          <p>India's traditional Diwali gold rush is seeing a shift this year, with soaring gold prices influencing buying habits. While demand for jewelry is slightly dented, a "fear of missing out" (FOMO) is driving more customers, leading to jewelers innovating with lighter, elaborate designs. A clear trend shows more gold and silver being bought for investment rather than solely jewelry, reflected in bullion market data and record high inflows into ETFs and digital gold. The Reserve Bank of India is also significantly influencing prices by diversifying its foreign exchange holdings with gold. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has experienced a remarkable 25% drop in fatal drug overdoses in 2024, largely attributed to enhanced harm reduction strategies against fentanyl. States like North Carolina, with a 35% decrease, are leading efforts through programs like law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD), which steers users towards recovery and support. Medication-assisted treatments like methadone and widespread naloxone availability are proving critical in saving lives and reducing cravings. While challenges remain, including disparities in decrease rates among different populations, these interventions offer significant hope in combating the epidemic.</p>

          <p>The North Pacific Ocean recorded its warmest summer on record, with sea surface temperatures more than 0.25°C above the 2022 high across a vast area. Scientists are investigating this "warm blob," struggling to fully explain its prolonged heat beyond climate change. Weaker winds this summer allowed more heat to remain at the surface. One intriguing hypothesis suggests that recent changes to shipping fuels, which reduced Sun-reflecting aerosols, might be contributing to the warming by revealing the full impact of human-caused warming. This marine heatwave could also influence colder early winter weather in the UK.</p>

This strong stance follows numerous legal claims against the city for excessive force during protests and reflects growing council frustration over legal payouts and the city attorney's independent litigation actions.</p>
