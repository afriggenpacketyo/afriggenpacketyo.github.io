          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner have lost their majority in the upper house of parliament. This defeat follows a similar loss in the lower house last October, marking the first time the LDP has lacked a majority in both houses since its 1955 founding. Despite the setback, which is compounded by public discontent over inflation and scandals, Ishiba has vowed to remain in office to handle critical trade negotiations with the United States. The election also saw a significant surge for the right-wing populist Sanseito party, which gained momentum with its "Japanese First" rhetoric.</p>

          <p>A driver intentionally plowed a vehicle into a crowd of people waiting outside a nightclub in East Hollywood, Los Angeles, injuring thirty individuals, with at least seven in critical condition. The incident occurred early Saturday morning when the driver, identified as Fernando Ramirez, made a U-turn before accelerating into the crowd. Following the crash, bystanders reportedly attacked the driver, who was also found to have been shot by an unknown assailant who fled the scene. Police have booked Ramirez for assault with a deadly weapon and are investigating the shooting as a separate crime.</p>

          <p>Ecuador has extradited notorious drug lord Adolfo "Fito" Macias to the United States to face charges including cocaine distribution and conspiracy. This marks the first time an Ecuadorian citizen has been extradited to a foreign country. Macias, the leader of the powerful "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June after a high-profile prison escape in January that led to a nationwide state of "internal armed conflict." His extradition is a significant moment for Ecuador, a country that has become a key hub in the global cocaine trade.</p>

          <p>Former Nickelodeon star Drake Bell has publicly claimed that the network does not pay residuals to its actors for shows that continue to air long after their original run. In a recent podcast appearance, Bell stated that despite the continued popularity and syndication of his show "Drake & Josh," he and his co-stars do not receive ongoing payments. He described the practice as a form of exploitation, where the corporation earns billions while the talent who created the content struggles financially. This allegation adds to previous claims of abuse and a toxic work environment at the network, which were highlighted in the "Quiet on Set" documentary.</p>

          <p>A significant contrast is emerging between the United States and China regarding their energy and climate strategies, particularly as global demand for electricity rises due to technologies like AI. While China is aggressively pursuing renewable energy goals and increasing investment in the sector to gain a global tech advantage, the Trump administration in the U.S. is moving to cancel tax credits for wind and solar power. The article highlights this divergence, framing it within the broader context of US-China technological and economic rivalry. Beijing's strategy positions it to lead in the green energy race while the U.S. focuses on different priorities.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated he may obstruct the Washington Commanders' plans for a new stadium unless the NFL team reverts to its former name, the "Redskins." In a series of social media posts, Trump called for both the Commanders and the MLB's Cleveland Guardians to restore their previous names, which were changed due to widespread criticism that they were racist toward Indigenous people. He threatened to prevent a deal for the Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., on federal property if the change is not made. Congress had already given the city control over the proposed site, making it unclear how Trump could intervene.</p>

Health experts also point to a rise in post-pandemic vaccine hesitancy and misinformation as contributing factors.

          <p>The UK government has issued a warning that individuals retiring in 2050 are projected to be financially worse off than today's pensioners unless retirement savings are significantly increased. To address this, the Department for Work and Pensions is reviving the Pensions Commission to explore solutions. The move comes as new analysis reveals that nearly half of working-age adults, particularly low earners, the self-employed, women, and some ethnic minorities, are not saving into a private pension. The commission will aim to build a national consensus on a future strategy to close this growing retirement savings gap.</p>

The decline is linked to a perception that the program is targeting more than just dangerous criminals and is deporting more people than expected. The poll also reveals that a large majority of Americans, across party lines, believe the administration should focus more on lowering prices rather than on tariffs or spending cuts.

          <p>The UK's High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project, now billions over budget and years behind schedule, is being cited as a prime example of how not to manage major infrastructure. According to insiders and analysts, the project was hampered from the start by a combination of factors unique to the UK, including its dense population, property laws, and complex planning system. The initial ambition to build the world's fastest line drove up costs, while political compromises and thousands of planning permissions led to expensive changes and delays.

The new additions were developed in response to requests from girls and aim to keep the program relevant to modern interests. Badges now available include "fandoms," for sharing enthusiasm for pop culture; "booktivist," for learning about empowerment through reading; and "laughter" for the youngest members. Other new badges cover topics like codebreaking, folklore, thrift, and environmental conservation, reflecting a broadening of the organization's scope to build confidence and address contemporary issues.</p>

          <p>The UK government has officially confirmed that a national inquiry will be held into the "Battle of Orgeave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The clash, which occurred on June 18, 1984, involved thousands of police officers and striking miners outside a coking plant in Rotherham. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry will examine the events of the day and their aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners based on what she called "discredited evidence." Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for decades, expressed cautious elation at the news.</p>

          <p>Following his victory at The Open, golfer Scottie Scheffler is being hailed as the most dominant force in the sport since Tiger Woods in his prime. This analysis explores the parallels between the two, noting that Scheffler has won four major championships in the last four seasons, a feat comparable to Woods's early career. His peers and commentators point to his machine-like consistency and ruthless ability to close out tournaments as "Tiger-like." While Scheffler himself calls the comparisons "silly," his performance, bolstered by recent improvements in his putting, has solidified his undisputed status as the world's number one golfer.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is shutting down its primary scientific research division, the Office of Research and Development (ORD), as part of a broader downsizing of the federal government. The ORD is responsible for providing the scientific analysis that underpins environmental regulations on hazards like toxic chemicals, climate change, and water pollution. The move, which is part of a plan to cut the EPA's staff by 23%, has been condemned by critics as a "travesty" that will cripple the agency's ability to use science in protecting public health.

The warning comes after a previous show where the camera focused on a man and woman who appeared to be having an affair, an incident that went viral online. The two individuals were later identified as the CEO and chief people officer of a tech company, leading to the CEO's resignation. Martin's lighthearted notice to the crowd in Wisconsin was a clear nod to the widely publicized and awkward moment.</p>

          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, the single most important skill to teach a child is "self-connection." This refers to the ability to understand and trust one's own emotions, needs, and inner voice, which fosters resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. The article argues that common parenting habits, like dismissing a child's feelings, can inadvertently erode this connection over time. The author provides practical tips for parents to nurture this skill, such as validating emotions and modeling emotional awareness, to support their long-term mental health.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, discusses the precarious position of American companies operating in China amidst ongoing trade tensions. He indicates that while an extension of the current 90-day tariff pause is almost inevitable, the business community is concerned that discussions between the two nations have focused almost exclusively on tariffs. Stein suggests a potential path toward a more normal trade relationship could involve the U.S. reciprocating China's recent move to restrict fentanyl precursors by lowering some tariffs. However, he notes that American businesses continue to navigate a very challenging and uncertain environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent cancellation of plea deals for the defendants in the 9/11 case, including alleged ringleader Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, has introduced further uncertainty and delay into the long-stalled legal proceedings. Legal experts note that the decision to void the agreements, which would have avoided a death penalty trial in exchange for life sentences, will likely provoke years of new litigation. Without the plea deals, the case is expected to return to a cycle of pretrial hearings, with a full trial still appearing to be years away. This development leaves the path to any form of legal closure or justice for the victims' families more unclear than ever.</p>

The incident resulted in a "medical episode," and he was transported to a hospital where he later died. MRI facilities have strict protocols requiring the removal of all metal objects due to the immense magnetic force, which can turn such items into dangerous projectiles.</p>
