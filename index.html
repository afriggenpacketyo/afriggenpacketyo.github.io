          <p>A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that the immunotherapy drug dostarlimab can eliminate tumors in some early-stage cancer patients, potentially avoiding the need for surgery. The study showed that 82 out of 103 participants responded so well to the drug that they no longer required an operation. While the results are promising, the study was conducted at a single hospital and focused on patients with tumors having a specific genetic alteration. The research opens the door for future advancements in cancer treatment and potential alternatives to invasive surgeries.</p>

          <p>The House has passed the "Take It Down Act," a bipartisan bill making it a federal crime to post real and fake sexually explicit imagery online without consent. The bill, supported by Melania Trump, requires social media companies to remove images and videos, including AI-generated deepfakes, within 48 hours of a victim's request. While Meta, TikTok, and Snapchat support the legislation, digital rights groups warn it could suppress lawful speech and lack protections against bad-faith takedown requests. The bill now goes to the president's desk for signature.</p>
