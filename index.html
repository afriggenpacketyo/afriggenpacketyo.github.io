            <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions and US plans for new tariffs citing national security, China's chip exports continue to rise. The US is considering tariffs on Chinese tech products, specifically semiconductors, due to national security concerns, according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. China's integrated circuit exports increased by 11.6% in 2024, reaching 298.1 billion units. China has been actively boosting its domestic chip industry to counter heightened US-China tech tensions.</p>

            <p>Sarah Palin's libel lawsuit against The New York Times is set for a retrial after an appeals court overturned a previous ruling against her. The lawsuit stems from a 2017 editorial that falsely linked Palin's campaign rhetoric to a mass shooting.

            <p>Goldman Sachs suggests that ESG investors should re-evaluate their stance on oil and gas companies, similar to how defense stocks gained favor after the Russia-Ukraine war. The firm argues that the energy transition will be longer than expected, requiring new oil and gas development well into the 2040s. They also highlight that oil and gas companies are major investors in low-carbon energy and essential for ensuring affordable energy, especially for emerging markets. However, some ESG experts disagree, citing the negative impacts of fossil fuels on the climate. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>China's exports experienced a significant jump in March, exceeding expectations as businesses accelerated shipments to avoid impending US tariffs.

            <p>Daniel Noboa, the center-right president of Ecuador, has won re-election, securing a full four-year term. Noboa's victory comes after winning a snap election in November 2023, and his presidency has been marked by a military crackdown on violent criminal gangs. His left-wing challenger, Luisa González, has contested the results and claimed fraud. Noboa's win gives him a mandate to continue his efforts to combat criminal drug gangs, potentially including foreign military assistance.</p>

            <p>China's exports rose sharply in March ahead of expected tariff increases from the US, but analysts anticipate a decline in the coming months. The export surge may be a 'final hurrah' before the full impact of tariffs takes effect. Imports also declined, indicating weak domestic demand. The US is threatening new cumulative tariffs on all Chinese goods, potentially reaching an effective rate of 156 per cent.</p>

            <p>Singapore has eased its monetary policy for the second consecutive time, following a lower-than-expected GDP growth of 3.8% for the first quarter. The Monetary Authority of Singapore reduced the rate of appreciation of its policy band, the S$NEER. The Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its GDP forecast for 2025 to 0%-2%, citing declines in manufacturing and some service sectors. The ministry also noted that the sweeping tariffs imposed by the US, as well as the US-China trade war, will deteriorate the growth outlook for both the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>
