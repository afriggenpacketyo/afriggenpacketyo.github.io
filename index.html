          <p>A federal jury in San Francisco has ordered Google to pay $425.7 million in damages for violating California privacy laws. The class-action lawsuit, covering nearly 98 million U.S. smartphones, found that the company improperly tracked user activity even when privacy controls were enabled. Google has denied the allegations, stating its tools give users control over their data, and has announced its intention to appeal the verdict. The ruling follows a separate antitrust decision where a judge ordered Google to share some search data with competitors.</p>

          <p>Germany's 2026 World Cup qualification campaign began with a surprising 2-0 loss to Slovakia in Bratislava, marking their first-ever away defeat in a World Cup qualifier. The team, led by coach Julian Nagelsmann, delivered what was described as a lethargic and emotionally lacking performance. Players and the coach expressed frustration post-match, citing a lack of connection and mindset as key issues rather than tactics. The unexpected result raises questions about the team's readiness and form just as the new domestic season gets underway.</p>

          <p>England's white-ball cricket team was defeated by South Africa by five runs at Lord's, resulting in a series loss with one game still to play. Chasing a target of 331, England fell just short, finishing at 325-9. This marks the team's fifth ODI series loss in their last six and highlights ongoing struggles since the 2023 World Cup. Despite strong individual performances from Joe Root and Jacob Bethell, England's collective effort was insufficient, raising concerns about the team's form and balance ahead of the Ashes.</p>

The move is a strategic effort to capitalize on the fast-growing beauty and personal-care category, which is projected to exceed $100 billion in the U.S. this year. The company will test the concept with dedicated beauty associates and shop-in-shops before a planned wider rollout across its brand portfolio in the following year.

          <p>Actor Channing Tatum underwent a significant physical transformation for his role in the film "Roofman," losing nearly 70 pounds and sparking concern among the film's crew. Tatum, who portrays a real-life thin criminal, dropped from 240 pounds down to 172 pounds after gaining weight for a previous role. The actor described the experience as leaving him feeling "hollow" and with a sense of "emptiness and a sadness." He later stated on social media that while he is grateful for his body's ability to change, he will not be taking on similar roles in the future due to the physical toll.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has successfully gained permission to challenge a High Court decision that allowed the activist group Palestine Action to appeal its proscription under terror legislation. The group's ban, which followed a break-in and damage to military aircraft at an RAF base, was initially challenged on the grounds that it breached free speech rights. A Court of Appeal judge ruled that the government's appeal has a "real prospect of success" and scheduled a hearing for September 25. The group's co-founder criticized the move as an attempt by the Home Secretary to avoid scrutiny.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to host a dinner at the White House with several major figures from the technology industry, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook, and Microsoft's Bill Gates. The meeting is intended to foster closer relationships between the administration and Silicon Valley leaders. Notably, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who had a public falling out with the president earlier this year, was invited but will not be attending, sending a representative instead. The dinner follows an AI summit hosted by First Lady Melania Trump earlier in the day.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old from New Hampshire, Jackson Denio, caught a massive 177-pound Atlantic halibut during an overnight fishing trip about 100 miles off the New England coast. The fish outweighed the teenager by nearly 60 pounds, and the catch may be a world record for his age group. After a 30-minute struggle, Denio successfully reeled in the giant fish with guidance from the boat's crew. The captain of the vessel praised the teen's composure and determination, noting he never let anyone else touch the rod during the intense fight.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military conducted a deadly strike on a boat in the Caribbean, which the Trump administration alleges was carrying drugs and operated by members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The attack, which killed 11 people, marks a significant escalation in the U.S. approach to combating drug trafficking and criminal organizations in the region. The administration has designated the gang a foreign terrorist organization and blames it for crime in U.S. cities, though some experts question the group's role in large-scale transnational drug smuggling.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma dropped almost 20% on Thursday, reaching their lowest point since its July initial public offering. The decline followed the company's first earnings report as a public entity, which presented a mixed outlook. While second-quarter revenue of $249.6 million slightly beat estimates, its forecast for third-quarter growth of around 33% did not assuage investor concerns. After an initial surge of 250% on its trading debut, the stock has now lost more than half its value, reflecting market volatility and high expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is asking the state's highest court to reinstate the massive financial penalty against Donald Trump in his civil fraud case. A mid-level appellate court had previously nullified the fine, which with interest exceeded $500 million, ruling it violated the constitutional ban on excessive fines. While that panel removed the monetary penalty, it upheld the trial court's finding that Trump committed fraud. Trump's legal team is simultaneously appealing the non-financial punishments, which include a ban on him and his sons holding corporate leadership roles in New York.</p>

Gupta discusses how the body has its own natural opioid system that can be activated through practices like active gratitude. The article also covers new non-opioid medications and reviews the evidence for cannabis in pain management, highlighting the potential for training the mind to mitigate certain kinds of pain.</p>
