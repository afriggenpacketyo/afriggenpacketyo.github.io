          <p>The S&P 500 has turned positive for the year after a significant rally from its April 8 closing low, driven by easing U.S.-China trade tensions. Eight stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust portfolio, including Meta Platforms, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, and Nvidia, have also turned positive for the year after initially being down. The article underscores the importance of remaining invested during market downturns. It remains uncertain where the market and these individual stocks will go in the near future, but easing U.S.-China trade tensions and recent business deals are positives for market sentiment.

          <p>A vote on President Trump's megabill, aimed at advancing his agenda, failed in the House Budget Committee due to objections from Republican hard-liners who complained that the bulk of savings in the legislation don't take effect until after Trump leaves office. Representatives Andrew Clyde, Josh Brecheen, Lloyd Smucker, Ralph Norman, and Chip Roy voted against clearing the bill, defying Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson. House Republican leaders will continue negotiations, with a chance the bill could clear the House before the Memorial Day recess. The House Freedom Caucus said it is prepared to continue negotiations over the weekend after several of them blocked the megabill from advancing.</p>

Masra previously went into exile in 2022 after his party was suspended, but he returned and served as prime minister before facing off against President Deby in presidential elections, alleging electoral fraud.</p>

          <p>Home equity line of credit (HELOC) interest rates have experienced fluctuations in 2025, influenced by the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain the federal funds rate. After declining to an 18-month low in January, HELOC rates have recently increased slightly in response to market conditions, but they are still lower than they were in September 2024. HELOCs remain a relatively affordable borrowing option compared to personal loans and credit cards, and they are well-positioned to exploit potential rate cuts later in the year. Homeowners considering HELOCs should account for potential volatility, but they could find it to be a beneficial borrowing option in the current financial climate.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill faced a setback as conservative Republicans blocked it from advancing out of the House Budget Committee, citing insufficient federal spending cuts. The conservatives are demanding that work requirements for Medicaid recipients begin sooner than the current bill allows.

House Speaker Mike Johnson remains committed to putting the legislation on the floor before Memorial Day.</p>

          <p>A new analysis suggests that the Republican tax plan may offer only modest gains to everyday workers, and some taxpayers may actually be left in worse financial shape if the bill becomes law. The Penn Wharton Budget Model found that many Americans who make less than $51,000 a year would see their after-tax income fall as a result of the Republican proposal beginning in 2026 due to spending cuts in other programs. The top 0.1 percent, including those with incomes over $4.3 million, would gain on average more than $389,000 in after-tax income in 2026, the data show. The article also discusses the political challenges facing the tax plan in Congress.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department is reportedly not planning to prosecute Boeing in a case tied to the two crashes of the aerospace giant's 737 Max, allowing the plane-maker to avoid a guilty plea. This tentative agreement comes after a judge rejected a previous plea deal, citing concerns about diversity, equity, and inclusion. The fraud charge stems from Boeing's development of the 737 Max, with accusations that the company misled regulators about the inclusion of a flight-control system implicated in the crashes.</p>

          <p>While it is legally possible to stop paying credit cards, doing so comes with serious consequences, including damaged credit, collection activity, and potential lawsuits. The article advises exploring alternatives such as hardship programs, credit counseling, debt settlement, or bankruptcy before defaulting on payments. Credit card debt is unsecured, but creditors can pursue legal avenues to recover unpaid balances, leading to wage garnishment and long-term financial fallout. Consulting with a debt relief expert or bankruptcy attorney is recommended to explore structured ways to manage or eliminate credit card debt.</p>

          <p>After several potential Republican candidates passed on running for key U.S. Senate races in 2026, some Republicans are split on whether their party is struggling to recruit competitive candidates. High-profile Republicans like Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia and former Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire have opted not to run, raising concerns about the party's ability to attract centrist candidates. Some Republicans believe that Trump's influence and demands for absolute loyalty may be deterring candidates who want to focus on state-specific issues, while others argue that these decisions do not indicate broader recruiting challenges.</p>

          <p>Following a report highlighting high levels of arsenic in rice brands sold across the U.S., experts recommend several strategies to reduce exposure. These include diversifying your diet with rice alternatives like quinoa, barley, and couscous, which contain lower levels of heavy metals. Checking labels for the rice's growing region, as rice grown in California has lower arsenic levels than rice grown in the Southeast U.S., and cooking rice like pasta, using a high water-to-rice ratio and draining the excess water, can also help reduce arsenic content.</p>
