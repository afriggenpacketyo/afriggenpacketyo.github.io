          <p>A Canadian CP-140 Aurora military aircraft, part of a multinational mission to enforce UN sanctions against North Korea, was repeatedly intercepted by Chinese fighter jets in international airspace. A CBS News crew aboard the plane documented the encounters, including one instance where a missile-carrying Chinese jet flew less than 200 feet away. The mission, called Operation NEON, aims to track illicit North Korean trade but faces consistent and risky challenges from the Chinese military. This highlights the escalating tensions and China's role in undermining international sanctions on Pyongyang.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from deploying the California National Guard to Portland, Oregon. The judge ruled there was no evidence to justify the federalized troops' presence, raising concerns about circumventing state sovereignty. This legal challenge is part of a broader conflict over the president's use of military forces for domestic law enforcement, as Illinois and Chicago have also filed a lawsuit to block a similar deployment. The White House has criticized the ruling as a violation of constitutional order.</p>

          <p>During the Sanderson Farms Championship, PGA Tour golfer Vince Whaley encountered a tense moment when he had to play a shot from a watery area under the watchful eye of a six-foot alligator. The reptile remained stationary about 20 feet away as Whaley, trusting his caddie to monitor the animal, successfully executed the shot and saved par on the hole. The incident provided a moment of unexpected drama at the tournament in Jackson, Mississippi. Whaley later joked that his plan, had the alligator moved closer, was simply to get out of the water as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p>Mark Sanchez, a former NFL quarterback and current Fox Sports commentator, is now facing a felony charge of battery involving serious bodily injury following an altercation in Indianapolis. Prosecutors upgraded the charges from misdemeanors after learning the 69-year-old victim sustained significant injuries during a dispute over a parked vehicle. Sanchez allegedly became physical with the truck driver, and the incident was reportedly captured on surveillance video. The case highlights a serious legal issue for the former football star, who was in the city for a broadcasting assignment.</p>

          <p>Doan's Bakery is recalling its White Chocolate Coconut cake, famously gifted by actor Tom Cruise to his friends and colleagues during the holidays, due to an undeclared allergen risk. The FDA announced that the cake, along with the bakery's Carrot Bundt cake, may contain wheat and milk that were not listed on the label, posing a serious threat to individuals with allergies. The issue was discovered during a routine inspection, and while no illnesses have been reported, the voluntary recall affects cakes shipped nationwide via Goldbelly.com between June and September 2025.</p>

Jeffries argued the debate would provide transparency to the American people regarding the legislative impasse and what he termed the Speaker's "my way or the highway approach." Johnson quickly dismissed the offer as "desperate pleas for attention" and theatrics, stating that the issues had already been debated.

          <p>The current U.S. government shutdown is distinct from previous ones due to heightened political animosity and a profound lack of trust between the Republican and Democratic parties. For Democrats, the standoff is a direct confrontation with the Trump administration's agenda, while some Republicans view it as an opportunity to reduce the federal workforce. Unlike past shutdowns characterized by negotiation attempts, this impasse is defined by bitter accusations and minimal collaboration. The conflict occurs against the backdrop of a fragile economy, making the political stalemate particularly perilous for the country.</p>

          <p>Space company Firefly Aerospace announced it is acquiring SciTec, a defense technology contractor, for $855 million in a cash-and-stock deal. The acquisition is a strategic move by Firefly to bolster its national security capabilities by integrating SciTec's software for missile warning, tracking, and defense systems. This deal follows a recent rocket explosion during a ground test that caused Firefly's stock to dip, but the company continues to build its portfolio of government and defense contracts. SciTec will operate as a subsidiary of Firefly once the transaction closes.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's military has claimed responsibility for a series of long-range drone strikes deep inside Russian territory, targeting key military and industrial sites. The attacks reportedly hit the Sverdlov ammunition plant in Nizhny Novgorod, an oil terminal in occupied Crimea, and a weapons depot, causing explosions and fires. Russia's defense ministry reported shooting down 251 drones in one of the largest barrages of the war. These strikes represent a significant escalation in Ukraine's strategy to disrupt Moscow's supply lines and cripple its war-making capabilities from afar.</p>

          <p>The union representing U.S. air traffic controllers is urging its members to remain on the job despite the ongoing partial government shutdown, which has left them working without pay. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association warned that any job action is illegal and could lead to termination from federal service. The situation raises concerns about aviation safety and efficiency, as a similar shutdown in 2019 led to increased absences and flight delays. The persistent shortage of controllers, who are already working mandatory overtime, exacerbates the strain on the national airspace system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts advise that recent tax legislation signed by President Trump will impact charitable giving strategies, particularly for 2025 and beyond. Starting in 2026, a new tax break will be available for non-itemizers, making it potentially advantageous for some to delay smaller year-end donations until January. Conversely, higher earners may face a reduced benefit from their charitable deductions in 2026 due to a new deduction floor and a cap for the top tax bracket. This could incentivize accelerating large donations into 2025 using tools like donor-advised funds (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's decision in Mahmoud v. Taylor, which grants parents a constitutional right to opt their children out of classroom content that conflicts with their religious beliefs, poses a significant challenge for public schools. While creating administrative burdens, this article argues it also offers liberals an opportunity to recommit to pluralism by accommodating diverse beliefs rather than imposing ideological conformity. The ruling forces a delicate balance between ensuring LGBTQ students feel included and respecting the convictions of religious families, a central tension in maintaining shared civic institutions.</p>

With no clear path to forming a stable government, France faces mounting pressure for another round of elections or other drastic political action.</p>
