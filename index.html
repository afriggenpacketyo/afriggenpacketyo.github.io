          <p>The UK government is considering a significant overhaul of road safety laws in England and Wales. The new strategy includes mandatory eye tests every three years for drivers over 70, who could be banned if they fail. Additionally, the plan proposes lowering the drink-driving limit to align with Scotland's stricter standard and introducing penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. These changes follow a coroner's report that criticized the UK's current driver licensing system as excessively lax after several fatal accidents involving drivers with poor eyesight.</p>

          <p>While mature black holes are known for letting nothing escape, scientists theorize that newly formed black holes produce a unique form of 'music.' This phenomenon is not sound but rather gravitational waves that ring out as the nascent black hole settles into a stable, mathematically perfect shape after its creation from a star's collapse or a merger. This process smooths out any initial irregularities, and the resulting vibrations in spacetime could soon be detectable, offering a new way to observe and understand these enigmatic cosmic objects.</p>

          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (US$501) annually for each child under three years old. This initiative is expected to have a more significant economic impact in less affluent regions where the subsidy represents a larger percentage of household income. For example, the payment constitutes over 13.5% of an average resident's annual income in the poorer province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in Shanghai. This disparity suggests the policy could stimulate consumption and potentially birth rates more effectively in smaller cities and rural areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a deal to secure export licenses to China, semiconductor giants Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from specific chip sales in the country. The agreement covers Nvidia's H20 chip and AMD's MI308 chip, both of which were developed for the Chinese market following earlier U.S. export restrictions. This development, which reverses a previous ban, comes amid easing trade tensions and follows extensive lobbying efforts by Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, to allow American AI technology to compete globally.</p>

This sustained warmth has led to the arrival of species not typically found in UK waters, such as octopus, bluefin tuna, and mauve stinger jellyfish. While these new arrivals are notable, the rising temperatures are also creating stress for native cold-water species like cod.

          <p>The Lee fire in western Colorado has rapidly grown into one of the largest wildfires in the state's history, charring over 167 square miles and prompting widespread evacuations. As a precautionary measure, all 179 inmates from the Rifle Correctional Center were safely evacuated and relocated to another facility. Over a thousand firefighters are battling the blaze, which is being fueled by gusty winds and dry conditions, with containment at only 6%. The fire is churning through remote terrain about 250 miles west of Denver, with no structural damage reported yet.</p>

          <p>A 2022 study conducted on mice has suggested a surprising potential link between nose-picking and an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that damaging the nasal epithelium—the protective tissue inside the nose—allowed the bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae a direct pathway to the brain. In response to this infection, the mouse brains produced amyloid-beta protein deposits, which are a key pathological marker of Alzheimer's. While the findings are preliminary and require human studies for confirmation, they highlight a novel environmental factor that could contribute to the disease.</p>

          <p>A contentious political battle is escalating in Texas over a Republican-led effort to redraw the state's congressional maps, a move that could give the GOP a significant advantage in the next election. In protest, Democratic lawmakers have fled the state to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to conduct business. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker called the GOP effort "cheating," while Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have the absent lawmakers arrested upon their return and to call indefinite special legislative sessions until the matter is resolved.</p>

          <p>A 60-foot passenger vessel named Discovery ran aground in powerful surf near Honolulu's Kewalo Basin Harbor. Dramatic video captured the boat being tossed by large waves, appearing to nearly capsize before coming to rest against a concrete wall. The two experienced crew members on board were not injured. The boat's operator reported that two large waves hit the stern, disrupting its course and causing it to lose propulsion after grounding. The fuel and oil were safely removed to prevent pollution, and a plan was made to tow the vessel away.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Vice President J.D. Vance, the Trump administration is considering imposing new tariffs on Chinese imports as a punitive measure for China's continued purchasing of Russian oil. While President Trump is reportedly thinking about the move, no firm decision has been made, as the administration weighs the complex implications for the broader U.S.-China relationship. This potential escalation in trade pressure comes as the administration seeks new ways to influence the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Beijing responded that its trade with Russia is conducted within the framework of international law. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria and collaborator Adidas have issued apologies following criticism that their "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe constituted cultural appropriation. The design was inspired by traditional Mexican leather sandals known as huaraches, but it was reportedly produced without consulting or crediting the Indigenous communities who originated the style. The controversy drew comments from Mexico's president, and Adidas has since contacted Oaxacan officials to discuss restitution. Chavarria expressed deep regret that the design was not developed in a respectful partnership with the Oaxacan community.</p>

          <p>A report from the occupied West Bank details a sharp increase in intimidation and violence by Israeli settlers aimed at driving out Palestinian communities since the Hamas attacks of October 2023. This campaign, supported by hardline nationalist ministers in the Israeli government, involves destroying livelihoods and restricting access to land, which has led to the forcible displacement of entire communities. The article highlights that the line between settlers and the Israeli military has blurred, with settlers now serving in regional defense units and allegedly using their authority to threaten Palestinians.</p>

          <p>According to historian Rana Mitter of Harvard Kennedy School, the impact of World War II on China is a pivotal yet often underestimated factor in understanding the nation's modern development. Mitter's research focuses on the consequences of Japan's invasion, arguing that the conflict shattered the infrastructure and communications networks built in the preceding decades. This widespread destruction effectively forced China to start its post-war development from a state of near-total ruin, profoundly influencing its subsequent political and societal trajectory.</p>

This aggressive rhetoric comes as his administration has already increased the presence of federal law enforcement in D.C. and floated the idea of a federal takeover of the city's governance.</p>
