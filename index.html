        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israel's High Court of Justice has mandated that the government provide more food to Palestinian prisoners, citing insufficient provisions. This ruling comes as US President Donald Trump issued a "last warning" to Hamas to accept a ceasefire deal, while Israel's military continues its offensive to seize Gaza City. The court's decision highlights humanitarian concerns within the broader, ongoing conflict in Gaza and the Middle East region. This article underscores the complex interplay of legal, political, and military pressures in the area.</p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. saw a significant 33% drop in August, contributing to the country's slowest overall export growth in six months. This decline is attributed to President Donald Trump's intensified crackdown on transshipments and the fading impact of earlier export frontloading. Imports from the U.S. also fell by 16%. Economists anticipate continued pressure on exports, with sluggish domestic demand and persistent deflationary pressures further challenging China's economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jury selection has commenced in the trial of Ryan Routh, charged with attempting to assassinate Donald Trump during a golf game last year in South Florida. Routh, who is representing himself, pleaded not guilty to charges including attempting to assassinate a presidential candidate and firearm violations. Prosecutors allege Routh methodically plotted the attack for weeks, but was thwarted by a Secret Service agent. This high-profile case follows another assassination attempt on Trump earlier in the same year.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are expected to open positively as attention shifts to France's impending confidence vote for Prime Minister Francois Bayrou. Bayrou is widely anticipated to lose the vote due to disagreements over proposed budget cuts totaling 44 billion euros. If ousted, President Emmanuel Macron will face appointing France's fifth prime minister in under two years. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific markets traded mostly higher, and U.S. stock futures were stable ahead of key inflation reports, with hopes for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.

          <p>Erin Patterson has been sentenced to life in prison with a non-parole period of 33 years for the murder of three relatives and the attempted murder of another, using death cap mushrooms. Justice Christopher Beale highlighted the enormous betrayal of trust, noting Patterson's victims were family members who had supported her. Patterson, who maintains her innocence, allegedly intended to kill her estranged husband as well. The case garnered significant public interest, and the judge inferred an ongoing intent to kill from her "pitiless behavior."</p>

          <p>An audacious attempt to traffic over 2.2 tonnes of cocaine into the UK and Europe was thwarted by Irish authorities, leading to 129 years in jail for eight men.

Ireland's extensive, vulnerable coastline is increasingly targeted by cartels, including the Kinahan organised crime group, turning its territorial waters into a "Wild West."
