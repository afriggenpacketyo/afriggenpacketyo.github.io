          <h2>Trump Fails to Sway SALT Caucus on Tax Bill Support</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 13:09:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's attempt to convince House Republicans from blue states to support a major tax bill fell short due to disagreements over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The bill proposes raising the SALT deduction to $30,000, but some GOP lawmakers from high-tax states consider this insufficient. Trump urged the SALT Caucus to "let it go," but their opposition could jeopardize the bill's passage before Memorial Day weekend. The 2017 tax law capped the SALT deduction at $10,000, a move seen as targeting Democratic-leaning states.</p>

          <p>A woman named Chloe Gray went viral on TikTok for bringing a whole rotisserie chicken as her carry-on luggage on a flight from Newark to California. Gray, a social media influencer, jokingly referred to the chicken as her "designer bag" and claimed it was a convenient way to have a healthy meal during her travels. While TSA agents questioned her about the unusual item, they ultimately allowed her to proceed. Other passengers expressed mixed reactions, with some finding the strong smell disruptive.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Vladimir Putin held a two-hour phone conversation, their third since the beginning of Trump's second term, with differing interpretations of the call's focus. Trump emphasized potential trade opportunities between Russia and the United States after the end of the conflict in Ukraine, envisioning job creation and wealth generation for Russia. Putin described the talks as "frank, informative and very useful," expressing a willingness to work with Ukraine on a "memorandum" for a possible peace accord. Analysts suggest the call may have centered on bilateral economic relations rather than solely on resolving the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Millions of consumers in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (and Scotland from 1992) could be eligible for up to Â£70 each following a court ruling that historic fees charged by Mastercard were unfair. The legal case, initiated by Walter Merricks, argued that shoppers were overcharged due to fees levied on transactions between 1992 and 2008. Consumers who lived in the specified regions for at least three months during the eligibility period and purchased goods from UK businesses accepting Mastercard are entitled to claim. The settlement totals Â£200m, with unclaimed funds going to the lawsuit's financial backer.</p>

          <p>The FDA has outlined new, more stringent guidelines for approving future COVID-19 vaccine boosters for healthy Americans, requiring new clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. This contrasts with the previous approach of approving updated shots based on antibody response. For high-risk individuals (adults 65+ and those with underlying conditions), the FDA will still accept immunogenicity data. The agency aims to balance regulatory flexibility with rigorous scientific standards, acknowledging the uncertain benefit of repeat vaccinations for low-risk individuals.</p>

          <p>The availability of EU e-gates for UK passport holders this summer remains uncertain, as the EU Commission indicates access won't be granted until the new European Entry/Exit Scheme (EES) is implemented in October 2025. Even then, the decision rests with individual countries. The EES collects biometric data on non-EU citizens entering the bloc. While a recent UK-EU agreement removes legal barriers to e-gate use post-EES, talks with individual EU nations are ongoing to potentially allow British passengers to use e-gates sooner.</p>

          <p>Liberty Steel is making a final effort to prevent the collapse of its plants in Rotherham and Sheffield, UK, potentially impacting 1,450 jobs. A court could force the company's speciality steel business to close on Wednesday due to unpaid debts unless an adjournment is granted. Government sources have indicated they are not willing to intervene financially to cover outstanding debts, but may consider stepping in if the company enters insolvency. Creditors are seeking liquidation to sell Liberty's assets and recover owed funds.</p>

          <p>The FDA will continue approving updated COVID-19 vaccines for seniors and individuals at higher risk of severe illness, but will require vaccine manufacturers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for broader use. This decision may limit access to updated shots for many Americans without underlying conditions. The agency said it would demand robust, gold-standard data on persons at low risk. The FDA's new leadership, under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aims to move away from the "one-size-fits-all regulatory framework."</p>

          <p>Walmart warned that President Trump's tariffs would lead to higher prices for its shoppers, a shift from its previous downplaying of the issue. The company's CFO stated that the magnitude of the increases is more than any retailer can absorb. Trump responded by telling Walmart to "EAT THE TARIFFS." This situation illustrates the challenges businesses face in balancing customer interests, shareholder expectations, and the White House's trade policies. Walmart reiterated its commitment to maintaining low prices for as long as possible.</p>

          <p>Israel has recovered thousands of items belonging to its most famous spy, Eli Cohen, after a covert operation in Syria. The items, including documents, recordings, photos, and letters, were collected by Syrian intelligence after Cohen's capture in 1965. Cohen, who infiltrated the Syrian political echelon, provided critical intelligence that helped Israel in the 1967 Middle East War. The retrieval occurred 60 years after Cohen's execution in Damascus. Israel continues to seek the return of Cohen's remains.</p>

          <p>The European Union has decided to lift its economic sanctions on Syria, according to the bloc's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas. The decision comes after an Islamist rebel group overthrew former dictator Bashar Assad in December. The EU aims to support the rebuilding of a new, inclusive, and peaceful Syria. However, sanctions will remain in place for individuals and organizations connected to the Assad regime, as well as those responsible for human rights violations. Export restrictions on weapons and goods used for domestic repression will also continue.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential monthly payouts from a $25,000 annuity, highlighting how factors like age, gender, and annuity type influence the income stream. It explains the differences between immediate, deferred, fixed, variable, and indexed annuities, and discusses the trade-offs between guaranteed income and flexibility. The article concludes that while a $25,000 annuity may not significantly impact retirement security, it can offer a small, steady income stream, especially when integrated into a diversified retirement plan.

Unlike Walmart, it doesn't sell food and has a higher average receipt. The direct commitment to not raising prices sets Home Depot apart from many retailers â€”large and small â€” who say they cannot afford to absorb new tariffs.</p>
