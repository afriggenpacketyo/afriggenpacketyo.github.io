          <p>Missouri's Republican lawmakers have approved a referendum to repeal the abortion-rights amendment voters approved last year, seeking to ban most abortions except in cases of sexual assault or incest. The proposed constitutional amendment, which passed the Republican-led House last month, would allow abortions only for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, or in sexual assault or incest cases up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. The measure also prohibits gender transition surgeries, hormone treatments, and puberty blockers for minors, which are already barred under state law. Protesters disrupted the Senate vote with chants of "Stop the ban!"</p>

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber has voluntarily taken a 25% pay cut for the 2025-26 school year due to funding cuts imposed by the Trump administration. The Trump administration accused Harvard of failing to uphold civil rights laws and to foster an "environment that produces intellectual creativity", threatening to pull federal funding if Harvard did not reform governance, leadership, hiring and admissions practices. Harvard refused to comply with the demands, with Garber saying that "no governmentâ€¦ should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and areas of study and inquiry they can pursue."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council voted to approve a sweeping package of minimum wage increases for workers in the tourism industry, requiring hotels with over 60 rooms and airport businesses to pay $30 per hour by 2028. Hotel owners, business groups, and airport concession companies predicted the wage increases would negatively impact an industry still recovering from the COVID pandemic. However, labor leaders and unionized workers celebrated the victory, arguing it would benefit the region by putting more money in workers' pockets.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a pause on the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded health care benefits in 2026, citing a $12 billion budget deficit. Newsom attributed the deficit to economic uncertainty stemming from federal tariff policies. The plan includes a freeze on new Medi-Cal applications for low-income adults without legal status and a $100 monthly premium for adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" already on Medi-Cal starting in 2027. Newsom's office estimates the changes will save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029.</p>
