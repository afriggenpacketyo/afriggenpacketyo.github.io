          <p>Recent Israeli airstrikes have reportedly killed more than 35 people across Gaza, including women, children, and civilians who were seeking humanitarian aid. The attacks persist as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu affirmed his commitment to continuing the campaign against Hamas during a speech at the United Nations. Meanwhile, reports have emerged of a new 21-point U.S. peace plan that may include a pathway to a Palestinian state, a concept Netanyahu has strongly opposed. The humanitarian situation remains dire, with hundreds of thousands displaced and essential services collapsing amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of U.S. troops to Portland, Oregon, to protect federal facilities, particularly an ICE processing center that has been the site of recent protests. In a social media post, Trump stated he was authorizing the use of "full force, if necessary" against what he termed "Antifa, and other domestic terrorists." The move drew immediate criticism from Democratic lawmakers in Oregon, including the governor and Portland's mayor, who asserted that federal intervention was not requested and is unnecessary. This action represents an escalation in the administration's crackdown on protests and illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>A retired FBI investigator suggests that convicted serial killer Joseph Naso, known as the "Alphabet Killer," may have been paying homage to Caryl Chessman, an executed 1940s criminal known as the "Red Light Bandit." Naso, who murdered four women with matching first and last initials, was reportedly a pen pal of Chessman and was invited to his 1960 execution. The theory is explored in a new docuseries, which also reveals that a fellow death row inmate claims Naso confessed to killing 26 people. The investigator believes Naso's crimes were a tribute to his idol, mirroring Chessman's notoriety and legal defiance.</p>

          <p>Over a dozen FBI agents were fired, reportedly including some who were photographed kneeling in solidarity with racial justice protesters in June 2020. The agents had been deployed to Washington, D.C., following the police killing of George Floyd and chose to kneel to de-escalate a confrontation with protesters. While an initial review found no grounds for discipline, a subsequent investigation was opened under FBI Director Kash Patel. The FBI Agents Association condemned the firings as a violation of due process that damages trust within the Bureau and weakens national security by eliminating valuable expertise.</p>

          <p>Finland has been named the happiest country in the world for the eighth year in a row, according to the annual World Happiness Report. Experts suggest this consistent ranking is less about daily joy and more about a deep sense of contentment derived from a well-functioning society. Key factors include strong social support systems, universal access to services like advanced public libraries, a high level of trust in institutions, and a close connection to nature.

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has rapidly strengthened into a Category 4 storm over the Atlantic, with maximum sustained winds reaching 145 mph. Currently located northeast of the Leeward Islands, the storm is moving west and is expected to continue strengthening, although no coastal watches or warnings are in effect for the U.S. at this time. The National Hurricane Center is also monitoring a second weather system in the Caribbean that is likely to develop into a tropical storm and potentially a hurricane. This second system is forecast to approach the southeastern U.S. coast early next week.</p>

          <p>A stampede at a political campaign rally in Karur, India, has left at least 36 people dead and 40 others injured. The event was for the Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam party, led by popular actor-turned-politician Vijay. Reports indicate that a crowd of over 30,000 became restless after Vijay was several hours late for his speech, leading to a crush when some people allegedly rushed his bus. Both Vijay and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have expressed their condolences to the families of the victims.

          <p>As Major Hurricane Humberto churns in the Atlantic, meteorologists are monitoring the possibility of a rare interaction with a nearby developing storm system. If the two storms get close enough, they could engage in a phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect, where they orbit a common center. In this case, since Humberto is significantly stronger, it would likely absorb or disrupt the weaker system rather than performing a gravitational "dance." While a direct merger is considered unlikely, any interaction could slightly alter the forecasted tracks of both storms, with the second system posing a potential threat to the southeastern U.S.</p>

Brashers, who had a long criminal history including other violent crimes, died by suicide in 1999 during a police standoff. The case had previously resulted in the wrongful convictions of two men who were later exonerated by DNA evidence. The investigation remains open as police continue to work on the case.</p>

This would place the Fed in a difficult position, caught between its dual mandate of maintaining price stability and achieving full employment.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has abruptly summoned hundreds of senior U.S. generals and admirals from around the world for an unusual meeting at Quantico, Virginia. The gathering has stirred anxiety among military officials, who are reportedly bracing for potential firings or demotions. The meeting's agenda is focused on Hegseth's vision for restoring a "warrior ethos" and implementing new military standards. This unprecedented assembly is seen by some as a "show of force" for the new military posture under the Trump administration, with Hegseth expected to deliver a message for leaders to align with his direction or risk their careers.</p>

          <p>Belva Davis, a trailblazing journalist who became the first Black woman television reporter on the U.S. West Coast, has passed away at the age of 92. Davis broke barriers in the 1960s, a time when television news was dominated by white men, and became a trusted and respected anchor in the San Francisco Bay Area. Throughout her career, she covered pivotal events from the assassination of Harvey Milk to the AIDS crisis, interviewing figures like Muhammad Ali and Fidel Castro. Colleagues and public figures remembered her as a courageous mentor who opened doors for a new generation of journalists.</p>

          <p>Lt. Col. George Hardy, one of the last surviving original Tuskegee Airmen, has died at the age of 100. Hardy was among the first Black military pilots in U.S. history and flew 21 combat missions over Europe during World War II as a P-51 "Red Tail" fighter pilot. His distinguished military career also included flying combat missions in both the Korean and Vietnam Wars. After retiring from the Air Force, Hardy became a dedicated advocate for the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen, who collectively received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007 for their courage and patriotism in the face of racial discrimination.</p>

          <p>A resilient stock market, buoyed by a "wealth effect" among asset holders, appears to be powering consumer spending and keeping the U.S. economy from a recession despite a weak jobs picture. Recent economic data shows surprisingly strong consumer spending and durable goods orders, largely benefiting the top 10% of earners who own 87% of the market. However, economists warn that this creates a vulnerability; if the stock market were to decline, consumer confidence and spending would likely fall sharply. With consumer sentiment already low among non-investors, the economy could be on a knife's edge, reliant on market performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Activist investor Anson Funds is publicly calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, arguing it is the best path forward for shareholders. This move follows a previous activist campaign by Legion Partners that led Clear Channel to divest its European and Latin American assets, transforming it into a U.S.-focused company. Despite these changes, the company's stock has underperformed, and it still carries significant debt. Anson believes a sale to a strategic acquirer like JCDecaux or Lamar, or to a private equity firm, is now more feasible and would unlock greater value than a slow, standalone restructuring.

This method addresses labor shortages and weather delays, allowing for more efficient production. The company recently demonstrated its rapid-response capabilities by producing 82 homes in two months for residents displaced by the Maui wildfires.

His declaration that inflation has been "defeated" is also incorrect, with the annual rate at 2.9% and showing signs of re-accelerating. The president is accurate that the stock market has hit record highs during his second term. However, his claim of a manufacturing boom is questionable, as the sector has shed jobs in recent months.

May, a member of the state's conservative Freedom Caucus who resigned earlier this year, faces a potential sentence of five to 20 years in prison for each of the five counts.
