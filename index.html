          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland to negotiate a framework trade agreement. The meeting aims to prevent the implementation of a threatened 30% U.S. tariff on EU goods, set to begin on August 1st. There is cautious optimism for a deal, with sources suggesting a potential compromise involving a 15% baseline tariff, similar to a recent U.S. agreement with Japan. This high-stakes discussion occurs amid the world's largest bilateral trade relationship, with significant global economic implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>WWE legend Hulk Hogan, who died at age 71 from a reported cardiac arrest, had faced extensive health issues in the years prior. Hogan himself stated he had undergone 25 surgeries in the last decade, including for his back, shoulders, knees, and hips, attributing them to the physical toll of his long wrestling career. His wife recently clarified that he had undergone a major neck surgery and was not in a coma, contrary to rumors. Medical experts cited in the article connect the high physical strain, travel, and potential past steroid use common among wrestlers of his era to premature health complications and heart disease.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Argues Israel's Gaza Food Distribution System is a Cover for Starvation</h2>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Alex de Waal argues that the U.S. and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) is not a genuine aid effort but an alibi for the ongoing starvation of Palestinians. He contends the four military-zone distribution sites provide less than half the required food, fail to reach the most vulnerable, and lack essential items like therapeutic food for malnourished children. De Waal asserts that the system forces desperate people to risk their lives for rations, contributing to social breakdown. He concludes that the operation's primary purpose is to avoid the stigma of causing a famine, rather than to provide meaningful, dignified humanitarian relief.</p>

          <p>A 25-year-old Cuban woman, who legally entered the U.S. seeking asylum, was abruptly detained by ICE agents in an El Paso immigration courthouse moments after a judge scheduled her next hearing. This incident is part of a wider, concerning trend where migrants attending their required court dates are being arrested, even those with ongoing cases or a legal pathway to remain. Advocates report that ICE is targeting individuals for fast-tracked deportation, creating a climate of fear that may deter migrants from appearing in court. The practice raises serious questions about due process within the U.S. immigration system under the Trump administration's intensified enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is experiencing a paradox where existing home prices hit an all-time high in June, even as the overall number of sales reached a nine-month low. This divergence is driven by a market of "haves and have-nots," where affluent, all-cash buyers and those with significant housing equity can afford the high prices, particularly in the million-dollar-plus segment. Meanwhile, high mortgage rates are deterring many first-time and middle-income buyers and discouraging current homeowners with low-rate mortgages from selling, a phenomenon known as the "lock-in effect." This dynamic keeps inventory tight and prices elevated, creating a challenging environment for many aspiring homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Syria's Kurdish minority is in a precarious position, with its military wing, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), declaring disarmament a "red line" amid rising sectarian violence in the country. This declaration comes as a crucial peace deal with Syria's interim government stalls over the integration of Kurdish forces and control of key territories. Turkey, which views the SDF as a threat, is reportedly seeking a defense agreement with Damascus that could further pressure the Kurds. Analysts suggest that unless the new Syrian government guarantees rights for all minorities, instability will persist, potentially drawing in external powers like Israel to support the Kurds.</p>

Over 220 MPs have signed a letter urging recognition, a step France has committed to taking within months. While the UK government is accelerating efforts for aid delivery, some critics describe airdrops as "largely symbolic" and inefficient, insisting that only the full opening of land borders by Israel can prevent a man-made famine.</p>

McIntosh arrives in historic form, having recently broken three world records, and is attempting to win five individual gold medals, a feat only Michael Phelps has achieved.

The mother, Alphonsine Djiako Leuga, was the sole carer for her daughter, Loraine. After the mother died of pneumonia in a home without heating, her daughter, who was entirely dependent on her, died weeks later from malnutrition. The coroner identified "missed opportunities" by social care teams to escalate concerns after the family had disengaged with services.

          <p>The ongoing deadly border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia pits a well-equipped, longtime U.S. ally against a smaller force with strong ties to China. Militarily, Thailand holds a significant advantage in personnel, modern weaponry, and air power, benefiting from its status as a major non-NATO U.S. ally. In contrast, Cambodia's younger military relies heavily on Chinese and older Russian equipment, and Beijing has invested in facilities like the Ream Naval Base. Despite Thailand's superior firepower, analysts note that the disputed border terrain may favor Cambodian ground forces, suggesting Thailand will likely emphasize its air and long-range capabilities in the conflict.</p>

In response to these tariffs, many European luxury houses like Moncler and Brunello Cucinelli are planning price increases.

          <p>Three Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies were killed when a grenade they had recovered from a Santa Monica garage unexpectedly detonated at a training facility. Officials confirmed the deputies from the Arson Explosives Detail believed the devices were inert. In a deeply concerning development, a second grenade recovered at the same time is now missing, and authorities have been unable to locate it despite an extensive search. The ATF is leading the investigation into the blast and the search for the missing explosive. The department has changed its policy to treat all recovered explosive devices as live to prevent a future tragedy.</p>
