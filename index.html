          <p>Southwest Airlines will officially end its long-standing open seating policy, with assigned seats becoming available for flights starting January 27, 2026. Customers can begin booking these flights on July 29 of this year. This change is part of a broader strategy shift, which includes new fare bundles, options for extra legroom, and a revamped boarding process with eight numbered groups. The move, along with the recent elimination of the 'bags fly free' policy, signals the airline's response to financial pressures and its effort to modernize the customer experience.</p>

          <p>Brett Hankison, a former Louisville police officer, has been sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the 2020 raid that led to her death. A jury convicted him of using excessive force by blindly firing ten shots into her apartment through a covered door and window. The sentence followed a controversial recommendation from the Justice Department for only one day in prison, which civil rights advocates condemned. Taylor's death was a pivotal event that fueled nationwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has barred a Wall Street Journal reporter from the press pool for an upcoming presidential trip to Scotland. The decision is a direct response to the newspaper's story about an alleged 'bawdy' birthday letter signed by Donald Trump for Jeffrey Epstein in the early 2000s. The White House press secretary cited the Journal's 'fake and defamatory conduct' for the exclusion, a move the White House Correspondents' Association condemned as a violation of First Amendment principles. This action highlights ongoing tensions between the administration and news organizations over press access and coverage.</p>

Jones publicly noted Parsons' injury history, which prompted former NFL player J.J. Watt to criticize the owner for publicly taking a dig at his star players before the season begins. Parsons retweeted Watt's sarcastic commentary, signaling tension as the All-Pro defensive end seeks a new contract that would place him among the highest-paid defensive players in the league.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new focus on targeting sanctuary cities, with border czar Tom Homan vowing to 'flood the zone' with ICE agents to increase arrests of undocumented individuals. The policy intensification follows the shooting of an off-duty CBP officer in New York City, allegedly by an undocumented person. Homan stated that if local jails do not cooperate, ICE will conduct more arrests in communities and at worksites, detaining anyone found to be in the country illegally. The move escalates the conflict between federal immigration authorities and Democrat-run cities with sanctuary policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that Donald Trump's presidency is animated more by personal grievances and pettiness than by a coherent policy agenda. The article cites several examples, including retaliating against former officials like James Clapper, pushing to fire the Fed Chairman over personal frustration, and abruptly changing Ukraine policy after feeling slighted by Vladimir Putin. It suggests that these actions, from purges at the FBI to focusing on the names of sports teams, stem from a vengeful and emotional governing style. This approach prioritizes loyalty and settling scores over addressing substantive national and international issues.</p>

Cantwell's recommendations include upgrading Doppler radar, improving satellites, and bolstering research at NOAA, an agency facing significant budget cuts under the administration's proposals.

          <p>Lawyers for Harvard University and the Trump administration have faced off in a Boston court over the decision to strip the university of over $2 billion in federal funding. The administration claims the cuts are necessary to combat antisemitism on campus, an argument the presiding judge appeared skeptical of, calling it 'mind-boggling.' Harvard's attorneys argued the move was an attempt to control the university and would harm vital public research into medicine, space, and AI. The case is being closely watched and is part of a wider conflict between the administration and the university.</p>

          <p>In a strongly worded joint statement, the United Kingdom and 27 other countries have called for an immediate end to the war in Gaza, asserting that civilian suffering has 'reached new depths.' The declaration condemns Israel's aid delivery model as dangerous and criticizes the 'inhumane killing of civilians' seeking food and water. The statement follows numerous deadly incidents at aid distribution points and growing reports of malnutrition and starvation from the UN and other agencies. Israel's foreign ministry rejected the statement, claiming it is 'disconnected from reality' and sends the wrong message to Hamas.</p>

The protesters condemned the Trump administration and Texas officials for defunding key weather and disaster agencies like NOAA and for failing to address the climate crisis.

The players, who opted out of their last agreement, are negotiating for a better revenue-sharing model, higher salaries, and improved benefits. A key sticking point is the current model, where players receive just over 9% of league revenue, compared to the roughly 50/50 split in the NBA. With the WNBA's rapid growth in viewership and revenue, players are advocating for a salary structure that reflects their contribution to the league's success. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from San Jose State University reveals a staggering level of economic inequality in Silicon Valley, where just nine households now control 15% of the region's total wealth. The 2025 'Silicon Valley Pain Index' shows that the wealth gap in the tech hub has widened at double the national rate over the past decade. While the nine wealthiest households saw their collective wealth increase by $136 billion in the last year, 110,000 households reported having little to no assets. The report also highlights the extreme cost of living, with San Jose ranked among the world's most unaffordable cities. (not investment advice)</p>

Hernandez confessed in 2012 to luring the boy into a convenience store basement and choking him, though his lawyers argued the confession was false due to mental illness.

This results in almost the same monthly payment for either option over a 10 or 15-year term. However, a key difference is that HELOC rates are variable and can change, while home equity loan rates are fixed, offering more long-term payment stability. (not investment advice)</p>
