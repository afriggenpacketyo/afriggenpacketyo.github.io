          <p>Rabbi Pinchas Taylor of the American Faith Coalition paid tribute to the late Charlie Kirk, highlighting his deep faith and unwavering support for the Jewish people and Israel. In his remarks, Taylor described Kirk not just as a political commentator but as a man of conviction who stood against antisemitism and acted as a voice of reason within his political circles. The tribute contextualizes Kirk's legacy as a bridge-builder between communities, guided by Judeo-Christian values, ahead of a large memorial service.</p>

          <p>A memorial service for political commentator Charlie Kirk is expected to draw over 100,000 mourners to State Farm Stadium in Arizona, with security levels comparable to a Super Bowl. The event will feature remarks from high-profile figures, including President Donald Trump, who praised Kirk as a "great man" with a tremendous influence on youth. The Department of Homeland Security has designated the memorial as a top-level special security event, reflecting the massive scale of the gathering to honor his legacy.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team defeated Ireland by six wickets in the third T20 match, securing a 2-0 victory in the first-ever T20 series between the two nations. Jordan Cox, who was a late addition to the squad, played a pivotal role with a half-century knock of 55 runs, guiding England to their target of 155 with 17 balls to spare. England's spin bowlers were also effective, taking six of the eight Irish wickets to restrict the hosts' total.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump appeared to dismiss the severity of new Pentagon restrictions on journalists, stating, "Nothing stops reporters." The new directive from the Department of War requires journalists to pledge not to disclose unauthorized information or risk losing their press credentials. Press freedom advocates have fiercely criticized the move, calling it a direct assault on independent journalism and an unconstitutional prior restraint on publication, while the administration defends it as a necessary security measure.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan initiated a one-day trial banning traffic from a major section of Oxford Street, calling it the start of a "fight back to rescue this street." The event is a precursor to a potential permanent pedestrianization aimed at increasing footfall and boosting business for one of the world's busiest shopping areas. While many pedestrians welcomed the car-free environment, concerns remain over accessibility for those with mobility issues and the displacement of traffic to smaller residential streets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to aging and well-being expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can physically accelerate the aging process by damaging telomeres, the protective caps at the ends of our chromosomes. This cellular damage can be counteracted by adopting an "anti-inflammatory lifestyle" focused on stress management. Epel recommends incorporating small, sustainable habits like eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short daily breaks for meditation, and prioritizing deep rest through activities such as yoga or breathwork to promote longevity.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats in the UK are reconsidering their long-held opposition to a national identity card system, a policy they were instrumental in scrapping back in 2010. Party leader Sir Ed Davey suggested that "times have changed" and that a modern digital ID system could empower individuals and improve access to public services, citing Estonia's system as a positive example. This potential policy shift comes as the opposition Labour Party is reportedly preparing to announce its support for a similar digital ID scheme.</p>

          <p>A child development expert suggests that raising children with exceptional social skills goes beyond teaching simple manners; it's rooted in modeling emotional intelligence at home. Key practices include openly discussing feelings, demonstrating empathy in daily interactions, and validating a child's emotions to build their confidence.

          <p>With annual fees for premium travel credit cards on the rise, a credit expert from The Points Guy offers advice on maximizing rewards. He argues that consumers should avoid two common mistakes: choosing no-fee cards, which generally offer poor rewards, and hoarding points, which can be devalued by the issuer at any time. Instead, users should select cards that match their spending habits and periodically call their card company's retention department to negotiate for offers that can offset the annual fee.

          <p>The recent wave of diplomatic recognition for a Palestinian state by Western nations brings a critical challenge into sharp focus: the absence of a unified and recognized leadership to govern it. Palestinian politics have been deeply fractured for nearly two decades between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza, with no national elections held since 2006. This analysis suggests that while symbolic recognition is a significant step, the practical implementation of statehood is severely hampered by these internal political divisions.</p>
