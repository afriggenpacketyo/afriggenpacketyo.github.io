        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A panel has determined that two Metropolitan Police officers committed gross misconduct during the strip-search of a 15-year-old black girl, known as Child Q, at her east London school in 2020. The officers wrongly suspected her of possessing cannabis and forced her to expose her intimate parts while she was menstruating and without an appropriate adult present. The panel noted that black schoolchildren are often treated as older and less vulnerable than their white peers, though it did not find that race was a factor in this specific incident. The Met Police has apologized for the trauma caused to Child Q and her family and acknowledged organizational failings in the training and oversight of strip-searches. The force stated that the incident has been a catalyst for change, leading to improvements in processes and a reduction in similar searches. </p>

          <p>Recent research is casting doubt on the reasoning capabilities of AI models, which were expected to be the next leap in artificial intelligence. Apple researchers found that these models struggle with complex problems and lack generalizability, potentially just memorizing patterns instead of generating new solutions. Experts like Ali Ghodsi of Databricks highlight the models' limitations in common sense tasks, while Salesforce points out the gap between current capabilities and real-world enterprise demand. While Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang suggests a need for increased computation due to agentic AI, others argue that Apple's warnings may be influenced by their own AI setbacks. </p>

          <p>Togo's opposition is planning further rallies against the Gnassingbe dynasty, as many Togolese, especially young people, reject the new political structure that could allow President Faure Gnassingbe to remain in power indefinitely. Protests were triggered by a hike in electricity prices and target the Gnassingbe family, which has been in power for 60 years. Previous protests have been met with heavy-handed police responses, including arrests and the use of tear gas. The recent change in government systems has raised concerns about democracy in the region, particularly given the military coups in neighboring West African nations.</p>

Additionally, Japan chipmaker Renesas postponed achieving its 2030 sales goal by five years due to competition from Chinese rivals.

          <p>The US economy contracted more than previously estimated in the first quarter of 2025, with real gross domestic product falling by 0.5%, according to the Commerce Department. The decline primarily reflects downward revisions to consumer spending and exports, partly affected by a downward revision to imports. An import surge triggered by tariffs contributed to businesses stockpiling goods, especially from China. Economists expect a bounce back in the second quarter, but uncertainty remains due to approaching deadlines for higher tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A majority of CFOs surveyed by CNBC believe that President Trump's tax cut bill will pass despite significant changes and divisions in Congress. The CFOs expect the corporate tax breaks temporarily made law by Trump's 2017 tax act to remain in place. Concerns about the deficit persist, but the desire to make the corporate tax cuts permanent is a driving factor. The survey also reveals that CFOs expect bond yields to remain elevated and anticipate a recession either in the second half of the year or in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

Composer Andrew Lloyd Weber says Zegler's performance is amazing, and the unconventional staging technique is quintessential Lloyd and Lloyd Webber.

Redwood has served as president of Children's Health Defense, an anti-vaccine organization founded by Kennedy, and has attributed her son's autism to mercury exposure from vaccines. The appointment has raised concerns among health experts, who note that decades of research have found no link between autism and vaccines or any vaccine preservative, including thimerosal.

Backed by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mamdani combined door-knocking with social media, contrasting with Cuomo's campaign focused on stage-managed events. Mamdani will be the Democratic nominee in the mayoral election and is favored to win, which would make him New York’s first Muslim mayor.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts recommend considering supplemental life insurance if your basic workplace policy has a low death benefit, especially if your family financially depends on you. Younger families, in particular, may need supplemental life insurance because workplace group life insurance is often based on a multiple of your salary. Major life events are an opportunity to reevaluate your coverage, and consider the purpose of your life insurance, including income replacement, debt payoff, and college funding. Term insurance is usually the best choice for most people as it is affordable and provides substantial coverage during high-need years.</p>
