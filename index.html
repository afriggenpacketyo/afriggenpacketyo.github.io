        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated that the "punishment" of Israel would persist, following reported Israeli attacks on Iranian cities. This statement comes after President Trump announced that the United States had struck three nuclear sites in Iran, using "bunker buster" bombs. General Dan Caine indicated that a full battle damage assessment was still pending, even as Trump claimed monumental damage to all nuclear sites in Iran. The escalating tensions suggest a continued volatile situation in the region, with potential for further conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran's parliament has reportedly approved the closure of the Strait of Hormuz following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, a move that could alienate neighbors and trade partners. Experts suggest this decision, which now rests with the country's national security council, carries significant risks for Iran, particularly concerning its oil exports to Asia, especially China. While the Joint Maritime Information Center indicates no current threats to commercial shipping, potential disruptions could lead to higher energy prices and geopolitical tensions. Disrupting supplies will also "put a target" on the country's own oil production, export infrastructure, and regime at a time when there is little reason to doubt U.S. and Israeli resolve in being 'trigger-happy.'"</p>

The inquiry will focus on the worst-performing maternity and neonatal services in the country, including those in Leeds, Sussex, Gloucester, and Mid and South Essex. Streeting met with parents who lost babies and aims to ensure these families receive the truth and accountability they deserve.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that climate change is exacerbating sleep apnea, with the likelihood of sleep apnea problems increasing by almost 50% when temperatures rise to 80 degrees Fahrenheit or warmer. Severe cases of sleep apnea, where breathing stops more than 30 times per hour, also increase by 40%. The study, which analyzed sleep data from over 125,000 people across 41 countries, found that as temperatures climb, sleep apnea worsens. The researchers suggest that controlling sleep environments with cooling can help, but express concern for those without access to air conditioning.</p>

          <p>The government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting growth, with a central component being lower energy costs for businesses. The plan includes exempting over 7,000 UK businesses from some green energy levies, potentially slashing energy bills by up to 25%. A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to £40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for manufacturing firms. The strategy also aims to upskill Britons, attract global talent, streamline planning processes, and boost research and development spending, focusing on eight specific sectors where the UK is already strong.

          <p>Chinese state media is urging Beijing to proactively adapt to the trend of stablecoins by developing yuan-backed versions to promote the currency's global use. The Securities Times argues that while unregulated stablecoins could harm the financial system, forgoing this efficient settlement tool could mean missing an opportunity for the yuan. Experts believe stablecoins offer unique advantages as an emerging payment method, reducing capital and time costs for cross-border transactions. The article suggests that regulating stablecoins would facilitate the internationalization of the yuan.</p>

          <p>President Trump's military strike on Iran signals a shift from his role as a showman to a more authoritarian figure, according to an analysis of the situation. The strike, which involved significant U.S. military intervention, was cheered by Israel and Republican hawks but alarmed some in his base. Democrats criticized the action as a violation of the constitution and a disregard for public opinion. The move highlights Trump's increasing use of military force and disregard for democratic norms.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to send up to 30,000 migrants to Guantánamo Bay has resulted in far fewer transfers than initially stated, with approximately 500 migrants sent to the facility. The operation has cost over $40 million in the first two months, excluding transportation, with a high daily cost per migrant. While the administration claims the site is used for "staging for final removal," critics argue that the transfers are intended to scare migrants into self-deportation.

          <p>President Trump is implementing changes to reshape the civil service, making it easier to fire federal workers and emphasizing loyalty to his agenda. A proposed rule would allow the administration to move civil servants into a new category of employees who serve at the pleasure of the president.

          <p>The U.S. dollar surged in early trading following U.S. military strikes on Iran, benefiting from its safe-haven status, but analysts predict the gains may be temporary. Concerns over U.S. fiscal policy, trade wars, and weakening international demand for U.S. assets are expected to regain focus once the immediate crisis-driven demand fades. While fears of Iran retaliating, such as by closing the Strait of Hormuz, contributed to the dollar's initial strength, the U.S. Treasury market's muted reaction suggests a more complex situation.

Examples from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya illustrate the potential for power vacuums, violence, and instability following attempted regime change.
