          <p>A 20-year-old Palestinian-American man from Tampa, Florida, was beaten to death in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. His family alleges he was attacked by Israeli settlers while protecting his family's land and that an ambulance was blocked from reaching him for hours. The U.S. State Department has confirmed the death of a citizen and is providing consular assistance, but has referred the investigation to Israeli authorities. The victim's family is demanding a U.S.-led investigation into the incident, which occurred amid heightened tensions and violence in the region.</p>

          <p>Police across the United Kingdom have arrested 71 individuals at demonstrations protesting the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The arrests in London, Cardiff, and Manchester were primarily for showing support for the banned group, which is now a criminal offense under the Terrorism Act. The proscription followed an incident where activists damaged military aircraft, which the group claimed responsibility for. Critics, including the group's legal counsel, argue that banning the organization is an authoritarian misuse of power, while the government maintains the group's activities have escalated in severity.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has terminated the employment of at least 20 prosecutors and support staff who were involved in former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into President Donald Trump. According to sources, the fired individuals include not only prosecutors but also support personnel and U.S. marshals identified by a departmental working group. This action follows the earlier ousting of most senior prosecutors associated with the probes. The move has reportedly caused significant concern among the Justice Department's career employees, reminiscent of previous purges during the Trump presidency.</p>

          <p>A lightning-sparked wildfire, named the White Sage Fire, has grown to over 19,000 acres near Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park, forcing the evacuation of the North Rim and nearby communities. The fire, which remains 0% contained, is being fueled by high temperatures, strong winds, and dry conditions, creating a dangerous situation. A second nearby blaze, the Dragon Bravo Fire, has also intensified, prompting immediate evacuation orders for all North Rim residents. Officials have issued an extreme heat warning and advised against hiking after a 67-year-old hiker died in the canyon earlier in the week.</p>

An updated "Frequently Asked Questions" page on the Fed's website addresses claims made by OMB Director Russell Vought, clarifying that no new VIP dining rooms are being built and explaining that cost overruns were due to unforeseen conditions like asbestos. This move is seen as the central bank pushing back against an escalating campaign by President Trump, who has accused Chairman Jerome Powell of mismanaging the institution.

          <p>The UK's third heatwave of the year reached its peak, with temperatures hitting 33C (91.4F) in Ross on Wye. The widespread heat resulted in Scotland recording its warmest day of the year and Northern Ireland its hottest in nearly three years. The conditions have led to the implementation of hosepipe bans for millions in England and wildfire warnings across Scotland. The heat also impacted travel and sporting events, with amber heat health alerts in effect for southern England, signifying a likely increase in mortality and demand for health services.</p>

          <h2>Satirical Article Lampoons Dan Bongino's Stance on FBI and Epstein Conspiracy Theories</h2>

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic humorously portrays former FBI agent Dan Bongino as resigning from a fictional high-level FBI post to "solve" the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy. The piece mockingly suggests that the only way to uncover the truth is from a podcast studio basement, far from any actual government intelligence. It satirizes the belief that those outside of government have a clearer view of its inner workings than those in leadership positions. The article uses hyperbole to critique conspiracy-minded thinking and the political discourse surrounding the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Texas following severe floods, President Trump responded critically to a reporter who asked about families upset over delayed flood warnings. When questioned about what he would say to families who believe lives could have been saved with timely alerts, Trump called it an "evil" question. He praised the response efforts as "heroism" and stated that it is easy to second-guess actions during an unprecedented event. The exchange has drawn significant attention online, with many criticizing the president's defensive reaction to a question raised on behalf of victims' families.</p>

          <p>Two fathers in England are seeking a judicial review of government guidance on mobile phones in schools, aiming to implement a complete ban on smartphones for students. The campaigners argue that the current policy, which lets headteachers decide, is unlawful and fails to protect children from harmful content, cyberbullying, and sexual harassment. They have sent a formal letter to the Education Secretary, signaling their intent to take legal action. The Department for Education responded that schools already have the power to ban phones and that the Online Safety Act provides additional protections.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report into the crash of Air India Flight 171 reveals a puzzling cockpit event just seconds after takeoff. Both of the Boeing 787's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position, starving the engines of fuel. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he activated the cut-off, with the other denying he did so. While the switches were quickly returned to normal, the aircraft lost power and crashed, killing 260 people. Investigators are now focused on why the switches, designed to prevent accidental use, were activated.</p>

This advice encourages a long-term holding strategy rather than short-term trading of the chipmaker's stock. The article notes Nvidia's significant growth, driven by the AI boom, despite geopolitical tensions and U.S. export restrictions on its products to China. The company's continued strong performance and demand from other regions are highlighted as key factors in its sustained rally. (not investment advice)</p>
