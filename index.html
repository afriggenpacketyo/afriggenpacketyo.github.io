          <p>Shares for department store Kohl's saw a dramatic surge of over 30% in volatile trading, reminiscent of past meme stock rallies. The spike occurred without any clear corporate news, driven by chatter on social media platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets, which highlighted the stock's high short interest. Analysts caution that the surge appears disconnected from the company's weak business fundamentals, which include falling sales and leadership instability, drawing parallels to the previous speculative frenzy around Bed Bath and Beyond.

          <p>A passenger on a SkyWest flight described the terrifying moment the aircraft made a sharp, roller-coaster-like turn to avoid a B-52 bomber near Minot, North Dakota. The bomber was conducting a pre-approved flyover for the state fair, but air traffic control allegedly failed to inform the commercial flight of its presence. The SkyWest pilot, who was praised for his quick reaction, informed passengers of the near-miss after safely landing. The Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating the incident to determine how close the two planes came to a collision.</p>

          <p>An initial investigation into a fatal Jeju Air crash in South Korea has suggested pilot error, finding that the pilots shut down the less-damaged engine after both sustained bird strikes. The finding has prompted outrage from victims' families and pilots' unions, who accuse authorities of prematurely blaming the deceased pilots to deflect from other potential causes, such as a poorly designed concrete structure at the airport. With all 181 people on board killed, critics are demanding the release of all flight recorder data and a more thorough investigation into all contributing factors.</p>

          <p>A 65-year-old British man, Howard Phillips, has been found guilty of attempting to spy for Russia under the UK's National Security Act. Phillips offered to provide personal information about a former defense secretary to individuals he believed were Russian intelligence agents, who were actually undercover British officers. Prosecutors stated he was motivated by financial gain and was brazen in his efforts, which included applying for a job with UK Border Force to gain access to sensitive information. He now awaits sentencing for his actions.</p>

          <p>President Trump continued his public criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "numbskull" for keeping interest rates high, but indicated he would not attempt to fire him. Trump stated that Powell's term would be over in eight months anyway, seemingly backing away from previous suggestions that he might try to remove the central bank leader. The comments come amid ongoing speculation about Powell's job security and legal questions over a president's authority to fire a Fed chair. The White House has also questioned a multi-billion dollar renovation project at the Federal Reserve.</p>

While the city is offering a permit program and some funds to help a fraction of these residents find housing, critics argue the plan is cruel and will displace vulnerable families without providing nearly enough alternative shelter options.</p>

          <h2>Tucker Carlson's Criticism of Epstein File Handling Creates Rift with Trump</h2>

          <p>Conservative media personality Tucker Carlson is creating a notable rift within the MAGA movement by persistently criticizing the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein controversy. While President Trump has dismissed the issue, Carlson has used it to challenge the administration from the right, arguing that the government's dismissive attitude is alienating its base. This divergence highlights a tricky dilemma for pro-Trump media figures and opens a fissure in what has been a largely unified political movement, with Carlson questioning the establishment on multiple fronts.</p>

          <p>The European Union has expressed serious concern after the Ukrainian parliament voted to strip two key anti-corruption bodies of their independence. The move places the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO) under the direct supervision of the Prosecutor General. An EU commissioner warned that dismantling these safeguards is a "serious step back" and emphasized that the independence of these agencies is essential for Ukraine's path toward EU membership, a critical goal for the war-torn nation.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has announced that he will meet with his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm next week to continue high-level trade talks. This marks the third round of such discussions, signaling a potential extension of the current pause on imposing new tariffs on each other. The continued engagement suggests a thaw in trade relations between the world's two largest economies. Both sides have recently expressed optimism, with Beijing noting that "new progress" has been made in resolving economic and trade concerns.</p>

          <p>Food industry giants like General Mills, PepsiCo, and Kraft Heinz are increasingly focusing on high-protein products to meet growing consumer demand. Companies are launching new protein-fortified lines and highlighting the protein content in existing products, a trend fueled by fitness culture and users of new medical weight-loss drugs. The protein snack market is reportedly growing three times faster than the overall snacking industry. This shift reflects a significant trend in consumer preferences toward more functional and health-conscious food options.</p>

          <p>For the first time, generative AI models from Google and OpenAI have achieved gold-medal level scores at the prestigious International Mathematical Olympiad. While five human contestants achieved perfect scores, the AI's ability to solve five out of six complex problems marks a significant milestone in the development of advanced reasoning capabilities. The rapid improvement of these models, which solved the problems within the official time limit, suggests that AI is quickly catching up to top human intellect in complex problem-solving domains. The progress is seen as an exciting development by competition organizers.</p>

          <p>An emergency room doctor argues in this article that President Trump's recently signed bill, which cuts an estimated $1 trillion from Medicaid over ten years, will be a disaster for the nation's emergency care system. The legislation is expected to leave millions uninsured, forcing them to rely on ERs for care and increasing the burden of uncompensated costs on already-strained hospitals. The author warns this will lead to more service cuts and hospital closures, particularly in rural areas, ultimately endangering the health of both uninsured and insured Americans.</p>

          <p>Students in the Los Angeles Unified School District have achieved a "new high watermark" in academic performance, with math and English scores rising for the second consecutive year. The gains have fully erased pandemic-era learning losses and surpassed pre-2020 achievement levels across all tested grades. While significant achievement gaps persist for Black and Latino students, the across-the-board improvement is seen as strong evidence of effective instructional strategies and successful use of recovery funds in the nation's second-largest school system.</p>

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated he is "appalled and sickened" by the suffering of civilians in Gaza, describing the situation as "grotesque." His comments followed an international statement, co-signed by the UK and 27 other nations, that accused Israel of "drip feeding" aid and condemned the killing of over 800 Palestinians seeking food and water. Lammy called Israel's rejection of the statement "hugely disappointing" and warned that the UK could take further action if Israel does not change its conduct in the war.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Warns Trump's SNAP Cuts Will Shift Costs to States and Increase Hunger</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's new legislation is set to cut $186 billion in federal spending for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) over the next decade, shifting the financial burden to individual states. According to this analysis, the move will force states to either absorb massive costs or scale back benefits, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating over 3 million Americans will likely lose their food assistance. This policy change threatens to dismantle a key federal safety net and significantly increase food insecurity across the country.</p>
