          <p>Nathan Gill, the former leader of Reform UK in Wales, has admitted to accepting money to make pro-Russian statements regarding Ukraine while serving in the European Parliament. The charges cover multiple instances between 2018 and 2019 where he allegedly received payments from a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician for his advocacy. Gill now faces a probable jail sentence following his guilty pleas, in a case that highlights the ongoing concerns about malign foreign influence within European political institutions.</p>

          <p>This article examines the increasing phenomenon of shooters leaving messages on shell casings and firearms, a trend observed in several recent high-profile attacks. Experts characterize this as a "performative" act intended to communicate with specific online communities and capture media attention, tracing its modern prominence to the 2019 Christchurch shooting. This practice introduces a disturbing element for both investigators and the families of victims, who are left to interpret these often obscure, internet-native references.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan proposal, the Claiming Age Clarity Act, seeks to make Social Security benefits more understandable by revising key terminology. Under the bill, "early eligibility age" (62) would be renamed "minimum benefit age," while "full retirement age" (67) would become "standard benefit age" to more accurately reflect the financial consequences of claiming benefits at different times. The initiative aims to help Americans make better-informed decisions for their retirement, addressing widespread confusion about benefit qualifications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, maintained a 2.9% annual rate in August, aligning with economists' forecasts. The headline PCE rate, which includes volatile food and energy costs, edged up slightly to 2.7%. These figures are not expected to change the central bank's current trajectory, as policymakers are still signaling potential interest rate reductions before the year concludes, suggesting a stable economic outlook.

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the ROAD to Housing Act, is being viewed as a potentially impactful federal effort to address the U.S. housing crisis. The legislation promotes the creation of model zoning codes to facilitate denser construction and offers financial incentives to municipalities that successfully increase their housing supply. While its immediate effects may be modest, some policy experts believe it establishes a foundation for a "Right-to-Build Zone" strategy, empowering cities to bypass local opposition and streamline development.</p>

          <p>The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the body that organizes the Eurovision Song Contest, has announced it will conduct a vote among its 68 member nations to decide on Israel's participation in the 2026 competition. This decision comes in response to significant controversy and calls for Israel's exclusion due to the ongoing war in Gaza. Several national broadcasters have threatened to withdraw from the contest if Israel is allowed to remain, and a simple majority vote at the November general assembly will determine the outcome.</p>

          <p>A recent Goldman Sachs survey of 245 global family offices indicates a strong preference for investing in the artificial intelligence boom through public equities and ETFs, rather than through direct investments in private startups or venture capital funds. More than half of these ultra-wealthy investment firms reported gaining their AI exposure via public markets, compared to only a quarter investing directly in private AI ventures. This conservative approach is reportedly driven by greater confidence in the valuations of public companies and the extensive AI involvement of major tech stocks. (not investment advice)</p>
