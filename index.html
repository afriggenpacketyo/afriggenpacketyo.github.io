          <p>In a promotional segment for WWE's SummerSlam, wrestler John Cena appeared to abandon his recent villainous character. He addressed his upcoming championship match against Cody Rhodes, expressing regret for his recent actions and alignment with The Rock and Travis Scott. Cena delivered a speech reminiscent of his long-standing "hustle, loyalty, respect" persona, subtly criticizing his former partners for leaving him to face the consequences of their "shocking TV" angle. The segment sets the stage for a high-stakes street fight, with Cena vowing to defend his title as the "greatest of all time."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have identified a connection between the sun's magnetic cycle and precipitation patterns in China, potentially explaining the recent trend of "south drought and north flooding." A study published in the Journal of Climate suggests that decadal changes in solar activity influence the positioning of the monsoon rain belt over the country. This finding could be crucial for improving long-term climate predictions, particularly for managing flood seasons and mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events. The study highlights the significant role solar phenomena can play in regional climate systems.</p>

          <p>Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was expected to attend a $25 million fundraiser for a pro-Trump super PAC, hosted at the former president's New Jersey golf club. This attendance occurred just one day after Trump sent letters to major pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, demanding they lower U.S. drug prices to match rates in other countries. The dynamic highlights the complex relationship between the pharmaceutical industry and the administration, which has both partnered with companies on key initiatives and publicly criticized them over high costs. The event underscores ongoing debates about drug pricing and corporate influence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Seal Beach, California, are reporting a significant rise in stingray-related injuries, increasing from an average of one per day to as many as 15 recently. This uptick is attributed to calm, warm waters drawing the stingrays closer to shore, coinciding with hot weather and more beachgoers. A specific area known as "ray bay" is a hotspot due to warmer water from a nearby power plant. To avoid stings, officials advise shuffling feet in the sand to alert the animals, and if stung, the recommended treatment is soaking the wound in hot water.</p>

The data, cited from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, projects a loss of nearly half a million jobs by 2035. The analysis contradicts the administration's claims of consumer savings, suggesting that reduced demand for electric and fuel-efficient vehicles would increase overall gasoline consumption and prices for all drivers. This internal assessment raises questions about the economic consequences of the proposed deregulation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended the administration's decision to fire the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, following a disappointing July jobs report. Greer stated that the president has "real concerns" about the reliability and accuracy of federal economic data, citing large revisions in previous months' figures. The firing, which came after Mr. Trump claimed the numbers were "RIGGED," drew criticism for potentially undermining the credibility of nonpartisan federal statistics. Greer argued that the president has the authority to choose who serves in the executive branch and that businesses need more reliable data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's executive order to increase tariffs on imports is expected to raise consumer prices and create prolonged uncertainty for businesses, according to trade experts. The new duties, which set a baseline tariff of at least 15% for most countries, could make everyday goods like clothing, furniture, and cars more expensive. An analysis from the National Taxpayers Union estimates the tariffs could cost the average American family over $2,000 per year. While the administration argues the policy will revive U.S. manufacturing, economists warn of potential inflation, sluggish growth, and supply-chain disruptions. (not investment advice)</p>

Psychiatrists report that the constant threat of being hunted by these ubiquitous and deadly drones creates a state of perpetual tension that persists even after leaving the battlefield.

          <p>President Donald Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), following a jobs report that showed weaker-than-expected hiring and large downward revisions for previous months. Trump accused the commissioner of manipulating data for political reasons, a claim made without evidence. The move shocked economists and policymakers, who warned that such interference threatens the integrity of essential, non-partisan economic data relied upon by markets and businesses. The firing coincided with a stock market drop as the administration moved forward with plans for widespread tariff hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A North Korean defector has provided a rare account of how the regime generates hundreds of millions of dollars annually by sending thousands of IT workers abroad. The defector, identified as Jin-su, explained how he used fake identities to secure remote work with Western companies, with up to 85% of his earnings sent back to North Korea. This clandestine operation, which boomed during the pandemic, serves as a vital source of foreign currency for the sanctioned nation. The workers are closely monitored and operate in teams, often impersonating Westerners to secure higher-paying jobs in the US and Europe.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging an "unconstitutional pressure campaign" to stop hospitals from providing gender-affirming care to minors. The suit argues the administration is using threats of criminal prosecution and investigations to create a de facto national ban on such care, even without a specific federal law. This has created an atmosphere of fear, leading several prominent children's hospitals to close their gender-affirming care clinics. The administration contends it has the authority to stop treatments it describes as harmful.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a landmark case, a Florida jury has found Tesla partially liable for a 2019 crash that killed a pedestrian and severely injured another while the vehicle's Autopilot software was engaged. The plaintiffs argued the driver-assistance software should have alerted the driver and applied the brakes, but Tesla maintained the driver was at fault for being distracted. The verdict, which Tesla has vowed to appeal, requires the company to pay up to $243 million in damages. This is a significant setback for the automaker and could encourage more legal action over the capabilities and safety of its self-driving technology.</p>

          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has issued a ruling that closes off a major avenue for millions of motorists to claim compensation over hidden commissions in car finance deals. The court did not uphold a previous finding that secret commission payments were inherently unlawful. However, the judgment left open the possibility for claims based on unfairly large commissions, meaning lenders could still face a reduced but significant compensation bill estimated between £5 billion and £13 billion. The decision was described as a "bitter pill to swallow" by one of the claimants in the landmark case.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made several moves at the trade deadline to strengthen their roster, acquiring right-handed relievers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase and outfielder Alex Call. Manager Dave Roberts stated these additions are intended to "raise the floor" for the first-place team. Stewart, a former Dodger, returns as a high-leverage relief option, while the 6-foot-10 Gervase adds a unique look from the bullpen. The front office emphasized that the team's biggest improvements are expected to come from its existing, underperforming stars. The team also hopes for the late-season return of injured pitcher Roki Sasaki.</p>

Gillie Jenkinson, who specializes in helping cult survivors, notes that red flags include "love bombing," where abusers use intense affection to gain control, and providing overly simplistic answers to complex life problems. Other warning signs are the use of insider language, restricting access to outside information, and creating a high barrier to exit. Jenkinson appeared in a BBC documentary on the Jesus Army cult and advocates for more specialized mental health support for those who leave such groups.</p>

          <p>At an internal town hall meeting, social media giant ByteDance revealed that the median service length for its current employees is 2.9 years. The company, which owns TikTok and its Chinese version Douyin, also stated that about half of its 120,000-person workforce has been with the firm for more than three years. This disclosure appears to counter online speculation that the company had a much higher turnover rate. These figures suggest ByteDance is a relatively stable employer within China's competitive tech industry, which is known for its demanding work culture, despite the company officially abandoning its "996" schedule in 2021.</p>

After Taylor Kia of Lima repossessed her car due to a loan issue, Tiah McCreary discovered the dealership had let its business name registration with the state lapse. She promptly registered the name "Taylor Kia of Lima" for herself and then sued the dealership for, among other things, using a name that legally belonged to her.
