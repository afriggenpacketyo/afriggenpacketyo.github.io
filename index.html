          <p>An Iranian official has cautioned that any U.S. involvement in the ongoing conflict with Israel could escalate into a widespread war, as the exchange of missile strikes intensifies between the two nations. Israel has conducted multiple waves of strikes, targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, while Iran has retaliated with missile launches towards Israeli cities. The U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that two Iranian centrifuge production facilities were hit during the Israeli operation. President Trump issued a stern warning to Iran, demanding unconditional surrender, while Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei rejected the ultimatum and warned the U.S. against military intervention. </p>

          <p>A profile of Desi Arnaz highlights his pivotal role in shaping the television industry, beyond his on-screen persona in "I Love Lucy." Arnaz and his colleagues made the crucial decision to film the show on 35mm film, enabling reruns and syndication, thus revolutionizing television economics. The show was initially created to salvage his marriage with Lucille Ball, as her career in movies was fading, and she wanted to work with him in Los Angeles. Despite initial concerns from CBS, Arnaz's insistence on owning the rights to the show paid off, making Desilu a television production powerhouse. </p>

          <p>This article presents an excerpt from Todd S. Purdum's biography of Desi Arnaz, emphasizing his transformative influence on television. While Lucille Ball provided the artistic spark for "I Love Lucy," Arnaz's business acumen drove its success and revolutionized the industry. Arnaz assembled a team of Hollywood technicians to film the show in front of a live audience with three cameras, a method that became standard. His decision to preserve episodes on film led to reruns and syndication, shifting the center of television production from New York to Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Miami has held Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier in contempt of court for defying a court order blocking the enforcement of a new immigration law. Uthmeier instructed state law enforcement to continue making arrests under the law, even after a temporary restraining order was issued. The judge cited Uthmeier's defiance and his public boasts about ignoring the court order, ordering him to file bi-weekly reports on any further arrests made in defiance of the restraining order. This ruling highlights the escalating tensions between right-wing politicians and the courts over immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned the U.S. that any military intervention in the conflict with Israel would result in "irreparable damage." Khamenei's statement follows President Trump's warning to Iran, demanding "unconditional surrender." Tensions have escalated since Israel's attack on Iran's nuclear program, with ongoing exchanges of missile fire. Amid these tensions, Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz commented that Israel is doing "the dirty work" for the Western world, highlighting the complex geopolitical dynamics at play.</p>
