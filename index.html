          <p>Donald Trump's 10% tariff on imports has taken effect, impacting numerous countries and shaking global markets. Higher tariffs are slated for larger trading partners, including the EU and China. Keir Starmer is consulting with foreign leaders to address the potential trade war, while Canada vows to stand firm against the US measures. Trump's announcement caused a significant stock market decline, wiping out trillions in value and prompting investors to seek safer investments. Kelly Ann Shaw, a former White House trade advisor, anticipates tariff negotiations and called the shift a "seismic" change to global trade.</p>

          <p>China's Foreign Ministry responded to the U.S.'s new tariffs by stating that "the market has spoken," urging the White House to engage in "equal-footed consultation" to de-escalate the trade war. This comes after U.S. stock markets experienced a sharp decline for the second consecutive day, mirroring a global rout. China's Finance Ministry announced a 34% tariff on all goods imported from the U.S., effective April 10, further intensifying investor fears of inflation, recession, and risks to global economic growth. The Chinese spokesperson emphasized that the trade war initiated by the U.S. is "unprovoked and unjustified."</p>

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler criticizes Donald Trump for allegedly exploiting the fight against antisemitism to exert control over universities. Nadler accuses Trump of not genuinely caring about antisemitism and instead using it to justify attacks on institutions like Columbia and Harvard. He points to the suspension of research grants to Princeton and reviews of federal contracts to Harvard as examples of this. Nadler warns against restricting free speech on campuses, arguing it would harm Jewish people, and criticizes the IHRA definition of antisemitism for conflating anti-Israel sentiment with antisemitism.</p>

          <p>Steven Greenhouse argues that Donald Trump's new tariffs, driven by impulsiveness and ignorance, risk causing serious damage to the US and global economies. Economists predict a potential recession and job losses as a result of the tariffs, which are essentially taxes on imports that could cost the average American family thousands of dollars annually. The tariffs are seen as a blunderbuss approach, hitting consumers and industries alike, and could harm poorer nations dependent on exports. The article warns that Trump's actions could worsen relations with allies and strengthen China's economic position.</p>

          <p>Raising bilingual children requires consistency, exposure, and practice, but it's achievable without expensive lessons. A common myth is that learning multiple languages confuses children, but research suggests bilingualism can improve cognitive function and academic achievement. Parents can choose strategies like "one parent, one language" or designate specific times and places for using the minority language. Creating an immersive language environment at home and embracing imperfection are also key to success.</p>

          <p>A suspected Russian-run sabotage plot involving explosive parcels has been uncovered in Europe. The parcels, detonated at courier depots in Britain, Germany, and Poland, contained hidden homemade incendiary devices disguised as cosmetics and sex toys. The devices were made with readily available chemicals and pre-timed detonators. European security officials believe this is part of a "hybrid war" by Russia to destabilize countries supporting Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Sierra Leone declared a public health emergency over the synthetic drug kush, but women have been left behind in intervention efforts. Women face social factors and stigma that prevent them from accessing treatment. Despite new measures, only a small number of people, mostly men, have gone through the official rehab program. Rights groups emphasize the need for targeted support for female users, who are often vulnerable to violence and exploitation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A potential ban on TikTok in the US has been delayed for a second time due to stalled negotiations between the US and China. The delay is reportedly linked to China's reluctance to approve a deal for ByteDance to sell TikTok's US operations in response to Trump's tariffs. Trump has expressed willingness to reduce tariffs on China to facilitate the deal. The original law aimed to ban TikTok over concerns about potential Chinese government spying.</p>
