          <p>Many Ukrainian refugees who fled to the United States after the war began are facing an uncertain future as their two-year work permits are set to expire. The Trump administration has not renewed the program, leaving families who have settled in communities like DeWitt, Iowa, in limbo. Local employers, who praise the refugees as hardworking contributors to a depleted workforce, are joining advocates in calling for an extension. Without the ability to work legally, these refugees may be unable to support themselves, despite the ongoing danger in their home country.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates that lowering the recommended age for colorectal cancer screening to 45 has led to a significant increase in early-stage diagnoses. The studies show a sharp rise in both screenings and localized cancer detection among people aged 45 to 49 since the guidelines were updated. Health experts call this promising news, as finding cancer earlier improves treatment outcomes and saves lives. However, they also note that screening rates in this younger age group remain suboptimal and require further effort to increase.</p>

          <p>Dozens of Democratic legislators have left Texas to deny Republicans the quorum needed to vote on a new congressional map that would significantly favor the GOP. The move is a direct protest against what they call a partisan gerrymander encouraged by former President Trump. In response, Republican leaders, including Governor Greg Abbott, have voted to issue civil arrest warrants and threatened other legal consequences to compel the lawmakers' return. The Democrats, now in states like Illinois, have vowed to remain absent to run out the clock on the special legislative session.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner over steep downward revisions to job numbers, experts are clarifying that such adjustments are a normal part of the process. The BLS initially releases preliminary estimates and then revises them as more complete survey data becomes available from businesses and households. Former officials state this is a standard feature designed to balance timeliness with accuracy, not a sign of failure or political manipulation. They note that declining survey response rates have made the process more challenging in recent years.</p>

          <p>A group of more than a dozen House Democrats, led by Representative Ro Khanna, is urging the Trump administration to officially recognize a Palestinian state. The letter, addressed to the president and secretary of state, argues that the current tragic moment highlights the overdue need for Palestinian self-determination. This push from progressives aligns with recent pledges from allies like France and Canada but contrasts with the administration's view that such a move would reward Hamas. The letter states a viable Palestinian state would also need to fully recognize and guarantee Israel's security.</p>

          <p>Firefighters on Maui have been battling a brush fire above Ka'anapali, just a few miles north of where the catastrophic Lahaina wildfires occurred nearly two years ago. The blaze prompted the shutdown of a major highway as crews worked to control it, with the Maui County Fire Department reporting that the fire was slowly being contained. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the region's vulnerability to wildfires, which previously devastated the historic town of Lahaina, causing over 100 fatalities. Officials asked motorists to avoid the area due to heavy smoke.</p>

          <p>John Edward Bruce, a prominent Black journalist and Pan-Africanist pioneer born just before the Civil War, is finally being honored with a headstone at his unmarked grave in Yonkers, New York. Despite his international renown and association with figures like Marcus Garvey, Bruce was not wealthy and was buried without a marker in 1924. A new effort, using private and public funds, has created a black granite headstone to preserve his legacy. Advocates say it is a fitting tribute for a man who dedicated his life to ensuring Black history and culture were acknowledged.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied Sean “Diddy” Combs’s request for release on bail, ordering him to remain in custody at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center until his sentencing in October. The judge was unswayed by arguments that Combs is not a flight risk and faces threats at the facility. Although cleared of racketeering and sex trafficking, Combs was convicted on two prostitution-related charges and faces up to 10 years in prison for each count. The ruling came despite a letter of support from one of the victims in the trial.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have been instructed to stop summarily deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy, which had effectively closed the asylum system to those crossing illegally, was found to violate U.S. laws protecting people from being returned to places where they could face persecution or torture. This move reopens pathways for migrants to request humanitarian refuge, though they will likely remain detained during the process. The administration had credited the ban for a record drop in illegal border crossings.</p>

With a heat wave forecast for the southern half of the state, officials are warning of elevated fire danger and the risk of more unpredictable, plume-dominated fires.</p>

          <p>In an interview with "48 Hours," Latah County prosecutor Bill Thompson reflected on the immense pressure and emotional toll of the Bryan Kohberger case. He defended the controversial plea deal, which spared Kohberger the death penalty in exchange for guilty pleas, as the best way to ensure accountability and finality for the victims' families. Thompson stated that he believed any confession from Kohberger would have been self-serving and further victimizing. He also described the powerful evidence, including DNA on the knife sheath, that left no doubt of Kohberger's guilt for the brutal murders.</p>

          <p>California Democrats are preparing a countermove to a Republican push to redraw congressional maps in Texas. Governor Gavin Newsom stated that lawmakers will craft a ballot measure to redraw California's own districts, but it will include a "trigger" so it only goes before voters if Texas moves forward with its plan. This sets up a high-stakes political battle that could influence control of the U.S. House. The timeline is tight, as California lawmakers would need to act quickly upon returning from recess in August to qualify the measure for a special November election.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest, escalating the legal measures against him. The decision came after Bolsonaro allegedly violated the conditions of his release by addressing a political rally via a live call, which was broadcast by his allies. Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing Bolsonaro's trial for an alleged coup attempt following his 2022 election loss, ruled that he had defied a ban on using social media and engaging in political speech. The order also prohibits most visitors to his home.</p>

Survivors who returned to Korea faced stigma and poverty, while their descendants have wrestled with unexplained illnesses and genetic health issues. They continue a long and unresolved fight for recognition and justice from both Japan, which has not fully acknowledged their plight, and a Korean government that was slow to investigate.</p>

This article explains that China currently dominates the supply chain, controlling the vast majority of mining, processing, and magnet production. As a result, the U.S. and other Western nations are scrambling to diversify their sources, making developing countries with rare earth reserves the new front line in this high-stakes geopolitical contest. However, analysts note a lack of investment and technical expertise is hindering efforts to move away from Chinese supply.</p>
