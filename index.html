          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 04:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European officials are expressing growing concern over China's restrictions on the export of rare earth minerals, which are critical for many high-tech and green industries. An MEP described the situation as a "strategic chokehold" by Beijing, intended to directly impact Europe, not just as collateral damage from the US-China trade dispute. Analysts suggest that despite efforts to diversify supply chains and increase recycling, Europe will likely remain dependent on Chinese rare earths for at least another decade. The issue is a key point of tension ahead of an upcoming EU-China summit in Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's postal service regulator, Ofcom, has approved Royal Mail's plan to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays and reduce weekday deliveries to an every-other-day schedule. This reform is intended to cut costs as the volume of letter mail declines annually, making the universal service obligation financially unsustainable. While first-class letters will still be delivered six days a week, the move has drawn criticism from consumer groups and MPs who fear a decline in service reliability for essential correspondence. Royal Mail welcomed the decision, stating it reflects modern communication habits and is necessary for the service's survival.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A court in Seoul has approved a new arrest warrant for former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, four months after he was released from custody. The special prosecutor argued that Yoon posed a risk of destroying evidence related to additional charges, including obstruction of duty and abuse of power, stemming from his brief imposition of martial law in December. Yoon was previously indicted on rebellion charges after the National Assembly voted to lift the martial law decree. This re-arrest could lead to an extended period of detention as investigators pursue the new charges.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, has been subjected to a massive overnight aerial assault by Russia, involving numerous missiles and drones, resulting in at least two deaths and several injuries. Ukrainian officials reported that wreckage from the attacks hit residential buildings and started fires across the city, with eight districts affected. President Volodymyr Zelensky stated the attack included approximately 18 missiles and 400 drones, primarily targeting the capital. The assault underscores the escalating conflict and diminishing prospects for a diplomatic resolution, occurring as international partners discuss further support for Ukraine's defense.</p>

The EU is currently in a state of uncertainty, awaiting a potential trade deal with the U.S. that could mitigate the impact of new duties.

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has temporarily stopped delivering its ID.Buzz electric van to the U.S. market, citing multiple factors for the decision. According to company sources reported by Handelsblatt, the steep 27.5% tariff imposed by the Trump administration on European-built cars is a significant reason for the halt. The move is also linked to a recall notice from U.S. safety regulators concerning the van's third-row seats, which do not meet federal standards. This development comes as VW reports a nearly 7% drop in its vehicle deliveries to North America for the first half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vienna is often cited as a prime example of successful housing policy, largely due to its extensive and stable social-housing sector, which comprises about 43% of the city's housing stock. This system, which serves a wide range of income levels, results in significantly lower rent and often higher quality housing compared to the private market. The model's stability is attributed to a long-term political commitment originating from the "Red Vienna" era and continued financing through a levy on employee salaries. While the system faces challenges, such as complex allocation processes, it demonstrates that prioritizing housing as a basic need can create a more affordable and stable urban environment.</p>

The move caused a spike in U.S. copper prices, creating a significant premium over the global market.

          <p>The Chinese government is implementing new measures to address persistent youth unemployment amid a sluggish economy and intense domestic competition. The State Council announced a one-off subsidy of up to 1,500 yuan for each unemployed person aged 16 to 24 hired by a company. This incentive is available to employers who provide formal contracts and pay social insurance contributions for at least three months. Additionally, China's economic planner has allocated 10 billion yuan to expand its "work-for-relief" program, which creates jobs through labor-intensive public works projects to support vulnerable groups.

An elder from the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles shared that from July 2024 to June 2025, the Church saw unprecedented growth, with new members also attending services at higher rates. This report aligns with broader Pew Research Center findings that suggest the decline of Christianity in the U.S. may be leveling off.

          <p>The Chinese embassy in South Africa has issued a warning to its citizens about an increase in kidnappings, particularly targeting Chinese women. The advisory urges nationals to avoid going out alone and to inform others of their whereabouts, citing multiple recent incidents that threaten personal and property safety. Analysts suggest Chinese traders are being targeted due to a perception that they carry large amounts of cash and operate outside the formal banking system. This warning comes amid a general rise in kidnappings in South Africa and follows a recent fatal robbery targeting Chinese nationals.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against the state of California, arguing that its regulations on egg production are contributing to soaring egg prices nationwide. The lawsuit claims that California's anti-animal cruelty laws, which mandate more space for hens, constitute "unnecessary red tape" that illegally affects interstate commerce. The administration contends that federal law requires national uniformity in egg safety standards, which California's rules violate. This legal action is part of President Trump's broader vow to lower egg prices, a key consumer concern amid wider inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

In an upcoming speech, she will describe the rising benefits bill as a "ticking time bomb" that threatens the economy. This proposal aims to create a clear policy distinction from the Labour government, which recently scaled back its own planned welfare cuts, and from Reform UK, which opposes the two-child benefit cap. The plan would limit access to benefits like Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to British citizens, with some exceptions for those covered by international agreements.</p>

The decision comes as the central bank assesses the impact of recent government measures designed to cool Seoul's overheating housing market, which has seen prices spike and household debt expand significantly. While the economy has shown signs of slowing, the bank is focused on the risks associated with household debt, which is uniquely structured in South Korea due to its "jeonse" rental deposit system. Analysts expect rate cuts may follow later in the year if the housing market stabilizes. (not investment advice)</p>

This is the highest tariff rate threatened against any country in the recent wave of trade actions and is notable because the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Brazil.

          <p>A new report from the anti-poverty organization Oxfam reveals stark wealth inequality across Africa, stating that the continent's four wealthiest individuals possess more wealth than the poorest 50% of the population combined. The report notes that while Africa had no billionaires in 2000, it now has 23, whose collective wealth has surged by 56% in the last five years. Oxfam argues that government policies, particularly tax systems that are less progressive than the global average, are biased against the poor and allow the super-rich to accumulate more wealth. The organization warns that this extreme inequality hinders democracy and poverty reduction efforts.</p>
