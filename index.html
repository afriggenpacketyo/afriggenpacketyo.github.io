          <p>Electric grills are gaining popularity as a climate-friendly alternative to traditional propane and charcoal grills, with several manufacturers now producing full-size models capable of reaching high temperatures. Consumers are drawn to the convenience and cost-effectiveness of electric grills, as they eliminate the need for propane tanks and offer precise temperature control. Switching to electric grills, powered by increasingly cleaner energy grids, is part of a broader trend toward electrification as a key climate solution. While some chefs remain skeptical, electric grills are suitable for everyday cooking and offer a safer option in areas prone to wildfires.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has suggested that President Trump possesses the authority to impose tariffs unilaterally, citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 and a precedent from a 1970s court case. Despite this favorable view, Judge T. Kent Wetherell II transferred the lawsuit challenging Trump's tariffs to the Court of International Trade in New York. The ruling marks a symbolic victory for the Trump administration, which faces multiple legal challenges to its "Liberation Day" tariffs, with the decision hinging on the interpretation of the IEEPA and its predecessor, the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is set to implement a new Army Fitness Test (AFT) on June 1, 2025, replacing the existing Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) with updated scoring standards that emphasize combat readiness. The AFT consists of five components, including a three-repetition maximum deadlift, hand-release push-ups, sprint-drag-carry, plank, and a two-mile run. Scoring requirements are more demanding, particularly for soldiers in combat roles, and the test is designed to improve overall fitness and prepare soldiers for modern warfare. Experts suggest that while challenging, the AFT is achievable with focused training, though estimates vary on how many civilians could pass it.</p>

          <p>The head of US Space Command, General Stephen Whiting, stated that China's expanding arsenal of anti-satellite weapons is forcing Washington to accelerate its defensive measures in orbit, known as the "Golden Dome" strategy. Whiting highlighted that China's strategy includes deploying weapons in orbit, developing jamming systems, and fielding kinetic anti-satellite missiles to disrupt US military operations. The US$25 billion Golden Dome project aims to create a layered missile defense architecture to protect the US from long-range and hypersonic threats, in response to China's growing space power ambitions.</p>

          <p>A Cooper's hawk in West Orange, New Jersey, has been observed using a pedestrian crosswalk signal to its advantage, creating a unique hunting strategy. The hawk learned to associate the signal's rhythmic clicking with a buildup of cars, which provided cover for ambushing sparrows and other small birds. This behavior demonstrates the hawk's cognitive abilities, including creating a mental map of the neighborhood and understanding the connection between the traffic signal and its hunting opportunities. The article emphasizes the intelligence and adaptability of animals in human environments.</p>

          <p>President Trump's budget legislation seeks to punish states that provide health coverage to unauthorized immigrants by cutting federal Medicaid reimbursements unless they roll back these benefits. The bill, which narrowly passed the House, would affect 14 states, potentially leaving millions without health insurance and posing economic and political challenges. Critics argue the move is hostile towards immigrants and targets Democratic-led states, while supporters claim such programs encourage illegal immigration. The situation forces states to decide between maintaining their healthcare policies and facing significant funding cuts.</p>

          <p>Experts are casting doubt on President Trump's plan to quickly convert a luxury jet gifted by Qatar into the next Air Force One, citing technical complexities and constitutional concerns. The gifted Boeing 747-8, while opulent, lacks the high-tech communications, defense systems, and specialized layout required for Air Force One. Customizing a plane to meet these standards typically takes years and involves significant modifications, raising questions about cost and security. Concerns have been raised that the President might try to roll back current security requirements for Air Force One in order to get the plane ready faster.</p>

The First State Animal Center and SPCA cared for the surviving birds after they were found trapped in high temperatures, leading to the death of thousands. Adopters, screened to ensure the chicks would not be used for meat, took them in as egg-laying hens or pets, with the shelter hailing the adoptions as a success and expressing gratitude for the community's support. Donations are still being requested to help the shelter recover from revenue losses and expenses incurred during the rescue.</p>
