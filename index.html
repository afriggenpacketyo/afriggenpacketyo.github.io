        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a detailed history of the 14 U.S. government shutdowns that have occurred since 1980, contextualizing the most recent funding lapse. It explains that shutdowns happen when Congress fails to approve funding, a practice solidified by legal opinions from 1980-81. The report chronicles each shutdown, from the eight under President Reagan to the longest one under President Trump in 2018, detailing the political disputes that caused them, such as disagreements over spending cuts, policy riders, and presidential vetoes. These events have become more frequent in the last decade, often causing significant economic disruption and impacting federal workers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A potential mass shooting at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was averted when the family of Billy Joe Cagle, 49, alerted police to his threatening social media livestream. Cagle, who has a history of mental health issues, was arrested at the airport, and police found an AR-15-style rifle with 27 rounds in his truck. Officials praised the family's quick action, stating that their intervention likely saved numerous lives. Atlanta's mayor emphasized the success of the "See something, say something" principle in preventing a tragedy, as Cagle now faces charges including making terroristic threats and possession of a firearm by a felon.</p>

          <p>General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson announced that the company anticipates its 2026 earnings will exceed its 2025 results, which have already surpassed Wall Street expectations. This positive forecast follows GM's decision to raise its 2025 guidance, citing factors like reduced electric vehicle losses, lower warranty costs, and tariff offsets. The company's stock rose over 10% following the news, and executives reaffirmed their commitment to share buybacks and achieving 8% to 10% adjusted profit margins in North America. Analysts view the commentary as encouraging, signaling a potential cultural shift towards faster adaptation and improved financial performance for the automaker. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the ongoing federal government shutdown, student loan borrowers have several avenues for assistance. Key Federal Student Aid call centers remain operational because they are staffed by contractors, not direct government employees. Borrowers can still reach their loan servicers, which are also government contractors, for help with billing, payments, and applications for forbearance or deferment. While processes like employment verification for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) continue, the final approval for most loan forgiveness programs is on hold as it requires Education Department staff. Borrowers can identify their servicer through the official Studentaid.gov website.</p>

          <p>American cattle ranchers are voicing concerns over the potential re-emergence of the parasitic screwworm from Mexico and state that President Trump's proposal to import beef from Argentina is not a viable solution for the stressed U.S. beef supply chain. The industry is already grappling with the lowest cattle herd inventory since 1951 due to drought and other pressures. Ranchers argue that government intervention manipulates the market and undermines their efforts to rebuild herds, a process that takes years. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association criticized the plan, highlighting Argentina's history of foot-and-mouth disease and the unbalanced trade relationship between the two countries.

Recent polling shows Sherrill's lead has narrowed to just four points, suggesting the race is highly competitive.

          <p>Aston Villa has cautioned its fans that displaying political symbols, messages, or flags during the upcoming Europa League match against Maccabi Tel Aviv is strictly prohibited and will lead to immediate ejection. This warning comes after Maccabi Tel Aviv declined its ticket allocation due to safety concerns, following a decision by Birmingham's safety advisory group to ban away fans based on a high-risk assessment by local police. The ban was widely condemned, but the Israeli club stated a "toxic atmosphere" made it unsafe for their supporters to attend. Aston Villa will not sell tickets for the vacant away section and is restricting sales to fans with a prior purchase history.</p>

The controversy has intensified as another potential chair, Annie Hudson, withdrew her candidacy.

          <p>A critical look back at the 2002 film "Bend It Like Beckham" reveals a deeply problematic core plot point: a romantic relationship between an adult male coach and a teenage female player. While the movie is celebrated for tackling issues of racism, gender norms, and cultural identity, its normalization of this inappropriate power dynamic is jarring from a modern perspective. The article argues that in light of real-world abuse scandals that have since emerged in women's soccer, this aspect of the film cannot be ignored. It suggests a potential sequel should address this issue directly, reflecting the contemporary understanding of the harm inherent in such relationships.</p>

A 65-year-old retiring this year can expect to pay an average of $172,500 in healthcare costs, with traditional Medicare not covering long-term care, dental, or vision. Recommendations include thoroughly understanding Medicare gaps, building a dedicated medical emergency fund of $5,000 to $10,000, and securing supplemental coverage like Medigap or Medicare Advantage plans. Additionally, planning for potential long-term care costs through specialized insurance or annuities is crucial to protect retirement savings from being depleted by unexpected health issues.</p>

This arrangement effectively means he prepaid his rent for decades, explaining his current ability to reside in the 30-room mansion.

          <p>Fox News host Lawrence Jones made the claim that New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani wants to "eliminate" the city's Jewish community. The statement came during a "Fox & Friends" segment discussing the mayoral race and a clip of Rabbi Elliot Cosgrove, who asserted that Mamdani poses a danger to Jewish security. Jones referenced Mamdani's refusal to condemn certain slogans and a photo with a controversial imam as evidence. He expressed shock at polling that suggests Mamdani has support within the Jewish community, stating, "He wants to eliminate your entire community. Doesn’t even believe in a Jewish state."</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance is in Israel to help reinforce the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, which was recently threatened by an attack that killed two Israeli soldiers. While Hamas denied responsibility, Israel retaliated with significant airstrikes, killing at least 45 Palestinians. President Trump has warned Hamas against further breaches of the peace deal, which has seen the release of all living Israeli hostages and the return of deceased individuals from both sides. However, critics like former Israeli official Alon Pinkas express skepticism about Prime Minister Netanyahu's commitment to a lasting peace, suggesting he was pressured into the agreement and may resume military operations.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the COVID-19 inquiry that children paid a "huge price" to protect others during the pandemic. He defended the actions of teachers and schools while acknowledging that closing them was a "personal horror." Johnson addressed criticism about the lack of planning for school closures in early 2020, stating the rapid spread of the virus made it difficult to prepare. He also commented on the 2020 exam results fiasco, admitting he was in a "thoroughly homicidal mood" over the crisis but maintained that the Department for Education did a "heroic job" overall. He concluded that school closures should be a measure of last resort in any future pandemic.</p>

          <p>Despite ambitious predictions from tech CEOs that AI will soon write the vast majority of code, many software engineers remain skeptical about its current capabilities. While AI tools are useful for simple, repetitive tasks, developers report that they often create messy, unworkable code for complex projects, requiring more human effort to fix. Studies on AI's impact on productivity have shown mixed results, with some indicating modest time savings while others found experienced engineers took longer to complete tasks. Engineers express concern that a management-driven push to use AI everywhere is creating a culture where there is little room for disagreement about the technology's actual effectiveness.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached for two British prisoners, Lindsay Sandiford and Shahab Shahabadi, to be transferred from Indonesia back to the UK. Sandiford, 69, has been on death row for over a decade after being convicted of trafficking cocaine in 2013, while Shahabadi, 35, is serving a life sentence. The Indonesian minister for law and human rights cited the poor health of both prisoners as a key factor in the decision, noting Sandiford is seriously ill and Shahabadi is suffering from severe mental health disorders. The transfer is expected to occur in approximately two weeks, once technical details are finalized between the two countries.</p>

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which oversees the program, has informed states of insufficient funds to cover full benefits and instructed them to pause sending recipient data to payment processors. This disruption threatens the food security of over 40 million Americans who rely on the program.

          <p>Concerns about President Donald Trump's fitness for office are growing after a series of rambling and confusing public speeches, raising questions about the constitutional guardrails for removing an impeded president. At 79, Trump frequently appears to lose his train of thought, leading to calls from some Democrats to invoke the 25th Amendment. However, legal experts note that the amendment sets an extremely high bar, requiring the support of the vice president and a majority of the cabinet, followed by a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress if the president contests it. Despite numerous examples of unusual behavior, there appears to be no appetite among Republicans to scrutinize their leader's health.</p>

          <p>Gavin Plumb, a security guard sentenced to life in prison for plotting to kidnap, sexually assault, and murder television presenter Holly Willoughby, has had his appeal dismissed. Plumb, 38, was convicted after an undercover U.S. police officer infiltrated an online group where he detailed his plans. Police found a "kidnap kit" in his flat, including chloroform and restraints. The Court of Appeal upheld his sentence, which has a minimum term of 16 years, ruling that he intended harm "of the gravest and highest possible kind." The court rejected the defense's argument that the sentence was too long, agreeing with the prosecution that the offense had life-changing consequences for the victim.</p>

          <p>In southwest Madagascar, where overfishing has devastated coral reefs and the livelihoods of coastal communities, a novel conservation project is underway to restore the fishery without restricting access. The nonprofit Reef Doctor is building artificial reefs by sinking limestone chunks and seeding them with marine life to create new fish habitats. This approach directly addresses the food insecurity driving the over-exploitation, as poverty and climate-driven migration have pushed too many people to depend on a collapsing ecosystem. The project is part of a large-scale study linking environmental restoration to human health, aiming to prove that ecological interventions can serve as public health solutions in impoverished nations.</p>
