        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. housing market is experiencing a significant split, with home prices declining in some southern and western metropolitan areas while rising in the Northeast and Midwest. A recent report from Realtor.com attributes this divergence to inventory levels; regions with more housing supply, like Austin and Miami, are seeing price drops, creating a more balanced market. Conversely, areas with limited inventory, such as New York and Milwaukee, continue to face upward price pressure due to constrained supply and high demand. This dynamic creates vastly different experiences for homebuyers and sellers depending on their location. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to terminate approximately $7 billion in grant funding awarded through the Solar for All program, which was established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The program is designed to help low- and middle-income households install solar panels, with grants already awarded to 60 state agencies and other entities. Because the funds have already been awarded, the administration's move to claw them back is legally complex and expected to face court challenges. This action is part of a broader pattern of the administration targeting clean energy initiatives.</p>

          <p>Indiana is set to open a new 1,000-bed migrant detention facility, nicknamed the "Speedway Slammer," in partnership with the Trump administration's Department of Homeland Security. Located at the Miami Correctional Center, the facility is modeled after Florida's "Alligator Alcatraz" and is intended to hold individuals who are in the country illegally before deportation. The initiative is funded by a recent reconciliation bill and is part of a broader federal strategy to increase detention capacity and encourage self-deportation. Governor Mike Braun praised the partnership as a key component of the state's efforts to combat illegal immigration.</p>

A grand jury is expected to be presented with an indictment against Elias Rodriguez, which will likely include special findings allowing for the pursuit of the death penalty. Rodriguez is accused of killing Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim outside the Capital Jewish Museum in May. According to charging documents, after his arrest, he stated he committed the act "for Palestine," prompting the investigation into a hate-motivated crime.</p>

Trump also mentioned Secretary of State Marco Rubio as another potential contender, suggesting the two might collaborate in the future. This statement provides a clear, though unofficial, signal of the president's preference for the party's direction.</p>

          <p>James Arthur McDonald Jr., a former financial analyst and frequent CNBC contributor, has been sentenced to five years in prison for a multimillion-dollar investment fraud scheme. As CEO of two investment firms, McDonald lost tens of millions of dollars of client money on a risky market bet in late 2020. He then solicited new funds while misrepresenting his firms' financial health and misappropriated the money for personal use, including buying a Porsche. After becoming a fugitive in 2021, he was arrested in Washington state and has now pleaded guilty to securities fraud.</p>

The move, which received bipartisan support within a subcommittee, sets up a potential conflict between Congress and the Trump administration, which has faced pressure to increase transparency regarding the Epstein saga.

This article from The Economist explores the cracks appearing in what was once solid backing, noting that the long-standing divisions among Democrats regarding the Jewish state may now be mirrored on the right. The piece suggests that the unwavering pro-Israel stance, exemplified by leaders like House Speaker Mike Johnson, might not be as universally held among the Republican base as it once was.

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced second-quarter financial results that fell short of Wall Street's earnings expectations, causing its stock to slide in after-hours trading. While the chipmaker's revenue of $7.69 billion surpassed estimates, its adjusted earnings per share of 48 cents missed the 49-cent forecast. The company's AI chip business saw a decline, partly due to U.S. export restrictions to China, though CEO Lisa Su expressed optimism about future growth. AMD's data center and client segments both showed strong year-over-year revenue increases, but the earnings miss overshadowed the positive aspects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has claimed that major banks are discriminating against conservatives by closing their accounts, a practice known as "debanking," and suggested he will sign an executive order to address it. The issue has gained traction among some on the right who allege their accounts were closed due to their political views, though banks maintain that such decisions are based on risk management and regulatory compliance. Financial institutions are required to report suspicious activity and are not obligated to provide a reason for account closures, leaving some customers without a clear explanation for being debanked.</p>

          <p>Tennessee has executed Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate, without deactivating his implanted heart defibrillator, a decision that sparked significant legal and medical debate. His attorneys had argued that the lethal injection could trigger the device, causing unnecessary pain and violating constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. Despite a lower court initially agreeing, the state's supreme court overturned the order. The execution proceeded after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a final appeal, highlighting complex ethical questions about capital punishment for inmates with advanced medical conditions and the role of medical professionals.</p>

          <p>President Trump has dismissed five of the eight members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, the body created by Congress to manage the U.S. territory's fiscal crisis. A White House official stated the board had been run "inefficiently and ineffectively," necessitating a change in leadership to restore common sense. The fired members were largely appointed by Democratic presidents. The move comes amid ongoing legal battles over restructuring the debt of Puerto Rico's power authority and criticism of the board's performance from figures on the island and in Washington.</p>

          <p>Fire authorities across California are on high alert as a prolonged heat wave is expected to worsen wildfire conditions this week, threatening to intensify several large blazes already burning in the state. Southern and Central California have already experienced an active fire season, and the incoming high temperatures and low humidity will increase the risk of new fires starting and growing rapidly. While strong winds are not in the forecast, conditions are ripe for "plume-dominated" fires that can generate their own wind. The state's largest active blaze, the Gifford fire, remains largely uncontained.</p>

          <p>Ion Iliescu, the dominant and divisive figure who led Romania out of communism, has died at the age of 95. He rose to power during the violent 1989 revolution that overthrew dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and served as the country's first democratically elected president. While credited with steering Romania toward NATO and the EU, his legacy is marred by controversy, particularly his role in the violent suppression of anti-government protests in 1990, known as the Mineriads. His career embodied the complex and often painful transition of a nation grappling with its authoritarian past.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic examines President Trump's persistent use of the term "Russia hoax" to describe the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. It argues that while the phrase has no fixed definition, it serves as a powerful rhetorical tool for the president, despite overwhelming evidence from U.S. intelligence that the interference was real. The piece traces how the "hoax" narrative has evolved, often conflating discredited claims like the Steele dossier with the core findings of Russian meddling. It concludes the "Russia hoax" claim is itself a successful hoax.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered federal prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the 2016 Trump-Russia investigation. This legal proceeding will explore allegations that political opponents of Donald Trump may have conspired to falsely accuse his campaign of colluding with Russia. The move follows accusations from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard that Obama-era officials politicized intelligence to target Trump. It signals a formal escalation in the effort to investigate the investigators who conducted the original probe into Russian election interference.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard's final report on the Titan submersible disaster concludes that the fatal implosion was "preventable" and that owner OceanGate used intimidation and exploited regulatory loopholes to avoid safety oversight. The investigation found that the vessel's design was flawed, its structural integrity was likely compromised in prior incidents, and the company fostered a "toxic" safety culture where concerns were dismissed. The report places significant blame on CEO Stockton Rush, stating his overconfidence led to a disregard for warnings that ultimately resulted in the deaths of all five people aboard.</p>

The Justice Department has been pushing for the release to increase transparency in the Jeffrey Epstein saga. However, Maxwell's team contends that since she is alive and still has legal options, the traditional secrecy of grand jury proceedings should be maintained.</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) plans to enter negotiations with the Trump administration after federal agencies froze approximately $339 million in research grants. The administration has accused UCLA of violating civil rights laws related to antisemitism, race in admissions, and transgender athletes. The grant freeze, affecting hundreds of projects in fields like medicine and clean energy, is seen as a major escalation in the administration's campaign against elite universities. While UCLA leaders expressed hope for a resolution, they have not ruled out a potential lawsuit to challenge the government's actions.</p>

          <p>As Texas Democrats remain out of state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan, questions are arising about Governor Greg Abbott's legal authority to remove them from office. While the governor has threatened to use an attorney general's opinion to declare their seats vacant for abandonment, legal experts note this is a nonbinding opinion. The Texas Constitution's primary mechanisms for removal are expulsion by a two-thirds vote of the House or by voters at the ballot box. The standoff highlights the intense political battle over gerrymandering, with Democrats willing to risk arrest to prevent the new maps.</p>

          <p>The current political fight in Texas, where Republicans are seeking arrest warrants for Democrats who fled the state, exemplifies how gerrymandering has become a "blood sport" in American politics. This article explains that while redrawing districts has a long history, the stakes are now higher than ever, with control of Congress potentially hanging in the balance. The 2019 Supreme Court ruling that federal courts cannot block maps for being purely partisan has removed a key check on the practice. This has empowered state-level actors to pursue aggressive redistricting strategies with national consequences.</p>
