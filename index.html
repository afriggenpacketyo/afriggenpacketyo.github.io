          <p>Two easyJet airplanes clipped wings while taxiing on the runway at Manchester International Airport in the UK. The incident prompted a brief suspension of airport operations for assessment, but flights resumed within minutes after it was determined the planes could safely return to a stand. No injuries were reported as a result of the minor collision, and airport authorities have launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the event. EasyJet is currently managing the travel arrangements for all passengers who were affected by the disruption.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Washington D.C. has raised questions about his authority to replicate such actions in other major U.S. cities. Legal experts note that the President's direct command over the D.C. National Guard is unique due to the capital's federal status, whereas state governors control their own Guard units. Any attempt to deploy federal forces for domestic policing in states would likely face significant legal challenges under the Posse Comitatus Act. Critics argue the intervention in D.C., where violent crime is at a 30-year low, is a political move rather than a response to a genuine emergency.</p>

          <p>During India's 78th Independence Day address, Prime Minister Narendra Modi advocated for national self-reliance, particularly in energy and defense, amid threats of increased U.S. tariffs over Russian oil purchases. Modi stressed that achieving energy independence is crucial for building a developed and truly self-reliant India. He also issued a stern warning to Pakistan, stating that India would no longer tolerate "nuclear blackmail" and would continue to suspend a key water-sharing treaty. The speech underscored India's assertive foreign and economic policy stance in the face of international pressures.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has begun canceling hundreds of flights in anticipation of a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, which could ground the airline's entire fleet by Saturday morning. The labor dispute centers on contract negotiations, with the union citing "poverty wages" and unpaid labor, while the airline claims it offered a significant pay increase. The preemptive cancellations are intended to facilitate an orderly shutdown and eventual restart of operations. The strike threatens to disrupt travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily, with thousands of Canadians potentially stranded abroad.</p>

This article explains that his policies threaten core tenets such as the "most favoured nation" rule, which ensures equal trade concessions for all member countries. By abandoning multilateralism in favor of bilateral deals and tariffs, the administration is eroding a system designed to prevent trade disputes and protectionism. The long-term consequences of dismantling these carefully established global trading norms could be far more damaging than the immediate impact of tariffs.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet at a military base in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The location was chosen for its security capabilities and historical connection, as the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867. The high-stakes meeting follows several unsuccessful rounds of peace talks and comes as Trump seeks to fulfill his campaign promise of ending the conflict quickly. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will not be present, though Trump has stated he will be the first to be called after the summit concludes.</p>

This fight is considered his "breakthrough" opportunity, providing a platform to transition from a promising prospect to a legitimate title contender. A victory over a well-known name like Whyte could significantly accelerate his path toward a world title shot against top fighters in the division.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is set to increase its number of data centres by nearly 20%, with almost 100 new facilities planned, largely driven by the growing demands of artificial intelligence. While the government views this expansion as critical national infrastructure for economic growth, concerns are mounting over the immense strain these facilities will place on energy and water resources. Experts warn that the increased demand could lead to higher utility bills for consumers and significant environmental impact. The majority of the new centres are planned for London and the southeast, raising specific concerns for resource management in the region.</p>

The original agreement fell apart amid rising hostilities, including North Korea's sending of trash-filled balloons across the border.

The decision reflects growing investor concerns about geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as weakening confidence in China's economic outlook.

          <p>The upcoming summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin has fueled speculation about potential territorial concessions that could alter the map of Ukraine. Russia currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and parts of four other regions. Reports suggest Putin may demand full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in exchange for a ceasefire, a concession Ukraine finds unacceptable after immense sacrifice. Trump's recent comments about "territorial swaps" have caused alarm in Kyiv and among European allies, who insist on Ukraine's territorial integrity as a cornerstone of any potential peace agreement.</p>

This trend is attributed to spending pressures, which are squeezing the mid-range market. Like other major brewers, Carlsberg has seen a decline in sales volumes as consumers react to higher prices.

However, the research also highlights the significant environmental challenge posed by this production, with a waste recovery rate of only 17 percent.

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has struck down two Trump administration directives that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools and universities by threatening to withdraw federal funding. The judge ruled that the Department of Education's guidance, which broadly interpreted a Supreme Court ruling on admissions to apply to all aspects of education, violated procedural requirements. The memos had been criticized by education groups for creating a "sea change" in regulation and chilling lawful speech and beneficial programs. The ruling is being hailed as a significant victory for supporters of DEI initiatives in education.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New home prices in China's 70 major cities fell by 0.3 percent in July, matching the previous month's sharp decline and indicating that government stimulus measures have not yet revived the property market. On a year-on-year basis, prices have been falling since April 2022, though the rate of decline narrowed slightly. Despite efforts like cutting mortgage rates and easing purchase restrictions, consumer demand remains weak as cautious citizens prioritize saving over investing in real estate. This prolonged slump continues to put pressure on major developers who are struggling with significant debt burdens. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After winning the Premier League title in his first season, Liverpool manager Arne Slot faces heightened expectations following an aggressive summer spending spree that could exceed £300 million. The club has made several high-profile signings, including Florian Wirtz for £116 million, signaling a clear ambition to dominate both domestically and in Europe. This significant investment shifts the narrative from a transitional period after Jürgen Klopp to a clear mandate for sustained success. The pressure is now on Slot to integrate the new talent and defend the title against strengthened rivals, with anything less than a major trophy likely to be seen as a disappointment.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has weighed in on the transfer saga involving Newcastle striker Alexander Isak, suggesting it is becoming increasingly difficult for the player to remain at the club. After Newcastle rejected a £110 million offer from Liverpool, Isak remains keen on the move, creating a challenging situation for his current team. Rooney noted that while losing a top player is a blow, financial regulations might make a sale beneficial for Newcastle, allowing them to reinvest in strengthening the overall squad. For Isak, the chance to join the reigning Premier League champions represents a huge career opportunity.</p>

          <p>Surrey Police has launched a campaign called "Jog On" to combat the street harassment and catcalling of female joggers. The initiative involves plain-clothed female police officers running in targeted areas, with uniformed colleagues nearby to intervene and educate perpetrators. An officer involved described the behavior as prevalent and unsettling, noting she was honked at twice during a single undercover run. The campaign follows a local survey where 94% of female residents reported experiencing harassment, yet nearly half never reported it, highlighting a significant gap in official data and the need for proactive policing.</p>

          <p>A recent advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ), stating that governments have a legal obligation to protect the environment from emissions, is being seen as a potential watershed moment for investors. The unanimous ruling found that activities like fossil fuel production and subsidies could be considered internationally wrongful acts.

The move comes as the nation faces a severe security crisis, with a powerful gang federation controlling large parts of the capital.

          <p>The summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin carries immense weight for the future of Ukraine, with several critical issues on the table. These include potential territorial concessions, with Russia reportedly demanding more land in exchange for a ceasefire, a proposition Ukraine rejects. Another key point is security guarantees, as Ukraine seeks protection from future aggression while Russia demands its neutrality. The lifting of economic sanctions on Russia, accountability for war crimes, and the return of prisoners of war and abducted children are also central to any potential agreement, highlighting the complexity of achieving a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>As part of President Trump's "Making D.C. Safe and Beautiful" initiative, federal and local authorities have begun clearing homeless encampments across the capital. This action, supported by the deployment of National Guard troops, is framed by the administration as a move to address crime and grime. However, for the unhoused individuals being displaced, the operation is a source of fear and disruption, as they are forced to pack their belongings and move with little notice. Critics and advocates for the homeless argue the policy is inhumane and treats people as eyesores rather than addressing the root causes of homelessness.</p>
