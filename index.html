          <h2>Treasury Yields Surge Amid Tariff-Induced Economic Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-07 13:22:05 EDT</div>

          <p>The 10-year Treasury yield rose above 4% as President Trump's tariffs triggered concerns about a potential economic slowdown, creating a perplexing situation for investors. Despite expectations of lower Federal Reserve rates due to the anticipated economic weakness, Treasury yields increased, possibly indicating a shift in international investor sentiment towards the U.S. as a safe haven. Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to lower Treasury yields, but his tariff policies seem to be having the opposite effect, fueling fears of a global trade war as countries retaliate with their own tariffs.

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose additional tariffs on China if the country does not remove retaliatory tariffs it placed on the U.S. This announcement intensified market volatility already fueled by Trump's initial tariffs against major U.S. trading partners. The potential tariff increase could bring the total tariff rate on some Chinese goods to over 100%, exacerbating fears of a global trade war and further destabilizing the markets. Trump continues to assert that the tariffs are bringing billions of dollars into the U.S., despite lacking concrete evidence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to block the return of a Maryland man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. The government argues that a federal court cannot order the president to engage in foreign diplomacy, which they say is implicit in returning the man. The man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was deported despite having protected legal status, and the government claims he is a gang member. Lower courts have ordered his return, stating the government has no right to remove someone lawfully present in the U.S. without due process.</p>

          <p>Amid massive layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Trump administration, senior officials are being offered reassignments to positions within the Indian Health Service (IHS). This move is viewed by some as a purge of leadership and a sign of disrespect towards public service and the IHS. Critics argue that the IHS is being used as a pawn, diverting qualified workers instead of adequately staffing the service with the most qualified individuals. Some suspect the targets are individuals who worked closely with Dr. Anthony Fauci during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney called a snap election for April 28 after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resigned in January.

Polls suggest a tightening race between the Liberals and Conservatives, with the Liberals gaining ground after Trudeau's resignation. The election will focus on how to respond to President Trump's economic threats, which has overtaken the cost of living as the dominant issue for voters.</p>

          <p>The U.S. faces a growing risk of stagflation, characterized by stagnant growth, rising inflation, and elevated unemployment, as a result of President Trump's tariffs. Tariffs function as taxes on imported goods, potentially choking off access to affordable goods and materials from overseas. This could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, as businesses face higher costs and consumers have less disposable income. Economists are debating whether these conditions will lead to a recession or a prolonged period of stagflation.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service has removed a quote and image of Harriet Tubman from a webpage about the Underground Railroad, replacing them with an emphasis on "Black/White Cooperation." This change is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to roll back initiatives related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) across the federal government. Critics argue that these actions are an attempt to sanitize history and erase the contributions of marginalized groups.</p>
