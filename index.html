          <p>Oracle reported lower-than-expected earnings and revenue, but its stock surged due to staggering forward-looking projections for its cloud infrastructure business. The company forecasts massive growth, with analysts expressing shock and excitement over multi-billion dollar AI deals and a huge increase in remaining performance obligations. This optimism is driven by Oracle's expanding data center capacity, which is attracting business from competitors like Microsoft and Google, though some caution that these are not organically acquired customers. The forecast suggests a significant shift in the cloud computing landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swedish online lender Klarna has priced its Initial Public Offering (IPO) at $40 per share, exceeding its initial valuation range and valuing the company at approximately $15 billion. The company, known for its "buy now, pay later" services, raised $1.37 billion, with the majority of funds going to existing shareholders. This successful pricing reflects a strong market appetite for tech IPOs, despite Klarna reporting a widening net loss in the second quarter. The move to go public is seen as a test of investor confidence in its recent rebranding efforts towards becoming a digital retail bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boston's Democratic Mayor, Michelle Wu, has advanced to the November mayoral election after a preliminary contest. Her victory comes as she actively resists a new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) crackdown in Massachusetts, dubbed 'Patriot 2.0'. Wu defends Boston's sanctuary city policies and its Trust Act, which limits local police cooperation with federal deportation efforts, arguing that ICE's actions do not make communities safer. The Department of Homeland Security has criticized her stance, claiming it harbors criminals and puts public safety at risk.</p>

Walkinshaw, who previously served as chief of staff to the late Rep. Gerry Connolly, defeated Republican Stewart Whitson in a reliably Democratic district. Key issues in the race included federal job cuts initiated by the Trump administration, which significantly impact the local workforce. Walkinshaw has also pledged to support a bipartisan effort to force a vote on releasing files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi saw early gains, while U.S. equity futures also rose slightly. The positive sentiment follows a record-setting day on Wall Street, where all three major benchmarks closed at all-time highs.

The Department of Homeland Security states the operation targets criminals, but activists argue that anyone who appears to be of a certain ethnicity is being targeted.

          <p>Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has resigned following two days of violent protests that resulted in 19 deaths. The unrest was initially sparked by a government ban on major social media platforms, which has since been repealed, but it tapped into broader public anger over corruption and unemployment. Demonstrators defied curfews, setting fire to government buildings and the homes of several politicians in the capital, Kathmandu. The protests, largely led by younger Nepalis, highlight deep-seated frustration with the government's perceived authoritarianism and lack of accountability.</p>

This annual benchmark revision suggests the job market was cooling more substantially than earlier data showed, strengthening the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The revision, which is a standard statistical process to account for business openings and closures, shows that job growth momentum was weaker entering 2025.

The initiative will also scrutinize social media influencers who promote pharmaceuticals without proper risk disclosures. This move stops short of the outright ban previously suggested by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but officials described it as the strongest possible action using existing regulations.</p>

          <p>A group of more than 2,000 actors and filmmakers, including Emma Stone and Ava DuVernay, has signed an open letter pledging to boycott Israeli film institutions they accuse of being complicit in human rights abuses against Palestinians. The campaign, organized by Filmmakers for Palestine, calls on film workers to avoid partnering with Israeli production companies, cinemas, and distributors that have not endorsed the rights of the Palestinian people. The letter specifies that the boycott targets institutional complicity, not individuals. An Israeli film industry group called the pledge "profoundly misguided," stating it undermines dialogue and creative expression.</p>

The team showcased significant attacking flair even without key players like Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka, with Noni Madueke scoring and impressing. The dominant display provides a major boost for Tuchel and creates positive selection challenges as younger players staked their claims for regular spots.</p>

          <p>Wales head coach Craig Bellamy described the past week as his toughest yet, following a 1-0 friendly defeat to Canada in Swansea.

Despite the loss, he was impressed with how his team, which included three debutants, adapted to their tactical system against a top-tier side. Bellamy emphasized the importance of these challenging matches for the long-term development of his players, even while expressing his personal disappointment with the result.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's handling of newly released documents from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, arguing his uncharacteristic denials and legal actions are backfiring. Unlike his usual strategy of brazenly confronting accusations, Trump is suing media outlets for defamation and calling the story a "dead issue," which only fuels suspicion. The White House's defense, suggesting the president's famous signature was forged on a letter to Epstein, has been met with skepticism. This defensive posture is seen as a departure from his typical playbook and is intensifying scrutiny from both political opponents and his own supporters.</p>

          <p>An Israeli strike targeting a Hamas leader in Doha is analyzed as a significant challenge to Qatar's established role as a key international intermediary. For years, Qatar has balanced relationships with opposing factions, making itself an essential partner for negotiations involving groups like the Taliban and Hamas. This attack, allegedly conducted with U.S. awareness, suggests that Israel and the U.S. may now view mediation as a ruse in this conflict. The move undermines Qatar's perceived neutrality and could limit its future effectiveness as a go-between in global disputes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a lower court order that would have forced the Trump administration to spend nearly $5 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress. President Trump had previously informed Congress he would not spend the funds, calling them "woke, weaponized and wasteful," in a move known as a "pocket rescission." A federal judge had ordered the administration to release the money, which was designated for UN programs, peacekeeping, and development assistance. Chief Justice John Roberts issued the temporary stay while the court considers the administration's appeal.</p>

          <p>Australian regulators have approved the first-ever rollout of a vaccine designed to protect endangered koalas from chlamydia, a disease that has devastated wild populations. Developed over a decade by scientists at the University of the Sunshine Coast, the single-dose vaccine has been shown to reduce the likelihood of symptoms and decrease mortality by at least 65%. Chlamydia can cause blindness, infertility, and death in koalas, and is a major contributor to their declining numbers. Researchers are now seeking major funding to distribute the vaccine to wildlife hospitals and vets to curb the epidemic.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has informed government departments that access to the Treasury's £9 billion emergency reserve fund will be limited ahead of the November budget. In a letter to ministers, she stated that departments must maximize their own savings before requesting funds for unforeseen pressures, and any borrowed funds would need to be repaid. The move aims to enforce spending discipline and help the Labour government meet its borrowing rules amid pressure to balance public finances. Reeves emphasized the importance of stability and living within the country's means to control inflation and promote growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed a new AI model, SpikingBrain 1.0, that mimics the human brain's efficiency by only activating necessary neurons. This design allows the model to run up to 100 times faster than traditional systems on long-text processing tasks and learn from significantly less training data. Crucially, the system operates entirely on China's domestic MetaX chip platform, rather than relying on dominant Nvidia hardware. This development is strategically important for China as it seeks to build a self-reliant AI ecosystem amid U.S. export controls on advanced chips.</p>
