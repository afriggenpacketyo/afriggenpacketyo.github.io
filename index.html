          <p>A gunman opened fire on a Dallas ICE facility, killing one detainee and critically injuring two others before taking his own life. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted attack, as evidence, including messages on shell casings, indicated anti-ICE motivations. The shooting has prompted heightened security at ICE facilities nationwide and has drawn condemnation from officials, who link the violence to heated political rhetoric surrounding immigration enforcement. The event is one of several recent attacks on federal immigration and border facilities in Texas.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of U.S. troops to Portland, Oregon, authorizing the use of "full force" to protect federal facilities, specifically an ICE center targeted by protesters. The move, which has been criticized by Democratic lawmakers, is part of a broader administration crackdown on illegal immigration and follows the designation of Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization. The order has escalated tensions, with local officials stating they did not request federal intervention and critics raising concerns about a repeat of controversial 2020 federal deployments.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visa of Colombian President Gustavo Petro following his participation in a New York protest. During the demonstration, Petro urged American soldiers to disobey President Trump's orders, which the U.S. deemed "reckless and incendiary." This action marks a significant escalation in tensions between the U.S. and Colombia, a traditionally close ally, amid ongoing disagreements over anti-narcotics efforts and other policies. Petro, who holds European citizenship, stated the revocation does not affect his ability to travel to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Israeli airstrikes and gunfire have resulted in at least 57 deaths across Gaza, including nine members of one family, according to health officials. The attacks occurred as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the UN, stating his intention to "finish the job" against Hamas despite growing international calls for a ceasefire. With hospitals on the brink of collapse and aid deliveries restricted, the humanitarian situation is worsening, particularly in northern Gaza where famine is a major concern. The conflict has claimed over 65,000 lives in Gaza, according to the local Health Ministry.</p>

          <p>A man in his 50s has died and seven other individuals, including emergency responders, received medical treatment for suspected carbon monoxide poisoning at a takeaway shop in Bloxwich, West Midlands. The incident occurred on Friday night at a pizza parlor that was undergoing refurbishment. A local official suggested that a generator being operated with insufficient ventilation may have released the toxic fumes, leading to the tragedy. Police are now collaborating with the Health and Safety Executive to investigate the exact circumstances of the man's death.</p>

          <p>Danish defense facilities, including several air bases, have reported multiple sightings of unidentified drones, escalating security concerns across Northern Europe. These incidents follow recent drone activity that temporarily shut down Danish airports, prompting officials to investigate the source of the "capable actor" behind the flyovers. In response to the provocations, which NATO has linked to a pattern of Russian behavior, Denmark is increasing its anti-drone capabilities, including accepting assistance from Sweden. Neighboring countries like Germany and Norway have also reported similar unexplained drone activity, heightening regional tensions.</p>

          <p>The Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) has generated significant controversy after posting a tribute on social media honoring Assata Shakur, who died recently in Cuba. Shakur, a Black militant, was convicted for the 1973 murder of a New Jersey State Trooper and is on the FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorists list after escaping from prison and fleeing to Cuba. The union's post, which called her a "revolutionary fighter," drew sharp criticism for celebrating a convicted cop-killer. This incident is the latest in a series of controversial public stances taken by the CTU.</p>

          <p>After nearly 34 years, Austin police have identified a suspect in the notorious 1991 quadruple murder at an "I Can’t Believe It’s Yogurt" shop. The suspect, Robert Eugene Brashers, was identified through advanced DNA testing; he died by suicide in 1999 during a police standoff. The case involved the brutal killing of four teenage girls who were bound, shot, and then set on fire inside the shop. This breakthrough follows years of investigation and the wrongful conviction of two other men, whose sentences were overturned in 2009 due to new DNA evidence.</p>

The women are now advocating for stronger legislation, as current laws often do not cover the creation of such material if it is not distributed.

McNair Jr. alleges he was pushed out after questioning the league's handling of player scandals that could have implicated NFL personnel.

A BYD executive characterized the divestment as a normal part of investing, thanking Buffett and the late Charlie Munger for their 17 years of support. Berkshire's initial 2008 investment saw massive returns, but the firm began gradually selling its shares in 2022. Despite the company's unfazed public statement, BYD's stock has fallen amid investor concern and signs of cooling growth in the EV market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lt. Col. George Hardy, one of the last surviving original Tuskegee Airmen, has died at the age of 100. As the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot, he flew 21 combat missions over Europe during World War II at the age of 19. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first Black military pilots in the U.S. armed forces, overcoming systemic racism to serve with distinction. Hardy's extensive military career also included combat missions in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, and he later became a champion for preserving the legacy of his fellow airmen.</p>

          <p>A resilient stock market, powering a "wealth effect" for asset holders, may be the primary force keeping the U.S. economy from a recession despite a weak jobs picture. Recent economic data, including consumer spending and durable goods orders, has been surprisingly strong, largely benefiting the top 10% of earners who own 87% of the market. Economists warn that this creates a vulnerability; if the stock market were to decline, consumer spending would likely plummet, potentially triggering a recession. While current indicators show stability, declining consumer sentiment among non-investors suggests underlying fragility. (not investment advice)</p>

Ukraine's Sports Minister strongly condemned the move, stating that those who voted in favor betrayed Olympic values while an active war of aggression continues.

          <p>This article examines several recent economic claims made by President Trump, finding a mix of accurate, misleading, and false statements. While the president is correct that mortgage rates and gasoline prices have decreased over the past year, his claims that grocery prices and energy costs are down are inaccurate, as both have risen. His assertion that inflation has been "defeated" is also false, with the annual rate at 2.9% and showing signs of re-accelerating. The stock market has indeed hit record highs, but the manufacturing sector has shed jobs in recent months. (not investment advice)</p>

May, who resigned from office earlier this year and is representing himself, faces five to 20 years in prison on each of the five counts.

An Austrian Jew who fled the Nazis, Troller later returned to Europe as a U.S. soldier and served as an interpreter during the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. He settled in Paris and became a prominent correspondent for German television, where his show "Personenbeschreibung" featured insightful interviews with cultural icons like Marlon Brando and Woody Allen.

The meeting at Clarence House was their first face-to-face encounter in several months and was seen as a potential step toward mending their strained relationship.

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's recent advice for pregnant women to "tough it out" and avoid Tylenol is irresponsible and misogynistic. The author contends there is no scientific evidence for the president's suggested link between the pain reliever and autism, and that an untreated fever can pose real risks during pregnancy. The piece frames the president's comments as part of a broader history of dismissing women's pain and engaging in "mom-shaming." The author concludes that the administration's focus on Tylenol is not about health but is another attempt to control women's bodies and choices.</p>
