          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly criticized European nations for indirectly financing Russia's war in Ukraine through continued energy purchases and for not applying sufficient economic pressure on China. In a statement following a call with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European leaders, Trump emphasized that Europe must cease buying Russian oil, which provides significant revenue to Moscow's war machine. He also urged the leaders to hold China accountable for its role in supporting Russia's military efforts. The call occurred during a 'Coalition of the Willing' summit in Paris, where discussions also focused on enhancing Ukraine's air defense capabilities and finding paths toward a peaceful resolution.</p>

          <p>Nadine Dorries, a former Conservative minister and close ally of Boris Johnson, has announced her defection to the Reform UK party, declaring that the Tory Party is "dead." Dorries, who served as culture secretary, stated that the Conservative party has changed and no longer aligns with her core beliefs from when she joined in 1995. In her announcement, she criticized the MPs who removed Johnson from power and cited rising crime and the use of hotels for migrants as key reasons for her decision. She expressed her belief that Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is the only politician capable of addressing the country's current challenges, particularly on issues of law, immigration, and public spending.</p>

          <p>A tragic funicular railway derailment in Lisbon has resulted in the deaths of 16 people and left 23 others injured, prompting a period of national mourning in Portugal. The victims include a diverse group of locals and tourists, with authorities confirming the nationalities of some as Portuguese, South Korean, Canadian, American, German, Ukrainian, and Swiss. Among the deceased was André Jorge Gonçalves Marques, the funicular's brake guard, and Pedro Manuel Alves Trindade, a former volleyball referee. The incident has deeply affected the community, as the funicular serves as a vital mode of transport for both residents and visitors navigating the city's steep hills. An investigation into the cause of the crash is currently underway.</p>

The death toll from the initial 6.0 magnitude earthquake has now risen to 2,205, with an additional 3,640 people reported injured, according to a Taliban government spokesman. Search and rescue operations are continuing in the affected regions, where humanitarian aid is being distributed to displaced families. Tents have been set up in multiple locations to provide shelter for those who have lost their homes in the disaster, which has been followed by a series of aftershocks, further destabilizing the region and hampering relief work.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The city of Washington, D.C., has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the deployment of National Guard troops for domestic law enforcement is unconstitutional. D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb contends that President Trump's actions, which placed the D.C. police under federal control and brought approximately 2,200 troops to the city, violate democratic principles by militarizing law enforcement. The lawsuit seeks a permanent injunction to halt the deployment. This legal challenge follows a separate federal judge's ruling that blocked a similar deployment in California, representing a significant obstacle to the administration's nationwide crime crackdown strategy. The White House maintains the president is acting within his lawful authority.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is appealing a state appellate court's decision that nullified a $500 million penalty against former President Donald Trump and his company for business fraud. The lower court had ruled that the massive fine, imposed by Judge Arthur Engoron, violated the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibition against "excessive fines." While the appellate court threw out the financial penalty, it upheld the underlying ruling that Trump and other defendants had committed fraud by inflating the value of real estate assets to secure favorable loan terms. James is now taking the case to the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, seeking to have the substantial monetary punishment reinstated.</p>

          <p>Senator Ruben Gallego has introduced the "You Earn It, You Keep It Act," a bill aimed at permanently eliminating federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for all recipients. The proposal contrasts with the recently passed Republican tax law, which offers a temporary, income-based deduction for seniors. To offset the cost, Gallego's bill would increase Social Security's revenue by applying the payroll tax to annual earnings over $250,000, a significant increase from the current cap. Proponents argue this change would provide crucial financial relief to seniors, while analysis suggests it would also extend the solvency of the Social Security trust fund by 24 years, ensuring full benefits could be paid until 2058.</p>

Industry leaders also point to wider issues affecting U.S. travel, including a sharp drop in Canadian visitors, substantial increases in visa costs, and major cuts to federal tourism marketing funds, all of which create uncertainty for the sector's future performance.</p>

          <p>Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, has repeatedly refused to disclose the source of a "tip" that led him to accuse Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud. During a contentious interview, Pulte dismissed questions about his sources, stating it would be reckless to reveal whistleblowers and that the focus should be on the alleged crime, not the investigation. The accusations, which Cook denies, prompted President Trump to move to fire her from the Fed board, raising concerns about the political weaponization of federal agencies.

          <p>A recent federal appeals court ruling that President Trump unlawfully imposed certain country-based tariffs could lead to tens of billions of dollars in refunds for American businesses. The court found that Trump lacked the authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement the sweeping levies. While the administration has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, if the ruling stands, the government may have to return over $70 billion collected from these specific tariffs. The situation creates significant uncertainty for businesses, and experts suggest that even if refunds are owed, the process for claiming them could be complex, potentially requiring companies to file individual requests rather than receiving automatic reimbursements.</p>

Orsted claims the stop-work order is unlawful and was issued in bad faith, citing President Trump's long-standing hostility towards wind power as the true motive, rather than the administration's stated national security concerns.

The seaweed was washed ashore by the strong winds and high tides from the recent Hurricane Erin. According to city officials, the powerful odor is a natural result of the seaweed decomposing in the Good Harbor estuary after being trapped by the tides. While the smell is unpleasant, authorities have assured the public that it is not dangerous and will gradually dissipate as the seaweed breaks down. The red seaweed is known for spreading aggressively and has been linked to fish die-offs in other areas.</p>

Notably, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who has had a complex relationship with the president, was invited but stated he could not attend, sending a representative in his place. The gathering underscores the ongoing efforts by many tech executives to maintain ties with the administration, which aligns with their goals on AI and domestic manufacturing.</p>

          <p>During a Senate committee hearing, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested that expanded access to the abortion pill mifepristone could be rolled back, claiming the Biden administration had "twisted the data" regarding its safety. He appeared to reference a flawed, non-peer-reviewed analysis from a right-wing think tank to support his assertion, which contradicts decades of scientific research affirming the drug's safety and effectiveness. This comment came during a tense hearing where Kennedy was scrutinized for his chaotic leadership of the health department. His remarks signal a potential shift in federal policy that could significantly restrict access to what has become a primary method of abortion in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A British vascular surgeon, Neil Hopper, has been sentenced to two years and eight months in prison for insurance fraud and possessing extreme pornography. The court heard that Hopper, who had performed hundreds of amputations, used ice to intentionally freeze his own legs, leading to their necessary medical amputation. He then fraudulently claimed over £466,000 from insurers by stating the injuries were the result of sepsis. The investigation revealed Hopper had a long-standing sexual interest in amputation and body mutilation, purchasing graphic videos online. The hospital where he worked has reassured the public that an exhaustive review found no evidence of risk or harm to his patients.</p>

The slump reflects investor concerns about the future of the software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry in the face of the AI boom and specific challenges in Salesforce's marketing and commerce product sales. Despite the market's reaction, CEO Marc Benioff remains optimistic, dismissing concerns and highlighting the transformative potential of AI for the company's offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Northwestern University President Michael H. Schill has announced his resignation after three years, citing extraordinary challenges, including significant federal funding cuts under the Trump administration. The university recently faced a nearly $800 million slash in research funding, which forced the elimination of approximately 425 jobs. Schill's leadership also came under intense scrutiny from conservative lawmakers and advocacy groups over the university's handling of campus protests related to the war in Gaza. In his resignation message, Schill stated that he believes it is the right time for new leadership to guide the institution through its next chapter, acknowledging the turbulent period the university has faced.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's higher education regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), has suggested that universities could be required to set different tuition fee levels based on the quality of their teaching. This proposal for "differential fee levels" aims to incentivize higher teaching standards across the sector. Currently, most universities in England and Wales charge a uniform undergraduate fee of £9,535. The OfS ranks universities in categories from gold to "requires improvement," which could form the basis for such a system. The potential change sparks a debate among university leaders, who argue that improving quality is difficult with strained financial resources, as many institutions are already facing deficits.</p>
