          <p>The Justice Department has launched an investigation into former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo regarding his testimony to Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic, following accusations that he lied about his involvement in drafting a 2020 state report on nursing home deaths. Congressional Republicans have been pressing for this investigation, alleging that Cuomo misled Congress. Cuomo's spokesperson denies any wrongdoing, calling the investigation politically motivated and an attempt at election interference. The investigation coincides with Cuomo's run for New York City mayor, adding a layer of political complexity to the legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>Japan's export growth has slowed for the second consecutive month due to tariffs imposed by the United States, according to recent government data. Exports grew by only 2%, the slowest rate since October of the previous year, while imports shrank by 2.2%. The decline in exports to both China and the U.S. is particularly notable, with transport equipment exports to the U.S. falling significantly. Economists anticipate that net exports will continue to negatively impact Japan's GDP growth, potentially delaying the central bank's interest rate hike.</p>

          <p>Immigration lawyers have filed an emergency motion alleging that the U.S. government deported migrants from Asian countries like Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan, a nation plagued by conflict. This action would violate a court order requiring due process rights for migrants before deportation to third countries. The lawyers argue that deportation to South Sudan poses a significant risk to the migrants' safety, citing widespread violence and instability in the country. A judge has ordered the government to maintain custody of the migrants and provide information on their deportation process.</p>

          <p>Despite Russia's efforts to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine on its terms, President Putin's push for normalizing relations with the United States faces significant challenges. While Putin has resisted pressure for an immediate cease-fire, President Trump has indicated that economic rapprochement with Russia will only occur after peace in Ukraine is achieved. This linkage could confine Russia to economic stagnation, limiting its access to Western sanctions relief and foreign investment. Putin's strategy may be based on the belief that time is on his side, with stable oil prices and modest economic growth.</p>

The technique, developed at the University of Nottingham and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, has a 100% success rate in diagnosing tumor types.

          <p>President Trump announced plans for the "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, an ambitious project aimed at expanding the country's air defense system to protect against foreign threats. The project, which Trump claims will be completed by the end of his term, has been a priority since he took office. Experts, however, cite logistical and financial hurdles, with cost estimates ranging from $175 billion to $542 billion. The project aims to create a next-generation military system capable of intercepting missiles launched from anywhere in the world.</p>

          <p>The Chicago Sun-Times has confirmed that a summer reading list featuring nonexistent books was created using artificial intelligence by a freelancer. Social media users criticized the paper for using AI to generate book recommendations, which included fake titles attributed to real authors. The newspaper has since removed the special section from its e-paper version and vowed to update its policies regarding third-party licensed editorial content.

          <h2>Industry Links Skew Red Meat Research, Analysis Finds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis reveals that red meat studies with industry links are more likely to report favorable results than those without them. The review found that industry-funded studies often neglected to compare red meat to heart-healthy foods like whole grains and plant-based proteins. Experts express concern about the potential for industry-linked studies to shape public understanding of nutrition and the health consequences of certain foods. The findings highlight the need for independent nutrition research to ensure unbiased and credible information.</p>

          <h2>US-China Tariff Truce Offers Hope for Resolution on Fentanyl and Other Issues</h2>

          <p>A recent tariff truce between the US and China has sparked cautious optimism for resolving economic tensions and addressing issues like fentanyl production. While the agreement provides a 90-day reprieve, the complex nature of their economic interdependence makes a comprehensive agreement unlikely before the deadline. Despite scaled-back tariffs, the remaining duties continue to impact bilateral trade. The truce signals a reluctance from both sides to sever economic ties completely, offering hope for future progress.</p>
