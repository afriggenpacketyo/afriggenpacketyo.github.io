          <p>Ten Americans held in Venezuela have been freed and are returning to the U.S. following a complex prisoner swap involving Venezuela and El Salvador. The deal saw El Salvador repatriate 252 Venezuelan nationals, who had been deported from the U.S. and detained in a Salvadoran prison, in exchange for the release of the Americans and dozens of Venezuelan political prisoners. U.S. officials described the negotiations as tense and "down-to-the-wire," but stated the agreement was humanitarian in nature and did not involve discussions about sanctions relief for Venezuela.</p>

This balancing act is seen as a pragmatic approach in a region where making a binary choice between the two superpowers is considered unrealistic for many nations.</p>

          <p>A jury has ordered the city of Los Angeles to pay $48.8 million to Kamran Hakimi, a man who has been in a coma since being struck by a city sanitation truck last year. Hakimi was in a crosswalk with a green light when the truck made an unsafe right turn, hitting him. The city admitted the driver was at fault but disputed the extent of the damages, arguing Hakimi's comatose state minimized his suffering. The verdict is one of the largest payouts by the city in recent years.</p>

His statement was cautiously welcomed by postal union leaders, who have been protesting calls from some in the Trump administration to sell off the mail agency's services.</p>

          <p>This analysis explores the reasons behind CBS's surprising decision to cancel "The Late Show," a dominant force in late-night ratings for years. While the network cited purely financial reasons, speculation about political motives persists due to host Stephen Colbert's recent criticism of parent company Paramount. The article argues the move reflects the declining value of the traditional late-night talk show format in the streaming era, where high production costs are harder to justify against shrinking linear TV audiences and the availability of clips online.</p>

The author notes that these influencers accepted government-provided binders of mostly public information, then complained when no new scoops were handed to them. The article contrasts this with the shoe-leather reporting by traditional media outlets that originally uncovered the Epstein scandal, suggesting that true journalism involves independent investigation rather than waiting for information from powerful sources.</p>
