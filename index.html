            <p>A devastating roof collapse at the Jet Set nightclub in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, has resulted in the deaths of at least 184 people, including singer Rubby Pérez, and injuries to hundreds more. Rescue teams, including international support from Israel and Mexico, are diligently searching for potential survivors amidst the rubble.

Despite these challenges, core inflation rose slightly, and the Chinese government is considering policy stimulus measures to boost domestic consumption.

            <p>Amazon has delayed the launch of its Kuiper internet satellites due to adverse weather conditions. A United Launch Alliance rocket carrying 27 Kuiper satellites was scheduled to lift off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, but was postponed due to cumulus clouds and heavy winds. Amazon is competing with SpaceX's Starlink in the market for providing broadband internet via satellite. The company must launch half of its total constellation by July 2026 to meet FCC requirements.</p>

            <p>President Trump's trade war is now sharply focused on China, with a 125% tariff rate imposed on Chinese goods, while pausing tariffs on most other nations. This move signals a renewed focus on challenging China's dominance in global trade and upending the established system. The aim is to change China's export-driven economic model and address what Trump sees as unfinished business from his first term. The future depends on China's willingness to negotiate and the US's commitment to free trade.</p>
