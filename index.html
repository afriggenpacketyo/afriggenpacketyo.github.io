          <p>President Trump sparked controversy with a Truth Social post seemingly criticizing the number of non-working holidays in the United States, coinciding with Juneteenth. The post, which did not explicitly mention Juneteenth, argued that these holidays cost the country billions and that workers don't want them. This stance contrasts with Trump's previous acknowledgements of Juneteenth as a historic day recognizing the end of slavery. Juneteenth has been a federal holiday since 2021, commemorating the day in 1865 when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, announcing the freedom of enslaved people. The article highlights the ongoing debate surrounding federal holidays and their economic impact. The author's tone is neutral. Optimism is not reflected in the tone of this article.</p>

          <p>The Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument, along with other national monuments, is at risk of being revoked or reduced due to a legal opinion allowing presidents to do so. This coincides with proposed budget cuts for the National Park Service, potentially leading to the closure of over 300 park sites. The monument, designated in 2023, commemorates the story of Emmett Till, whose murder sparked the modern civil rights movement. Preservation advocates are working to expand the monument, emphasizing the importance of learning from past mistakes, while the White House claims these reforms will improve park operations and conservation efforts. The potential closure of this and other monuments is seen as a significant loss of historical preservation. Optimism is not reflected in the tone of this article.</p>

          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar spikes in previous months. This surge coincides with Japan's core inflation rate climbing to 3.7%, the highest since January 2023, placing pressure on the Bank of Japan to raise rates. The government has released emergency stockpiles to moderate rice prices, and analysts suggest that price reductions could boost household spending if extended to processed foods and restaurants. Rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East may also impact energy prices. The article highlights the complex interplay between food prices, inflation, and monetary policy in Japan.

          <p>President Trump is weighing potential military action against Iran, setting a two-week deadline for a decision. This consideration comes amid escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, and legal concerns surrounding the War Powers Resolution. Lawmakers are pushing for congressional approval before any military engagement, fearing further escalation in the Middle East. Experts debate the legality of unilateral action, citing precedents of presidents acting without congressional authorization, while critics warn of potential retaliation and violations of international law.

          <p>China's central bank has kept its benchmark lending rates steady, following the monetary easing measures implemented last month to stimulate economic growth. The People's Bank of China held the one-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5%. Last month, authorities reduced lending rates for the first time since October by 10 basis points, aiming to mitigate the impact of trade tensions with the United States. This decision follows a trend of commercial banks trimming deposit rates to protect their net interest margin.

          <p>Hunan has become the first province in China to utilize special-purpose bonds to guarantee government payments to enterprises, allocating 20 billion yuan for this purpose this year. This adjustment to the annual fiscal budget marks the first instance of these bonds, typically reserved for revenue-generating construction projects, being used to cover government arrears. Experts caution that this sum may be insufficient compared to the scale of local government debt, with concerns about prioritizing certain arrears and firms.
