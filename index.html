          <p>Marks & Spencer has announced that its online services will experience disruptions until July due to a sophisticated cyber-attack that occurred over the Easter weekend. The retailer estimates a £300 million reduction in profits for the current year, which is more than analysts anticipated. The cyber-attack initially affected click-and-collect and contactless payments, and M&S believes the ransomware attack was executed by Scattered Spider, a cyber-crime service. Despite the disruption, M&S CEO Stuart Machin remains optimistic about the company's long-term plans for reshaping the business for customers, colleagues, and shareholders.</p>

Speaker Mike Johnson engaged in negotiations with various factions to address concerns about the bill, which encompasses tax cuts, increased military spending, and adjustments to Medicaid and clean energy subsidies. While some Republicans expressed reservations, Speaker Johnson's negotiations seemed to yield progress, with Representative Chip Roy noting improvements compared to previous weeks. The bill is expected to face a vote in the House soon, contingent on resolving remaining disagreements among Republicans.</p>

          <p>A leaked memo has revealed internal disagreements within the Labour party regarding tax policy, specifically between Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. The memo reportedly urged Reeves to consider raising taxes by £3-4 billion annually through various measures, which Reeves did not implement, opting instead for welfare cuts. The proposals included increasing corporation tax on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. The Conservatives have seized on the memo, accusing Labour of planning future tax increases, while Labour maintains unity behind its economic plan.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede has allowed himself to be bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, building immunity to multiple types of venom. His unusual hobby has sparked interest from researchers who hope to develop a universal antivenom using his blood. The World Health Organization estimates that venomous snake bites affect millions annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Current antivenoms are specific to certain venoms and derived from animals injected with small amounts of venom. Friede's case offers hope for a synthesized treatment effective against various snake venoms.</p>

          <p>Several Democrats are openly expressing interest in running for president in 2028, a departure from the traditional reluctance to declare such ambitions early. Governors Andy Beshear and Tim Walz, along with Senator Ruben Gallego, are among those who have indicated their interest in a White House bid. This shift reflects a changing dynamic in American politics, where potential candidates are more forthcoming about their aspirations. Despite the early declarations, many contenders face challenges including low name recognition and fundraising hurdles, as the field of potential candidates is expected to narrow significantly before the actual election.</p>

          <p>The election of an American Pope, Leo XIV, has stirred controversy among Maga Catholics, who view him with skepticism due to his perceived progressive leanings. This new Pope's choice of name is a sign that he recognizes the scale and the novelty of the challenge that the rightwing populist turn represents. Julian Coman writes that Pope Leo XIV's papacy may lead to a clash between the Vatican and Trumpian nationalism, particularly concerning issues like migration, economic populism, and global cooperation. The article suggests that Pope Leo XIV intends to address global crises such as inequality, climate change, and migration, potentially challenging the Maga worldview.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem incorrectly defined habeas corpus during a Senate hearing, asserting it was the president's right to deport people rather than a protection against unlawful detention. Senator Maggie Hassan corrected Noem, emphasizing that habeas corpus ensures individuals are not detained without valid legal grounds. The Trump administration has considered suspending habeas corpus for detained migrants, a move legal experts say can only be done by Congress. The incident highlights ongoing debates about executive power and constitutional rights in the context of immigration policy.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to pause its scheme to pay out large bonuses to senior executives linked with securing its £3bn rescue loan, following public and government criticism. The company's "retention scheme," which could have amounted to 50% of senior bosses' pay packets, faced scrutiny after Downing Street deemed it "not acceptable" for executives to reward themselves for failure. The decision comes as Thames Water faces heavy criticism over its performance and financial stability, with the government on standby to put the company into special administration.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that high doses of radiotherapy, a common cancer treatment, can paradoxically promote the distant metastasis of tumors. Scientists at the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Centre discovered that radiation could lead to the growth of existing metastatic tumors, even when those tumors had not directly received radiation therapy. The research suggests that radiation therapy, while effective in controlling localized tumors, may have unintended consequences for the spread of cancer.</p>

Fires overtook land clearances from agriculture as the main cause for the first time on record, with the Amazon particularly affected amid record drought.
