          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, former President Trump hinted at a potential regime change in Iran if the current leadership fails to "MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN." In a Truth Social post, Trump questioned why a leadership shift wouldn't occur after the strikes, emphasizing the "monumental" damage inflicted on the nuclear sites. He also applauded the B-2 stealth bomber pilots involved in the operation. The strikes, involving over 125 aircraft, targeted facilities in Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, showcasing U.S. military capabilities. </p>

          <p>President Trump's decisions regarding Iran have been influenced more by his own risk assessments than by the U.S. intelligence community's consensus. While intelligence agencies maintain that Iran's nuclear weapons program was suspended in 2003, CIA Director John Ratcliffe has briefed Trump on Iran's enriched uranium stockpiles, suggesting the country is attempting to build a nuclear weapon. Israel has also assisted in these efforts. Despite criticism, Trump believes Iran is actively pursuing the means to build a weapon and ordered strikes based on this assessment.</p>

          <p>Florida Republican Representative Kat Cammack criticized what she views as left-wing fearmongering after hospital staff hesitated to administer necessary drugs during her ectopic pregnancy due to the state's abortion law. Cammack, who opposes abortion, had to show staff the state law to prove her treatment was legal. She believes pro-abortion groups have created unnecessary fear around medical procedures related to pregnancy. Cammack hopes her experience will foster common ground between opposing political groups, advocating for women's healthcare regardless of party affiliation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military provided a detailed account of "Operation Midnight Hammer," which targeted Iranian nuclear facilities. The operation involved decoy flights, mid-air refuelings, and B-2 stealth bombers dropping "bunker buster" bombs. According to the Pentagon, Israeli air dominance facilitated the operation. While the U.S. claims the strikes "obliterated" Iran's nuclear regime, Iran has minimized the damage. The BBC's independent verification of the Pentagon's account is difficult due to the nature of the mission and lack of access to specific flight data.</p>

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) warns of retaliation, but calculations are being made to avoid missteps.

Closing the strait could severely impact the global economy, potentially driving oil prices above $100 per barrel. Rubio stated it would be "economic suicide" for Iran, as its oil exports rely on the waterway, and that the U.S. retains options to respond to any closure attempts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear facilities could escalate into a larger conflict, depending on the damage inflicted and Iran's response. Possible scenarios include an indefinite bombing campaign, a full-on war of regime change, or a cycle of violence. The attack carries risks, including potential consequences for various countries and constituencies. The Trump administration's handling of the situation raises concerns due to the president's impulsiveness and lack of foreign policy expertise.</p>
