          <p>Nvidia has announced a significant $5 billion investment in Intel, leading to a more than 22% surge in Intel's stock price. This strategic partnership aims to co-develop advanced data center and PC chips, combining Nvidia's expertise in AI with Intel's CPU and x86 ecosystem. The deal, which follows recent investments in Intel by Softbank and the U.S. government, is seen as a major boost for the struggling chipmaker's turnaround efforts. This collaboration is being hailed as a milestone for American high-tech manufacturing, although it does not currently include plans for Nvidia to use Intel's manufacturing facilities.

          <p>A major dispute has emerged within the new UK left-wing party co-founded by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana. Sultana has publicly accused Corbyn and other senior members of fostering a "sexist boys' club" and excluding her from key decisions, despite their initial agreement to lead jointly. The conflict escalated over an "unauthorised" membership drive launched by Sultana, which Corbyn's faction disavowed, creating confusion and frustration among supporters. This public infighting, occurring before the party is even officially named, threatens to derail its momentum and has raised concerns about its viability and internal governance structures.</p>

CEO José Muñoz described the U.S. as the company's "engine of growth," reconfirming a $26 billion investment to expand American operations and localize over 80% of its vehicle production by 2030. Despite lowering its annual profit outlook due to tariffs, the company is targeting a 34% increase in global sales by the decade's end. Muñoz also expressed empathy for the workers affected by the raid and stressed the importance of resolving visa issues for specialized technical experts.</p>

This optimistic forecast is driven by the company's strategic focus on securing artificial intelligence agents, a rapidly growing sector creating new enterprise vulnerabilities.

          <p>During a state visit to the United Kingdom, U.S. President Donald Trump advised Prime Minister Keir Starmer to "call out the military" to control the country's borders and stop illegal migration. The comment came during a joint press conference where both leaders aimed to present a united front, despite disagreements on issues like the UK's plan to recognize a Palestinian state. The visit, marked by royal pageantry, reportedly secured promises of £150 billion in U.S. investment in the UK. Starmer largely avoided public conflict with Trump, while the president also made notable remarks about feeling "let down" by Vladimir Putin regarding the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Co. has indefinitely suspended the ABC talk show "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after host Jimmy Kimmel made comments linking the alleged killer of a conservative activist to the MAGA movement. This action follows similar pressure that led to the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show and is part of a broader trend of the Trump administration's intensifying scrutiny of media companies. The suspension was preceded by statements from the FCC chair suggesting ABC's broadcast license could be at risk, and several major station affiliates, including Nexstar and Sinclair, had already announced they would preempt the show. The move has ignited a significant debate about free speech and government influence over media content.</p>

          <p>Paul Thomas Anderson's new film, "One Battle After Another," is drawing praise for its electrifying and politically urgent story. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a burnout former revolutionary forced out of hiding, the movie is inspired by Thomas Pynchon's novel "Vineland" but updates the setting to the present day. The article highlights the film's willingness to tackle raw contemporary themes of political violence and government overreach, a departure from Anderson's typically historical settings. With powerful performances from DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor, and Sean Penn, the nearly three-hour film is described as a taut, visceral, and emotionally investing blockbuster that masterfully blends action with commentary on modern American anxieties.</p>

While some officials framed the decision as a necessary compromise to ensure the program's continuation until 2030, mobility and environmental associations have criticized the hike.

          <p>A fierce debate over the limits of free speech has erupted following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, as the Trump administration takes action against his critics. Attorney General Pam Bondi has vowed to target "hate speech," while the State Department plans to revoke visas for those celebrating Kirk's death online. This crackdown has culminated in the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after the host's monologue on the topic. Legal experts and civil liberties advocates argue these actions set a dangerous precedent, potentially violating First Amendment protections and using government power to suppress lawful, albeit controversial, expression, blurring the lines between persuasion and coercion.</p>

This decision reaffirms the company's long-term strategic commitment to the U.S. market, despite the raid causing a two-to-three-month delay in the opening of an adjacent battery plant.

The defense successfully cast doubt on the credibility of the agents involved, particularly Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino, who was the only agent to testify he witnessed the alleged assault. Video evidence presented in court showed an agent forcefully shoving the defendant but did not capture any assault by the protester. The trial also highlighted factual discrepancies in initial reports and brought up a past misconduct investigation against Bovino, ultimately leading to a swift not-guilty verdict.</p>

On Gaza, Trump remained focused on the Israeli hostages, while on Ukraine, he expressed feeling "let down" by Putin but offered no new strategy.

These payments are marginally lower than they were at the beginning of 2025, offering modest but tangible savings over the life of the loan.

While some athletes use intimidation, others adopt a quiet confidence to unsettle opponents, highlighting the intense mental battle that occurs in high-stakes events like a world championship final, where performance is often determined by psychological readiness.</p>

          <p>Two Israeli soldiers were killed at the King Hussein Bridge crossing into the West Bank by a Jordanian driver who was delivering humanitarian aid intended for Gaza. The attacker was subsequently shot and killed by security forces, prompting Israel to recommend a temporary halt to aid from Jordan pending an investigation. In a separate development, Israel's military has launched a series of airstrikes against what it describes as Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon. This escalation comes as Israeli forces also continue their offensive in Gaza, where four more soldiers were reported killed in Rafah, deepening the regional conflict.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the decertification of a Miami-based organ procurement organization, the Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency, citing a long history of patient safety failures and violations of federal requirements. The move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to reform the nation's organ transplant system and restore public trust following reports of procurement attempts on patients who were not deceased. Kennedy stated the action should serve as a clear warning to other organizations and that his department is setting a new standard where patient safety comes first, contrasting his approach with that of the previous administration.</p>

          <p>Southern California is experiencing its first significant rainfall in months as moisture from a dissipated tropical storm moves through the region, prompting flood watches in several areas. While the rain is a welcome change after a long dry spell, meteorologists say it will have only a marginal effect on the upcoming wildfire season. Officials note that much more precipitation, typically two to four inches, is needed to substantially reduce fire risk, and this storm is unlikely to deliver such amounts. The rain may temporarily slow the start of the dangerous Santa Ana wind season but will not be enough to lift the region out of its severe drought conditions.</p>

          <p>The New York Department of Taxation and Finance is set to begin mailing one-time "inflation refund" checks to over eight million eligible state residents starting in late September. The payments, ranging from $150 to $400, are designed to provide financial relief from higher sales taxes resulting from inflation. Eligibility is based on income thresholds and filing status from the 2023 tax year, and qualified individuals do not need to apply to receive the payment. The program is funded by surplus state revenue generated from increased sales tax collections, a direct consequence of higher consumer prices over the past year. (not investment advice)</p>

Huang emphasized that Nvidia will become a major customer for Intel's CPUs while supplying GPU technology, targeting a combined market worth $50 billion. The deal focuses on product development rather than manufacturing, though future foundry partnerships were not ruled out, signaling a major strategic alignment between the two tech giants.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan children, stating that the government's justification for the action "crumbled like a house of cards." The ruling came after an emergency lawsuit was filed to stop the expulsion of over 70 minors over Labor Day weekend. The administration had claimed it was acting on requests from the children's families and the Guatemalan government to reunify them. However, Judge Timothy Kelly found no evidence that any parents had sought their children's return, citing a Guatemalan report indicating families were surprised by the effort and believed their children were pursuing legal status in the U.S.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals with overwhelming credit card debt, such as a $75,000 balance, debt forgiveness through settlement can offer substantial relief. This process involves negotiating with creditors to pay a lump sum that is less than the total amount owed, potentially reducing the debt by 30% to 50%. A 40% reduction on a $75,000 balance, for example, would lower the payable amount to $45,000. While this strategy can provide a faster path out of debt compared to making minimum payments against high interest rates, it requires available cash for the settlement and can negatively impact one's credit score.

Critics argue that the decision was a direct result of pressure from the Trump administration, particularly FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who had threatened regulatory action. Former President Barack Obama stated the administration is taking "cancel culture to a new and dangerous level," while House Democratic leaders have called for Carr's resignation and announced an investigation. The incident is being viewed as a significant escalation in the administration's efforts to silence media critics and a threat to First Amendment freedoms.</p>

In a letter, Parkinson explained that the evidence did not meet the high threshold for a conviction under the outdated Official Secrets Act 1911, which would have required proving China was an "enemy."
