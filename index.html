          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites and warned of potential further attacks if Iran does not pursue peace. The strikes, which Trump described as a "spectacular military success," targeted sites including the Fordo underground nuclear facility. Trump conveyed the strikes as a warning to Iran, emphasizing the potential for more significant consequences if peace is not established. The president's announcement follows escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, with the U.S. now directly involved in military action.

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. attacked three sites in Iran, joining the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. The Israel Defense Forces reported completing strikes in southwestern Iran on a military site containing missile launchers, as well as radar detection system sites. Meanwhile, the U.S. appeared to maneuver B-2 stealth bombers and refueling tankers in the Pacific ahead of President Trump's decision on taking action in the conflict with Iran. These developments indicate a coordinated effort between the U.S. and Israel to target Iranian military and nuclear capabilities, intensifying the regional conflict. The situation remains tense, with potential for further escalation depending on Iran's response. </p>

Iran has pledged to retaliate if the U.S. joined the Israeli assault, which began with airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites and military targets on June 13.

          <p>Several Chinese ambassadors from West African nations have recently concluded their tenures, prompting speculation about the reasons behind their departures. While some analysts suggest these are routine rotations for diplomats, others believe it could be a subtle message to Sahelian regimes amid rising tensions over resource nationalism and security concerns. The departures include ambassadors from Senegal, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. The timing of these departures raises questions about China's diplomatic strategy in the region, particularly in light of increasing competition for resources and influence. The situation warrants close observation to determine the long-term implications for China's relations with West African nations. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military attacked three sites in Iran, directly joining Israel's effort to dismantle Iran's nuclear program. The decision to involve the U.S. follows over a week of Israeli attacks aimed at degrading Iranian air defenses and nuclear capabilities. Trump stated that B-2 stealth bombers were used, but did not specify the types of bombs deployed. The attacks are a risky decision, given Iran's promise to retaliate if the U.S. joins the Israeli assault.

          <p>President Trump announced that U.S. warplanes bombed three Iranian nuclear sites, an attack he said was "very successful," despite previously setting a two-week deadline for negotiations. Iran had warned of reprisals if the U.S. joined Israel in attacking its territory, raising concerns about potential escalation. The success of the strikes in destroying Iranian nuclear research facilities remains uncertain, and the pressure to strike again could increase. The prospect of a U.S. attack on Iran has already prompted criticism from Democrats and within Trump's own "America First" movement, creating domestic political concerns. The situation's trajectory is uncertain and beyond Trump's complete control. </p>

          <p>Keystone Mission will close two of its facilities due to a critical lack of funding and unsustainable increases in operating costs. Acting executive director Justin Behrens called on the community to work together to find a resolution to the issues at hand. Despite the closure of physical locations, the organization remains committed to ensuring that those living with homelessness are not left behind. Behrens urged the community, stakeholders, and supporters to come together during this transitional time, emphasizing the importance of financial donations, resource sharing, and collaboration with other service providers. </p>

          <p>Stephanie Fagan grieved for 20 years over the loss of the murdered Pelley family and her friend Jessica Pelley, who was cut off from contact after the tragedy. Fagan cleaned the Pelley family gravestones regularly, hoping to one day reconnect with Jessica. In 2009, Fagan found Jessica, now Jessi Toronjo, through Facebook and they reunited after 20 years. They discovered that Jessi had taken flowers Fagan placed at the graves during the trial of Jessi's stepbrother, Jeff Pelley, who was convicted of the murders. The two women became close friends and now consider each other sisters. </p>

          <p>The Israel-Iran war entered its second week with additional strikes targeting an Iranian nuclear research facility. Iran's foreign minister warned against the United States joining the conflict. Smoke was seen rising from an area near a mountain in Isfahan, where a local official said Israel had attacked the nuclear research facility in two waves. Israel's defense minister said the military had also killed three senior Iranian commanders in targeted attacks. The U.S. State Department confirmed that several U.S. citizens were "lightly wounded as a result of the impact of an Iranian missile strike." </p>

          <p>President Trump stated that his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was "wrong" when she testified that Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon. The White House asserted that Iran has everything needed to build a nuclear weapon and only needs the green light from its supreme leader. Trump dismissed Gabbard's testimony, asserting that Iran was "very close to having" a nuclear weapon. Gabbard defended her testimony, claiming media outlets took her statements out of context. The disagreement highlights conflicting assessments within the administration regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities. </p>

          <p>Texas will require all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments under a new law signed by Governor Greg Abbott. The law is expected to face legal challenges from critics who argue it violates the separation of church and state. A similar law in Louisiana was blocked by a federal appeals court, while Arkansas has a similar law facing a federal court challenge. The Texas measure requires schools to post a 16-by-20-inch poster or framed copy of a specific English version of the commandments. Abbott also signed a bill allowing schools to provide students and staff with a daily voluntary period of prayer or religious reading. </p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, has returned to New Jersey after a federal judge ordered his release from ICE detention. Khalil, a green card holder, was in ICE custody for over 100 days due to his role in campus protests against Israel. Judge Michael Fabiarz ruled that Khalil is not a threat or flight risk, calling his detention "highly unusual." Khalil accused the Trump administration of trying to dehumanize him and immigrants, while Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez criticized his detainment as a violation of his First Amendment rights. Khalil vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights. </p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Judge Indira Talwani struck down a policy change that would have capped indirect costs for universities at 15% of direct research costs. The universities argued the move threatened critical work in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and other technology fields. Talwani deemed the change arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. The University of California estimated the change would cost it just under $100 million a year. </p>

The U.S. State Department has also placed Israel under a Level 4 travel advisory, urging Americans not to travel there due to armed conflict, terrorism, and civil unrest.

          <p>Israel's strikes against Iran have damaged nuclear facilities, but complete destruction of Iran's ability to make weapons-grade uranium is believed to be out of reach without U.S. assistance. The key uranium enrichment site, Fordo, is located 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by air defenses. Israel's best chance at destroying the facility could lie with the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), a U.S.-produced bomb that can only be dropped by a B-2 Spirit bomber. The MOP is designed to attack deeply-buried facilities and hardened bunkers and tunnels. The B-2 Spirit's stealth capabilities allow it to evade air defenses and reach heavily defended targets. </p>
