          <h2>Poll Shows Declining Support for Trump's Deportation Program Amid Economic Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 19:44:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority now believing it is not focused on dangerous criminals. The survey also highlights that most Americans want the administration to prioritize lowering prices over other economic policies like tariffs. Despite widespread agreement that his policies have reduced border crossings, Trump's approval on immigration has declined, suggesting public opinion is shifting more due to the deportation program's execution than border activity. The poll also found most Americans are not factoring the Jeffrey Epstein case into their evaluation of the president.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament following a recent election. Despite this significant setback, which undermines his government's influence, Ishiba has stated he will not resign. The election results reflect voter frustration over rising prices, a cost-of-living crisis, and ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. Analysts note this loss could destabilize the government at a critical time and potentially open the door for a leadership challenge within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.</p>

This victory marks his fourth major title and his second of the 2025 season, solidifying his position as the world's number one golfer. With this win, Scheffler is now only one major away—the U.S. Open—from completing the coveted career Grand Slam. He joins an elite group including Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, and Tiger Woods as the only players to win The Open, the Masters, and the PGA Championship before turning 30.</p>

          <p>At least 85 Palestinians were killed across Gaza on Sunday while attempting to access humanitarian aid, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. The deadliest incident occurred at the Zikim crossing in northern Gaza, where a UN aid convoy was met by large crowds that came under Israeli gunfire, resulting in at least 67 deaths. The Israel Defense Forces stated they fired warning shots to address an "immediate threat." The violence comes as Israel issues new evacuation orders for parts of central Gaza, further complicating aid distribution amid a catastrophic humanitarian crisis and growing starvation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' struggles continued as they were swept by the Milwaukee Brewers, losing 6-5 in a game marked by a significant injury scare. First baseman Freddie Freeman left the game with a left wrist contusion after being hit by a pitch, though X-rays were negative and he is considered day-to-day. The loss was the Dodgers' third straight since the All-Star break and their tenth in twelve games, highlighting a major slump. Despite a 34th home run from Shohei Ohtani, defensive errors and an inconsistent bullpen contributed to the defeat, compounding the team's recent woes.</p>

          <p>Officials have significantly reduced the number of individuals listed as missing following the catastrophic floods in Texas Hill Country, with the count now down to three from a high of over 160. This sharp decrease is attributed to extensive follow-up work by local, state, and federal agencies, who verified that many initially reported missing were safe. The historic flash floods, which killed at least 135 people, devastated the region, particularly along the Guadalupe River. Recovery efforts are ongoing as Texas lawmakers prepare to address flood-related issues, including improving early warning systems.</p>

          <p>A deep dive into the UK's High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project reveals that insiders believe it was plagued by fundamental issues from the start, making its massive cost overruns and delays almost inevitable. The project's initial ambition to build the world's fastest railway drove up costs, while the UK's complex planning system and democratic process added further expense and complexity. The use of a hybrid bill allowed for thousands of costly compromises to appease local opposition, from rerouting via tunnels to renovating a drinking fountain. This suggests that any large-scale infrastructure project in the UK faces inherent challenges tied to its geography and political structure.</p>

          <p>Coldplay frontman Chris Martin gave concertgoers a humorous heads-up before the band's "Jumbotron Song," advising them to "do your makeup now" in case they appeared on the big screen. The warning follows a recent viral incident where a man and woman, later identified as a CEO and HR head from the same company, were caught cuddling on the Jumbotron, leading to the man's resignation. The moment became an internet sensation, prompting memes and discussion. Martin's lighthearted comment appears to be a subtle acknowledgment of the viral event, adding a layer of self-awareness to the fan-interactive concert segment.</p>

          <h2>Child Development Expert Argues 'Self-Connection' Is the Most Crucial Skill for Parents to Teach</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 18:05:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill to teach a child for lifelong success is "self-connection," the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. Raouda argues that common parenting phrases like "you're fine" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings, leading to anxiety and low self-esteem later in life. To foster this crucial skill, she advises parents to validate their child's emotions, welcome their full selves, and model their own emotional regulation. These small shifts help build resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence, providing a strong foundation for mental health.</p>

          <p>Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, describes the difficult position of American businesses operating in China amidst ongoing trade tensions. He notes that while a recent framework deal has paused further tariff hikes, the focus remains narrowly on tariffs rather than broader systemic issues. American companies are navigating a complex environment, trying to maintain their presence in the critical Chinese market while dealing with political and economic uncertainty. Stein emphasizes the need for a more stable and predictable trade relationship to ensure long-term success for the over 270 American companies his council represents.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller has founded Better Angels, a nonprofit aiming to prove that affordable housing can be built profitably without taxpayer subsidies. The initiative is bidding on several projects in Los Angeles, proposing to use a mix of private equity and conventional loans to build hundreds of units faster and at a lower cost than traditional government-funded projects. By aiming for market-rate returns, Miller hopes to attract capitalist investment to solve the affordable housing crisis. While the rents will be higher than in subsidized housing, the model seeks to serve low- and moderate-income tenants and create a new, scalable approach to the problem.</p>

          <p>The long-stalled military trials for the 9/11 defendants at Guantanamo Bay face a new period of uncertainty after proposed plea deals were officially canceled. The deals, which would have taken the death penalty off the table in exchange for guilty pleas, were rejected by the Biden administration following opposition from some victims' families. Georgetown University Law professor Stephen Vladeck explains that this decision sends the complex and controversial cases back toward potential military commission trials. The path forward remains unclear, continuing the decades-long struggle for legal resolution for the masterminds of the September 11th attacks.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died after being violently pulled into a running MRI machine due to a heavy metallic necklace he was wearing. The incident occurred at a medical facility on Long Island, New York, when the man entered the MRI room without permission. The machine's powerful magnetic field attracted the chain, causing a "medical episode" that proved fatal. The victim's wife stated he was wearing a 20-pound chain used for weight training and had entered the room to help her after her scan. This tragic event underscores the critical safety protocols required around MRI machines, which can turn any magnetic object into a dangerous projectile.</p>

          <p>England defender Lucy Bronze has highlighted the growing problem of online abuse in women's football, stating that it intensifies as the sport's profile increases. Her comments follow teammate Jess Carter's revelation of receiving racist messages during Euro 2025, which has prompted a police investigation. Bronze noted that while men's football sees more abuse in stadiums, women's football is heavily targeted online. The Lionesses squad has decided to stop taking a knee, seeking a new way to combat racism, and Bronze called for more accountability from social media platforms to protect players from hate.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced the creation of a new water ombudsman to handle consumer complaints against water companies, such as leaks and incorrect billing. This new consumer champion is part of a broader overhaul of the water industry, which faces public anger over rising bills and a dramatic increase in sewage discharges into waterways. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the sector as "broken" and vowed to halve sewage spills by 2030. The move aims to bring the water industry in line with other utilities by providing a single, legally empowered body to protect customers and resolve disputes.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent visit to China aimed to stabilize relations, his government's actions risk sabotaging these efforts. The author contends that despite positive framing in Chinese media, the Australian government's consideration of forcing a sale of the Chinese-leased Port of Darwin sends a contradictory message. This move, framed in Australian media as standing up to a "retaliation threat," undermines the goal of convincing China that Australia is a reliable partner for trade and investment. The article suggests that such actions create an unstable environment and hinder the potential for genuine improvement in bilateral ties.</p>

          <p>Emergency room physicians and pediatricians are issuing strong warnings about the dangers of recreational trampolines, citing them as a leading cause of injuries for children. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, trampolines are associated with over 100,000 injuries annually in the U.S., ranging from minor cuts to severe fractures, concussions, and spinal injuries. Doctors stress that injuries can occur even with safety nets and adult supervision, with the risk increasing significantly when multiple children jump at once. Due to the high potential for serious harm, many medical professionals state they would never let their own children use them.</p>
