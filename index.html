          <p>President Trump has recently issued pardons and commutations for several individuals, including reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, former Rep. Michael Grimm, and former Virginia sheriff Scott Jenkins. The pardons also extend to individuals connected to Hunter Biden, such as Devon Archer and Jason Galanis. Additionally, Trump pardoned former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and Nevada state lawmaker Michelle Fiore, as well as commuting the sentence of Ozy founder Carlos Watson. The pardons have sparked controversy, with some critics alleging they are politically motivated and reward Trump supporters while others have expressed relief for those who have been pardoned.</p>

Despite his departure, Musk's companies will likely face less government oversight. Musk's promise to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget only amounted to $150 billion in cuts, and even that number has not been verified. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to revoke visas for some Chinese international students, particularly those studying in "critical fields" or with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. This move, announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, aims to increase scrutiny of visa applications from China and Hong Kong. The Chinese Embassy has condemned the action as discriminatory and politically motivated, while the U.S. government argues it is necessary to protect national security. This decision adds to the uncertainty faced by international students in America, who have already experienced heightened scrutiny under the Trump administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's tariffs remain in place for now after an appeals court temporarily suspended a lower court's ruling that deemed the duties illegal. The initial ruling, from the U.S. Court of International Trade, challenged Trump's authority to impose tariffs on goods from China, Mexico, and Canada, as well as a blanket 10% import tax. The Trump administration has criticized the court's decision as judicial overreach, asserting that trade negotiations should not be impeded by activist judges. The White House is expected to challenge the court rulings, potentially leading to a Supreme Court decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has granted a temporary reprieve for President Trump's tariffs, allowing them to remain in place while legal challenges continue. This decision follows a previous ruling by a trade court that deemed many of Trump's global tariffs illegal, sparking criticism from the White House. The Trump administration argues that the court's decision improperly second-guessed the president and threatened trade negotiations. Small businesses and states had challenged the tariffs, which are central to Trump's economic agenda. The next hearing is scheduled for June 5, with the possibility of the case reaching the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Argentine court has declared a mistrial in the case of seven health professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer legend Diego Maradona.

Despite aggressive tariffs towards Asia, Chinese equities have outperformed, making them attractive from a valuation perspective. Valuations remain compelling, and with falling interest rates, diversifying away from US equities is becoming increasingly appealing. The firm said global investors are showing more interest in non-US assets, even though most of the buying this year has come from local and mainland investors. (not investment advice)</p>

The billionaire leaves Washington, but the aftershocks are still being felt by federal workers. The future of these programs and the stability of federal employment remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, ending one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions.
