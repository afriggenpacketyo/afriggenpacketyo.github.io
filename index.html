            <p>President Trump's latest round of reciprocal tariffs, exceeding a base rate of 10%, have been imposed on imports from 86 countries. China faces a net total tariff of 104% on its goods, comprising previous duties and a new 50% increase. Lesotho and Cambodia follow with significant tariff rates of 50% and 49%, respectively. Trump defends the tariffs as a correction to trade imbalances, while economists warn of potential economic damage and stock market losses. (not investment advice)</p>
