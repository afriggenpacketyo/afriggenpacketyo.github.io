          <p>The death of Phillip Reeder, a 52-year-old unarmed man in Irondale, Alabama, has been officially ruled a homicide. An autopsy concluded he died of heart failure linked to cocaine use and restraint during an altercation with police. His family, who reviewed unreleased body camera footage, alleges an officer knelt on his neck for over three minutes, drawing comparisons to the death of George Floyd. The city of Irondale disputes this characterization, stating no knee was used on his neck and that Reeder was resisting arrest after behaving erratically in traffic.</p>

          <p>The passage of President Trump's signature "megabill" revealed significant fractures within the House Republican conference, requiring extensive negotiations and a last-minute push from leadership. The article details the dramatic, sleepless nights leading up to the vote, where leaders like Majority Whip Tom Emmer struggled to secure support from holdout members. Ultimately, direct intervention and a "charm offensive" from Trump, including backroom deals with hard-line conservatives, were necessary to overcome internal resistance and pass the legislation, highlighting potential challenges for future party unity.</p>

          <p>China's military recently conducted a comprehensive exercise in Inner Mongolia, simulating the seizure of border locations using a wide array of domestically produced drone and counter-drone systems. State media reported the drill involved phases covering reconnaissance, AI-driven planning, infiltration, and aerial attacks. A notable part of the exercise was a live-fire demonstration of the OW-5A50 anti-drone laser weapon, which successfully downed a target from several kilometers away, showcasing significant advancements in China's unmanned warfare capabilities and integrated defense systems.</p>

          <p>General Motors is scheduled to release its second-quarter earnings, with investors closely watching the financial impact of President Trump's auto tariffs and any adjustments to its full-year guidance. The company previously lowered its 2025 earnings forecast to account for a potential $4-5 billion hit from the tariffs. Wall Street analysts expect adjusted earnings of $2.44 per share on $46.4 billion in revenue. Additionally, the recent elimination of federal EV tax credits in Trump's new bill adds further uncertainty to GM's electric vehicle strategy and future sales outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) has raised concerns that NHS England's strategy for the upcoming resident doctors' strike could put patients at risk. The union argues that the plan to limit cancellations of routine procedures will overstretch the senior doctors who are providing cover, potentially leading to last-minute disruptions and patient harm. This new approach contrasts with previous strikes where non-urgent care was widely rescheduled. The dispute centers on resident doctors' demands for pay restoration, with talks ongoing between the BMA and the government to avert the walkout.</p>

          <p>India's Vice President, Jagdeep Dhankhar, has resigned from his position, effective immediately, citing the need to prioritize his health based on medical advice. The 74-year-old had held the largely ceremonial but constitutionally significant role since August 2022. In his resignation letter to President Droupadi Murmu, Dhankhar expressed gratitude for the opportunity to serve the country and thanked the President and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for their support. Prime Minister Modi responded with a social media post wishing Dhankhar good health in the future.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Note Earth's Rotation Speeding Up, Resulting in Slightly Shorter Days</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 05:01:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Scientists who monitor Earth's rotation have observed a recent trend of slightly shorter days, with some days in July being a millisecond or more shorter than the standard 24 hours. While variations in the planet's spin are common, influenced by factors like the moon's gravity and atmospheric winds, the recent spate of speedier rotations has captured public attention. Experts note that while the long-term trend is for days to lengthen, the current acceleration is a minor fluctuation. This phenomenon is also linked to climate change, as melting polar ice redistributes mass and can affect rotation speed.</p>

          <p>A Montana man, identified only as James, illustrates the "benefit cliff" faced by many low-income workers, where a small pay raise makes them ineligible for Medicaid but still unable to afford private insurance. To maintain access to essential medications for addiction treatment and mental health, he intentionally does not report his increased income to the state, putting him at risk of fraud accusations. His story provides a personal counter-narrative to the political rhetoric about widespread abuse of the system, highlighting how strict eligibility rules can force hardworking individuals into impossible choices between their health and their livelihood.</p>

However, disability rights activists also express concern over pending Medicaid cuts and new eligibility requirements, emphasizing the ongoing fight for rights and services even as they celebrate past victories and progress.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Together in Manzanar," by Tracy Slater, chronicles the true story of Elaine Buchman Yoneda, a Jewish American labor activist who chose to enter the Manzanar concentration camp during World War II. She made this decision so she would not be separated from her 3-year-old, half-Japanese son, Tommy, who was mandated for incarceration. The book details the family's agonizing choice and the desolate, unfit conditions of life inside the camp. It reflects on a dark period of American history, drawing parallels to contemporary concerns over immigration policies and fear-based narratives.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing a critical staffing shortage, forcing it to reassign field office employees to handle long wait times on its national 800 number. While this has improved phone service, union representatives and former officials warn it is creating new backlogs and increasing stress at local offices responsible for processing claims. Experts argue this is a "rearranging the deck chairs" scenario caused by years of underfunding and thousands of recent employee departures. The new SSA Commissioner, however, has stated that increased staffing is not the long-term solution.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is legally challenging the Trump administration, arguing that the cancellation of $2.6 billion in federal funding was an illegal and politically motivated act. The university claims the cuts are retaliation for rejecting federal demands regarding campus policies on antisemitism, admissions, and diversity. In court, Harvard argued the government is attempting to micromanage its academic decisions, while the Justice Department maintained it has the authority to cancel grants with institutions non-compliant with presidential directives. The case is a major test of the administration's power to influence higher education by threatening financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

The agreement could involve using OpenAI's software in sectors like education, defence, and the justice system, and may include an information-sharing program with access to government data. As part of the partnership, OpenAI will also expand its London office. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle stated that AI will be fundamental to driving change and economic growth, though the move has drawn criticism from some groups over ethical and data concerns.</p>
