          <h2>Federal Wrongful Death Trial Begins Over Fatal Crash Involving Tesla's Autopilot</h2>

          <p>Tesla is facing a federal trial in Miami concerning a 2019 crash where its Autopilot system was engaged. The lawsuit was filed by the family of Naibel Benavides Leon, who was killed, and Dillon Angulo, who was seriously injured when a Model S crashed into their parked vehicle. The case questions whether defects in the Autopilot system contributed to the tragedy, with plaintiffs alleging it failed to detect obstacles. Tesla contends the crash was caused by a distracted driver who was speeding and overrode the car's systems while searching for a dropped cell phone.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a new plan to supply Ukraine with "top-of-the-line weapons" through NATO allies, who will purchase the arms from the U.S. and then transfer them to Kyiv. The move marks a significant policy shift, aiming to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities without direct U.S. financial outlay for the equipment. Simultaneously, Trump threatened to impose 100% secondary tariffs on any country trading with Russia if a peace deal to end the war is not reached within 50 days, aiming to cripple Russia's war economy.

          <p>A major wildfire in Grand Canyon National Park has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge on the North Rim, along with dozens of other structures. The lodge, a National Historic Landmark, was the only hotel within the more remote North Rim and had been a beloved destination for generations. This is the second time the lodge has burned down; the original structure, built in the 1920s, was destroyed by a fire in 1932 and subsequently rebuilt. The North Rim is now closed for the remainder of the season, and officials are mourning the loss of the iconic building.</p>

          <p>"MasterChef" presenter John Torode has stated he is the individual subject to an upheld allegation of using racist language, which emerged from an inquiry into his co-host Gregg Wallace. The alleged incident occurred in 2018 or 2019, and the report noted an immediate apology was made. However, Torode claims he has "no recollection" of the event and does not believe it happened, while affirming that any racial language is unacceptable. This follows the separate upholding of 45 allegations against Wallace for inappropriate behavior on the program.</p>

          <p>Search and recovery operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4th flash floods in Kerr County, Texas, have been intermittently suspended due to new flooding threats. Heavy rains have caused the Guadalupe and San Saba rivers to rise again, creating dangerous conditions for volunteer and official search crews. The original flooding killed at least 130 people, including many children at a summer camp, with about 160 people still reported as missing. Authorities are urging extreme caution as the region, with its already saturated ground, faces continued risk of dangerous high water.</p>

          <p>AI startup Cognition is set to acquire the intellectual property and talent of its competitor, Windsurf, in a deal announced just days after Google hired away Windsurf's CEO and other senior staff. The acquisition highlights the intense "talent war" among major AI companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta. Cognition, known for its AI coding assistant Devin, and Windsurf are both backed by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. Cognition's CEO assured that all Windsurf employees would be treated fairly and integrated into a single, united team.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Stocks Edge Higher, Largely Unfazed by New Tariff Announcements</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. stock market closed slightly higher on Monday, with major indices like the Dow Jones and S&P 500 showing modest gains. Investors appeared to shrug off President Trump's weekend announcement of new tariffs targeting the European Union and Mexico, which are set to take effect on August 1. The move rekindled trade tensions and raised concerns about potential price increases for consumers. Despite the geopolitical uncertainty, the market demonstrated resilience, suggesting that the impact of the tariff threats was either already priced in or not seen as a major immediate risk.

          <p>President Trump is receiving criticism from his own base after telling them to "not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein" and defending his administration's official findings on the matter. A recent Justice Department memo reiterated that Epstein died by suicide and that no evidence of a "client list" was found, directly contradicting popular MAGA theories. By dismissing these beliefs, which are central to the "deep state" narrative, Trump risks alienating supporters who expected his presidency to uncover such conspiracies. The fallout has been intense, with prominent conservative figures expressing their dissatisfaction with the administration's stance.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 24 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for freezing over $6 billion in federal education grants. The funds, which were previously approved for K-12 schools and adult education, were abruptly withheld just weeks before the new school year. The lawsuit argues that this freeze places school districts in an "impossible financial situation," as they have already set budgets and signed contracts. The frozen grants support a wide range of essential programs, including teacher professional development, migrant education, and services for English language learners.</p>

Acknowledging issues like a perceived lag in AI innovation and the retirement of COO Jeff Williams, Cramer argues Cook has earned the benefit of the doubt after delivering enormous profits for years. He maintains that as long as the iPhone remains an indispensable product, the stock is worth holding. Apple's shares have underperformed this year, down nearly 16.5% year to date amid shaky investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

Analysts suggest the rally is fueled by long-term institutional buyers, with one exchange predicting a potential rise to $125,000 in the coming months.

          <p>The annual count in Los Angeles County revealed a 4% decrease in the overall homeless population for 2025, marking the second straight year of decline. More significantly, the number of people living unsheltered on the streets dropped by nearly 10%. Officials attribute the progress to urgent initiatives like Mayor Karen Bass's "Inside Safe" program, which focuses on moving people from encampments into interim housing such as hotels. While the number of people in temporary shelters has increased, the data suggests that investments in homelessness reduction are yielding positive results in getting people off the streets.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge has ordered prosecutors to show why the murder convictions of Erik and Lyle Menendez should not be reconsidered in light of new evidence. The brothers, convicted in 1996 for killing their parents, filed a petition based on a newly discovered letter from Erik detailing sexual abuse by their father, and a declaration from a former boy band member who also claims he was sexually assaulted by Jose Menendez. The judge found the evidence sufficient to potentially change the trial's outcome. This development could lead to a new trial or even release for the brothers, who are eligible for a parole hearing in August.</p>
