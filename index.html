          <p>This article recounts the investigation into the disappearance of Suzanne Morphew, a Colorado mother who vanished in May 2020. Initially, authorities considered various possibilities, including an abduction and the involvement of her husband, Barry Morphew. The investigation uncovered a secret love affair, financial troubles, and suspicious behavior from Barry, including unusual cell phone activity and multiple trash runs. Despite these clues, it took years to find Suzanne's remains and bring Barry to trial, which was ultimately dismissed before a second arrest. The article highlights the complex web of evidence and the challenges faced by investigators in solving this case.</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified a mysterious human skull, dubbed "dragon man," found in the 1930s as belonging to the Denisovan species. Initially, it was difficult to identify because DNA extraction from a tooth failed, leading researchers to use dental calculus, a calcified dental plaque. Researchers used bleach on the dental plaque in order to eliminate any possible modern-day DNA. This discovery marks the first intact Denisovan specimen, revealing that this group coexisted with modern humans and was closely related to Neanderthals. </p>

Trump also called Powell a "dumb guy" and accused him of being a "Trump Hater."

          <p>The United States' recent failure to reach a tariff deal with Japan and threats to impose new duties on imports may embolden China in trade negotiations. With the US struggling to secure agreements, China's negotiators might adopt a tougher stance. The US President Donald Trump imposed duties on Chinese imports to more than 100 per cent. Beijing's negotiators would draw strength from the US threat to notify trading partners of new duties and the lack of a US-Japan deal because both showed it was hard for Washington to get what it wanted through talks this summer.

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to keep two Michigan coal plants open and a Supreme Court ruling favoring fossil fuel firms in an emissions case marked a day of environmental setbacks in the US. The Department of Energy ordered the JH Campbell coal plant to remain open beyond its closure date, while the administration is expected to prolong the life of the Monroe power plant. These plants contribute significantly to Michigan's greenhouse gas pollution. Opponents argue the decision lacks support, could raise costs for ratepayers, and is ideologically driven.</p>

          <p>Scientists are trying to solve a decade-long mystery involving anomalous signals detected from below the ice in Antarctica. These strange radio waves emerged during a search for high-energy cosmic particles known as neutrinos. The signals came from below the horizon, suggesting they had passed through thousands of miles of rock, which should have absorbed them. Researchers believe these signals cannot be explained by the current understanding of particle physics, and follow-up observations have not been able to find the same signals.</p>
