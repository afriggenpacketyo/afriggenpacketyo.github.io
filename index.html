          <p>Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and James Lankford (R-OK) discussed the escalating political violence in the U.S. following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Both senators condemned the act and identified social media algorithms as a major driver of extremism and division, pushing the angriest voices to the forefront. They highlighted the thousands of threats against public officials and called for bipartisan solutions, such as the Kids Online Safety Act, to mitigate online radicalization and protect public discourse. The senators also touched upon the need to pass a budget and avoid a government shutdown despite the tense political climate.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham commented on the state of American democracy following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. He described the current era as a "dangerous place," drawing historical parallels to other periods when violence erupted over fundamental questions of national identity and inclusion. Meacham argued that when citizens lose the ability to engage in peaceful debate, they break the "American covenant" of living in contention without resorting to violence.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has stated that the nation's flag will not be surrendered to those who use it for division, following a large-scale "Unite the Kingdom" march in London. Organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, the event drew over 150,000 people and resulted in clashes with a smaller counter-protest, injuring 26 police officers and leading to 24 arrests. Starmer emphasized that while peaceful protest is a core value, assaults on police and intimidation will not be tolerated. The event also drew criticism for featuring a video message from Elon Musk urging protesters to "fight back."</p>

          <p>The Art Institute of Chicago is hosting a new exhibition titled "Gustave Caillebotte: Painting His World," offering a fresh perspective on the lesser-known French Impressionist painter. While Caillebotte is famous for his iconic "Paris Street; Rainy Day," the exhibition highlights his unconventional focus on male subjects in domestic and intimate settings, which was unusual for his time. Some of his works, like "The Floor Scrapers," were initially rejected by the art establishment for their realism and sensuous depiction of working-class men. The show aims to re-integrate Caillebotte into the Impressionist narrative and allow viewers to interpret his unique artistic vision.</p>

          <p>A columnist critiques the American culture of tipping, arguing it has become excessive and is now further enabled by a new federal law making up to $25,000 in tips tax-free. The author contends that this policy, while seemingly beneficial to workers, is a temporary measure that pressures consumers while allowing employers to avoid paying higher base wages. The article questions the eligibility criteria for the tax break, which includes professions like plumbers and digital content creators but excludes others like postal workers and teachers. The author ultimately advocates for eliminating tipping altogether to ensure fair and stable compensation for service workers.</p>

He contrasted this with the governor's failure to issue similar orders for other victims of political violence. Governor Reynolds called the decision "disgraceful," though Green received support from another supervisor who cited Kirk's divisive rhetoric as the reason for their stance.</p>

Rosen expresses concern that the system of checks and balances is failing, with Congress ceding power and the Supreme Court taking on an oversized role in deciding political questions.

The shooter, who died by a self-inflicted gunshot, had posted images of another school shooter and extremist symbols on his social media accounts.

The author criticizes tributes that portray Kirk as a virtuous practitioner of good-faith debate, arguing his campus events were trolling affairs designed to humiliate opponents and spread hateful rhetoric. The article asserts that an honest accounting of Kirk's life must acknowledge his opposition to civil rights, his promotion of replacement theory, and his history of denigrating remarks. Donegan concludes that the same values that demand condemnation of his murder should also demand a commitment to defeating the divisive politics he championed.</p>

Critics note the administration has recently cut funding for the very FDA and CDC offices that run successful tobacco control and prevention programs.

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, is calling for a full investigation into Prince Andrew over allegations that he sexually abused her. In a BBC interview, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, stated that every person, regardless of royal status, must be held accountable under the law. Giuffre alleged she was sexually abused by the prince three times when she was 17. While Prince Andrew has consistently denied the claims, he reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 without admitting liability, and Roberts feels the consequences so far have been insufficient.</p>

          <p>Recent developments in the U.S. media landscape suggest a growing influence of right-wing perspectives and allies of Donald Trump, raising concerns about press freedom. The article points to CBS News' parent company, Paramount, installing a Trump ally as an ombudsman and reportedly considering a purchase of CNN's parent company. Simultaneously, a settlement in the Murdoch family ensures Fox News will maintain its conservative direction for decades. These moves, along with changes at outlets like the Washington Post, are seen by some media critics as a capitulation to political pressure and a strategic shift toward a more partisan, and potentially more profitable, right-leaning model.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has brought renewed scrutiny to a state law that allows individuals with permits to carry firearms on college campuses. The law, passed in August, added to Utah's already permissive gun regulations, which include permitless carry. While the suspect's legal right to possess the rifle on campus is unclear, the timing has highlighted the debate over gun accessibility as a deterrent versus a risk. Proponents argue armed citizens deter "soft target" attacks, but critics contend that such policies are inadequate against ideologically motivated violence and create challenges for securing public events.</p>

          <p>The "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) campaign, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is reportedly increasing the stress and workload for parents trying to provide healthy food for their children. The movement condemns a wide range of ingredients, including seed oils and ultra-processed foods, pushing parents into time-consuming and expensive shopping habits to find compliant products. The article notes that while the campaign aims to improve children's health, its policy proposals offer little practical support for families, especially those with low incomes, potentially worsening the psychological burden on mothers who already face immense pressure to manage their children's nutrition.</p>

          <p>A growing backlash is targeting social media influencers who post videos of themselves provoking and wrestling with Australian wildlife, including dangerous crocodiles. One U.S. influencer, Mike Holston, is under investigation by Queensland authorities for videos showing him trapping and grappling with crocodiles, actions deemed "extremely dangerous and illegal." Animal rights groups like PETA are calling for his deportation, arguing that the animals are being cruelly used as props for online content. Experts worry that such viral videos encourage "copycat tourism," trivializing the harm caused to wildlife and putting both animals and people at risk for the sake of online popularity.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable act of bravery, surgeons at the Kyiv Heart Institute performed a life-saving heart transplant on a 12-year-old girl during one of the most intense Russian missile attacks on the city. The medical team, led by Dr. Borys Todurov, drove through explosions to retrieve the donor heart from another hospital. The heart came from a 4-year-old who had died in an accident. The transplant surgery for Kira Skliarova, whose own heart was severely weakened by illness, was then completed as the hospital building shook from nearby blasts, giving the young girl a new chance at life.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre has asserted that Lord Mandelson's appointment as the UK's ambassador to the United States was a mistake and "speaks to how deep the corruption goes." This follows Mandelson's recent dismissal after emails revealed his supportive messages to Jeffrey Epstein in 2008 as the financier faced jail for sex offenses. A government minister acknowledged that had the full extent of the relationship been known, the appointment would have been "highly unlikely." Giuffre's family criticized the system for allowing powerful individuals to maintain their status without accountability until survivors and their families force the issue into the public spotlight.</p>

          <p>A scrapbook gifted to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday, compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell and released by House Democrats, has renewed questions about what his powerful associates knew of his crimes. The book contains numerous messages with sexual innuendo, including an alleged note attributed to Donald Trump stating, "We have certain things in common, Jeffrey." Trump has denied the note's authenticity and is suing over its reporting. The book also lists figures like Bill Clinton under a "friends" section and includes crude cartoons, fueling speculation that Epstein's proclivities were an open secret among his elite circle.</p>
