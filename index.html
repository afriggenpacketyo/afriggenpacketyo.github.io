          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries officially endorsed Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, just ahead of early voting. Jeffries praised Mamdani's dedication to tackling the affordability crisis and his pledge to represent all city residents, regardless of their political alignment. This high-profile backing aligns Mamdani with key Democratic figures, including Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who previously endorsed him. The endorsement injects further dynamics into the race, as Mamdani's opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, has also secured significant support, including from outgoing Mayor Eric Adams. The political landscape suggests a highly contested general election, with Jeffries' support expected to become a focal point for Republican criticism.</p>

          <p>Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent commenced a new round of trade discussions in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, potentially paving the way for a summit between Presidents Xi and Trump. This marks their fifth face-to-face meeting since the US escalated its trade war in April, with a temporary trade truce nearing its expiration next month. The talks are crucial for addressing the complex economic and trade relations between the world's two largest economies, as both sides seek to navigate contentious issues. The resumption of high-level dialogue offers a cautious but positive sign for managing ongoing trade tensions and exploring pathways toward a more stable economic relationship before further tariff increases.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is forecast to rapidly intensify into a major hurricane this weekend, presenting a "life-threatening and catastrophic" risk of flash flooding and landslides across Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. Currently located southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, the storm is expected to deliver up to 25 inches of rain in some areas, with potential for even higher amounts in mountainous terrain. Forecasters warn of 140 mph winds, with Jamaica likely to experience the most severe impacts. Authorities have issued hurricane warnings and watches, emphasizing the urgent need for preparedness as the region braces for widespread devastation.</p>

          <h2>Xi's South Korea Visit Aims for 'Symbolic Restart' in Strained Ties</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 23:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to South Korea is being interpreted by experts as a carefully calibrated move to achieve a "symbolic restart" for the strained bilateral relationship. While immediate major breakthroughs are not anticipated, the trip aims to foster trust and improve communication after a period of heightened tensions. Xi's previous visit in 2014 led to a free-trade agreement, but subsequent diplomatic exchanges revealed complexities, particularly regarding the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. This current engagement signifies a mutual desire to stabilize ties and explore avenues for cooperation, acknowledging the delicate balance of regional diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement officers opened fire on a U-Haul truck that reversed erratically towards personnel outside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, during protests against an immigration enforcement crackdown. The incident, captured on video, resulted in the driver sustaining non-life-threatening injuries and being taken into custody after a mental health evaluation. This occurred amidst day-long demonstrations following the Trump administration's planned immigration surge in the Bay Area, which was later canceled. Protesters had gathered to oppose the operation, which DHS stated would target criminal undocumented individuals, including murderers, sexual assaulters, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of "fabricating a new eternal war" following the deployment of the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier to the Caribbean. This move is part of the Trump administration's escalating military presence and campaign against alleged drug traffickers, which has involved ten airstrikes and resulted in at least 43 deaths. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated the deployment aims to disrupt transnational criminal organizations. However, analysts suggest the military buildup is intended to destabilize Maduro's government and pressure his inner circle, rather than solely combating drug trade. Maduro, a long-standing critic of Trump, vehemently denies US allegations of his involvement in drug trafficking.</p>

Both airlines argue that the decision is "arbitrary and capricious," predicting substantial financial losses and severe disruptions to flight operations, including potential route cancellations and reduced consumer benefits of up to $800 million annually.

          <p>The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has confirmed the first West Nile virus death of the year, involving an individual hospitalized in the San Fernando Valley with neurological illness. This fatality highlights the ongoing public health concern, with 14 infections recorded across L.A. County in 2025, primarily concentrated in the San Fernando Valley. Research from the National Institutes of Health suggests that drought conditions, which the region has experienced, can paradoxically increase the risk of West Nile virus. This occurs by consolidating infected mosquito and bird populations around fewer water sources, thereby accelerating transmission rates to humans. Officials emphasize the potential for severe, life-threatening symptoms and permanent effects from the virus.</p>

          <p>Dozens of executives and companies have contributed to fund President Trump's $300 million White House ballroom, which will replace the East Wing, sparking concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Many donors, including Big Tech firms, defense contractors, and cryptocurrency companies, are reportedly seeking favorable policy decisions, reduced federal scrutiny, or approval for major deals from the administration. The White House maintains the project is funded solely through private donations and the president's own money. This article details specific examples, such as YouTube's settlement contribution, Palantir's increased government contracts, and Nvidia's granted export licenses to China, illustrating the intricate relationship between financial contributions and potential influence on federal policy.</p>

          <p>A Santa Cruz sea otter, potentially the renowned "841" or a related individual, has once again begun attacking surfers and commandeering their surfboards at the popular Steamer Lane. This resurgence of curious and bold behavior mirrors incidents from two years prior, though the current otter is untagged, leaving its precise identity unclear. Federal wildlife officials had previously attempted to capture 841, who subsequently gave birth and ceased her interactions with humans. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, designated as the lead response agency, has not yet issued a statement, while California authorities currently have no plans for intervention, leaving surfers to contend with the persistent otter.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased at an annual rate of 3% in September, coming in slightly below economists' forecasts, with the influence of President Trump's tariffs remaining subdued. This crucial economic data was released despite the ongoing government shutdown, as it is necessary for calculating the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment. Economists suggest that while tariffs contribute to rising prices, businesses are absorbing some costs, passing on up to 55% to consumers. The report presents a complex scenario for the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision, balancing persistent inflation with a notable slowdown in job growth, though a rate cut is still widely expected due to labor market concerns (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Ontario has announced it will pause its anti-tariff ad campaign targeting the U.S., effective Monday, following President Trump's threat to terminate all trade negotiations with Canada. Trump fiercely criticized the ad, which featured excerpts from a 1987 Ronald Reagan speech on the disadvantages of tariffs, labeling it "FAKE" and alleging it was designed to interfere with a pending Supreme Court decision on his tariff strategy. Ontario Premier Doug Ford stated the campaign successfully reached U.S. audiences and initiated a dialogue about the economic impact of tariffs. This article underscores the significant escalation in trade tensions between the two neighboring nations, despite Canada's efforts to engage in constructive dialogue.</p>

Her mother returned home alone three days later and has since refused to cooperate with authorities, making her the central focus of the FBI and Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office investigation.

          <p>President Donald Trump has granted clemency to Changpeng Zhao, a prominent cryptocurrency mogul who previously pleaded guilty to violating anti-money-laundering laws during his tenure as CEO of Binance. This pardon follows Zhao's extensive lobbying efforts and his connections to Trump's inner circle, including Binance's reported involvement in developing code for a stablecoin used by World Liberty Financial, a crypto startup co-founded by Trump's sons. Critics argue this clemency exemplifies Trump's pattern of using presidential pardons to reward political loyalty and financial contributions, rather than as a "benign prerogative." The move signals potential for Binance's reentry into the U.S. market and aligns with Trump's stated goal of making America the "crypto capital of the world" (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>West Ham United is enduring its worst start to a Premier League season in 52 years, marked by a third consecutive defeat under new manager Nuno Espirito Santo, who remains winless. The club currently sits 19th in the table with a dismal four points, leading to a "perilous" situation. A major concern is their defensive record, having conceded 20 goals, including a record nine from corners—the most by any team at this stage in competition history. Critics, like former goalkeeper Rob Green, have questioned Nuno's tactical choices, emphasizing the urgent need for the team to change its attitude, preparation, and work ethic to avoid potential relegation.</p>

          <p>As clocks revert and winter nights lengthen, particularly in Scotland's northern isles where daylight can drop to under six hours, over a million people in the UK experience Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Symptoms include lowered mood, irritability, and difficulties concentrating. This article highlights various coping strategies, such as light therapy, engaging in creative and cultural activities, and establishing new "light routines." Professor Hester Parr notes the challenges faced by rural communities with limited support, leading to initiatives like Orkney's "Wintering Well" boxes, which provide therapeutic lamps and mental health guides.

The committee argues that such a cut, reportedly considered to incentivize investment in stocks and shares, is unlikely to achieve its goal of fostering an investment culture. With the Chancellor facing an estimated £22bn budget shortfall, changes to ISAs were reportedly being mulled but met significant opposition from financial institutions and consumer advocates.

          <p>A significant shift in UK driving preferences is underway, with one in three cars now automatic and a quarter of driving tests taken in automatic vehicles last year. This trend is largely influenced by the impending 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars, as electric vehicles are exclusively automatic. New drivers face a dilemma: learning manual offers greater vehicle versatility, but automatic tests are perceived as quicker, despite official statistics showing a lower pass rate. This article explores the challenges, including a shortage of automatic instructors and higher lesson costs, alongside the evolving social perceptions and accessibility benefits for individuals with disabilities.</p>
