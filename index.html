        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has begun hearings on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's request for a temporary restraining order to prevent President Trump from firing her. Cook's lawsuit argues her removal is illegal, while Trump's lawyers contend the president has the discretion to remove a governor for cause, citing allegations of mortgage fraud. The outcome of this case could significantly impact the Federal Reserve's independence, as Trump aims to appoint a majority to the board, which he has criticized for not cutting interest rates. The dispute over presidential power and the central bank's autonomy may ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alibaba's U.S.-listed stock jumped as much as 12% after the company reported better-than-expected net income for its first fiscal quarter, largely driven by a 26% year-over-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division. This growth is fueled by strong demand for artificial intelligence services, with AI-related product revenue maintaining triple-digit growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. While overall revenue slightly missed forecasts due to heavy investment in China's competitive "quick commerce" sector, investors were encouraged by the cloud unit's performance and the company's focus on developing new AI chips.

Wilkins' complaint asserts these claims are malicious lies intended as "self-enriching clickbait," noting she is an American-born country singer with no ties to Israel.

          <p>Shares of the "buy now, pay later" company Affirm surged over 12% after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that significantly surpassed Wall Street's expectations. The company posted a net income of $69.2 million, a stark reversal from a loss in the same period last year, and its key volume metric grew by 44%. CEO Max Levchin attributed the success to strong consumer spending and growth in partnerships with major retailers like Shopify and Amazon, which offset the loss of Walmart as a client.

          <p>The "de minimis" trade exemption, which allowed shipments valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, has been officially terminated by an executive order from President Donald Trump. This sudden policy change is causing significant disruption for global supply chains, forcing retailers of all sizes to re-evaluate their business models and potentially leading to higher prices for consumers. The exemption, heavily utilized by e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu, had been criticized as a loophole that facilitated unfair competition and allowed unsafe goods into the country.

          <p>A UK Court of Appeal ruling has permitted the government to continue housing asylum seekers at the Bell Hotel in Epping, providing a technical legal victory for ministers. This decision prevents a potential wave of similar legal challenges from other local councils that could have disrupted the asylum accommodation system. However, the ruling creates a political dilemma for the Labour government, as it has been forced to argue in favor of using hotels, a policy it has promised to end. Political opponents are now criticizing the government for prioritizing migrants over local communities, increasing pressure on ministers to find alternative solutions.</p>

While former vice presidents are legally entitled to six months of protection after leaving office, the Biden administration had extended Harris's detail for an additional year due to a heightened threat environment. A new executive memorandum has directed the Department of Homeland Security to rescind this extension, effective September 1. This decision follows a recent threat assessment that reportedly found no specific alarms warranting continued protection beyond the standard period.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed new regulations that would prohibit the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from performing abortions, even in cases of sexual assault and incest. The draft rule, which also forbids VA providers from counseling veterans about the procedure, includes a narrow exception only when the mother's life is endangered. This move would reverse a 2022 Biden administration policy that expanded abortion access for veterans following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The proposal has drawn significant criticism from abortion rights advocates and female veterans, who argue it will endanger women's lives and strip them of essential healthcare.</p>

The move reflects a push by the Trump administration and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to restore Confederate symbols that were recently removed.

Through international collaborations and educational programs, India promotes yoga not just as a wellness activity but as a means to foster people-to-people ties and project a non-threatening, civilizational influence. However, the practice faces criticism for over-commercialization and concerns that its association with Hindu nationalism could undermine its universal appeal.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber made baseball history by hitting four home runs in a single game against the Atlanta Braves, becoming just the 21st player to achieve the feat. He had a chance to hit a record-breaking fifth home run in his final at-bat but popped out against a position player, infielder Vidal Bruján, who was pitching in the blowout game. This outcome averted a potential controversy, as hitting a historic homer off a non-pitcher lobbing slow pitches would have likely been viewed as illegitimate by many. Schwarber's four home runs brought his season total to an MLB-leading 49.</p>

After the loss, Amorim stated the team was "completely lost" and that "something has to change," which led to speculation about his future at the club. Speaking on Friday, he clarified that such emotional reactions are part of his character, saying, "Sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years." Despite the debate his words caused, Amorim is understood to retain the support of the club's ownership.</p>

          <p>An immigrant detainee, Luis Manuel Rivas Velásquez, who was believed by his family to have died at a Florida detention facility nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz" after collapsing, has been found alive. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had transferred him without notifying his family or lawyers, first to a facility at Fort Bliss, Texas, and then again to another center. His lawyers describe the conditions at the Florida camp as a "living hell" and allege he received delayed medical care. They consider the repeated, unannounced transfers as potential retribution for his speaking out about the poor conditions for detainees.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of the Interior has drafted a proposal to significantly expand its list of "critical minerals," adding 51 commodities including copper, lead, and silicon. This strategic move is aimed at preventing potential supply-chain disruptions and reducing economic reliance on foreign sources, particularly China. The designation as a critical mineral can guide government investment, provide tax incentives, and expedite permitting for domestic mining and material recovery projects. This policy is expected to support the onshoring of production for key industries like semiconductors, automotive manufacturing, and solar panels, enhancing national and economic security.</p>

Paetongtarn, who is the daughter of former PM Thaksin Shinawatra, accepted the verdict but maintained her actions were intended to de-escalate the conflict.

          <p>President Trump has informed Congress he will not spend $4.9 billion in foreign aid that was previously approved, using a rare executive maneuver known as a "pocket rescission." By proposing to cancel the funds late in the fiscal year, the administration ensures Congress does not have the required 45 days to act, causing the funding to expire on September 30. This tactic, last used in 1977, effectively allows the president to cut spending without legislative approval, raising concerns about bypassing Congress's constitutional power of the purse. The cuts target programs under the State Department and USAID.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed a new regulation to replace open-ended visas for international students, cultural exchange visitors, and foreign journalists with fixed-term limits. Under the proposal, student (F) and exchange (J) visas would be limited to a maximum of four years, while media (I) visas would be valid for up to 240 days, requiring holders to apply for extensions to continue their stay. The administration states the change is necessary for better monitoring and oversight of visa holders.

The article argues that by pressuring developers to avoid certain data and restricting government research on marginalized communities, the policy will lead to biased AI models. These tools, which are increasingly used for medical diagnoses and treatment plans, could encode and automate existing health inequities for decades. The article draws parallels to historical instances where flawed, race-based assumptions were built into clinical tools, causing long-term harm to patients.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD reported a nearly 30% drop in profits for the second quarter compared to the previous year, despite a significant surge in overseas sales. The Shenzhen-based company attributed the decline to an intense price war in the highly competitive Chinese domestic market, which has adversely impacted the industry's profitability. While BYD's deliveries to foreign customers grew by over 144% year-on-year, its overall first-half earnings and revenue fell short of analyst expectations. The results highlight the challenge Chinese EV makers face in balancing domestic market pressures with international expansion efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

Increasing HOA dues, higher insurance premiums, and new building reserve requirements are adding significant monthly expenses for owners. Real estate agents advise that when these ongoing costs are factored in, the long-term affordability of a cheaper condo can be nearly the same as that of a more expensive single-family home.
