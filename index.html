          <p>A Goldman Sachs survey reveals that investment firms for ultra-wealthy families are shifting their portfolios, increasing average allocations to public equities to 31% while decreasing private equity to 21%. This change reflects a "pro-risk" strategy despite concerns about geopolitical issues and inflation, with many offices preparing to invest opportunistically during market dislocations. The survey also highlights a strong interest in AI, primarily through public stocks and ETFs, and a continued, albeit reduced, focus on private equity, particularly in secondary markets.

          <p>The killing of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk has drawn widespread condemnation from across the American political spectrum. Figures from former presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama to current President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance expressed shock and offered condolences to his family. President Trump attributed the act to "radical left" rhetoric and ordered flags to be flown at half-staff. The event has highlighted the intense political polarization in the country, with some lawmakers calling for civility while others engaged in heated arguments on the House floor following the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, is facing questions regarding the purchase of an £885,000 home in his Clacton constituency, which was bought in his partner Laure Ferrari's name. A BBC investigation challenges Farage's claim that Ferrari could afford the property using her family's wealth, finding little evidence to support significant financial means. Critics suggest the arrangement may have been a way to avoid over £44,000 in stamp duty for a second home, opening Farage to accusations of hypocrisy after he criticized another politician for similar tax avoidance. Farage denies any financial interest in the property.</p>

          <p>More than 300 South Korean workers, detained in a U.S. immigration raid for allegedly working illegally at an electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia, are being sent home. The incident caused diplomatic friction, with South Korea's president warning it could impact future investment in the U.S. Following negotiations, the U.S. agreed that the workers would be transported without restraints and would not be barred from future reentry. The situation highlights a clash between U.S. efforts to boost domestic manufacturing and its immigration policies, as South Korea currently lacks a specific visa quota for its skilled technicians.</p>

          <p>The article profiles Slovenian basketball superstar Luka Doncic, highlighting his exceptional offensive skills and polarizing on-court behavior. Renowned for his versatility and game control, Doncic has been a dominant force in the NBA since being named Rookie of the Year in his debut season with the Dallas Mavericks. However, he has also faced criticism for his defensive shortcomings, perceived fitness issues, and frequent arguments with officials. A controversial trade to the Los Angeles Lakers in February underscored these tensions, though he has since signed a new contract and expressed renewed motivation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The once-common teenage rite of passage of babysitting has largely been replaced by a professionalized industry of adult caregivers, driven by parental safety concerns and busier teen schedules. This shift means teenagers are missing out on a key opportunity to develop responsibility, critical thinking, and social skills outside of structured, adult-led activities. Experts argue that having older, but not adult, role models is also beneficial for young children, fostering a unique kind of mentorship and play. The decline of teen babysitting reflects broader societal trends of increased isolation and the erosion of community ties.</p>

Routh, who has dismissed his lawyers and is representing himself, faces five criminal counts that could result in a life sentence. The trial is being overseen by Judge Aileen Cannon, who has barred Routh from arguing his actions were justified or protected by free speech.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has dismissed Peter Mandelson from his post as the U.K. Ambassador to the United States following the release of new documents detailing his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The Foreign Office stated that emails, including one where Mandelson called Epstein his "best pal," revealed a connection "materially different" from what was known at the time of his appointment. The dismissal comes at a sensitive time, just before a U.S. presidential state visit, and complicates diplomatic relations as the U.K. seeks to maintain its "special relationship" with the U.S. administration.</p>

          <p>The widespread, unauthorized use of AI tools like ChatGPT is undermining the core educational mission of colleges and universities by enabling rampant cheating, according to this article. While some institutions are embracing and integrating AI, the author argues this is a misguided surrender. To preserve academic integrity and foster genuine learning, the article proposes a radical "de-teching" of campuses, including banning Wi-Fi, laptops, and smartphones, and returning to low-tech methods supplemented by controlled computer lab access. This approach, though seemingly draconian, is presented as necessary to create an environment where students can learn to think critically.</p>

While Harry stated his father is "doing great" amid his cancer treatment, there was no meeting with his brother, Prince William, with whom relations reportedly remain non-existent.

The landmark decision was a victory for two couples who challenged the existing legislation as archaic and patriarchal. The case argued that the law perpetuated harmful stereotypes by denying men a choice that is available to women. Parliament will now be required to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the court's ruling, which was not opposed by the government's ministers.</p>

The UAE has publicly stated that annexation is a "red line," forcing a potential confrontation that could unravel the agreements and prevent further expansion.

          <p>The English Football Association has charged Chelsea Football Club with 74 alleged rule breaches related to payments made to agents between 2009 and 2022. The charges primarily cover the period when the club was owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and concern intermediaries and third-party investments in players. The club's new ownership, led by Todd Boehly, self-reported the potential breaches after discovering them during the due diligence process of their 2022 purchase. While potential sanctions range from fines to a points deduction, Chelsea's cooperation with the investigation will be considered.</p>

          <p>In a landmark ruling, a Spanish court has sided with residents of the Galicia region who sued local authorities over unchecked pollution from industrial pig farming. The claimants argued that nitrate runoff from massive amounts of pig waste has contaminated drinking water, destroyed the local ecosystem, and violated their human rights. The court ordered authorities to compensate the residents, clean up the polluted river, and implement preventative measures. This case is the first of its kind in Europe and could set a precedent for other communities fighting environmental damage from industrial agriculture.</p>

          <p>The U.S. space agency, NASA, has barred Chinese citizens from accessing its facilities, materials, and networks, effectively preventing them from working on its programs. The move, confirmed by NASA as a measure to "ensure the security of our work," affects Chinese nationals who were contributing as contractors or students. This restriction reflects the escalating geopolitical competition and national security concerns between the U.S. and China, particularly in the context of an accelerating "second space race." The ban further curtails scientific collaboration between the two nations, which was already strained by U.S. laws.</p>

          <p>Olympic swimmer Ben Proud has become the first British athlete to join the Enhanced Games, a controversial event that permits the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Proud defended his decision by highlighting the financial incentives, stating that the prize money from a single race could surpass what he would earn from 13 world championship titles. The 30-year-old athlete acknowledged the criticism from governing bodies like Aquatics GB but argued that traditional sport does not provide enough income for retirement. The Enhanced Games, criticized by anti-doping agencies as dangerous, plans its inaugural event for 2026.</p>

          <p>At least 19 people have been killed and several others are missing after severe flash floods and landslides struck two islands in Indonesia, including the popular tourist destination of Bali. Heavy rainfall, exacerbated by climate change which has altered monsoon patterns, caused widespread damage across seven districts in Bali and on the nearby island of Flores. Rescue operations are ongoing, with authorities using excavators and drones to search for the missing. Over 500 people have been evacuated from their homes, taking refuge in makeshift shelters set up in schools and mosques.</p>

          <p>Attendees at the Utah Valley University event where conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot have described a scene of chaos and terror immediately following the single gunshot. Eyewitnesses reported hearing a loud bang before seeing Kirk fall, which triggered mass panic as the crowd of approximately 3,000 people dropped to the ground and then scrambled for cover. Some witnesses expressed surprise at the lack of security measures, such as bag checks, at the outdoor event. The shooting, which occurred moments after Kirk had been discussing gun violence, left many attendees shaken and traumatized.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is the latest and one of the most prominent examples of a new era of political violence in the United States. Experts suggest the current climate, marked by intense polarization, economic anxiety, and demonizing rhetoric from political leaders, is comparable to fraught periods like 1968. The article explores how a sense of democratic despair can lead individuals to believe violence is the only solution. While leaders from both parties condemned the killing, the event immediately fueled further partisan blame, highlighting the challenge of de-escalating a cycle of violence in a deeply divided nation.</p>

          <p>A decade after the first detection of gravitational waves, scientists have used the improved sensitivity of LIGO detectors to confirm a key theory proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1971. By analyzing the waves from a collision of two black holes, researchers verified Hawking's area theorem, which states that the surface area of a resulting black hole can never be smaller than the sum of the areas of the original black holes. The observation, made possible by significant upgrades to the detectors, marks a major milestone in gravitational wave astronomy. Hawking, who passed away in 2018, had hoped this prediction could be tested with such data.</p>
