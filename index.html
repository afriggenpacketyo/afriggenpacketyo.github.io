          <p>A police officer in Alvarado, Texas, was shot in the neck but has since been released from the hospital after responding to a call about a suspicious person. The incident occurred outside an ICE detention facility on the Fourth of July. Authorities report that multiple armed suspects, some wearing body armor, were taken into custody after an apparent attempt to lure law enforcement to the scene with fireworks. The Justice Department is closely monitoring the situation as an investigation into the motive continues.</p>

          <p>Severe flash floods have devastated central Texas's Hill Country, leading to at least 32 deaths, including 14 children. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically, by 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching communities and a children's summer camp by surprise. More than two dozen people, primarily from Camp Mystic, remain missing, prompting extensive search and rescue operations involving hundreds of personnel and aircraft. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a federal disaster declaration for the affected counties.</p>

          <p>Following his public feud with President Trump, Elon Musk announced the formation of the 'America Party,' but experts highlight the immense challenges involved. Creating a new national political party requires navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws, overcoming high ballot access thresholds, and facing intense legal opposition from established parties. While Musk's vast wealth could fund such an effort, the process would likely take years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars, making a significant impact by the 2026 midterms improbable.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced that eight individuals with extensive violent criminal records were deported to South Sudan on July 4th. The agency stated the removal followed weeks of legal delays, which were ultimately resolved by a Supreme Court ruling allowing the enforcement of a third-country removal policy. The deported men, originally from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Burma, Vietnam, and South Sudan, had convictions for severe crimes including murder, sexual assault, and armed robbery. DHS framed the action as a victory for public safety.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Newport Beach, California, rescued 350 people on the Fourth of July holiday as dangerous surf conditions created powerful rip currents. In one dramatic instance, a police helicopter captured footage of rescuers saving more than 10 people who were pulled far from shore by a 'monster rip current.' The National Weather Service has issued warnings for strong rip currents and hazardous swimming conditions through the weekend for several Southern California coastal areas. The warnings are due to elevated surf creating waves that can easily pull swimmers out to sea.</p>

This marks a potential shift from the mantra established under coach Brendon McCullum, where drawing a match was not considered an option.

          <p>President Donald Trump is facing criticism from Jewish organizations after using the antisemitic term 'Shylock' during a rally in Iowa to describe some bankers. The Anti-Defamation League called the use of the slur, which originates from a Jewish moneylender character in Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice,' 'very troubling and irresponsible.' When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware of the term's offensive connotations, stating he simply viewed it as a term for a moneylender charging high rates. Critics argue the comment normalizes dangerous antisemitic tropes.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most significant event in world history since the birth of Christ for creating the concept of a 'citizen.' He emphasized that the nation's founding was a bloody civil war, and understanding its complexity and violence makes its ideals even more inspiring. Burns argued that Americans have always been divided, and the solution lies in engaging with history and each other, rather than succumbing to anger and distrust. He stressed that citizenship is an active, ongoing responsibility of lifelong learning.</p>

          <p>Colombian authorities have arrested the alleged mastermind behind the June 7 shooting of conservative senator and presidential candidate Miguel Uribe. The suspect, identified as Elder José Arteaga Hernández, was taken into custody in Bogota and faces charges including attempted homicide and using minors to commit crimes. Uribe was shot twice in the head during a political rally and remains in intensive care. The attack, allegedly carried out by a minor hired by Arteaga, has been widely condemned as a threat to democracy in a country with a history of political violence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis examines the fiscal consequences of taxing billionaires' wealth growth at rates comparable to middle-class income. It clarifies that while the wealthiest Americans pay a legal 16% average federal income tax rate, their effective tax rate on wealth growth is much lower, around 3.4%, due to strategies like 'buy-borrow-die.' If the top 25 billionaires were taxed at 20% on their wealth growth, it could generate an estimated $80 billion in revenue, which could fund major public services. The article highlights that the core issue is the system's focus on taxing labor over wealth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is facing criticism for an email claiming President Trump's new spending bill eliminates federal taxes on benefits for most recipients. Critics, including former SSA officials, label this as 'blatant misinformation,' explaining the bill does not eliminate the tax but provides a temporary deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors, which phases out for higher earners. They argue the communication is misleadingly partisan and misrepresents the actual, more modest impact of the legislation. The framing has caused confusion among beneficiaries.

          <p>A focus group of 2024 Labour voters from Kent constituencies expressed a strong sense of disappointment with the party's first year in government. Participants felt that the government had not delivered on its promises, particularly on immigration, and some felt they had been 'lied to.' While some were forgiving, acknowledging the difficulty of turning the country around in one year, others were concerned by recent policy U-turns, viewing them as a sign of a lack of direction. The discussion also revealed that some of these voters are now considering supporting Reform UK in a future election.</p>

          <p>Following a devastating flood that killed over 30 people, an expert explains why Texas Hill Country is one of the most dangerous places in the U.S. for flash flooding. The region's geography, featuring steep hills, shallow rivers, and soil that absorbs little water, creates the perfect conditions for rapid and destructive floods. The Balcones Escarpment can amplify downpours, causing rivers like the Guadalupe to rise at an alarming rate, as seen in the recent tragedy. Improving forecasting, public education about the dangers of driving in floodwaters, and better road closure systems are key to enhancing safety.</p>

McMurdock has denied any wrongdoing, stating his business dealings were compliant, but requested the whip be suspended as a 'precautionary measure' pending an internal party investigation.

Pro-democracy advocates warn that such rhetoric, regardless of its legal feasibility, creates a chilling effect on free speech and political opposition. The article argues that the threat itself is an attack on freedom, making citizens fear retaliation for criticizing the president.</p>
