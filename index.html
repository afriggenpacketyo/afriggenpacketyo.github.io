          <p>As his 100th day approaches, President Trump intensifies efforts to broker a Ukraine peace deal, dispatching envoy Steve Witkoff to Moscow for discussions with President Putin. Despite Trump's pressure, Russia has continued attacks, leading to a rare rebuke from the U.S. president on social media. The Kremlin remains amiable but firm in negotiations, testing Trump's patience as he aims for a swift resolution to the three-year conflict at the cost of territorial concession from Ukraine. Optimism remains cautious as the situation unfolds.</p>

          <p>A new study by UC San Diego researchers suggests that early childhood exposure to colibactin, a bacterial toxin produced by certain strains of E. coli, may increase the risk of early-onset colorectal cancer. Analyzing colorectal cancer genomes, researchers found that individuals exposed to colibactin were more likely to develop the cancer before age 50. While the study shows a strong association, it doesn't prove causation, further research is needed to develop screening tests and prevention strategies. The findings highlight the critical role of early-life microbial exposures in long-term cancer risk.</p>

          <p>The American economy under President Trump's second term is showing signs of stagflation, with stock markets warning of a recession and bond markets anticipating inflation. Trump's tariffs are likened to self-inflicted oil shocks, disrupting the economy and potentially leading to higher prices, reduced demand, and job losses. The grim fact about stagflation is that—once stumbled into—it is very hard to escape, and the grim fact about Trump is that his bad faith and poor choices once ruined only those who made the voluntary personal or corporate decision to do business with him. But no one can choose to sit out Trump’s trade war.</p>
