          <p>China is expected to actively participate in mediating a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, although analysts caution about the limitations of Beijing's influence. Both countries have exchanged strikes for five consecutive days, prompting China to advise its citizens to evacuate both nations due to the deteriorating security situation. President Xi Jinping has urged all involved parties to de-escalate the conflict and has offered China's support in restoring stability to the Middle East. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has communicated with his Iranian and Israeli counterparts, condemning Israel's actions while expressing China's readiness to help resolve the conflict.</p>

          <p>Karen Read, accused of killing her boyfriend in a drunken hit-and-run, may have strategically used media interviews to sway the jury. Legal experts suggest her defense might be aiming for a conviction on the lesser charge of operating under the influence. Jurors' questions during deliberations indicate a focus on the OUI charge, potentially giving them something to agree on rather than the more serious second-degree murder charge. Read spoke to reporters and sat for interviews after her mistrial, a move some experts deemed risky, but it could lead to a lighter sentence. Optimism score is relative to the fact that the victim in this case is deceased.</p>

The plan includes monitoring mineral shortages, coordinating responses to market disruptions, and diversifying mining, processing, manufacturing, and recycling efforts. While the plan avoids directly naming China, it addresses concerns about China's dominance in rare earths and its history of using export controls.</p>

          <p>The debate over whether the US should support Israel in attacking Iran has revealed deep rifts among Donald Trump's supporters. Trump is reportedly considering assisting in targeting Iran's nuclear facilities, sparking conflict between isolationist and hawkish factions within his party. Some Republicans, like Congressman Thomas Massie, are joining Democrats to block unauthorized military action against Iran. Figures like Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon are advocating for non-intervention, warning against involvement in another Middle Eastern conflict.</p>

The Trump administration argued that the deployment was necessary due to violent riots in Los Angeles, while California argued that the federalization of the National Guard was unlawful.
