          <p>Former Auburn men's basketball coach Bruce Pearl has been hired by CBS as a college basketball analyst, joining the network's NCAA tournament coverage. This move comes after his departure from Auburn, where he became an ambassador for the program and handed coaching duties to his son. The article notes ESPN host Michael Wilbon's previous comments hoping Pearl was "pushed out" due to being "divisive," which Pearl attributed to political differences, particularly regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict. Pearl maintains he was not forced out and looks forward to advocating for faith, family, and Israel in his new capacity.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's suggestion to deploy federal troops in San Francisco has prompted prominent tech investor Ron Conway to resign from the Salesforce Foundation board. Conway, a significant Democratic donor, cited misaligned values with Benioff's comments, which were amplified by figures like Elon Musk. Benioff later clarified that city and state leaders are primarily responsible for safety, but the controversy highlights tensions over urban safety and political divides. San Francisco leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have rejected the idea of federal troop deployment, asserting that crime rates are decreasing.</p>

Historically, such authorizations have led to diverse operations, from funding insurgencies to targeted killings.

          <p>This article critiques Apple's "Live Translation" feature for AirPods, highlighting its significant struggles in real-world, noisy environments and its limited support for regional Spanish dialects. The author's attempts to use the beta feature in a Hispanic neighborhood were hampered by ambient noise warnings, translation delays, and misinterpretations of Mexican Spanish terms. The article questions Apple's optimization for Spain's Spanish over more prevalent Latin American varieties in the US, suggesting deeper issues with AI translation's ability to capture cultural nuances. It concludes that the feature, despite its science-fiction promise, falls short in practical application.</p>

          <h2>A Century-Old Fable Foretells a Frightening American Future of Political Chaos and Corporate Power</h2>

          <p>This article revisits Henry Dwight Sedgwick's 1904 short story, "The American Coup d'Etat of 1961," which eerily imagined a future America grappling with political chaos, unchecked presidential power, and corporate dominance. The fable depicts a tech mogul's rise to power amidst economic collapse, a president seeking a third term, and a Congress reduced to a rubber stamp. Sedgwick's grim vision, written during Theodore Roosevelt's era, served as a critique of materialism, corruption, and imperial ambitions. The article highlights the story's enduring relevance as a "fable of an America that’s lost its moorings."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly planning to build an "Arc de Trump" triumphal arch in Washington D.C., across from the Lincoln Memorial, to commemorate the country's 250th anniversary. This article details the proposed privately funded monument, modeled after Paris's Arc de Triomphe, as part of Trump's broader vision for reshaping the capital. The plans, which include a gilded White House makeover and a $250 million ballroom, face significant hurdles due to complex federal approval processes for new memorials, which typically take years and require congressional consent.</p>
