          <h2>Warner Bros. Discovery Announces Plans for Corporate Split</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 07:29:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) announced its plan to split into two distinct public companies by mid-2026, marking a significant shift in the media landscape as consumers increasingly transition from traditional cable to streaming services. The restructuring will create a streaming and studios company, encompassing movie properties and HBO Max, and a global networks company, including CNN, TNT Sports, and Discovery. CEO David Zaslav will lead the streaming and studios company, while current CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels will head the global networks business. This strategic move aims to empower the iconic brands with sharper focus and flexibility to compete effectively in the evolving media market, mirroring Comcast's ongoing spin-off of its cable networks into Versant. The decision follows restructuring announcements made in December, signaling a precursor to this complete separation. The market reacted to the news with Warner Bros. Discovery shares being halted in extended trading. Optimism remains relatively high as the company positions itself for long-term success by adapting to the changing media landscape.</p>

Despite not participating in the penalty shootout, he expressed his intention to stay with the club.

Key issues on the agenda include Chinese exports of rare earth metals and Washington's restrictions on China's access to US technology. While previous talks in Geneva led to a temporary reduction in tariffs, both countries have since accused each other of breaching the agreement, creating a need for further discussions.</p>

          <p>Protests have taken place in Los Angeles in response to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, leading President Trump to announce the deployment of 2,000 National Guard soldiers. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as unnecessary and inflaming tensions. ICE reported arresting 118 immigrants during operations in LA last week, sparking peaceful protests that later turned chaotic, with law enforcement using flash bangs, tear gas, and rubber bullets. Newsom has requested protesters to remain peaceful and has asked Trump to rescind his deployment of troops. Meanwhile, the 78th Annual Tony Awards were held, highlighting the diversity and talent of this Broadway season's shows.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces intercepted an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists en route to Gaza, stating that the vessel was being safely directed to Israeli shores. Defense Minister Israel Katz had vowed to prevent the ship from reaching Gaza, citing the need to maintain the naval blockade against Hamas. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organized the effort, claimed the activists were kidnapped and accused Israel of confiscating the ship's cargo of humanitarian aid. Israel's Foreign Ministry posted images of Thunberg and the crew, stating they would be returned to their home countries, while also affirming that any aid would be sent to Gaza. After a three-month total blockade aimed at pressuring Hamas, Israel started allowing some basic aid into Gaza last month, but humanitarian workers have warned of famine unless the blockade and the war end.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is preparing to argue that emissions from US power plants are insignificant enough to warrant no climate regulation. However, analysis shows that these emissions contribute 5% of global planet-heating pollution since 1990. The EPA plans to remove restrictions on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants. Experts argue that this policy will cause significant harm and increase future costs, with a single year of emissions in 2022 causing 5,300 deaths in the US and $370 billion in global damages. This move is part of a broader deregulatory effort targeting clean air and water protections.</p>

Chicago's Welcoming City ordinance restricts city agencies from sharing information on undocumented immigrants with ICE. However, conservative city council members have attempted to change Chicagoâ€™s sanctuary city status.

          <p>Theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek explores the concept of quasi-worlds and their implications for quantum research, questioning the fundamental distinction between the universe we know and these quasi-worlds. He discusses how physics inside materials can be described using the same ideas used in fundamental physics in empty space. The notion of the world as a material is ancient, with ideas dating back to Aristotle and Plato. The article also touches on debates from the Scientific Revolution and the theories of Descartes and Newton. The fruitful application of these concepts has made modern electronics and computer technology possible.</p>

The article explores how the musical, based on Victor Hugo's novel, has been adopted by various political movements, including the MAGA movement. Hugo, a champion of freedom and democracy, would likely have been repelled by Trump's demagoguery, reminiscent of Napoleon III, whom Hugo opposed. The author suggests that Trump's attacks on the arts and free expression increase the likelihood that any future American equivalent of 'Les MisÃ©rables' will have to be written in exile.</p>

          <p>Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are facing challenges under the second Trump administration, including potential cuts to federal funding and grants. Despite Trump's pledge to support HBCUs, recent actions, such as funding cuts to Howard University, have raised concerns. Mark Brown, president of Tuskegee University, emphasizes that HBCUs are merit-based schools and not solely focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion. He highlights the importance of maintaining access to federal financial aid for students at HBCUs. The article also explores the economic impact of HBCUs and the need for political neutrality in education.</p>

          <p>NPR highlights five simple and inexpensive methods to reduce home energy use and combat climate change. These include opening windows for natural ventilation, utilizing ceiling fans, making roofs reflective, installing external shades, and sealing air leaks. Dorit Aviv from the University of Pennsylvania notes that reducing heat gain in hot months and heat loss in cold months is key to energy efficiency. Implementing these measures can lower energy bills and make homes more resilient to global warming. By adopting these climate solutions, homeowners can significantly reduce their carbon footprint without major investments.</p>

Sir David Attenborough has warned that bottom trawling is destroying areas of the seabed and marine life. Pressure is also building for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty at the UN Ocean Conference in Nice.

          <p>The concept of "coercive control," a pattern of controlling behavior, manipulation, and emotional abuse, is not being directly addressed in Sean "Diddy" Combs's trial on federal charges.

This raises questions about whether the jury can fully understand the dynamics of intimate partner violence and why witnesses maintained relationships with Combs for years. The case highlights the challenges of recognizing and prosecuting coercive control in the US legal system, which lacks precedent for addressing it as an ongoing pattern of abuse.</p>

          <p>California's fuel imports have surged to a four-year high in May, driven by refinery outages and a reliance on Asian trading partners. The state's petroleum product imports rose to 279,000 barrels per day, the highest since June 2021, with 70% coming from South Korea and other Asian exporters. Recent outages at refineries owned by Chevron, PBF Energy, and Valero have tightened supplies along the U.S. West Coast. Imports from the Bahamas, a rarely used trade route, hit a record high of 38,000 bpd.
