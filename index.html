          <p>A former sanitation worker at the Dharmasthala temple in Karnataka, India, has alleged that he was forced to dispose of hundreds of bodies, many showing signs of sexual assault, over a nearly 20-year period. In a police complaint, the man claims that temple supervisors covered up the crimes and threatened his life, forcing him to flee in 2014. The allegations, which include the murder of destitute men, have prompted the state government to form a Special Investigation Team. Families of individuals who disappeared or died mysteriously in the area are now calling for their cases to be reopened as part of the new probe.</p>

          <p>Shi Yongxin, the abbot of the world-famous Shaolin Temple in China, is under criminal investigation for multiple allegations including embezzlement and improper relationships with women. Known as the "CEO monk" for transforming the 1,500-year-old institution into a global brand, he has been stripped of his ordination certificate by China's Buddhist association. This is not the first time Shi has faced such accusations; he was previously investigated in 2015 for similar claims but was later cleared. The current probe has made him a top trending topic on Chinese social media, raising significant questions about the temple's governance under his leadership.</p>

          <p>A recent trade deal lowering U.S. tariffs on Japanese-made vehicles from 25% to 15% offers only partial relief to Japan's auto industry. Analysts caution that the new rate is still high and that a more significant challenge comes from the rapid rise of Chinese automakers, who are eroding Japan's market share globally, particularly in Southeast Asia. This external competition is compounded by domestic economic issues like high inflation and weak consumer spending, creating a difficult outlook for the sector. While larger companies like Toyota may be better positioned, smaller automakers face increasing pressure to innovate and form strategic partnerships to remain competitive. (not investment advice)</p>

Under the 15% tariff scenario, the U.S. is expected to import significantly less from major partners like China, Canada, and Mexico.

          <p>Japan's traditionally stable political landscape is being shaken by the surge of Sanseito, a far-right party that increased its parliamentary seats from one to fifteen in recent elections. Running on a "Japanese First" platform, the party has capitalized on public frustration with a sluggish economy, high inflation, and stagnant wages. Analysts note that the party's rise mirrors populist movements elsewhere, drawing parallels to Donald Trump's rhetoric and focusing heavily on anti-immigration and anti-tourist sentiment. This shift indicates a growing appetite for political change among Japanese voters, particularly the youth, who feel their concerns are not being addressed by the long-ruling establishment.</p>

          <p>White House Budget Director Russell Vought, a key author of the Project 2025 conservative plan, suggested that President Trump's recent criticism of the Federal Reserve is driven by a desire for lower interest rates, not the sweeping overhaul proposed in the blueprint. When questioned about the Project 2025 chapter on the Fed, Vought claimed, "I don't even know what that chapter says." While Project 2025 calls for limiting the Fed's mandate to stable money, Vought framed the administration's pressure on Chairman Jerome Powell as a response to global rate cuts and alleged fiscal mismanagement at the Fed, rather than a fundamental challenge to its existence.

          <p>A push to force a House vote on releasing federal files related to Jeffrey Epstein is causing a rift within the Republican party. House Speaker Mike Johnson has labeled the measure, co-sponsored by Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, as "reckless," citing concerns about protecting victims. However, Massie refutes this, stating the bill includes provisions to redact victims' names and that blocking a vote could become a political liability for the GOP in the midterms. The internal division highlights the ongoing political fallout from the Epstein case and the pressure from some wings of the party to pursue further disclosures.</p>

After a celebrated but relatively brief career in the public eye, he largely retired from performing in the 1970s to focus on teaching mathematics at the university level.
