          <p>A federal judge in Maryland, appointed by Trump, has ordered the government to facilitate the return of a Venezuelan man deported to El Salvador, citing a breach of a 2024 settlement agreement. The case involves individuals who entered the U.S. as unaccompanied minors and sought asylum. The Trump administration argued the deportation did not violate the settlement due to the man's designation as an 'alien enemy' following a cocaine possession conviction. The judge refuted this argument, emphasizing the contractual nature of the settlement and ordering the government to request his release from El Salvador. </p>

The EEOC is reviewing employment practices at Barnard College. The survey has raised concerns among some recipients, who fear it creates a list of Jewish faculty and staff. Barnard College sent an email explaining that the EEOC launched an investigation last summer into allegations that the College discriminated against Jewish employees.
