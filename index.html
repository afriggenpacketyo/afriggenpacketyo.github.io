          <p>Eli Lilly announced its daily obesity pill, orforglipron, resulted in about 12% weight loss in a late-stage trial, setting the stage for a 2026 market launch. While the results were slightly below some analysts' expectations and discontinuation rates due to side effects were noted, the pill is hailed as a potential "game changer" for its convenience over injections. This needle-free option could significantly expand patient access and help Eli Lilly dominate the booming GLP-1 market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has confirmed that Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump have agreed to meet in the coming days, with preparations for a summit underway. The development followed a meeting between Putin and a U.S. envoy, which Trump called "highly productive." In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated his call for a direct meeting with Putin, emphasizing that real solutions to the war can only be achieved through leader-to-leader discussions.</p>

          <p>A provision in a new bill signed by President Trump will cap lifetime federal student loans at $200,000 for professional programs, a move the American Medical Association warns could be a "punch in the face" for aspiring doctors. With the average cost of medical school already exceeding this limit, experts worry the cap will create significant financial barriers, particularly for students from lower-income backgrounds. This could exacerbate a projected physician shortage by forcing potential students to take on riskier private loans or abandon their medical careers altogether.</p>

          <p>Artist Takako Yamaguchi, 72, is having her first institutional show at MOCA in Los Angeles, a city she has called home for nearly five decades. Born in Japan, Yamaguchi's work is known for being time-consuming and exacting, often featuring landscapes she calls "abstractions in reverse" and defying easy categorization. In a recent interview, she reflected on her identity as an "outsider" both in the U.S. and Japan, and how L.A.'s freedom allowed her to develop her unique, contrarian artistic streak at her own deliberate pace.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Ready for My Close-Up," delves into the history of the classic 1950 film "Sunset Boulevard," a movie President Trump has reportedly screened frequently. The review highlights the film's dark themes of faded stardom, moral compromise, and the fear of irrelevance, which resonate in the current political climate. The book and the film itself serve as a mausoleum for Old Hollywood, capturing the anxieties of its creators and stars while offering a timeless critique of the corrosive need for fame and attention.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests in the Los Angeles area dropped significantly in July compared to the previous month, according to new Homeland Security data. The decline follows the launch of an aggressive deportation operation in June and a subsequent federal court order that blocked agents from targeting people without reasonable suspicion. While the 1,371 arrests in the last month are still higher than pre-operation levels, the figures suggest the administration's enforcement surge has been curtailed by legal challenges.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are advancing a bill to protect insured access to HIV prevention drugs like PrEP and PEP, requiring health plans to cover them without prior authorization or significant cost-sharing. The legislation is a direct response to concerns that the Trump administration may undermine access, particularly after the Health and Human Services Secretary floated the idea of replacing the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Advocates say the state bill would act as a crucial "shield" to ensure these life-saving medications remain accessible to Californians.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Los Angeles should pull out of hosting the 2028 Summer Olympics following President Trump's appointment to head a federal task force for the event. The author expresses concern that Trump will use the Games and the associated security apparatus, including potential military deployment, to further his political agenda and humiliate the city. Given the city's existing problems and the history of Olympic cost overruns, the author contends that hosting is an unnecessary risk that now comes with the added threat of political exploitation.</p>

          <p>A new federal law mandating work requirements for Medicaid recipients is projected to have a massive impact in California, with state officials estimating up to 3.4 million people could lose their health insurance. The rule requires many adults on Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, to prove every six months that they are working, in school, or volunteering. Critics argue that these bureaucratic hurdles will cause many eligible people to lose coverage, while proponents claim it encourages work and preserves the program for those most in need.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the 1906 Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles as a model for a more inclusive American democracy. Led by William J. Seymour, the son of formerly enslaved parents, the revival became the birthplace of modern Pentecostalism and was a radically integrated religious gathering for its time. The author argues that this movement, born from the Great Migration, demonstrates how marginalized communities can forge their own democratic spaces, offering lessons for today's fractured society by emphasizing shared dignity over racial or class hierarchies.</p>

          <p>India's stock market and political establishment have reacted with calm defiance to new U.S. tariffs of up to 50% on Indian goods, a move intended to pressure the country over its continued oil trade with Russia. There is a consensus in India that the tariffs are a pressure tactic, and the move has united political opposition behind Prime Minister Modi's government, strengthening its resolve. While certain sectors like jewelry and textiles will be hit hard, analysts note that India's economy is largely driven by domestic consumption. (not investment advice)</p>
