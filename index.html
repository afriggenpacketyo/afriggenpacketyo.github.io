          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered his release while his immigration proceedings continue. Khalil, who was detained for months due to "foreign policy" concerns under the Trump administration, addressed reporters after his release, stating that the administration chose the wrong person to target. The judge determined that Khalil is not a threat to the community or a flight risk, and his bail conditions restrict his travel to specific states. Khalil, a green card holder, was initially detained in March, and his wife gave birth to their first child in April while he was in custody, now he can finally hug his wife and child without looking at the clock. The administration plans to appeal the judge's decision. </p>

Garcia, a photographer and doctoral student, was picking up a delivery when he witnessed the agents' actions and began filming, leading to his arrest. He was later released without apparent criminal charges, while other U.S. citizens have also been arrested during recent enforcement operations.

The shooting caused panic among some attendees, and a post-game concert was canceled due to "technical issues."

The league, featuring 13 city-based teams with players from diverse backgrounds, has become a commercial juggernaut, boosting consumption of match tickets and local specialties. The enthusiasm for the amateur tournament comes after repeated disappointments from the men’s national football team, which failed to qualify for the World Cup.

          <p>All charges against Barry Morphew have been dismissed without prejudice, just nine days before he was to stand trial for the first-degree murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, who disappeared in May 2020. Prosecutors stated they need to investigate further and believe they are close to discovering Suzanne's body, citing the court's decision to exclude key expert witnesses. Morphew's attorney asserted his innocence, stating that there is no physical evidence connecting him to the alleged crime. The defense had previously requested dismissal due to the prosecution's failure to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence, leading to sanctions and the exclusion of several expert witnesses. </p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, while President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" to resolve conflicts with the school. The judge's preliminary injunction prevents the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. Mr. Trump claimed his administration has been "working closely with Harvard," and a deal may be announced soon, but the Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling, stating it conflicts with the president's powers. The battle over international students could significantly impact Harvard, where approximately one in four students are from outside the United States. </p>

          <p>Rhode Island's state House has approved legislation that would ban the sale and manufacturing of many semiautomatic rifles, sending the proposal to Democratic Gov. Dan McKee, who supports assault weapons bans. If signed into law, Rhode Island would join 10 other states with similar prohibitions on high-powered firearms. The bill only applies to the sale and manufacturing of assault weapons, not possession, similar to Washington state law. Critics argue that assault weapons bans do little to curb mass shootings and only punish law-abiding citizens, with some predicting the U.S. Supreme Court would deem the law unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>A prosecutor in the case of Suzanne Morphew, a missing Colorado mother, stated in court that investigators suspect they know the location of her body, describing it as "in a very difficult spot." This update comes as the case continues, with authorities actively searching for Morphew's remains. The case has involved bizarre clues, such as a chipmunk alibi, a tranquilizer gun, and a spy pen, but lacked direct evidence. The death of the 49-year-old Colorado mother who went missing was officially declared a homicide, according to an autopsy report released on April 29, 2024.</p>

          <p>A deadly border skirmish between Thailand and Cambodia has put China’s neighborhood diplomacy to the test as Beijing seeks to maintain stability in a region crucial to its strategic interests. Analysts said China would probably monitor the Thailand-Cambodia border dispute closely while avoiding direct mediation. The recent confrontation might cast a shadow over China’s neighborhood diplomacy, a priority for Beijing’s foreign policy as it looks to foster closer regional ties to offset pressure from its rivalry with the United States. The brief skirmish has shed light on deep-rooted border disputes in the Indochina peninsula, which lies alongside China and is considered a crucial trade gateway for Beijing to Southeast Asia and beyond.</p>

          <p>Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil was released on bail after more than three months in detention, following a federal judge's ruling that he was not a flight risk or threat. Khalil, a prominent voice in Columbia's pro-Palestinian protests last year, was arrested on March 8, sparking demonstrations in New York and Washington DC. The government has argued his activism impedes US foreign policy and moved to have him deported, but the White House maintains that Judge Michael Farbiarz did not have jurisdiction to order Mr Khalil's release. He said he was most eager to see his wife and his son, who was born during his 104 days in detention.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested he may try to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing Powell for not lowering interest rates faster. It is unclear whether the president is legally allowed to fire Powell before his term ends in May 2026. Mr. Trump has been lashing out against Powell for months, criticizing the central banker — whom Mr. Trump appointed in his first term — for not lowering interest rates at a faster pace. The Supreme Court ruled last month that the Trump administration can fire members of other independent federal agencies — but specifically exempted the Fed, calling the central bank a "uniquely structured, quasi-private entity."

A spokesperson for Padilla noted that Padilla and Vance were formerly colleagues in the Senate and said that Vance should know better.

The plants emit about 45% of the state’s greenhouse gas pollution.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European foreign ministers in Geneva to discuss de-escalation efforts. The U.S. offer, which is still on the table, would have allowed Iran to have a civilian nuclear program if it agreed not to enrich uranium on its soil. Khamenei, 86, is thought to still be battling cancer and is in hiding from the Israeli strikes.</p>
