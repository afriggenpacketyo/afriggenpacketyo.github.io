          <p>Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) convened in Malaysia to address concerns regarding potential "unilateral tariff measures" from the United States. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim noted the strain on the global trading system due to the tariffs, which could range from 10 to 49 percent on goods from ASEAN members. The leaders warned that these tariffs pose challenges to ASEAN's economic growth and stability, while reaffirming their commitment to a multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization.</p>

          <p>As South Korea prepares for its upcoming presidential election, many women feel that their priorities are being sidelined as candidates avoid addressing gender-based discrimination. Despite women playing a significant role in the movement to oust former President Yoon Suk Yeol, current candidates are hesitant to focus on women's issues due to concerns about alienating young male voters who feel they face reverse discrimination. Women in South Korea face issues such as lower pay, underrepresentation in leadership positions, and online sexual abuse, yet these concerns remain largely unaddressed by the leading candidates.</p>
