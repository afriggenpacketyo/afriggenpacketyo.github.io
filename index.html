          <p>Air Canada suspended all operations after its 10,000 flight attendants went on strike over stalled contract negotiations regarding wages and unpaid work. The strike, which began Saturday, prompted the carrier to cancel hundreds of flights, affecting over 100,000 passengers daily. In response to the significant disruption, the Canadian federal government quickly invoked its authority to force both the airline and the union into binding arbitration to resolve the dispute and restore service.</p>

          <p>Nationwide immigration arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) saw a 13% decrease in July, falling to 27,483 from 31,597 in June. While ICE has not commented on the decline, some activists and immigrant rights groups believe their efforts may be contributing to the slowdown. In places like Portland, Oregon, a combination of nightly protests and a "rapid response" legal aid system are thought to be creating impediments for large-scale enforcement operations by the agency.</p>
