          <p>President Trump has nominated Stephen Miran, a past critic of the Federal Reserve and author of the "Mar-A-Lago Accord," to the Fed's Board of Governors. Miran would fill a term expiring in January 2026, and his appointment is seen by some as a move to install a dissenting voice to push for lower interest rates. The nomination comes amid Trump's vocal criticism of current Fed Chair Jerome Powell and a recent split vote at the FOMC meeting. Miran's confirmation by the Senate would be required for him to join the board. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey is under scrutiny for a policy that provides migrant families with up to $30,000 in housing aid over two years through the HomeBASE program. Critics, including the state's GOP Chair, argue this is a costly "revolving door" policy that shifts expenses from shelters to rental assistance without a long-term solution. A former shelter director also claims the program is mismanaged and sets families up for failure rather than self-sufficiency. The controversy comes as the governor announces the closure of hotel shelters used during the migrant influx.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has renewed his call for a federal takeover of Washington, D.C.'s government, citing crime as a primary justification, though his legal authority to do so is limited. The president cannot unilaterally federalize the city; it would require an act of Congress to repeal the 1973 Home Rule Act that grants D.C. local autonomy. While Trump can command the D.C. National Guard, his claims about "out of control" crime conflict with recent police data showing a significant decrease in violent crime in 2025. This continues a long-running feud between the president and the city's Democratic leadership.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to review guidance on including alternative assets like cryptocurrency and private equity in 401(k) plans. This move could open up trillions of dollars in retirement funds to riskier, less transparent investments that have traditionally been excluded from such plans. While proponents argue it offers diversification, the order has raised concerns about investor protection due to the high fees and complexity associated with these assets. Major asset managers like BlackRock have already been developing products in anticipation of this shift. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics alleged that she ended a tenancy to sell a property she owned, only to re-list it for rent at a significantly higher price, a practice she was working to outlaw through new legislation. In her resignation letter, Ali maintained she had followed all legal requirements but acknowledged that remaining in her role would be a distraction. The incident drew sharp criticism from opposition parties and renters' advocacy groups.</p>

          <p>Dean Cain, known for playing Superman in the 1990s television series "Lois & Clark," has announced his plan to become an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer. The announcement came shortly after the agency waived its age limit for new applicants as part of a push to fill thousands of vacancies. Cain, who has previously served as a reserve police officer, stated he will be sworn in as an honorary officer soon. The move aligns with the actor's recent political commentary, including criticism of the new "Superman" film for framing the character as an immigrant.</p>

          <p>The movie review for "Freakier Friday" suggests the sequel serves more as a fan-service reunion for stars Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis than a compelling new story. The plot involves a four-way body swap that includes their new step-family members, but the film rushes through character development, relying on hijinks and montages instead of emotional depth. While the chemistry between Lohan and Curtis remains a highlight, and the film is packed with comedic cameos, the central mother-daughter story feels underdeveloped. The article concludes that while the movie is a disposable delight, it fails to recapture the magic of the original.</p>

Even with a judgment, federal and state laws protect certain funds, such as Social Security and disability benefits, from being garnished.

          <p>A recent survey shows a significant spike in bearish sentiment, with negative outlooks on the stock market rising by over 10 percentage points in one week. This is the largest increase in pessimism since just after the market's peak in February. Some market strategists view this widespread uneasiness as a contrarian bullish indicator, suggesting that many investors have already sold stocks and are holding cash, which could fuel a future rally. This negative sentiment persists despite major indexes performing well for the year, reflecting ongoing investor anxiety over economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Camilla Luddington, who stars in "Grey's Anatomy," has revealed she was recently diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid. On her podcast, Luddington explained that the diagnosis helped her understand long-term symptoms like fatigue and sluggishness, which she had previously dismissed as signs of aging. Hashimoto's is a common but slow-progressing condition that can cause a range of symptoms. Luddington shared that she is now on medication and has returned to exercising, expressing relief at finally having a medical reason for how she was feeling.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in California has ruled that Meta violated the state's Invasion of Privacy Act by collecting sensitive user data from the period-tracking app, Flo. The class-action lawsuit alleged that Flo shared users' private reproductive health information with companies like Meta and Google through their advertising software, despite assuring users of their privacy. While other companies involved, including Flo Health, settled before the verdict, Meta chose to go to trial and is expected to appeal the decision. The ruling is a significant moment for digital health data protection and the accountability of major tech companies.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut looking likely, savers may question the value of opening a high-yield savings account (HYSA). This article argues that HYSAs remain a worthwhile option for several reasons. Their rates, while slightly lower than their peak, are still substantially higher than those of traditional savings accounts, offering significant earning potential. Furthermore, any rate reductions are expected to be small and gradual, meaning HYSA rates will likely remain attractive, all while offering the flexibility that fixed-term products like CDs lack in an unpredictable economy.

          <p>This market commentary article argues that a recent sell-off in cybersecurity stocks, triggered by a disappointing forecast from Fortinet, presents a buying opportunity for other companies in the sector. The author notes that stocks like CrowdStrike, which operates on a different business model than Fortinet's hardware-focused one, were unfairly dragged down by association. The piece suggests that the market is overreacting and that the fundamental growth drivers for cloud-native cybersecurity firms like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks remain strong. It reflects a strategic view of capitalizing on a perceived market overreaction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarría and Adidas are facing accusations of cultural appropriation for their new "Oaxaca Slip On" sneaker, which blends a modern sole with the traditional leather weave of Mexican huaraches. Critics have pointed out that the shoe, named for a Mexican state, is made in China with no apparent collaboration with the Indigenous artisans who originated the craft. The government of Oaxaca is reportedly considering legal action over the design and the unauthorized use of the state's name. The controversy has sparked a debate about authentic representation and compensation in the fashion industry.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals that Americans get an average of 55% of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods. These foods, such as sweetened beverages, packaged snacks, and burgers, are typically high in salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats while being low in fiber and whole foods. The consumption rate was even higher among young people, at over 61%. This finding is significant as previous research has linked high consumption of ultra-processed foods to a greater risk of 32 damaging health outcomes, including cancer and heart disease.</p>

The comments come as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled intentions to take control of all of Gaza.

If passed, the change could shift several House seats to Democrats. The move sets up a major political battle with good-government groups who championed the independent commission to prevent partisan gerrymandering.</p>
