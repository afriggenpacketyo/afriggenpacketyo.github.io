          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa met with Donald Trump at the White House in an effort to reset relations between the two countries following continuous attacks from the U.S. administration. Trump has repeatedly criticized Pretoria, falsely claiming the systematic persecution of white Afrikaner farmers. Ramaphosa aimed to correct Trump's understanding of race relations in South Africa and discuss trade agreements vital to the South African economy. The meeting was watched anxiously by many South Africans, given previous instances of Trump's televised hostility towards other world leaders, but the hope was that Ramaphosa's diplomatic skills would foster a more respectful dialogue.</p>

          <p>For the fifth consecutive year, British businesses are reporting increasing difficulties in operating in China, citing regulatory opacity, rising compliance costs, and geopolitical uncertainties. Despite these challenges, British firms remain committed to the Chinese market, calling for a more favorable policy environment with clear and fairly enforced rules. Escalating tensions between China and the US, including technological decoupling and national security disputes, have left many British firms caught between competing superpowers, leading to delayed investments in China and globally. The British Chamber of Commerce in China emphasizes that removing barriers could distinguish China amidst global economic order disruptions.</p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after sparking public outrage with a remark that he had never bought a bag of rice, as he receives it from supporters, at a time when the public is struggling with soaring rice prices. The comment was seen as out of touch and added to public frustration over the government's handling of the rice shortage, which has led to rationing in some supermarkets. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted Eto's resignation and appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister. The resignation comes ahead of a crucial parliamentary election, posing a challenge to Ishiba's already unpopular government.</p>

The End-of-Life Options Act allows mentally capable adults with a terminal illness and six months or less to live to request a prescription to end their lives. The law includes safeguards such as mandatory counseling, waiting periods, and a second medical opinion on the patient's prognosis.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that U.S. export controls on artificial intelligence chips to China have been "a failure" because Chinese companies are turning to locally-developed technology. The U.S. restrictions have prompted Chinese firms to purchase semiconductors from domestic designers like Huawei and accelerated China's investment in building its own independent supply chain. Huang noted that Nvidia's share of China's AI chip market has significantly decreased as a result of these export controls. The Trump administration had previously rolled back some curbs following complaints that they were hindering AI development.</p>

The victims, Ximena Guzmán and José Muñoz, were killed in the Moderna neighborhood, and the motive is under investigation. Mayor Brugada, who holds the second most powerful political post in the country, vowed that her administration would continue its relentless fight against insecurity. Security analyst David Saucedo suggested the killings had the hallmarks of an organized crime hit intended to put pressure on Brugada's administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has revealed that high-dose radiotherapy, while typically used to target and destroy cancer cells, may paradoxically promote the distant metastasis of tumors. Scientists at the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Centre found that high doses of radiation could lead to the growth of existing metastatic tumors, even when these tumors had not directly received radiation therapy. The research suggests that while radiation therapy is effective for localized tumors, it may have unintended consequences for the spread of cancer to other parts of the body.</p>

The Amazon experienced its worst drought on record, leading to widespread fires, while South East Asia saw progress due to government policies.
