            <p>Walmart is leveraging its Walmart+ membership program to navigate tariffs and potential recession. The program accounts for nearly 50% of online and app spending, with members shopping twice as much and spending three times as much as non-members. Chief Growth Officer Seth Dallaire highlights the program's role as a 'frequency driver,' noting increased spending per subscriber and growth through the Walmart+ Assist program for those on government assistance. Higher profits from Walmart+ will allow Walmart to maintain low grocery prices and invest in advertising, making it more competitive during economic downturns.</p>

            <p>Experts suggest that China's centralized political system, dominated by the Communist Party, could give it an advantage in navigating a trade war with the U.S. compared to other countries. Zhu Feng of Nanjing University noted that the state-led administrative system allows for 'macroscopic prevention, adjustment and shifting' to address the trade war's impact on the economy. However, it was also warned that Chinese companies and local governments may lack the creativity to respond effectively to tariffs, as they heavily rely on directives from the central government.</p>

Investors are also seeking to buy stocks at lower costs after the market downturn. However, analysts caution that the tariff overhang remains, potentially impacting long-term growth and inflation.

            <p>Vietnam, a major beneficiary of global trade, faces challenges from President Trump's tariffs. The tariffs, including a 46% import duty, could significantly reduce Vietnam's economic growth, potentially lowering the GDP forecast to 5% in 2025. Companies like Nike, Adidas, and Apple, which rely on Vietnamese manufacturing, may need to reassess their supply chains. Vietnam's trade surplus with the U.S. has grown substantially, making it a target for the tariffs. These developments could disrupt Vietnam's economic stability and manufacturing landscape.</p>

The Cambodian government is exploring measures like tax credits to mitigate the impact. The tariffs are causing uncertainty and pausing new orders, with potential long-term implications for the Cambodian economy.</p>

The town of Citrusdal, which relies heavily on exporting citrus to the U.S., faces major job losses and potential economic collapse. The group is urging the South African government to prioritize negotiations with the U.S. on tariff reductions or exemptions.</p>
