          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, advocating for enhanced artificial intelligence cooperation among member states and cautioning against a "Cold War mentality" in international relations. Speaking to over 20 foreign leaders, including Russia's Vladimir Putin and India's Narendra Modi, Xi emphasized China's commitment to fostering high-quality development and cooperation within the bloc. He highlighted China's $84 billion investment in SCO countries and pledged support for vocational education, positioning China as a global peacemaker amidst persistent trade tensions with the United States and other global conflicts. The summit aims to strengthen regional ties and economic collaboration, potentially increasing Beijing's influence and fostering multipolarity.</p>

          <p>BYD, a prominent Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer, experienced a nearly 8% drop in its Hong Kong-listed shares after reporting a significant 30% slump in second-quarter net profit compared to the previous year. This substantial decline in profitability, despite a 14% increase in revenue driven by overseas sales, is largely attributed to an aggressive price war within China's highly competitive electric vehicle market. The company acknowledged the adverse impact of "increased price competition and frequent occurrences of excessive marketing" on the industry's development. Chinese authorities have already warned against these sustained price cuts, as BYD strategically expands into new global markets to mitigate intense domestic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly expanded in August, reaching a five-month high according to a private survey, which notably surpassed economists' estimates. This improvement was primarily driven by a recovery in new export orders, suggesting resilience in external demand despite tariffs, though domestic demand growth remained subdued. Rising raw material costs led businesses to increase sale prices, stabilizing them after months of decline. While overall business confidence improved, employment in the manufacturing sector continued to shrink, indicating that the recovery might be a temporary relief rather than a sustained rally, with its durability dependent on export stability and domestic demand.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Court judge issued a temporary restraining order, effectively blocking the Trump administration's attempt to deport dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling followed an emergency injunction request from immigrant advocacy groups, who argued that the children, many with pending asylum claims and expressing credible fears of abuse and persecution, were being prepared for immediate repatriation. While Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo and U.S. Justice Department lawyers contended the action was for family reunification, advocacy groups disputed the voluntariness in several cases. This 14-day order prevents officials from sending the children back to Guatemala, underscoring the contentious legal battles surrounding U.S. immigration policies.</p>

Additionally, headlines cover Reform UK's proposal to cut council tax by overhauling pension funds, and a demand for action against a rising shoplifting crisis. A separate report questions Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch's claim of a US medical school offer.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Tianjin, signaling a renewed effort to normalize relations between the two Asian giants, despite past border conflicts and a significant trade deficit. This outreach is largely influenced by the Trump administration's imposition of tariffs on Indian imports, pushing Delhi to seek alternative partnerships. While immediate outcomes include resuming direct flights and simpler visas, substantial roadblocks like border disputes and trade imbalances remain. India's pursuit of "strategic autonomy" by engaging China could complicate its relationships with Western allies like the Quad, highlighting a complex geopolitical balancing act.</p>

          <p>The GOP-led House Oversight Committee has officially withdrawn its subpoena for former special counsel Robert Mueller to testify regarding its broad investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein files. A committee spokesperson cited "health issues" as the reason for the withdrawal, confirming that Mueller's condition prevents him from appearing before Congress. Mueller's family later disclosed to The New York Times that he has been battling Parkinson's disease. As former FBI director from 2001 to 2013, Mueller was sought for his knowledge during the period Epstein was under FBI investigation, making his health condition a critical factor in the committee's decision to rescind the request.</p>

          <p>In the Leagues Cup final, the Seattle Sounders defeated Inter Miami 3-0, but the match's conclusion was overshadowed by a controversial incident involving star player Luis Suárez. After the final whistle, Suárez was seen confronting Sounders midfielder Obed Vargas and subsequently spitting on the Sounders' director of security, Gene Ramirez, during a larger post-game melee involving players and staff from both teams. This latest event adds to Suárez's extensive history of on-field misconduct, which includes multiple biting incidents and other physical altercations. Given past precedents, MLS is expected to hand down a multi-game suspension for the spitting offense, potentially impacting Inter Miami's upcoming season.</p>

Concurrently, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that Germany is preparing for a prolonged war in Ukraine, firmly rejecting a quick resolution that would compromise Ukraine's independence.

          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott expressed his lack of surprise regarding the blockbuster trade of star linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, despite the initial shock to many. Parsons, who subsequently became the NFL's highest-paid non-quarterback with a massive $188 million deal, had requested the trade. Prescott noted that the negotiations between Parsons and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones seemed to have become "personal," leading to the eventual parting. While initially not expecting a trade, Prescott acknowledged that the resolution was ultimately preferable to ongoing tension and distraction for the team. The Cowboys acquired two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark in exchange for Parsons, indicating a strategic move for future success.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has reportedly arranged security for former Vice President Kamala Harris, after President Donald Trump revoked her extended Secret Service protection just weeks before her book tour. Harris's initial six months of protection had been extended by Joe Biden due to threats, but Trump ended it abruptly. In response, Newsom, often seen as a political rival to Trump, ordered California Highway Patrol and LAPD protection for Harris, citing "conscience and decency." This move ensures Harris's safety, particularly as she embarks on a nationwide book tour, and highlights the ongoing political friction between the Trump administration and its critics.</p>

          <p>Preliminary Census Bureau data, analyzed by the Pew Research Center, indicates that over 1.2 million immigrants have left the U.S. labor force between January and July. This includes both undocumented and legal residents, marking the first decline in the overall immigrant population after a 2023 peak. Experts attribute this significant drop to President Trump’s stepped-up immigration policies, which have led to a plunge in illegal border crossings and increased enforcement actions. The departure of these workers, who constitute nearly 20% of the U.S. workforce, particularly impacts sectors like farming, construction, and healthcare, raising concerns about job growth and labor shortages.

          <p>Private surveys indicate that factory activity across much of Asia, including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, contracted in August, primarily due to the impact of U.S. tariffs. This downturn highlights concerns that Asian manufacturers, despite frontloading shipments, will struggle with weakening exports and declining profits. However, China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly expanded, according to its RatingDog PMI, confounding an official survey that showed contraction. Analysts warn of a "double-whammy" for Asian economies facing both U.S. tariffs and competition from cheap Chinese exports, signaling ongoing economic fragility and pressure on regional policymakers to bolster recovery.

While popular with many parents, experts raise concerns about data privacy and the accuracy of age verification technology, particularly within the "buffer zone" around age 16. The report recommends employing layered methods and notes that tech providers are actively addressing circumvention, with companies facing substantial fines for non-compliance.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani was hospitalized with multiple broken bones and other injuries after his vehicle was struck from behind at high speed in New Hampshire. According to his spokesperson, Michael Ragusa, Giuliani sustained fractured thoracic vertebrae, multiple lacerations and contusions, as well as injuries to his left arm and lower leg. The crash occurred Saturday night, with state police reporting that a 19-year-old woman's Honda hit the back of the Ford that Giuliani was riding in, which was being driven by his associate Ted Goodman. Ragusa clarified that the crash was "not a targeted attack," and Giuliani's son expressed pride in his father's toughness. Prior to the accident, Giuliani had reportedly stopped to assist a victim of domestic violence, contacting 911 and remaining on scene.</p>

          <p>Satellite images reveal that Vietnam has significantly expanded artificial land on all 21 features it occupies in the contested Spratly Islands, potentially surpassing China in reclamation efforts. This move, including the development of infrastructure like munitions storage, signals Vietnam's resolve to solidify its claims in the South China Sea. Rival claimants, including China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Brunei, also assert rights to parts of the archipelago. Analysts suggest that while Vietnam's actions may not drastically alter the strategic equation, they could prompt Beijing to upgrade its own defense posture in the region, intensifying existing geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's administration has left a distinctive mark on the Oval Office decor, applying what he calls "Trump touches" that have transformed the room with extensive gold accents. The refurbishments include gold trimming across the ceiling, door frames, and fireplace, with even sculpted cherubim painted gold. The president also multiplied the number of presidential paintings and added personal family photos and gifts. While a White House spokesperson claims Trump personally funded the "highest quality" gold, critics have described the aesthetic as "vulgar" or "gaudy." This redecoration follows a tradition of presidents personalizing the office, though Trump's changes are noted for their unprecedented scale and style.</p>

          <p>UK officials and farmers are issuing warnings of significant vegetable shortages, particularly for staples like broccoli, due to prolonged drought conditions and above-average warmth across the country. Record-breaking heatwaves and a dramatic decrease in precipitation, especially in England, have severely impacted crop yields, cutting them by over 50% and leading to smaller or less available produce. While farmers express hope for some market supply, fears of empty shelves loom if the adverse weather persists. This situation underscores the severe impact of climate change on agriculture, with the Met Office noting an increased frequency and severity of hot spells. The UK is investing in renewable energy and climate adaptation measures to combat these growing environmental challenges.</p>

          <p>England has launched the final phase of its largest-ever publicly funded childcare expansion, offering 30 hours per week for children aged nine months to four years. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed it as a "landmark moment" for working families. However, parents face long waiting lists, and nurseries report staff shortages limiting availability, with the sector needing an estimated 35,000 more staff. The funding rates are often lower than costs, leading nurseries to increase "consumable fees," causing confusion and financial strain for parents. This highlights significant implementation challenges despite the policy's positive intent to support working families.</p>
