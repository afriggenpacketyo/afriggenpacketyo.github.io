          <p>Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois has stated that President Trump's recent rhetoric "essentially just declared war" on a major American city. She clarified, however, that there are currently no indications of an impending military deployment to Chicago despite the president's social media posts and threats to send federal forces. Duckworth emphasized that such an order would be illegal and that the administration has not coordinated with local law enforcement, which would be necessary if the true goal were to fight crime. This situation reflects escalating tensions between the White House and leaders of major U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump was present at Arthur Ashe Stadium for the U.S. Open men's singles final, watching the match between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. This marked his first appearance at the prestigious tennis tournament since before he took office in 2017. The event itself featured two of the sport's top rising stars, and Alcaraz commented that having a president attend the final is a privilege for tennis. Despite some concerns about potential disruptions, the visit proceeded as a high-profile spectator event at one of the sport's major championships.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has successfully negotiated with the United States for the release of its citizens detained during a major immigration raid at a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia. Over 300 South Korean nationals were among the 475 people detained for allegedly working illegally. While the White House defended the raid as necessary for protecting American jobs and signaled more such operations are likely, Seoul raised concerns about the timing amid sensitive trade talks. A chartered plane is being arranged to bring the detainees home as South Korea also seeks to improve its visa system.</p>

          <p>Russia launched its largest aerial assault on Ukraine since the war began, using over 800 drones and missiles to strike targets across the country. For the first time, a key government building in Kyiv was damaged, marking a significant escalation that killed at least two civilians, including a mother and her infant. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strike as a deliberate crime and made urgent appeals for allies to strengthen Ukraine's air defenses and increase sanctions pressure on Russia. The attack occurred as hopes for diplomatic resolutions continue to diminish.</p>

          <h2>Editorial Argues Trump's 'War on Drugs' Escalates Failed Policy with Military Force</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This editorial argues that President Trump is transforming the metaphorical "war on drugs" into a dangerous reality by employing military force, highlighted by a recent U.S. strike that killed 11 alleged traffickers from Venezuela. The article suggests this action sets a troubling precedent for extrajudicial killings without congressional approval, drawing parallels to the expansion of executive power seen during the "war on terror." The author contends that such a strategy is not only a violation of due process but is also counterproductive, likely to alienate international partners and hinder effective anti-drug cooperation.</p>

          <p>England achieved a record-breaking 342-run victory over South Africa in their third one-day international cricket match, providing a significant morale boost despite having already lost the series. Young batsman Jacob Bethell delivered a breakout performance, scoring his first professional century with an elegant 110 runs, while Joe Root also contributed a century. Bowler Jofra Archer then dismantled the South African batting order in a hostile opening spell, taking four wickets as the visitors were dismissed for a mere 72 runs in a lopsided contest.</p>

His comments followed a controversial post evoking the film "Apocalypse Now" in relation to deportations. Concurrently, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) launched a new enforcement operation in Boston named "Patriot 2.0," aimed at targeting what a DHS spokesperson called "the worst of the worst."

          <p>Nuclear deterrence specialists are raising alarms about the increasing integration of artificial intelligence into military command structures, warning it could create a "slippery slope" toward accidental nuclear war. They fear that human decision-makers may become overly reliant on flawed AI systems or that an AI could independently escalate a conflict without understanding de-escalation, a tendency observed in wargaming simulations. These concerns are mounting as the Pentagon continues to push for AI adoption, with experts arguing that there is no clear guidance on how to safely incorporate the technology into nuclear command and control.</p>

          <p>Dr. Vonda Wright, a 58-year-old surgeon who specializes in longevity, shared her personal dietary regimen designed for healthy aging. She emphasizes a diet of clean, whole foods, aiming for 130 grams of protein daily from sources like leafy greens, eggs, dairy, and meat to maintain muscle mass. Dr. Wright strictly avoids sugar and simple carbohydrates, stating she can physically feel their inflammatory effects and the resulting "dullness in my brain." Her focus is on anti-inflammatory nutrition to support both long-term physical health and cognitive function.</p>

The driver had previously avoided identification by wearing a full racing helmet. The vehicle, identified as a non-street-legal GP2 series car, has led to the owner facing fines and a potential driving license suspension.</p>

The report indicates that companies are now allocating an average of 22% of their net income to Bitcoin, treating it as a permanent investment vehicle rather than a short-term trade.

Regarding cases related to President Trump's use of executive power, Justice Barrett maintained that the court's duty is to interpret the law as it applies to specific cases, not to make broad political judgments about a president's actions.</p>

The alleged attacker, who was arrested under a limited local ordinance, reportedly admitted his actions were racially motivated.

This shift raises critical questions about how future generations will acquire institutional knowledge and advance professionally.
