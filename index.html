          <p>Former MLB MVP Josh Hamilton recounted on a podcast that he believed the Holy Spirit informed him he would hit a home run during Game 6 of the 2011 World Series. His subsequent two-run homer gave the Texas Rangers a temporary lead in a game they would ultimately lose. Hamilton also discussed his struggles with substance abuse, his path to finding his faith, and the context behind his 2019 charge for injury to a child, stating he pleaded to a lesser misdemeanor to protect his family from a public trial.</p>

The indictment claims Cantrell arranged for Vappie to accompany her on numerous trips for personal reasons, costing the city over $70,000, and that the pair used encrypted messages to conceal their activities.</p>

          <p>An art exhibition in Bangkok focusing on authoritarian repression was censored after Chinese embassy officials complained about works by Tibetan, Uyghur, and Hong Kong artists. The show's curator, a Burmese artist named Sai, claims he and his wife were forced to flee Thailand and seek asylum in the UK after learning Thai police were searching for them. The Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre partially censored the exhibit by removing flags and obscuring artists' names, reportedly due to pressure to avoid diplomatic tensions with China.</p>

          <p>Rapper Sean Kingston, known for his hit "Beautiful Girls," has been sentenced to three and a half years in federal prison for his role in a fraud scheme that exceeded $1 million. Kingston and his mother, Janice Turner, were convicted of defrauding businesses of luxury items, including jewelry, a Cadillac Escalade, and a large television, by using the rapper's fame to obtain goods and then providing fake payment receipts. Turner was previously sentenced to five years for her involvement in the conspiracy.</p>

          <p>Following a lawsuit from the District of Columbia, the Department of Justice has agreed to reverse its appointment of a new emergency police chief for Washington, D.C., and rewrite a directive that ended the city's "sanctuary" policies. The Trump administration had invoked the Home Rule Act to place the Metropolitan Police Department under federal control, but a federal judge signaled that the move overstepped presidential authority. As a result, D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will remain in her role, and the administration will revise its order compelling local police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.</p>

However, with the rollback of federal EV tax credits, the truck's price may rise from a projected sub-$20,000 to nearly $28,000, placing it in a more competitive market segment against established models.</p>

          <p>Playboy Enterprises is moving its corporate headquarters from Los Angeles to Miami Beach, with the company's CEO citing California's "anti-business" climate and high operational costs as key factors. The move represents a strategic return to South Florida for the brand and includes plans for a new Playboy Club and multimedia studios. Playboy joins a growing list of major companies, including Tesla and Chevron, that have recently relocated from California, intensifying debates about the state's challenging business environment and high tax rates.</p>

          <p>As President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived for their summit at a U.S. air base in Alaska, they were greeted by a flyover featuring a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber and F-35 fighter jets. The B-2 is the same type of long-range aircraft used in a U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites, making the display a notable show of American military power ahead of the high-stakes diplomatic talks. The B-2 bomber is a key symbol of U.S. strategic capabilities, able to carry both conventional and nuclear munitions.</p>

          <p>A San Francisco chef is speaking out after his restaurant, Kis Cafe, closed following a viral TikTok video in which an influencer accused him of being rude. Chef Luke Sung claims the influencer, Karla Marcotte, had an unprofessional demeanor and that he questioned her credentials after viewing her social media content. Marcotte's video alleged Sung belittled her follower count and said her audience was not his target demographic. The backlash from the video led to the cafe's closure and Sung's departure as co-owner.</p>

          <p>After a six-month freeze and a lawsuit from over a dozen states, the Trump administration has agreed to resume a federal program funding the installation of electric vehicle chargers along highways. While maintaining his opposition to subsidizing green energy, the Transportation Secretary stated the administration would respect Congress's decision to authorize the funds. The new guidance for the program removes several Biden-era requirements related to community engagement and labor standards, which the administration claims will cut red tape and accelerate the rollout of charging infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Viral TikTok videos of sorority recruitment dances are being repurposed on the social media platform X with captions claiming they provoke outrage among liberals, despite a lack of evidence for such a reaction. This phenomenon appears to be driven by engagement-farming accounts that benefit from X's revenue-sharing program by creating a fictional culture-war narrative. Commentators suggest that the content is designed to appeal to a right-leaning user base by framing the videos of traditionally dressed young women as a defiant act of patriotism or traditionalism.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a government stake in Intel, a technology analyst has described such an intervention as essential for national security. The analyst argued that despite free-market principles, direct government involvement is necessary to revive the struggling chipmaker and reduce U.S. reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. This move would align with President Trump's goal of increasing domestic production of high-end technology, potentially utilizing funds from the CHIPS Act to structure the investment.

          <p>A new report from Deloitte indicates that the cost of packing a school lunch has increased by nearly 3% over the past year, with the average price now at $6.15. This rise is attributed to broader food inflation, which has elevated the prices of grocery staples like milk and bananas. While some items like white bread and tomatoes have become cheaper, the overall increase is pressuring household budgets. The cost of cafeteria lunches has also risen, prompting the USDA to increase funding for school meal programs.</p>
