          <p>Jen Pawol made sports history by becoming the first woman to serve as an umpire in a Major League Baseball regular-season game. Her debut was at first base for a match between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins, a moment celebrated by family, friends, and the wider baseball community. The 48-year-old, who has been an umpire in the minor leagues since 2016, called her promotion an emotional and gratifying culmination of years of hard work. Following the game, she donated the cap she wore to the National Baseball Hall of Fame to commemorate the milestone.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended a planned military operation in Gaza City, stating it is essential to defeat Hamas and that Israel has no choice but to proceed. He clarified that the goal is not to occupy Gaza but to demilitarize it and establish a non-Israeli civilian administration. The plan involves moving Palestinian civilians to designated safe zones with humanitarian aid. This announcement has drawn international condemnation and concern for the remaining hostages, as well as sparking an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 5-4 defeat against the Toronto Blue Jays after their bullpen surrendered a late lead. Starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance, but relievers Blake Treinen and Alex Vesia gave up three crucial solo home runs in the eighth and ninth innings. Despite having numerous opportunities with 10 hits and 13 walks, the Dodgers' offense struggled, leaving the bases loaded in both the eighth and ninth innings. The loss narrows the Dodgers' lead in the National League West division to just two games over the San Diego Padres.</p>

          <p>Actress Sophie Turner addressed social media criticism she received for attending an Oasis concert without her two young children. After a user commented that she had forgotten she was a mother, Turner retorted by explaining the concept of shared custody, suggesting the children were with their father, Joe Jonas. Her response garnered significant support from fans who pointed out the double standard often applied to mothers compared to fathers. The incident occurred following the finalization of her divorce from Jonas, which involved a contentious custody battle over their children.</p>

          <p>An unprecedented agreement has reportedly been reached where Nvidia and AMD will give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain chip sales to China. This arrangement was a condition for receiving export licenses for Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips, which are specifically designed for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. export controls. According to the Financial Times, this type of revenue-sharing deal to obtain export licenses is a first for any U.S. company.

          <p>Leaders from the European Union, UK, France, Germany, and other key nations issued a joint statement emphasizing that a lasting peace for the Russia-Ukraine war cannot be decided without Ukraine's involvement. The declaration comes as President Trump prepares for a one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which currently does not include Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. While the White House has indicated openness to a three-way meeting, the summit remains bilateral at Putin's request. The European leaders stressed their commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and the principle that international borders should not be altered by force.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new measures aimed at making it easier for NHS employers in England to hire newly qualified nurses and midwives. The initiative seeks to address a surplus of graduates, with some regions having up to three times more new professionals than available vacancies. The plan simplifies regulations, allowing trusts to hire proactively based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies. While nursing and midwifery colleges welcomed the move, employer representatives raised concerns about how the new hiring would be funded amid already strained budgets.</p>

          <p>A BBC report details how the war in Gaza has provided cover for an intensified campaign by Israeli settlers to displace Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. Ultra-nationalist settlers, supported by influential government ministers, are accelerating the expansion of settlements, with a stated goal of extinguishing hopes for a Palestinian state. The UN reports a sharp rise in settler attacks, and critics accuse Israeli security forces of failing to protect Palestinians, and in some cases, participating in the harassment. This pressure is part of a long-term project to solidify Israeli control over the territory.</p>

          <p>Historian Rana Mitter, a leading expert on modern China, emphasizes that the Second World War was a pivotal, yet often underestimated, factor in shaping the nation's contemporary trajectory. Speaking 80 years after the war's conclusion, Mitter explains that Japan's invasion shattered much of the infrastructure and communications networks that had been built in the 1920s and 1930s. This widespread destruction forced China to essentially rebuild from scratch in the post-war era, profoundly influencing its political and social development. He asserts that China's current interests are best served by a peaceful Asia-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>President Trump has demanded that homeless individuals in Washington, D.C. be moved out of the city "IMMEDIATELY" to locations "FAR from the Capital." This comes amid his administration's increased focus on what it calls an out-of-control crime problem in the city and hints at a potential federal takeover of local governance. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has pushed back, stating that violent crime has actually been driven down to a 30-year low and that any comparison to a war zone is false. The president's statements have been criticized by local officials and advocates for the homeless.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has reinstated a ban on commercial fishing within the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, overturning a recent directive from the Trump administration. The ruling blocks a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that had permitted fishing in areas previously protected by the Obama administration. The lawsuit, filed by environmental and Native Hawaiian groups, argued that the administration violated federal law by changing the rules without the required public notice and comment period. The decision is being celebrated as a major victory for marine conservation and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's new-look team under manager Arne Slot displayed both brilliant attacking potential and defensive frailties in a 2-2 draw and penalty shootout loss to Crystal Palace in the Community Shield. Four new signings started, with debut goals from Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong. However, the team twice surrendered a lead, revealing defensive vulnerabilities, particularly at full-back and in central defense. Record signing Florian Wirtz was a standout performer in a new, free-roaming attacking midfield role, but the overall performance indicates that the team still needs time to adapt and address its defensive bugs.</p>
