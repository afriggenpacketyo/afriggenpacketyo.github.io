          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures peaking at 33°C. Scotland and Northern Ireland have recorded their hottest days of the year and in almost three years, respectively. The extreme heat has caused disruptions, including travel cancellations and the postponement of sporting events. In response to dry conditions, authorities have implemented hosepipe bans for millions and issued wildfire warnings, highlighting the growing impact of climate change on weather patterns.</p>

          <h2>Satirical Piece Imagines Dan Bongino Resigning from FBI to Investigate Epstein Conspiracy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 14:03:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a satirical article from The Atlantic, former conservative commentator Dan Bongino is humorously depicted as resigning from a fictional post as Deputy Director of the FBI. The piece imagines him believing he can better solve the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy from outside the government, preferably from a podcast studio with a conspiracy board. The satire pokes fun at conspiracy theory culture, suggesting that the furthest one is from the actual evidence, the closer one is to the 'truth'. The piece uses irony to critique distrust in official government narratives.</p>

          <p>Chelsea is set to face Paris Saint-Germain in the final of the 2025 Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. The tournament, which featured 32 teams, has served as a major trial for the 2026 World Cup and has been seen as a success despite some criticism over high temperatures and low attendance. To reach the final, Chelsea defeated Fluminense 2-0, while PSG secured a dominant 4-0 victory over Real Madrid. The pre-game ceremony will feature performances by Robbie Williams and Laura Pausini, adding to the spectacle of the event.</p>

          <p>The third Test match between England and India at Lord's is precariously balanced after three days, with the scores level on the first innings. England's bowlers rallied late in the day to dismiss India for 387, taking the last four wickets for just 11 runs in sweltering heat. Key performances included a century from India's KL Rahul and crucial wickets from England's Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer. The day ended with heightened tensions as England closed at 2-0, setting the stage for a decisive fourth day in the tightly contested series.</p>

          <p>During a post-fight press conference for the historic all-female Taylor-Serrano 3 boxing card, Jake Paul sharply rebuked a reporter for questioning the role of ring girls and the 'sexualization of women' in the sport. The exchange occurred after Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano in their trilogy match at Madison Square Garden. Paul, a co-founder of the event's promotion company, dismissed the reporter's line of questioning, telling him to stop talking and making a pointed reference to Vice President Kamala Harris. The event set a world record for the most titles contested on a single boxing card.</p>

          <p>A total of 55 people were arrested in London and Cardiff during protests against the UK government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The majority of arrests were for showing support for the banned group, which is now a criminal offense under the Terrorism Act. Palestine Action has targeted arms companies it claims are linked to the war in Gaza, and the proscription followed an incident where activists broke into an RAF base. Critics, including a campaign group that organized the protest, argue the government is misusing terror legislation.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian drug lord known as 'Fito,' has agreed to be extradited to the United States to face drug and weapons trafficking charges. Macias, head of the powerful 'Los Choneros' gang, was recaptured in June after a dramatic prison escape last year that triggered a wave of gang violence across Ecuador. His consent in court paves the way for his transfer, making him the first Ecuadorian to be extradited under a new law. The move is a major victory for President Daniel Noboa's aggressive campaign against the country's powerful criminal organizations.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly fired at least 20 prosecutors and support staff who were involved in former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into President Trump. This move has caused concern among the Justice Department's career workforce. Separately, a federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from conducting broad, untargeted immigration arrests in parts of California, siding with advocacy groups who alleged unconstitutional racial profiling. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling, stating its agents are removing dangerous criminals like gang members and sexual offenders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to rising tariffs and trade uncertainty, U.S. companies are increasingly using Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce tax burdens on imported goods. These customs-sanctioned areas allow companies to store or assemble products duty-free, with tariffs only collected when the final goods enter U.S. commerce. While this strategy helps preserve cash flow, recent executive orders by President Trump have eliminated the 'inverted tariff' benefit, which allowed companies to pay a lower duty rate on finished products, increasing costs for some manufacturers.

          <p>An investigation found that FEMA repeatedly approved appeals to remove buildings at Camp Mystic, a Texas summer camp, from its 100-year flood map in the years leading up to a catastrophic flood that killed 27 people. This action loosened safety regulations and insurance requirements for the camp, which operated in a known flood plain. The changes were granted despite the obvious risk, and experts find it disturbing that a facility responsible for children would seek exemptions from basic flood oversight. The flood on July 4 was far more severe than a 100-year event.</p>

After leaving the restaurant industry burnt out, Kirby enrolled at Cornell University and identified a market gap for high-quality hummus. Starting with just a $450 blender and a few thousand dollars, he built the business while studying, focusing on slow, deep growth in regional markets. Today, Ithaca Hummus is sold in over 8,000 stores nationwide, a success Kirby attributes to maintaining product quality and strategic patience.</p>

The prestigious designation, which Bavarian politicians have sought for decades, recognizes the sites as architectural masterpieces and is expected to further boost tourism to the region.

          <p>Russia has significantly escalated its drone and missile attacks on Ukraine, a move military experts believe is aimed at overwhelming air defenses and breaking the country's will ahead of a potential summer offensive. Thanks to expanded domestic drone production, Russia is now less reliant on foreign suppliers and can launch massive, combined assaults. Analysts suggest the strategy has dual aims: destroying Ukraine's military-industrial capacity and terrorizing the civilian population to pressure the government. Western allies are being urged to provide more decisive aid, particularly advanced air defense systems, to counter the threat.</p>

The discussion highlighted a shift toward relying more on state and local officials rather than a large-scale federal presence.

Historically, successful third parties have influenced policy by pressuring the main parties on specific issues rather than by winning elections.
