          <p>SpaceX launched its Starship rocket on its ninth test flight, achieving orbit but encountering problems that led to the loss of both stages. The Super Heavy booster suffered a catastrophic failure during its descent, while the Starship upper stage experienced a propellant leak, causing it to spin out of control and break up during reentry. Despite these setbacks, SpaceX reported progress, including a successful ascent and no significant heat shield tile loss, with plans to review the data and conduct future tests. The mission aimed to test payload deployment and gather data on extreme descent trajectories, which are critical for the development of a fully reusable spacecraft for future missions to the moon and Mars. </p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will no longer recommend routine COVID-19 shots for healthy children and pregnant women, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This marks a significant shift from the previous guidance advocating annual shots for everyone aged six months and older, citing a lack of clinical data to support the shots for healthy children. While some medical experts have expressed concern about this decision, emphasizing the risk of severe illness in infants and pregnant women, others support the change, highlighting the potential for natural immunity and longer-lasting protection in children. The decision-making process typically involves the CDC's advisory committee, which had been weighing options to narrow vaccine recommendations to high-risk groups. Optimism score is based on a relatively neutral tone and the existence of varying perspectives in the article.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk voiced his disapproval of President Donald Trump's recent spending bill, asserting that it increases the budget deficit and undermines the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's remarks contrast with Trump's support for the legislation, which aims to cut $1.5 trillion in government spending. The bill, which passed in the House, still faces hurdles in the Senate, where Republican leaders hope to send it to Trump's desk by the Fourth of July. Musk's criticism highlights ongoing debates about fiscal policy and government spending in the United States.</p>

          <p>A cancelled government project to widen part of the A1 in Northumberland has left several homes purchased for the scheme vacant and in disrepair. National Highways spent over £4 million acquiring the properties, but the project was cancelled after a change in government. Affected families express their distress over losing their homes and seeing them "left to rot." National Highways is currently managing the properties while a strategy is being developed, but critics argue that the situation is a waste of money and negatively impacts the area. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking to cut an estimated $100 million in federal funding to Harvard University, citing concerns over discrimination and antisemitism. The Government Services Administration (GSA) will ask federal agencies to review Harvard's grants and contracts, potentially redirecting funds elsewhere. Harvard President Alan Garber has argued that cutting research funding would harm the country by halting important work. The university has been embroiled in a political and legal battle with the White House, including previous attempts to block funding and revoke the ability to enroll international students. </p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has cautioned that government pledges on crime reduction will not be achievable without substantial additional funding for policing. In an article for the Times, Rowley highlighted a decade of underinvestment and increasing pressures on police forces. He argued that the upcoming spending review is crucial for the restoration of neighborhood policing and the reduction of knife crime and violence against women and girls. The Home Office maintains it is committed to supporting the police, but Rowley's plea underscores the financial challenges facing law enforcement in England and Wales.</p>

Incarcerated firefighters, who make up around 30% of California's wildfire crews, currently earn low wages while risking their lives.

          <p>Rick Derringer, the musician known for his hits "Hang On Sloopy" and "Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo," died at the age of 77. Derringer's career spanned decades and included collaborations with artists like Barbra Streisand, Peter Frampton, and Weird Al Yankovic. He produced the instrumental hit “Frankenstein” for the Edgar Winter Group and wrote Hulk Hogan’s “Real American” theme. The McCoys, with Derringer as the frontman, reached the top of the Billboard charts in 1965 with “Hang On Sloopy,” which became an anthem for Ohio State University.</p>

Despite the loss of the vehicle, the company appears to have fixed issues from previous flights, and the Super Heavy booster was successfully reflown. The company is still working towards a reusable spacecraft for missions to Mars. </p>

          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine indicates a significant decline in the mental health of mothers in the United States between 2016 and 2023. The study, involving nearly 200,000 mothers, found a sharp decrease in those rating their mental health as "excellent" and an increase in those reporting poor mental health. Factors contributing to this decline may include high housing and child care costs, lack of paid parental leave, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings highlight the need for greater access to mental health care and support for mothers.</p>

          <p>A new study has revealed a significant decline in mental health among mothers in the United States in recent years. The study, which examined data from nearly 200,000 mothers, found that fewer mothers reported having "excellent" mental health, while more reported having "fair/poor" mental health. The decline was observed across all socioeconomic groups, with single female parents, those with lower educational attainment, and those with publicly insured children experiencing lower mental and physical health status. Researchers suggest factors such as limited access to mental health care, social isolation, and broader stressors may be contributing to this trend.</p>

This move has raised concerns about potential barriers to access for those groups, given the CDC's recommendations often determine insurance coverage. The move puts Kennedy at odds with the FDA, who recently said pregnancy was among the underlying conditions that warranted continued eligibility for COVID-19 vaccine approvals.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump plans to pardon Todd and Julie Chrisley, stars of the reality TV show Chrisley Knows Best, who were convicted of fraud and tax evasion. The pardon follows an interview their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, had on Fox News with Lara Trump, where she claimed her parents were prosecuted for their political beliefs. The Chrisleys were found guilty in 2022 of defrauding banks and evading taxes. Trump announced the pardon in a video posted online, stating that he hopes to have them “free and clean” by tomorrow.</p>
