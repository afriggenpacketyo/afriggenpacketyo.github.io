          <p>The White House has released new details regarding proposed budget cuts that would significantly impact various education, health, housing, and labor programs. The blueprint outlines reductions in aid for college and cancer research, among other areas. These cuts reflect the administration's priorities and are likely to face scrutiny and debate as they move through the legislative process, potentially affecting millions of Americans who rely on these programs for essential services and opportunities. The budget proposal sets the stage for negotiations with Congress, where lawmakers will weigh the proposed cuts against the needs of their constituents and the broader economic impact. The article provides a snapshot of the administration's fiscal agenda and its potential consequences for various sectors. Optimism remains low due to the stark nature of the cuts. </p>

          <p>Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist with extensive experience working with young adults, offers five simple parenting rules to navigate the complexities of raising children in today's world. The advice emphasizes trusting parental instincts, embracing cultural traditions, following the child's interests, focusing on enjoyment over strict development metrics, and being authentic rather than striving for an unattainable ideal of perfection. The psychiatrist suggests that parents should follow their instincts and cultural traditions rather than influencers or clickbait, and that children learn best when they are happy and relaxed. Ross also advises parents to focus on their children's enjoyment and to be their real selves, rather than their ideal selves. </p>

          <p>Ã‰tienne-Ã‰mile Baulieu, the French endocrinologist renowned as the father of the abortion pill, has died at the age of 98. Baulieu was a staunch advocate for a womanâ€™s right to choose, famously stating that it is always tragic when politics takes the most vulnerable hostage, in this case, women. His development of the abortion pill, also known as mifepristone, revolutionized reproductive healthcare and provided women with a non-surgical option for terminating pregnancies.

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. The report indicates that Iran possesses 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, a significant increase since February. The IAEA has expressed serious concern, noting that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material, while Israel views the report as a clear sign that Iran is determined to complete its nuclear weapons program.

The surgery involved removing part of her eye socket and cheekbone to reach the tumor, and Flores has since undergone radiation treatment and is now cancer-free.

          <p>A Texas police officer used automated license plate readers (ALPRs) to track a woman who had an abortion, sparking concerns about reproductive surveillance in the state. The officer performed a nationwide search of more than 83,000 ALPR cameras while looking for the woman, even in states where abortion is legal. The incident highlights the potential for abuse of surveillance technology in states with restrictive abortion laws, particularly for women of color who are already over-surveilled.

Financial planner Nathan Sebesta recommends working backward by deciding how much annual income you'll want in retirement and estimating how long you'll need that yearly income for, while advising to not panic and start where you are as soon as you can (not investment advice).

          <p>John Heitinga has departed from his role as Liverpool's assistant manager to take on the position of head coach at Dutch club Ajax. The former Netherlands defender, who previously made over 200 appearances for Ajax, returns on a two-year contract. Heitinga succeeds Francesco Farioli, whose tenure ended with a late-season collapse after leading the Eredivisie for much of the year. This move marks a significant step in Heitinga's managerial career, bringing him back to the club where he spent a large portion of his playing career.</p>

          <p>A monument to Joseph Stalin, once torn down, has been replicated and reinstalled in a Moscow metro station. The original statue, depicting Stalin with a wry smile, surrounded by admiring children and worshipful workers, was removed in the 1960s after Nikita Khrushchev denounced him. The reinstallation has sparked mixed reactions, with some praising it as art and culture, while others question how it is possible given the millions who died under his leadership. The statue does not include several features of the original, and the vision the Putin regime has for Russia's future is set in the stone of that subway station.</p>
