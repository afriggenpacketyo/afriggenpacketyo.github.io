          <p>Despite new US tariffs, India has refrained from rushing into a trade agreement, prioritizing the protection of its domestic farmers, who represent a significant political bloc. Analysts suggest that India's resistance is also a strategic move, positioning the country as a crucial counterbalance to China in the Indo-Pacific and a potential alternative for global manufacturing. While the tariffs will impact Indian exports, officials are confident in securing a favorable deal on their own terms, signaling a more assertive trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford has revised its forecast for the financial impact of US tariffs, now expecting them to cost the company approximately $2 billion in the current year. This is a significant increase from previous estimates, with the automaker having already paid an extra $800 million in duties in the last quarter alone. The company attributes the rising costs to sustained levies on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as tariffs on steel and aluminum. This report highlights the tangible economic consequences of ongoing trade policies for major American manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have concluded a trade deal, establishing a 15% tariff on South Korean exports, down from a threatened 25%. As part of the agreement, South Korea will facilitate a $350 billion investment fund for Korean companies to enter the US market, particularly in sectors like shipbuilding and semiconductors. While the deal provides some certainty for Seoul, analysts note it negates some benefits of the existing bilateral free trade agreement. The deal also includes a South Korean commitment to purchase $100 billion in US energy products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has reported a significant drop in its second-quarter operating profit, which fell by more than half compared to the previous year, missing analyst expectations. The decline was primarily driven by a staggering 93.8% plunge in profits from its crucial chip division, attributed to inventory adjustments and impacts from export restrictions. Despite the poor results, the company expressed optimism for a gradual recovery in the second half of the year, fueled by demand in AI and robotics. The mobile division, however, saw an uptick in sales and profit.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Broad Economic Impacts of Recent US Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 20:31:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of recent US trade policy shows that widespread tariffs have raised the average US tariff rate to its highest level in nearly a century. This has tripled the government's monthly tariff revenue but is also projected to shrink the overall size of the US economy over the next decade. The tariffs have widened the US trade deficit, partly due to stockpiling, and have shifted global trade patterns, with China's exports to the US declining while its trade with other nations has grown. Economists are also beginning to see the tariffs feed through to higher consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, resisting pressure from President Trump to implement a cut. The decision comes as policymakers weigh the uncertain economic effects of new tariffs, with recent data showing a GDP rebound driven primarily by a sharp drop in imports. While the Fed has signaled a potential rate cut later this year, it is proceeding cautiously due to inflation remaining above its target. The vote was not unanimous, with two members dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence.</p>

          <p>Following a major earthquake off the coast of Russia, this article explains the science behind tsunamis. These powerful waves are typically generated by large, shallow, underwater earthquakes that cause vertical shifts in the seafloor, displacing massive volumes of water. While difficult to predict precisely, scientists use deep ocean sensors to detect tsunamis, which can travel at jet-plane speeds in deep water before slowing and growing in height near the shore. Experts stress the importance of heeding all warnings and immediately moving to higher ground, as even small tsunamis are extremely dangerous.</p>

          <p>A research expedition using a human-occupied submersible has captured unprecedented images of abundant life in deep-sea trenches in the northwest Pacific. At depths exceeding 9,000 meters, scientists observed thriving communities of creatures, including tube worms and clams, fueled by chemical seeps from the ocean floor rather than sunlight. The findings challenge previous assumptions about the limits of life in extreme high-pressure, pitch-dark environments. Researchers were amazed by the density of the animal populations, suggesting such chemosynthetic ecosystems may be more widespread than previously thought.</p>
