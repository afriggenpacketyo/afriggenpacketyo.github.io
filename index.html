          <p>James Farthing, a Kentucky man who recently won a $167 million Powerball jackpot, was arrested in Florida for allegedly kicking a deputy in the face during a fight at a resort. According to the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office, Farthing faces felony battery charges on a law enforcement officer, as well as misdemeanor charges. The incident occurred after Farthing was involved in an altercation with another guest. Despite his recent lottery win, Farthing remains in custody due to a parole violation from a previous incident in Kentucky.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are locked in a trade war, initiated by the U.S. President Donald Trump who targeted China's trade surplus. Both countries have imposed substantial tariff hikes on each other's goods, disrupting bilateral trade. Trump has claimed that President Xi Jinping has called him to discuss negotiations, hinting at China's potential concession. However, the article suggests that Trump may have misjudged China's political strategy and resilience to economic hardship.

The incident occurred hours after Hinton Jr. and his family viewed police footage of his son's shooting.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised retaliation against the Houthis after a missile fired by the group struck near Ben Gurion Airport. The missile, launched from Yemen by the Iran-backed group, landed near the airport's main terminal, injuring four people. The Houthis claimed responsibility, citing Israel's actions in Gaza, and threatened to impose an aerial blockade on Israel. Israel's defense minister warned of a sevenfold response. Netanyahu stated that attacks by the Houthis originate from Iran and that Israel would respond to both the Houthi attack and Iran at a time and place of their choosing.</p>

The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 a year for home-schooled students. Supporters claim it ensures students have the freedom to seek the educational option that suits them, while Democrats argue it hurts public schools by siphoning funds to wealthier students already in private schools.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department's civil rights division is investigating a policy in Minnesota's Hennepin County to determine whether it illegally considers race as a factor in plea deals. The policy memo instructed prosecutors to be aware of racial or age considerations in plea negotiations and sentencing. The Justice Department's investigation will assess whether the local prosecutors have created a pattern of depriving individuals of rights protected by the Constitution. The county prosecutor's office has stated it will cooperate with the investigation.</p>

          <p>President Trump said he would discuss making Canada the 51st state with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney but did not anticipate using military force. He also stated that "something could happen with Greenland" for national security reasons and didn't rule out using military force there. Additionally, when questioned about upholding the Constitution, Trump responded that he has "brilliant lawyers" who will follow the Supreme Court's guidance. He claimed the U.S. subsidizes Canada by $200 billion a year and that Canada becoming a state would eliminate that cost.</p>

          <p>California's high-speed rail project, approved by voters in 2008, faces significant delays and tripled costs. The project, intended to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, has been reduced to a 171-mile stretch between Bakersfield and Merced. Eminent domain lawyer Mark Wasser argues that eminent domain is not the primary cause of the delays. Farmers and landowners have faced disruptions and complications due to the rail's diagonal route cutting through agricultural land. The project's future remains uncertain, with completion unlikely in the near future.</p>

          <p>President Trump's actions to enlarge executive power have drawn scrutiny, with some arguing he's going beyond mainstream notions. Some members of his administration are justifying Trump's actions by invoking a tradition of right-wing thought that favors monarchical and dictatorial rule. This perspective draws on legal theorist Carl Schmitt and thinkers affiliated with the Claremont Institute. It emphasizes the need for decisive action by the executive, challenging constraints imposed by administrative reforms and the separation of powers.</p>
