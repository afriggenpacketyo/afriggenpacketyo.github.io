          <p>A protest in Santa Cruz, California, during Pride Month drew nearly 1,000 people to form a human banner that spelled out "Resist!" in rainbow colors, organized by Indivisible Santa Cruz County, an organization known for its left-wing activism. The demonstration also displayed the phrase "86 47," which critics interpreted as a coded call to eliminate President Donald Trump, the 47th president. While organizers promoted the event as a peaceful act of resistance and solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community, critics argued that the message was hypocritical and fueled hostility towards conservatives. The Santa Cruz County Republican Party chair reported increased hostility towards local conservatives, including vandalism and attacks. The event took place amidst Santa Cruz's 50th Pride celebration, with participants dressing in matching rainbow colors. </p>

          <p>Ukraine claims to have completed its largest long-range attack of the war, using smuggled drones to strike 40 Russian warplanes at four military bases, as Russian and Ukrainian negotiators prepared for a second round of peace talks in Istanbul, Turkey. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that 117 drones were used in the operation, which took a year and a half to organize, and that it struck 34% of Russia's strategic cruise missile carriers. Russia confirmed the attacks in five regions, calling them a "terrorist act", while Ukrainian authorities reported a massive drone and missile attack on its territory. Expectations for the peace talks remain low due to the significant differences between the two sides on ending the war. </p>

          <p>Haoxiang Gao, a Chinese national and student at the University of Michigan, has fled the United States after being charged with illegal voting in the 2024 general election. Gao admitted to registering and casting a vote on campus, leading to charges of unauthorized elector attempting to vote and making a false affidavit. Despite a judge ordering him to surrender his passport and remain in Michigan, Gao boarded a flight to Shanghai using a different passport. The FBI has charged Gao with flight to avoid prosecution, although the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China. Studies indicate that instances of noncitizens voting in federal elections are rare. </p>

          <p>Six people were hospitalized with burns after a suspect carried out an attack on a pedestrian mall in Boulder, Colorado, during a pro-Israel demonstration. The suspect, identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly used a "makeshift flamethrower" and threw an incendiary device while yelling "Free Palestine". The FBI is investigating the incident as a "targeted terror attack" motivated by ideological violence. The victims, aged 67 to 88, were participating in a Run for Their Lives walk to raise awareness about hostages in Gaza. The attack has been condemned as an act of antisemitism, happening on the eve of the Jewish holiday, Shavuot. </p>

          <p>The New York Yankees thwarted a Los Angeles Dodgers series sweep with a 7-3 victory after Yoshinobu Yamamoto experienced early difficulties on the mound. After two dominant wins by the Dodgers, the Yankees capitalized on Yamamoto's rare poor performance, marked by inconsistent strikes and ineffective splitters. The Dodgers' defense and base running also faltered, contributing to their inability to build momentum. Despite late home runs from Pages and Muncy, the Dodgers' offense struggled against former Dodger Ryan Yarbrough, resulting in an inconsistent start to the season. </p>

          <p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado expressed concerns about a potential new wave of repression by Nicolás Maduro's regime following the U.S. decision to restrict Chevron's operations in Venezuela. Machado, currently in hiding, described the economic crisis in Venezuela as unsustainable and irreversible, with the regime increasingly isolated internationally. Despite Maduro's claims of victory in recent elections, Machado believes his regime is a sinking ship, lacking the capacity to secure financial support from traditional allies. Machado views the U.S. decision as beneficial for Venezuela's future, allowing for minimal operations without providing resources to the regime. </p>

          <p>A report warns that students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more to deliver courses, as financial challenges lead to course cutbacks. Universities UK found reluctance to collaborate due to competition laws, and calls for more clarity to prevent isolated decisions on course closures. A government review of higher education funding is underway, and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) expressed support for collaboration where possible. University budgets are strained by a drop in international students and fees failing to keep up with inflation, with many institutions heading for financial deficit. </p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is facing controversy after approving a law allowing the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation, a move criticized by US President Donald Trump. The law aims to increase black ownership of land, which remains largely in white hands, but opponents argue it threatens property rights. Legal experts say expropriation without compensation would be rare, mainly for unused or abandoned land, while compensation will likely be less than the current "market value". The government hopes the law will expedite land reform, but the "political cost" may prevent its implementation. </p>
