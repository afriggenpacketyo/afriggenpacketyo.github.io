          <p>R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe discussed the band's decision to release a new remix of their hit song "Radio Free Europe" to support the federally funded news service, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The organization is facing financial difficulties due to the Trump administration withholding millions in funding. Stipe emphasized the importance of journalism and freedom of speech in the fight against authoritarianism. The remix aims to raise morale and support for the organization, which broadcasts to 23 countries in 27 languages, and had to furlough journalists and go to court to get its funding released.</p>

The order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) to cease federal funding for the two outlets. Public media are expected to challenge the executive order, with PBS stating it is "exploring all options." NPR has stated that rural stations would be most impacted. The CPB's budget is already approved by Congress through 2027, and the agency's president has stated that the agency was not subject to the president’s authority.</p>

          <p>TikTok has been fined €530 million by the EU for transferring European users' personal data to China, violating the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) found that TikTok failed to guarantee that European users' data accessed by staff in China was adequately protected. TikTok plans to appeal the fine, asserting that it has never received a request from Chinese authorities for European users' data. This fine is the second largest ever imposed by the EU for GDPR violations.</p>

          <p>Nonfarm payrolls increased by 177,000 in April, exceeding expectations despite concerns over the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The unemployment rate remained at 4.2%, indicating a stable labor market. Health care, transportation, and warehousing sectors led job creation, while the federal government reported a slight loss of jobs. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% for the month, below the forecast. The report comes amid uncertainty over Trump's tariffs, but analysts suggest it's too early for their impacts to be fully reflected.</p>
