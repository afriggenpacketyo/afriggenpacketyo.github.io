          <p>Singapore's economy demonstrated robust growth in the second quarter of 2025, expanding 4.3% year-over-year and significantly outpacing economists' forecasts. The manufacturing sector was a primary driver of this acceleration, which marked a rebound from the previous quarter's contraction. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry maintains a cautious outlook, highlighting significant uncertainties and downside risks from global trade tensions, particularly U.S. tariff policies. The country's central bank has also adopted a looser monetary policy in response to these external economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Proposed Public Media Funding Cuts Could Disproportionately Affect Rural American Communities</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposal to rescind $1.1 billion in federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is facing a crucial Senate vote, a move strongly advocated for by President Trump. This article highlights the potential severe impact on rural America, where local public stations often serve as the primary or sole source of news and vital safety information. Stations like KOTZ in Arctic Alaska, which receives 41% of its income from public funds, warn that such cuts could force them off the air. While proponents of the cuts cite alleged media bias, some Republican senators from rural states have expressed opposition, concerned about the loss of essential services for their constituents.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department is asking for public assistance after a Colt M4 assault rifle went missing from the trunk of a deputy's cruiser in South L.A. The weapon, stored in a hard case along with five fully loaded magazines, was discovered missing on Saturday night. Authorities have released the four-mile route the deputies traveled in hopes that a member of the public might have seen or found the weapon. An internal investigation has been launched to determine if proper procedures were followed for securing the high-powered rifle.</p>

Ho also describes the rise of "rainbow tourism," a shift from predominantly Western tourists to a diverse, global mix of travelers from developing nations.

          <p>A long-running water dispute between Texas and the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua is intensifying amid a crippling, multi-year drought. Under an 81-year-old treaty, Mexico is required to send water from the Rio Grande to the US, but it is currently in significant arrears. Mexican farmers argue they cannot give what they don't have due to critically low reservoir levels, while Texan farmers accuse them of hoarding water and using inefficient irrigation. The conflict has been exacerbated by President Trump's threats of tariffs, highlighting how climate change and resource scarcity are straining international relations.</p>

This marks an unprecedented second state visit for an American president, a move widely seen as a significant act of soft diplomacy by the British government. The visit, which was arranged after Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivered the invitation, will include a full ceremonial welcome and state banquet. The event comes as the UK seeks to maintain close ties and influence with the Trump administration on key issues like trade and the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup final between Chelsea and PSG was marked by a pre-match and halftime spectacle that drew comparisons to the American Super Bowl rather than a traditional European football match. The event in New Jersey featured a military flyover, celebrity red carpet, and performances from major music artists, all in front of President Trump. This article analyzes the elaborate presentation, questioning whether the high-production, entertainment-focused model is the future of major global football tournaments.

          <p>The White House is defending a new 50% tariff on Brazil, framing it as part of a comprehensive strategy to onshore production and reduce national security risks associated with trade deficits. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett acknowledged that the U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil but argued that an overall global strategy is necessary to prevent transshipping and achieve long-term objectives. The move, along with tariffs on other materials like copper, is aimed at bolstering domestic production of critical goods, though critics question the economic impact on U.S. firms.

          <p>A Senate committee report has condemned the U.S. Secret Service for a series of significant failures that led to the 2024 assassination attempt on Donald Trump. The report blames a "cascade of preventable failures," chief among them being a lack of structured communication that prevented critical intelligence about the shooter from reaching Trump's detail in time. It also identified organizational mistakes, such as a countersniper team having an obstructed view of the shooter's location. The agency stated it has implemented reforms, but the committee noted that no personnel have been fired over the incident.</p>
