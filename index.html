          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 21:00:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed the world's first AI nuclear warhead inspector, as detailed in a peer-reviewed paper, potentially impacting international disarmament talks. The AI system, built on a joint Chinese-American protocol, aims to verify warhead specifications. The project faced challenges including training the AI with sensitive nuclear data and ensuring the system's security against leaks, but the first step of training the AI has been successfully completed. Due to the classified nature of nuclear warheads, specific data used for training cannot be disclosed, but the technology could significantly alter nuclear weapon management. Optimism that this technology will make a positive impact is somewhat tempered by the inherent risks associated with AI and nuclear weapons.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reorganizing the leadership at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) due to White House dissatisfaction with arrest and deportation numbers. Kenneth Genalo, head of Enforcement and Removal Operations, is retiring, while Robert Hammer, who leads Homeland Security Investigations, has been reassigned. The changes aim to ramp up efforts to locate, arrest, and deport unauthorized migrants, with the White House pushing for a minimum of 3,000 arrests per day. Career ICE officials Marcos Charles and Derek Gordon will replace Genalo and Hammer, and ICE claims the changes will help achieve the administration's mandate of arresting and deporting criminal illegal aliens.</p>

          <p>A West Hollywood shopping center has installed a motion-activated chirping device to discourage unhoused people from camping out on the property. The device, called the BlueChirper, emits a loud cricket-like sound when people pass by, irritating some customers. While the property management company claims the device is effective, the city is investigating whether it violates local noise ordinances. Critics argue that such deterrents do not address the root causes of homelessness and demean the public environment, and the device represents the private sector trying to solve a problem that should be addressed by local government.</p>

          <p>France is implementing a sweeping outdoor smoking ban starting July 1, prohibiting smoking in parks, beaches, bus stops, and near schools. Violators could face fines up to $153, with enforcement primarily handled by regular police and public self-regulation. The ban aims to protect children from secondhand smoke, but exemptions are made for outdoor cafÃ© seating areas. E-cigarettes are currently excluded from the restrictions, but future limits on nicotine levels in vapes are under consideration, and the move expands France's existing anti-smoking laws, which have already banned smoking in restaurants and indoor public places since 2008.</p>

The White House has suspended or revised parts of many of its duties while trade negotiations continue.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of International Trade ruling has struck down President Trump's tariffs imposed under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The ruling affects tariffs imposed on China, Mexico, and Canada to curb fentanyl smuggling, as well as the universal 10% baseline tariff on all imports to the U.S., and analysts estimate the tariffs struck down were likely to have raised almost $200 billion annually. The court's decision reduces the US's average external tariff, and countries may be less likely to rush into trade deals with the US.</p>

          <p>Starbase, Texas, the town home to Elon Musk's SpaceX, has notified some residents that they may "lose the right to continue using" their property as they do today. The town is considering a new zoning ordinance and citywide map, and the notice affects property owners in a proposed "Mixed Use District." Starbase, now run by SpaceX employees, plans a public hearing on June 23, and this development raises concerns about the future of the community.</p>
