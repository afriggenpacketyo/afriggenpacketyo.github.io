          <p>A 60-year-old man was arrested in Sydney after allegedly firing between 50 and 100 bullets at random on a busy street, resulting in 20 injuries, including one person in serious condition. New South Wales police responded to the incident in Croydon Park, where they apprehended the suspect and seized two rifles. The shooting, which Acting Superintendent Stephen Parry described as "serious and terrifying," saw cars and police targeted. The gunman's motive remains unclear, with no known links to terrorism or gang activity, and mass shootings are notably rare in Australia due to strict gun control laws implemented after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. The accused also sustained injuries during his arrest.</p>

          <p>President Trump deployed approximately 200 California National Guard members to Portland, Oregon, to protect federal property and support US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), directly circumventing a federal judge's order. This order had temporarily blocked the deployment of Oregon's own National Guard, with the judge stating Trump's characterization of Portland as a "war zone" was "untethered to the facts." Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and California Governor Gavin Newsom strongly criticized the deployment, labeling it an "appalling" and "un-American" abuse of power, emphasizing that no military intervention was needed in Oregon. Newsom vowed to challenge the move in court.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged over 4% to hit a record high, alongside the Topix reaching an all-time high, following the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's election of Sanae Takaichi as its new leader. Positioned to become Japan's first female prime minister, Takaichi is expected to advocate for a "high-pressure economy" and maintain the Bank of Japan's accommodative monetary policy. This shift in leadership and economic direction, focusing on expanding investment and demand through public-private partnerships, led to significant gains across real estate, technology, and consumer cyclical stocks. The Japanese yen weakened against the dollar, and bond yields saw increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nearly 30 million UK consumers who bought Apple or Samsung smartphones between 2015 and 2024 could be eligible for a share of a £480 million payout, averaging around £17 each. This potential compensation stems from a lawsuit brought by the consumer campaign group Which? against US tech giant Qualcomm at the Competition Appeal Tribunal in London. Which? alleges that Qualcomm engaged in anti-competitive practices, forcing Apple and Samsung to pay inflated prices and licensing fees for essential components, which subsequently raised smartphone costs for consumers. Qualcomm has previously stated the case has "no basis."</p>

          <p>Rite Aid has announced the nationwide closure of all its stores, concluding over six decades of operation, following its second bankruptcy filing in May. The pharmacy chain, which previously operated more than 1,200 stores across 15 states, initially sought Chapter 11 protection in October 2023 to manage billions in debt and shutter hundreds of underperforming locations. The company also faced extensive legal challenges, including over 1,000 federal, state, and local lawsuits alleging improper filling of opioid prescriptions, which it denied. Despite securing new financing during its initial bankruptcy, mounting financial pressures led to this final wind-down, a plan still under court review.</p>

          <p>The concept of a "swag gap," where partners have noticeably different styles or effort levels in appearance, is gaining traction on social media. While some argue it can lead to relationship conflicts, with one partner feeling disrespected or unproud, others like Jessica Raialo believe it doesn't have to be negative if both partners appreciate each other's unique styles. Relationship experts suggest that attempting to change a partner's appearance can be detrimental, emphasizing the importance of mutual respect and avoiding unhealthy power dynamics. The article highlights that "swag gap" can also extend beyond fashion to differences in success or confidence.</p>

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer highlighted that the impasse, triggered by Democrats rejecting a short-term funding measure over demands for low-income healthcare provisions, can only be resolved through direct talks between Trump and congressional leaders.

          <p>President Trump has successfully exerted influence over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, compelling him to halt offensive operations in Gaza and send negotiators to Cairo for peace talks, despite Netanyahu's prior stance against negotiations "under fire." This article argues that Trump's leverage stems from Netanyahu's political strategy of marketing himself as a close ally to the US president, making a public feud electorally damaging. Trump's recent actions, including unveiling a 20-point peace plan and public directives for a ceasefire, illustrate his capacity to dictate terms and balance the interests of various stakeholders in the Middle East, potentially driving a fragile peace process forward.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is poised to resume partial production this week, starting with its engine factory in Wolverhampton, following a major cyber attack that forced a month-long shutdown of its global operations. While a full return to capacity is expected to take several weeks, this restart brings welcome relief to JLR's extensive network of suppliers, many of whom have endured significant financial strain. The UK government has provided a £1.5 billion loan guarantee to support these suppliers, though some industry figures have criticized the direct impact of this measure on struggling small businesses. The hack, attributed to "Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters," cost JLR an estimated £50 million per week in lost production.</p>

          <p>Gisèle Pelicot, a victim of mass sexual assault, is returning to court to face one of her attackers who is appealing his conviction. Her public defiance last year was seen as a catalyst against sexual violence in France, but this article suggests that initial optimism may be waning, with some local officials attempting to downplay the case's significance. While feminist organizations report a tripling of sexual assault complaints, conviction rates remain stagnant, and concerns are rising about a "backlash" and the resurgence of sexual assault culture ideas. This case continues to highlight the ongoing struggle for substantive change in how France addresses sexual violence.</p>

          <p>Sophie Fay, a 26-year-old intensive care nurse, underwent an above-the-knee leg amputation after a rare and aggressive spindle cell sarcoma of the bone was discovered in her calf.

An MRI eventually revealed a large tumor "completely encased" her blood vessels and nerves, making amputation the only viable treatment.

Housing Secretary Steve Reed stated these changes aim to "fix the broken system" by legally mandating sellers and estate agents to provide comprehensive property information upfront, thereby increasing transparency and buyer confidence. Additional proposals include the introduction of binding contracts to deter late withdrawals from sales and the implementation of a new mandatory Code of Practice for industry professionals.

          <p>Mohamed Salah's diminished defensive work rate is emerging as a "little problem" for Liverpool, especially in matches against top-tier teams, creating defensive vulnerabilities on the right flank. While manager Arne Slot might be granting Salah freedom to focus on attack, the article argues that the players supporting him are not effectively covering the resulting space, leading to frequent 2v1 overloads. This analysis suggests the core issue is not Salah's goal-scoring form, which is expected to recover, but rather Liverpool's broader struggle with game control and defensive shape compared to the previous season. The team is urged to re-establish composure and balance to address these issues.</p>

Powers offers an example of a Han dynasty prime minister's story, frequently depicted in art, illustrating the concept of limited jurisdiction.

These buyers, often younger and chasing high-growth, unprofitable companies, are driving "life-changing moves" in stocks like Rigetti and Oklo.
