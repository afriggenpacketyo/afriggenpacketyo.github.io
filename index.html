          <p>In an interview, Representative French Hill advocated for the seizure and conversion of frozen Russian central bank assets to benefit Ukraine, building on the REPO Act. He also addressed the independence of the Federal Reserve, stating that while criticism of its policies is normal, he does not believe the president has the authority to fire the Fed Chair. Hill promoted upcoming House legislation aimed at creating clear regulations for digital assets, arguing it will protect consumers and establish the U.S. as a leader in financial technology innovation. He asserted that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are legitimate assets that can be considered for mortgage applications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Belgian sprinter Tim Merlier secured his second victory of the 2025 Tour de France, winning stage nine in a bunch sprint to Chateauroux. The stage was animated by a long-distance breakaway from Mathieu van der Poel, who was caught just one kilometer from the finish line after a valiant effort. Van der Poel's attack was a tribute to a teammate's dream of reaching the Tour podium. Despite the dramatic stage finish, there were no significant changes in the general classification, with Tadej Pogacar retaining the yellow jersey.</p>

          <p>Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal discussed a new bipartisan sanctions package designed to pressure Russia to end the war in Ukraine. The proposed legislation would grant the president authority to impose tariffs up to 500% on countries that support Russia's war economy, specifically naming China, India, and Brazil as key targets. The senators emphasized strong European and NATO unity on the issue and also advocated for using seized Russian assets to help fund Ukraine's defense. They indicated that a major shift in U.S. policy, including increased weapons flow to Ukraine, is imminent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Senate committee report released one year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump has described the incident as resulting from a 'cascade of preventable failures.' The highly critical findings state that the Secret Service denied or failed to fulfill multiple requests for additional security assets and assigned an inexperienced operator to the event despite known vulnerabilities. The report laments that the gunman was able to operate undetected for nearly 45 minutes and criticizes the disciplinary actions taken against six agents as insufficient, given that no one has been fired for the security lapses.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing its final day of a significant heatwave, with temperatures forecast to reach 31°C and amber heat health alerts active in central and southern England.

The FAA's notification stated the issue does not constitute an 'unsafe condition' that would require a mandatory Airworthiness Directive.

The film, which cost around $225 million to produce, overcame some right-wing criticism to earn positive reviews from both critics and audiences.

          <p>An investigation has been launched in France after a 20-year-old inmate escaped from the Lyon-Corbas prison by hiding inside his cellmate's bag. The prisoner took advantage of his cellmate's scheduled release, smuggling himself out of the facility in his luggage on Friday. The prison service confirmed the escape and stated the inmate was serving multiple sentences and was also under investigation for organized crime links. A prison administration director described the incident as an 'extremely rare event' caused by an 'accumulation of errors' and 'serious malfunctions.'</p>

          <h2>Experts Debunk False and Harmful Claims Linking Texas Floods to Cloud Seeding</h2>

          <p>Experts are actively refuting widespread and baseless claims, amplified by some politicians, that the recent deadly floods in Texas were caused by cloud seeding. Cloud seeding is a weather modification technique used to increase precipitation, but scientists state it is incapable of generating the massive, sustained rainfall that led to the disaster. This article explains that such conspiracy theories are not only untrue but also actively harmful, as they distract from the real causes of extreme weather, like climate change, and erode public trust in science and government during a crisis.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government will soon unveil measures to make electric cars cheaper for consumers to buy. While she did not confirm if this would involve direct subsidies, she guaranteed that the upfront cost would be reduced to encourage the switch from petrol and diesel vehicles. The plan also includes a £25 million package for councils to install 'cross-pavement gullies' for easier home charging and £63 million for broader charging infrastructure. The move aims to boost EV sales, which are currently lagging behind government-mandated targets ahead of the 2030 ban.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The death toll from the catastrophic flooding in central Texas has risen to at least 129, with search operations for the missing being suspended due to new, heavy rainfall. The National Weather Service has issued life-threatening flash flood emergencies for several counties, including areas already devastated by the initial deluge. Any new rainfall is expected to cause rapid river rises, exacerbating the danger for residents and first responders. The ongoing severe weather is hampering rescue efforts and posing a continued threat to communities across the region.</p>

          <p>Russia's defense ministry has announced the capture of another village in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, signaling a continued intensification of its offensive. The report claims Russian forces advanced 'deep into the enemy's defense' to seize the settlement of Myrne. This development comes as the war, now in its fourth year, sees Moscow ramping up attacks while peace negotiations remain stalled. In a related event, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reportedly offered his 'unconditional support' to Russia, further solidifying the alliance between the two nations.</p>

          <p>This article examines a Trump administration proposal to have 'able-bodied' adults enrolled in Medicaid fill farm labor shortages resulting from an immigration crackdown. Health policy expert Robin Rudowitz of KFF discusses the practical challenges and assumptions behind this idea. The analysis explores the demographics of the Medicaid population, the nature of agricultural work, and the potential disconnect between the skills and geographic location of enrollees and the needs of the farming industry. The conversation questions whether this is a viable solution to the complex issue of agricultural labor in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon, one of the few remaining moderate Republicans in the House, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026. In an interview, Bacon cited burnout from the demanding job and the increasing intensity of harassment and death threats from both the far-left and 'dark MAGA' supporters as key factors in his decision. Representing a swing district that voted for Kamala Harris, Bacon's departure highlights the immense pressure faced by Republicans who are critical of Donald Trump and the current direction of the party, a trend that has seen many similar figures leave Congress.</p>

          <p>Under the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi, the U.S. Department of Justice has dropped all charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore, a Utah doctor accused of a major fraud scheme.

Bondi stated that Moore 'gave his patients a choice,' a sentiment echoed by supporters like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.

          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a prominent political economist and adviser to Beijing, has argued that Chinese think tanks must become more 'self-centred' to effectively project the country's soft power. He contends that these organizations should develop an 'indigenous knowledge system' based on China's own practical experiences rather than relying on Western academic frameworks. According to Zheng, this approach would allow them to better explain Chinese policies and governance to the world and more accurately predict the nation's future trajectory. This shift would move them away from university-style analysis toward more practical, empirical policy research.</p>

The piece details how these influencers have courted controversy without consequence, upending traditional media norms and becoming a key platform for right-wing ideas.
