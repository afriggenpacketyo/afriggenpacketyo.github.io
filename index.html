          <p>Sichuan University removed a job posting for a Japanese archaeologist, Kazuo Miyamoto, after facing online backlash.

The university had announced Miyamoto's appointment as a chair professor to contribute to cultural exchanges and develop interdisciplinary talent. Neither Miyamoto nor Sichuan University have responded to requests for comments after the announcement was removed from the university’s webpage.</p>

          <p>House Republicans moved forward with President Trump's budget package after conservative opposition initially stalled the bill. Negotiations led to some "minor modifications," according to Speaker Mike Johnson, allowing the bill to advance through the House Budget Committee. The legislation aims to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term and increase spending on military and border security, offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. However, the bill still faces challenges from conservatives seeking stricter spending cuts and moderates concerned about state and local tax deductions.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms, which led doctors to find a nodule on his prostate. While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management. Mr. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.</p>

          <p>Former US President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, his office announced. The cancer is characterized as a more aggressive form of the disease, with a Gleason score of 9 out of 10, but is reportedly hormone-sensitive. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options, and he has received support from both sides of the aisle, including former President Trump and former Vice-President Harris.</p>
