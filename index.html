          <p>Former President Donald Trump labeled the push to release all files related to Jeffrey Epstein as an "irrelevant" and a "Democrat hoax," a characterization that drew a sharp rebuke from a survivor. His comments come as a bipartisan discharge petition, led by Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, gains signatures to force a vote on the matter, creating a conflict with House leadership. Speaker Mike Johnson, after speaking with Trump, has advocated for an ongoing House Oversight Committee investigation as a more thorough alternative, calling the petition "unnecessary." The effort highlights a significant intra-party and bipartisan struggle over transparency concerning the deceased sex offender's network.</p>

The victory marks Auger-Aliassime's first Grand Slam semi-final appearance since 2021, while de Minaur continues to seek a breakthrough beyond the quarter-final stage at major tournaments. The match was characterized by a high number of errors and double faults from both players, with Auger-Aliassime acknowledging that nerves played a significant role.

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma fell by 13% in extended trading after releasing its first earnings report since its initial public offering. The company reported second-quarter revenue of $249.6 million, a 41% year-over-year increase that narrowly beat expectations, and reached breakeven on earnings per share. Despite the revenue growth, the stock's decline reflects investor reaction to its performance and future outlook in a market increasingly focused on the impact of artificial intelligence. Figma provided third-quarter revenue guidance that surpassed analyst consensus but also noted a slight dip in its net retention rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Michigan woman, Linda Stermer, was convicted of murdering her husband, Todd Stermer, in a case involving a house fire and a bizarre vehicle collision. In 2007, after their house caught fire, Todd escaped the blaze only to be run over by Linda in the family van as she was purportedly driving to get help. He died from his burn injuries, and investigators later found his blood on the van. Prosecutors argued she intentionally set the fire and ran him over, presenting circumstantial evidence including an alleged affair and testimony from her sons who believe she is guilty. Despite a federal judge overturning her initial 2010 conviction due to prosecutorial misconduct, she was retried and found guilty again in 2025.</p>

          <p>Angela Rayner, the UK's deputy prime minister and housing secretary, has admitted to underpaying stamp duty on a flat she purchased, attributing the error to incorrect legal advice.

Rayner has stated her commitment to resolving the matter with HMRC and has referred herself for an investigation by the prime minister's standards adviser. The admission has created a political challenge for the Labour government, with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch calling for her dismissal, though Prime Minister Keir Starmer has expressed his support.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to cancel $2.2 billion in research funding for Harvard University, ruling the action was unlawful. U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs determined that the administration used antisemitism as a "smokescreen" to improperly terminate the grants, stating the move was more related to the president's "power and political views." The judge's order criticized the administration for jeopardizing decades of research and disregarding constitutional rights like free speech and academic freedom. However, the ruling also noted that Harvard has been "plagued by antisemitism" and should have handled the issue better on its campus.</p>

Proponents argue the ban is necessary to eliminate perceived conflicts of interest and restore public trust, stating it is "crazy" that lawmakers are permitted to trade stocks while in office. While House Speaker Mike Johnson has expressed general support for a ban, the bill still faces opposition from some who believe it would deter experienced individuals from the private sector from running for office.

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that Americans continue to hold a negative view of the U.S. economy, with most describing it as "uncertain" and "struggling." Economic ratings have slightly decreased over the past month, with positive views remaining in the 30% range throughout the year. The primary driver of this sentiment is the perception of rising prices, as two-thirds of respondents believe prices are still increasing and expect them to continue to do so. These concerns about inflation are closely linked to how individuals rate their personal financial situations, with those in lower-income brackets reporting more negative outlooks.

          <p>Ten years after German Chancellor Angela Merkel's welcoming "wir schaffen das" declaration during the 2015 migrant crisis, Europe's approach to migration has shifted dramatically towards restriction and control. Concerns over security, economic strain, and the rise of far-right political parties have led many nations, including historically welcoming ones like Sweden, to adopt tougher immigration policies. Countries like Hungary have implemented stringent border controls, a stance now mirrored by others across the continent. This has led to a policy of outsourcing migration control through deals with non-EU nations and has been accompanied by a rise in documented human rights abuses against asylum seekers, reflecting a profound change in the continent's political landscape.</p>

          <p>The Premier League's recent transfer window, which saw clubs spend a record £3 billion, is fueling concerns about growing financial inequality within English football. While the league's media income drives its spending power above European rivals, critics point to a widening gap between the top-flight and lower divisions. Furthermore, Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) are creating a "dangerous 'double whammy'" by incentivizing ambitious mid-tier clubs to sell homegrown talent to the league's elite, who are enriched by Champions League revenue. Experts argue these rules have created a "glass ceiling," preventing clubs from challenging the established top order and polarizing the competitive landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters soared over 20% after the retailer reported second-quarter earnings that significantly beat Wall Street expectations and reinstated its full-year guidance. The company credited its recent marketing campaigns, particularly a successful, though controversial, partnership with actress Sydney Sweeney, for driving customer acquisition and sales. CEO Jay Schottenstein noted a positive start to the fall season, fueled by stronger product offerings and increased brand engagement from campaigns with Sweeney and NFL star Travis Kelce. The strong performance marks a turnaround for the retailer, which had previously struggled with merchandising missteps and tariff impacts. (not investment advice)</p>

In response to Republican gerrymandering efforts in states like Texas, Democrats are launching counteroffensives.

          <p>The NBA has launched an investigation into allegations that a now-bankrupt sustainability firm, Aspiration Partners, paid Clippers star Kawhi Leonard $28 million in a scheme to circumvent the league's salary cap. A podcast report detailed documents from Aspiration's bankruptcy proceedings showing a contract with Leonard's LLC for four annual payments of $7 million. The Clippers and owner Steve Ballmer, who was an investor in Aspiration, have forcefully denied the claims, stating the team's relationship with the firm ended years ago due to default. A former Aspiration employee alleged they were told the payments were to bypass the salary cap, a serious violation that could result in fines and the loss of draft picks for the team if proven.</p>

Gold's appeal is growing amid economic uncertainty, ongoing wars, and inflation concerns, serving as a "fear hedge" for portfolios.

The fossil reveals that the car-sized herbivore had meter-long spikes on its neck, large spikes over its hips, and ribs fused with outward-projecting spikes—a feature never seen before in any vertebrate. This discovery challenges previous understandings of ankylosaur evolution, suggesting they developed complex armor much earlier than believed.

          <p>Despite President Trump's repeated assertions that a peace deal is imminent, the war in Ukraine remains difficult to end due to fundamental, conflicting objectives between Kyiv and Moscow. While Ukraine has softened its stance to consider a ceasefire that leaves some territory occupied, Russia's demands remain maximalist, seeking not just land but also political subservience and restrictions on Ukraine's military. Analysts suggest that for Russian leadership, the conflict is an existential struggle against the West, making significant concessions unlikely. While diplomatic talks continue, Russia faces little immediate pressure to compromise, as it can withstand sanctions and hopes that U.S. support for Ukraine may eventually waver, prolonging the conflict indefinitely.</p>

Newsmax claims these anticompetitive behaviors have stunted its growth, distribution, and advertising revenue.
