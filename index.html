          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority in implementing reciprocal tariffs, a significant setback to his economic agenda. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unilateral power to impose sweeping tariffs. The ruling stated that the tariffs exceeded the authority granted by IEEPA and failed to address the threats outlined in the orders. The Trump administration has swiftly appealed the ruling, setting up a potential legal battle that could reach the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pedestrian deaths have surged by 78% in the past 15 years, partially due to the increasing size and weight of vehicles like SUVs and trucks. Larger vehicles have bigger blind zones and require longer braking distances, making it difficult for drivers to see pedestrians, especially children. Automakers have begun repositioning front cameras lower to improve visibility. The popularity of SUVs and pickup trucks, which account for three-quarters of vehicle sales in the U.S., contributes to the rising number of pedestrian fatalities.</p>

Experts have criticized the decision, arguing that it puts American lives and health at risk and leaves the country less prepared for the next influenza pandemic. Moderna says a study involving 300 healthy adults had produced "positive interim" results and the company "had previously expected to advance the program to late-stage development."</p>

          <p>A federal court has blocked President Trump from imposing tariffs on China and other trading partners, ruling that he exceeded his authority under federal law. The cases centered on the president's use of a 1977 federal economic emergency law. The court found that the law does not authorize the president to use emergency powers to issue tariffs. The White House has rebuked the court for its ruling, stating that unfair trade relationships have harmed American communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump has commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the co-founder of the Chicago gang Gangster Disciples, who was serving multiple life sentences in federal prison. Hoover was convicted on federal charges in 1997 while already serving a 200-year sentence on state charges for murder. Hoover's attorneys expressed their relief, while the lead prosecutor in Hoover's federal trial voiced disappointment. It is unclear how soon he will be released from federal custody, but he still faces the remainder of his 200-year sentence in Illinois.</p>
