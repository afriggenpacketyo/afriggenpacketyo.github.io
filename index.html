          <p>House committees convened to discuss critical components of President Trump's domestic agenda, including Medicaid cuts and tax proposals, but faced disruptions from protesters. Representative Guthrie called for a respectful debate but was met with shouting from protesters concerned about Medicaid. The House Ways and Means Committee considered a $2.5 trillion tax proposal while Democrats attempted to extend Obamacare marketplace subsidies. The Energy and Commerce Committee hearing was marked by accusations of misrepresentation and dishonest politicking, highlighting the deep divisions over proposed Medicaid reductions and their potential impact on millions of Americans. The proposed bill would reduce federal spending by an estimated $912 billion and cause 8.6 million people to become uninsured, according to a partial analysis from the Congressional Budget Office that was circulated by Democrats on the committee.</p>

          <p>New reports indicate that U.S. tariffs are expected to substantially reduce Sony's fiscal year 2025 operating profit by 100 billion yen. This financial hit highlights the vulnerability of global corporations to international trade policies and the potential for significant earnings impacts. The tariffs, presumably on goods imported into the U.S., will likely force Sony to re-evaluate its supply chain and pricing strategies to mitigate the financial losses. This is a developing story, and further details are anticipated regarding specific products and strategies that Sony may employ to counteract these effects.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of the 1989 murders of their parents, have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole. A Los Angeles judge agreed to the resentencing after hearing emotional statements from the brothers and their family, who argued for their release. The brothers acknowledged the killings but claimed they acted in self-defense after years of sexual assault, a claim the prosecution disputes. The decision follows a recommendation from the previous district attorney, while the current DA maintains the brothers have not taken full responsibility for their crimes.</p>

Some Israeli military officials privately acknowledge that Palestinians in Gaza face widespread starvation unless aid deliveries resume within weeks. The analysis exposes a gap between Israel's public stance and private deliberations, aligning with warnings from aid groups about the dangers posed by the blockade. The UN reports that most bakeries have shut, charity kitchens are closing, and food stocks are depleted, leading to dire conditions for civilians.</p>

          <p>A Joe Biden aide has responded to a new book alleging a White House cover-up of the former president's "physical deterioration" during his ill-fated re-election campaign. The book, 'Original Sin,' claims that Biden's condition was so poor that aides discussed putting him in a wheelchair. A spokesperson for Biden maintained that "evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity" and that the Democrat had been "a very effective president." The book largely cites anonymous sources, with one exception from David Plouffe, who worked on Vice-President Harris's campaign, saying, "We got so screwed by Biden as a party."</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reinstated Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, making them eligible for the sport's Hall of Fame after their careers were marred by gambling scandals. The decision, which changes the league's policy on permanent ineligibility, also includes 15 other players. Rose agreed to a permanent ban in 1989 for betting on baseball games, while Jackson was banned for his involvement in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The Hall of Fame's board will now consider their candidacy, with the earliest possible induction in 2028.</p>
