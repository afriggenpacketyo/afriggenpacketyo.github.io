        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of regional banks and investment firm Jefferies have fallen sharply due to rising concerns on Wall Street about the quality of commercial loans. Recent bankruptcies in the auto sector and disclosures of bad loans by banks like Zions and Western Alliance have unsettled investors, sparking fears of a wider credit issue. While some analysts believe the problem is isolated, the opacity of the private credit market is causing a "sell first, ask questions later" mentality. This situation recalls the banking turmoil of 2023, though major banks have seen only minor declines this time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector General is alerting beneficiaries to a sophisticated scam involving fraudulent letters that appear to be from the U.S. Supreme Court. These letters, bearing the court's seal and fake signatures of justices, falsely claim the recipient is under investigation and that their assets will be frozen. Scammers then follow up with calls or texts to trick victims into providing personal information or money. This scheme represents an evolution of government imposter scams, using multiple contact points to appear more legitimate and prey on recipients' fears.</p>

          <p>A Milwaukee Brewers fan lost her job and resigned from a charity board after a video showed her threatening to call Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on a Hispanic Dodgers supporter during a playoff game. The incident occurred after the Dodgers fan, Ricardo Fosado, a U.S. military veteran, commented on the quiet crowd. The woman, identified as Shannon Kobylarczyk, was subsequently fired by her employer, ManpowerGroup. Despite being the target of the remarks and being ejected from the stadium, Fosado stated he felt she should not have been fired over the incident.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by S&P Global estimates that President Trump's trade tariffs will impose costs exceeding $1.2 trillion on global businesses in 2025. The report suggests that companies will absorb only about one-third of this financial burden, with the remaining two-thirds being passed on to consumers through higher prices. The study, based on data from thousands of companies, identifies tariffs and trade barriers as a systemic transfer of wealth from corporate profits to governments and other sectors. This economic pressure is expected to cause a contraction in profit margins for the year. (not investment advice)</p>

His campaign spokesperson confirmed the winnings and stated that the governor intends to donate the full amount to charity. Pritzker, who is considered a potential 2028 presidential candidate, has placed his personal assets in a blind trust since becoming governor.</p>

Democrats argued against funding the Pentagon separately, insisting that appropriations for other critical domestic programs must be addressed concurrently.

The Treasury Department reported that the deficit-to-GDP ratio is now estimated at 5.9%, a historically high figure outside of economic crises.

The Tomahawk's key feature is its ability to fly at very low altitudes, making it difficult for Russian air defense systems to intercept.

          <p>Senator Mitch McConnell, 83, experienced a fall in a Capitol hallway on Thursday while being approached by environmental activists. A video of the incident shows the senator appearing unsteady before falling to the floor; he was then helped up by his security detail and continued walking. This event is the latest in a series of public health concerns for McConnell, who previously suffered a fall in 2023 and experienced two instances of freezing up during press conferences. McConnell has announced he will step down as Republican leader and will not seek reelection when his term ends in 2027.</p>

          <p>A top official at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has confirmed that the agency is probing the social media accounts of immigration applicants to identify "anti-American" activity. This vetting is part of a Trump administration directive that treats such views as a significant negative factor in application decisions. The USCIS director stated the focus is on activity that is "beyond the pale," such as supporting violent overthrow of the government or terrorist groups, not on general political dissent. Critics argue this policy could be used to punish noncitizens for exercising legally protected speech.</p>

Muscat, a 52-year-old former Rangers player, is currently managing Shanghai Port in the Chinese Super League.

The club has been searching for a new manager after sacking Russell Martin just 17 games into his tenure. Muscat has previous managerial success, having won league titles in both Australia's A-League and Japan's J-League.</p>

          <p>The head of MI5, Sir Ken McCallum, has warned that the UK is operating in a "new era" of security threats, facing near-record volumes of terror investigations alongside rapidly increasing espionage from states like Russia, China, and Iran. In his annual address, he stated this has forced the biggest shift in the agency's mission since 9/11. He highlighted that state actors are using methods more commonly seen in terrorism cases and revealed that MI5 had disrupted a Chinese national security threat within the past week. The agency is also contending with a huge number of terror plots, having disrupted 19 late-stage attacks since 2020.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As credit card debt and delinquencies rise in the U.S., more consumers are facing lawsuits from creditors. This article explains that while hiring a lawyer is not mandatory, it can be beneficial for large debts or complex cases where defenses like an expired statute of limitations may apply. Crucially, individuals must respond to a lawsuit to avoid a default judgment, which can lead to wage garnishment or frozen bank accounts. Alternatives to court include negotiating a settlement directly with the creditor, seeking help from a credit counseling agency, or, in severe cases, filing for bankruptcy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has ruled that pets traveling in an aircraft's hold are to be legally classified as "baggage." The decision came in a case where a Spanish woman sued an airline for non-material damages after her dog was lost during transport. The court found that under the Montreal Convention governing air travel, pets are not "passengers," and therefore compensation for their loss is subject to the liability limits for luggage. The ruling clarifies that airlines' financial liability is limited unless a passenger pays an extra fee to declare a special interest.</p>

          <p>MI5 Director General Sir Ken McCallum stated that Chinese state operatives pose a daily national security threat to the UK and expressed frustration over the recent collapse of a prosecution against two men accused of spying for China. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped the case, reportedly after concluding the evidence did not sufficiently prove China was a threat. This has sparked a political controversy, with critics accusing the government of appeasing Beijing for economic reasons. McCallum affirmed that the alleged spying activity was disrupted by MI5 and that it is "frustrating when prosecutions fall through."</p>

          <p>The upcoming United States Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, has been officially declared a "heat hazard" by Formula 1's governing body, the FIA, due to forecasted temperatures exceeding 31°C (88°F). This is the second consecutive race to receive this designation under new safety rules. The classification triggers a rule allowing drivers the option to use in-car cooling vests to combat potentially dangerous conditions. While some drivers find the vests uncomfortable, others see them as a performance advantage by helping to keep them fresher during the demanding race in the unseasonably hot Texas weather.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how modern digital interactions are making real relationships feel more like one-sided, parasocial ones. As social media platforms shift from personal connection hubs to content-driven entertainment streams, interactions with friends and family are becoming more passive, akin to consuming media about celebrities. The lack of reciprocity in simply viewing a friend's post, rather than engaging, mimics the dynamic of a fan and a star. This trend is extending to private group chats and voice notes, where communication can feel more like broadcasting to an audience than a direct, two-way conversation.</p>

The assessment, conducted by the group Steady State, uses intelligence analysis methods to examine domestic democratic decline. The report concludes with "moderate to high confidence" that the Trump administration is systematically manipulating institutions to consolidate executive power, citing the politicization of law enforcement, attacks on judicial independence, and efforts to ensure ideological conformity across government as key indicators of this dangerous trend.</p>

The proposed "super-embassy" has faced significant opposition due to security concerns, including its proximity to critical financial communications infrastructure, which critics fear could be vulnerable to espionage.

However, Democratic-led states have resisted, arguing it is an unlawful effort to aggregate data for purposes like immigration enforcement.
