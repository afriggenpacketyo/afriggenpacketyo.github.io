          <p>The trial of Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate former President Trump in September 2024, commenced with the defendant forfeiting his opening statement. Routh, who is representing himself, was cut off by Judge Aileen Cannon after delivering a rambling speech that referenced Adolf Hitler and global conflicts instead of the case specifics. Prosecutors allege Routh meticulously planned the attack with military-grade weapons, driven by a desire to prevent Trump's re-election. The trial is expected to last several weeks and features testimony from Secret Service agents and eyewitnesses.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby publicly predicted that struggling competitor Spirit Airlines is headed for bankruptcy, stating that the business model for discount airlines is no longer viable. Speaking at an industry conference, Kirby asserted that Spirit's financial situation is unsustainable, a claim he based on his mathematical analysis of their position. He criticized the ultra-low-cost carrier model for relying on unsustainable growth and frustrating customers with numerous fees. Spirit Airlines, which recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, responded on social media by suggesting United's focus on them indicates concern over their competitive low fares.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a university event in Utah has drawn widespread condemnation from American political figures of all affiliations. President Trump, a close associate of Kirk, announced his death and blamed the killing on what he termed "radical left" rhetoric, ordering flags to be lowered to half-staff. Former presidents Biden, Obama, Bush, and Clinton, along with numerous members of Congress from both parties, issued statements denouncing political violence and offering condolences. The event has intensified the national conversation about civility and the dangers of extreme political discourse in the United States.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone expressed his excitement about President Trump's attendance at their game against the Detroit Tigers, which coincided with the 24th anniversary of the September 11th attacks. Boone reflected on the significant role baseball played in national healing and restoring a sense of normalcy following the 2001 tragedy. The president's visit prompted heightened security measures at Yankee Stadium, occurring just one day after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Before the game, Boone and several players participated in a commemorative wreath-laying ceremony at the stadium's 9/11 monument.</p>

The move signals further consolidation in a media industry being reshaped by streaming and comes as companies face increased scrutiny from the Trump administration.

          <p>Nadine Menendez, wife of former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 54 months in federal prison for her role in a high-profile bribery scheme. She was convicted of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, gold bars, and a luxury car in exchange for her husband's political influence. During her sentencing, Menendez tearfully expressed remorse and claimed she had blindly followed her husband, whom she is not divorcing. The judge acknowledged her health issues but emphasized her central role in the conspiracy, setting her surrender date for July 2026.</p>

          <p>A majority of justices on a Brazilian Supreme Court panel have voted to convict former President Jair Bolsonaro on multiple charges, including attempting to orchestrate a coup to unlawfully remain in power after his 2022 election loss.

          <p>The FBI has intensified its search for the person responsible for the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk by releasing images of a person of interest and offering a $100,000 reward.

          <p>The assassination of Charlie Kirk during an open-air event at Utah Valley University has raised significant questions about the adequacy of the security measures in place. The event, attended by approximately 3,000 people, was staffed by six university police officers and Kirk's private security team. Experts suggest that the outdoor setting made security more challenging, as protocols like bag checks and metal detectors are not typically used. The shooter reportedly fired from the roof of an adjacent building, highlighting a vulnerability that might have been monitored with additional measures like aerial drones, which were likely not in use.</p>

          <p>This article posits that President Trump and his allies are creating a misleading narrative by blaming the left for political violence following the assassination of Charlie Kirk. It argues that while the shooter's motives are unknown, the right has prematurely assigned blame in a way that ignores data showing far-right extremists have perpetrated the majority of domestic terror attacks in recent decades. The author contends that Trump's own rhetoric has often encouraged or excused violence, from the January 6th Capitol riot to comments about his political opponents. The piece concludes that this framing creates a dangerous environment detached from factual reality.</p>

A former manager noted Wissa's immediate determination to recover and succeed, a trait that has defined his career.

Several universities have entered lockdowns due to threats, and some politicians, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have canceled public events.

          <p>This article explores the rise of Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative activist who was assassinated, and his significant impact on the modern Republican party, particularly among young people. Starting as a high school student concerned with economic policy, Kirk founded Turning Point USA, which evolved into a powerful force in the culture wars, championing conservative social stances. He was a key ally to Donald Trump, credited with branding the MAGA movement for a younger audience and proving to be a gifted strategist and fundraiser. His death has left a major void, though his ideas and tactics are now deeply embedded within the party's structure.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have successfully altered the chamber's rules to accelerate the confirmation process for President Trump's executive branch nominees, bypassing Democratic opposition. The change, which lowers the voting threshold to a simple majority for certain procedural steps, was enacted after months of Republicans criticizing Democrats for slowing down confirmations. Majority Leader John Thune initiated the move, which Democrats warned against as a "nuclear" option that they would come to regret. The new rule allows for considering non-cabinet level nominees in groups, aiming to overcome the blockade and allow the president to fully staff his administration.</p>

          <p>This article examines the current earning potential of a traditional savings account, highlighting its minimal returns in the current economic climate. With the national average interest rate at just 0.39% and inflation recently rising to 2.9%, money held in these accounts is effectively losing purchasing power. A $10,000 deposit would earn less than $40 in interest over a full year, a figure that is likely to decrease as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates. The analysis suggests that savers should consider alternatives like high-yield savings accounts or Certificates of Deposit (CDs) to achieve more substantial and reliable returns.

Discovery by Paramount Skydance would create a media titan with an immense portfolio of valuable intellectual property and sports broadcasting rights. The deal would combine Paramount's franchises like 'Star Trek' and 'Mission: Impossible' with Warner's iconic assets, including the DC superhero universe, 'Harry Potter,' and 'Game of Thrones.' Furthermore, it would merge Warner's rights to broadcast MLB, NHL, and March Madness with Paramount's new exclusive deal for UFC events. This consolidation would create a content library and sports arsenal powerful enough to compete directly with industry giants like Disney.</p>

          <p>The latest Consumer Price Index report shows that inflation rose to 2.9% in August, moving further away from the Federal Reserve's 2% target and creating economic uncertainty. In this environment, the article suggests that investing in gold could be a prudent strategy for protecting wealth. Gold has historically served as a hedge against inflation, often maintaining or increasing its value while the purchasing power of currency erodes. With the price of gold recently surpassing record highs, the analysis indicates that now may be a crucial time for investors to consider allocating a portion of their portfolio to the precious metal.

          <p>English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick experienced a bizarre incident at the BMW PGA Championship that he believes ultimately worked in his favor. After his tee shot on the 18th hole went into the bushes just before a weather delay, his ball could not be found upon resumption of play. Eyewitnesses reported seeing two individuals run off with a golf ball from that area, leading Fitzpatrick to conclude it was stolen. This allowed him to take a penalty drop instead of playing a provisional ball from a worse position, a situation he feels saved him at least one stroke and contributed to his strong opening round score.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging that the ride-hailing company engages in systemic discrimination against passengers with disabilities. The complaint, filed in federal court, accuses Uber and its drivers of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act by routinely refusing service to individuals with service animals or stowable wheelchairs. The suit also claims the company unfairly applies cleaning and cancellation fees to these riders after unlawfully denying them service. Uber has stated that it has a zero-tolerance policy for such discrimination and fundamentally disagrees with the DOJ's allegations.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has sent goalkeeper Andre Onana to Turkish club Trabzonspor on a loan deal for the remainder of the 2025-26 season. The move comes after Onana, who was signed from Inter Milan for £47.2 million in 2023 to be the team's primary keeper, failed to appear in the club's first three Premier League matches of the new season. His only game time this year was during a surprising loss in the Carabao Cup.

This article explains that the trial, which was widely broadcast, has been seen by critics as a necessary step to uphold democratic principles and set a precedent against undermining elections. Evidence presented included alleged assassination plots and systematic efforts to cast doubt on the voting system. While Bolsonaro's supporters, including President Trump, decry the trial as political persecution, the verdict is viewed by many as a crucial defense of Brazil's young democracy.</p>

          <p>Average 30-year mortgage rates have fallen to 6.35%, their lowest point in almost a year, creating a potential opportunity for prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing. The decline is attributed to expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. This article advises consumers to weigh the risks of waiting for potentially lower rates against the possibility of them rising again. For current homeowners, it suggests that if today's rates are at least a percentage point below their existing mortgage rate, exploring a refinance could be a financially beneficial move.
