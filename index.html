          <p>A shooting at a University of New Mexico dormitory resulted in the death of a 14-year-old and the injury of a 19-year-old. The incident occurred early Friday morning during a gathering in a dorm room, where an 18-year-old suspect allegedly opened fire before fleeing. New Mexico State Police have since taken the suspect into custody, and the investigation is ongoing. The university closed its central campus as a precaution and is offering counseling services to the community.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched in Tunis, Tunisia, calling for the downfall of President Kais Saied's government, which they label an "authoritarian regime." The demonstration marked four years since Saied dissolved parliament and began ruling by decree, a move critics call a coup. Protesters demanded the release of jailed opposition leaders, journalists, and activists, stating that the country has become an "open-air prison." This reflects growing discontent over the erosion of democratic institutions and civil liberties under Saied's leadership.</p>

          <p>NASA has confirmed that nearly 4,000 employees, representing more than one-fifth of its total workforce, have applied to leave the agency through a deferred resignation program. This potential exodus would shrink NASA's civil servant staff from approximately 18,000 to 14,000. The departures come as the agency faces a proposed 25% budget cut for fiscal year 2026 and navigates a leadership crisis. Despite the significant staff reduction, NASA maintains that safety remains its top priority for future exploration missions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities have reported that one of two hand grenades recovered from a Santa Monica townhome is missing following a deadly explosion that killed three Los Angeles County sheriff’s detectives. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that only one of the devices detonated at the training academy where they were being rendered safe. A thorough search for the second grenade has been unsuccessful, prompting a nationwide investigation into its origin and whereabouts. The sheriff has ordered an independent review of the department's explosive disposal protocols.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has suggested that the United Kingdom will participate in airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza, following Israel's approval for such deliveries. This comes as the government faces mounting pressure, with over 220 MPs signing a letter urging the recognition of a Palestinian state, a move France recently committed to. Starmer emphasized the UK would "pull every lever" to deliver life-saving support to Palestinians amid a worsening humanitarian crisis. Aid agencies, however, caution that airdrops are an inefficient method for delivering necessary supplies.</p>

While Tesla CEO Elon Musk has hinted at expanding the company's robotaxi service, the California Public Utilities Commission clarified that Tesla's current permit only allows for a charter-party carrier service with human drivers. This distinction means any "friends and family" service launched in the state must be more of a traditional taxi service than a fully autonomous one.

The Royal Horticultural Society noted a boom in aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, which thrive in warm, dry conditions. While this has been a visibly bumper year for some insects, experts caution that the relative lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year. This short-term boom contrasts with long-term research suggesting a general decline in the UK's flying insect population.</p>

The rescue mission involved capturing dozens of sheep from the last remaining disease-free herd and airlifting them to the Franklin Mountains.

          <p>Several former federal prosecutors have described the direct involvement of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in interviewing Ghislaine Maxwell as highly unorthodox and concerning. They question the credibility of any information from a convicted, sentenced prisoner who is likely desperate for a deal to reduce her sentence. Experts noted that such interviews are typically handled by line prosecutors with deep case knowledge to assess truthfulness, not by a high-ranking political appointee. The situation is seen by some as a political move to address public pressure rather than a standard investigative procedure.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas executed a dramatic plunge shortly after takeoff to avoid a potential collision with another aircraft, injuring two flight attendants. Passengers reported being lifted from their seats during the sudden maneuver, which the pilot later explained was a response to a collision warning. According to flight tracking data, the plane nearly intercepted a privately owned Hawker Hunter fighter jet. The Federal Aviation Administration has confirmed it is investigating the incident, which is the second near-miss in U.S. airspace this week.</p>

          <p>This article explores the necessity of strictly adhering to popular health targets, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and walking 10,000 steps daily. Experts suggest there is often more flexibility than commonly believed; for instance, thirst is a reliable guide for hydration for most healthy people. However, they caution against dismissing all guidelines, noting that consistent sleep of at least seven hours is strongly linked to long-term health. The consensus is that while benchmarks are useful, a balanced, less rigid approach to incorporating healthy habits is often more sustainable and effective.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, moving beyond treating female athletes as "mini-men" to researching their unique physiology. Scientists are studying how factors like breast biomechanics, the menstrual cycle, and anatomical differences affect performance and injury risk. Research shows that proper sports bras can significantly improve performance by reducing inefficient movement, while a greater understanding of the menstrual cycle can help athletes manage symptoms. This new focus aims to optimize performance, reduce injuries like ACL tears, and keep more women and girls engaged in sports.</p>

While an Earth impact has been ruled out, a lunar strike could create a visible flash and a large crater, sending lunar debris toward our planet. This debris could pose a significant threat to orbiting satellites crucial for communication and navigation, as well as any potential lunar missions. The scenario is prompting planetary defense experts to consider expanding their monitoring to include threats to the moon.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the food aid boxes being distributed in Gaza by the Israel- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has raised concerns among nutrition experts. While the boxes, containing items like pasta, flour, and lentils, may provide sufficient calories for survival, they are reportedly deficient in essential vitamins and minerals. Experts warn that a prolonged diet of these items could lead to "hidden hunger" and diseases like anemia and scurvy, and they lack suitable food for young children. The aid's effectiveness is further hampered by severe water and fuel shortages needed for cooking.</p>
