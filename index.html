          <p>A prominent group of American business leaders, led by FedEx CEO Rajesh Subramaniam, is scheduled to visit Beijing this week. The visit, organized by the US-China Business Council, coincides with a new round of trade talks between the two nations. While the full agenda is not public, the delegation is expected to meet with Chinese officials to revive business discussions. This trip marks the most significant American business delegation to China since the escalation of tariff disputes in April.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed that a convicted fraudster named James Kenny orchestrated an elaborate, non-existent music festival called Monmouth Rising. He falsely claimed to have booked major acts like The Killers and secured significant investment, deceiving employees, suppliers, and the local community. The festival, promoted as the world's first hydrogen-powered event, unraveled when payments were missed and forged documents were discovered. The article details the "fantasist's" methods and the financial and emotional impact on those who believed in his grand, fraudulent vision.</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old mother from Apple Valley, California, has experienced a remarkable coincidence, giving birth to all four of her children on July 7th. Nauzhae Drake welcomed her fourth child on 7/7 of this year, following her three older children who were also born on the same date in 2019, 2021, and 2022. None of the births were induced or occurred on their due dates, a statistical improbability far rarer than winning the lottery. Drake, a nursing student, views the shared birthday as a blessing and a sign from God.</p>

          <p>A recent investigation by Le Parisien found that some Parisian cafes are overcharging foreign tourists, a practice a former waitress says is not surprising. Writing in The Guardian, Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett recounts her experiences on both sides of the transaction, confirming that while she never scammed customers, upselling and dishonest tactics are known in the industry. She offers practical advice for travelers to avoid being ripped off, such as always asking for tap water, questioning the bill, and being wary of deals that seem too good to be true.</p>

          <p>A senior Chinese official has called for a clearer presentation of the history of ancient kingdoms that existed in what is now northeastern China, reigniting a sensitive historical dispute with South Korea. Huang Qiang, the party chief of Jilin province, referred to the Fuyu, Gaogouli, and Bohai kingdoms by their Chinese names, which are internationally known by their Korean names. This emphasis on a China-centric historical narrative touches upon a long-standing academic and political disagreement over whether these kingdoms are part of Chinese or Korean history, potentially straining diplomatic ties.</p>

This expanded information control, a hallmark of Xi Jinping's rule, aims to prevent copycat crimes and unrest but leaves citizens demanding truth and transparency. Following a particularly deadly attack in November, authorities have tightened their grip, often deleting reports or issuing vague statements that omit key details.

The complex trial detailed their turbulent relationship, which included Ashley's accusations of poisoning and Doug's admission of firing a gun in their home.

          <h2>Aid Agencies Criticize Gaza Airdrops as Inefficient and a 'Grotesque Distraction'</h2>

          <p>International aid agency leaders have strongly criticized the focus on airdropping aid into Gaza, labeling it a "grotesque distraction" that is expensive, inefficient, and dangerous. While Israel and other nations have begun or plan to conduct airdrops, organizations like the International Rescue Committee and UNRWA warn they cannot deliver the necessary volume of aid to combat the severe starvation crisis. They argue that thousands of aid trucks are waiting for access via land routes, which is a faster, cheaper, and safer method. The debate highlights the failure to get aid into Gaza through traditional crossings.</p>

          <h2>Israeli Military Announces Airdrops and Humanitarian Corridors for Gaza Aid</h2>

          <p>Amid growing international pressure and reports of starvation-related deaths, the Israeli military announced it has begun airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza. The IDF also stated it would establish humanitarian corridors to allow for the safe movement of United Nations aid convoys. This action comes after months of warnings about a potential famine and follows several incidents where hundreds of Palestinians were killed trying to access aid. Despite the move, the head of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency has criticized airdrops as an inefficient solution to the "manmade hunger" in the territory.</p>

          <p>An advertisement for the brand Guess in the latest issue of Vogue has generated controversy by featuring a supermodel created entirely with artificial intelligence. While not an editorial choice by the magazine, the ad's use of a flawless, AI-generated person has raised concerns about reinforcing unrealistic beauty standards and the potential impact on real models. Critics argue the move is "disheartening" and undermines progress toward diversity in the fashion industry. The debate highlights the growing ethical questions surrounding AI's role in media and its effect on consumer body image.</p>
