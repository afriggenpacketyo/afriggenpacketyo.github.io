          <p>The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) reported detecting and tracking Russian military aircraft flying in the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone this week. While such occurrences are regular and the planes were not considered a threat, they remained in international airspace under surveillance. This event is the latest in a series of similar sightings this year, which have previously prompted the U.S. and Canada to scramble fighter jets in response to the activity. NORAD affirmed its readiness to defend North American airspace using its layered defense network of radars and aircraft.</p>

          <p>Uber has announced a new pilot program in the U.S. that will allow women drivers and riders to preferentially match with each other. The feature, launching next month in select cities including Los Angeles and San Francisco, is designed to enhance comfort and safety on the platform. While not a guarantee, it increases the likelihood of women being paired together. This initiative follows similar features launched in other countries and comes as ridesharing companies face ongoing scrutiny over safety and sexual assault incidents involving their platforms.</p>

          <p>China maintained its lead in the global shipbuilding market, securing 68.3% of new vessel orders in the first half of the year, though this marks a decrease from nearly 75% in the same period last year. The total order volume also fell by 18.2%, a decline analysts attribute to shipowner caution regarding orders for oil and LNG tankers. This hesitation is linked to the United States' prominent role as a major exporter of oil and LNG. Despite the dip, experts believe China's competitive advantages in the sector remain strong.

          <p>Scientists from the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre claim to have overcome a major challenge in stealth aircraft design that they say contributed to the cancellation of the U.S. Navy's X-47B drone program. Their new software platform reportedly allows for a vast number of design variables without increasing computational load, breaking the so-called "dimensionality curse." By applying their system to the X-47B model, they achieved significant theoretical improvements in aerodynamics, stealth, and propulsion. This innovation could have major implications for the future of military aviation technology.</p>

The hearing will feature victim impact statements from the families, who have expressed divided opinions on the plea agreement that spared Kohberger's life.

          <p>The mother of Jeremiah Kelly, an 18-year-old University of Cincinnati freshman football player who died unexpectedly in April, is questioning if his death could have been prevented. A coroner's report identified the cause as cardiac hypertrophy, a thickening of the heart muscle, a condition that shocked his mother who described him as a healthy child. Although Kelly had passed a required NCAA physical, his mother now plans to have her other sons see a sports cardiologist to be more aware of potential risks.

Finch, who had planned to become a history teacher, has faced criticism from opposition councillors for his age and lack of professional experience, which he dismisses as "ageist." He became interim leader after his predecessor resigned and has already engaged in local issues, such as a dispute over a Union Jack dress at a school.

          <p>An analysis suggests that President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff strategy is achieving tangible results, exemplified by the recent trade agreement with Japan. The deal, which sets a 15% tariff on many Japanese goods, is viewed as a significant win for the White House, potentially influencing other economic blocs like the European Union. While Japan secured a better outcome than the threatened 25% tariff, the deal highlights a broader acceptance of U.S. protectionist measures. However, questions remain about the long-term economic impact, as U.S. consumers will likely bear the cost through higher prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ari Aster's new film, "Eddington," is described as a surreal neo-Western that channels the anxiety and conspiratorial thinking of the early COVID-19 pandemic. The movie follows a small-town New Mexico sheriff, played by Joaquin Phoenix, whose struggle to maintain control in his community spirals into a violent and absurd spectacle. This article compares the protagonist to Travis Bickle from "Taxi Driver," exploring how the film immerses the viewer in the chaotic perspective of a man committed to his own distorted sense of justice. The film is characterized as a dark, lacerating comedy about modern societal fears.</p>

          <p>An investigation into the federal cleanup effort following Hurricane Helene in North Carolina suggests that the operation created a secondary environmental disaster. According to state biologists and environmental experts, contractors hired by the Army Corps of Engineers removed far more than just storm debris, clearing live trees and essential wildlife habitats. The payment structure, which compensates contractors by the volume of debris removed, is cited as a key reason for the excessive clearing. This practice allegedly harmed ecosystems and endangered species, including freshwater mussels and hellbender salamanders, in some of the state's waterways.</p>

          <p>The new trade agreement between the United States and Japan is poised to have significant effects on the global economy, particularly in Asia. The deal reduces the U.S. tariff on Japanese auto imports from 27.5% to 15%, providing a boost to major car manufacturers like Toyota and Honda. In return, Japan has proposed a $550 billion investment in the U.S. to bolster key supply chains. This agreement sets a benchmark for other Asian nations like South Korea and Taiwan currently in trade negotiations with Washington, putting pressure on them to secure favorable terms.</p>

          <p>The political future of Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is uncertain following his ruling coalition's loss in upper house elections, creating potential implications for relations with China. Ishiba, who has maintained a largely pragmatic approach toward Beijing, is facing intense pressure to step down. If he resigns, it would trigger a leadership contest within the Liberal Democratic Party. Any change in leadership could affect the momentum of diplomatic progress between the two nations, though his prospects may have improved following a reported trade deal with the United States.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama's office issued a rare and forceful statement refuting President Donald Trump's recent calls to prosecute him for treason. Trump had accused Obama of attempting to orchestrate a "coup" by manufacturing evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Obama's office labeled the claims "outrageous," "ridiculous," and a "weak attempt at distraction," stating they do not normally dignify such misinformation with a response. The statement reaffirmed the consensus finding that Russia worked to influence the election, as confirmed by a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report in 2020.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 115 international aid organizations, including Doctors Without Borders and Save the Children, has issued a stark warning about "mass starvation" in Gaza. In a joint statement, the groups blame the Israeli government's siege and restrictions on aid for creating chaos and death, with some aid workers now needing to join food lines themselves. According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, dozens of people, including children, have died from famine and malnutrition in recent days.

The 66-year-old was part of a tour group when he decided to return to his hotel alone but never arrived.

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has determined the probable cause of a fatal 2023 plane crash in Alaska that killed Eugene Peltola Jr., the husband of former U.S. Rep.

These factors, combined with downdrafts and turbulent conditions, likely caused the plane to have insufficient power to clear the terrain. Peltola was the sole occupant of the aircraft.</p>

Senior figures from the junior coalition partner, the Social Democrats, had urged the government to sign the declaration.
