          <p>Afro Charities is relocating the AFRO American Newspapers' archives to the Upton Mansion in West Baltimore with the aim of creating a public research archive. The archives contain millions of photos, thousands of newspaper editions, letters, and audio recordings dating back to 1892, including letters from Booker T. Washington. The $16 million project will renovate the vacant mansion into the new AFRO News headquarters and archives, providing an inviting space for the public to connect with their histories.

          <p>An inquest into the death of Rhianan Rudd, a 16-year-old girl groomed and charged with terrorism offenses, concluded that authorities missed opportunities to help her. The coroner cited a "systems failure" by counter-terror police and Derbyshire County Council for not referring Rudd earlier as a potential victim of modern slavery. Rudd, who took her own life in May 2022, had been exploited online by an American neo-Nazi and became fixated on Adolf Hitler. The inquest highlighted failures in providing timely mental health support and safeguarding her, despite legal obligations to do so.</p>

          <p>A study in JAMA Pediatrics found that firearm-related deaths among children and teens sharply increased after states loosened gun laws following a 2010 Supreme Court decision. States with more permissive gun laws saw over 6,000 excess deaths, while states with stricter laws, like California and New York, experienced significant drops. Firearms are now the leading cause of death for young people in the U.S., with most deaths being homicides and suicides.

          <p>The UK government has finalized its latest spending plans, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves set to announce funding increases for the NHS, schools, defense, and infrastructure projects. Reeves has loosened Treasury borrowing rules to invest in infrastructure, but will need to make budget cuts to meet fiscal rules. Ministers were locked in budget talks to protect their budgets, with the Home Office arguing for maintained police numbers. The government has pledged to hike defense spending, invest in science and technology, and provide free school meals to more children.</p>

          <p>A riot at the Trousdale Turner Correctional Center in Tennessee was contained overnight, with all prisoners returned to their cells after officers deployed chemical agents. The incident began when several inmates refused to return to their cells, and three guards were briefly held hostage but released safely. A multi-agency response helped secure the facility, and one correctional officer sustained minor injuries.

          <p>The UK government's decision to largely reverse cuts to winter fuel payments has raised questions about its spending and savings plans. The government initially planned to limit payments to pensioners receiving pension credit, but will now provide payments to all pensioners, clawing them back in the following tax year for those earning above Â£35,000. This U-turn will cost Â£1.25 billion, a saving of only Â£450 million relative to the original system, with some analysts suggesting the net saving could be even lower. The Treasury plans to address the resulting Â£1 billion gap in the next Budget.</p>
