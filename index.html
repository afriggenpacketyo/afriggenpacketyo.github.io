        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Mark Warner, vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, expressed serious concerns about the Trump administration's lack of a clear plan regarding Iran, noting that even Republican colleagues seem uninformed. Warner highlighted the intelligence community's consensus that Iran isn't currently developing nuclear weapons, questioning the administration's potential dismissal of this assessment. He cautioned against manipulating intelligence, referencing the Iraq War as a consequence of disregarding accurate information. Warner emphasized the importance of the intelligence community speaking truth to power and ensuring that policy decisions are based on factual assessments rather than manipulated data. Optimism is tempered by the potential for miscalculation and escalation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's mixed messaging on immigration raids has created confusion and fear among businesses and workers. While a pause in raids initially brought relief, subsequent statements from the Department of Homeland Security indicated a continued focus on worksite enforcement. This flip-flop has baffled businesses and left employees stressed, particularly in industries heavily reliant on immigrant labor. The raids have led to labor shortages and economic disruption, with many workers fearing detention and deportation, impacting industries like agriculture, hospitality, and construction.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel will exact the full price from Iran following a missile strike on Soroka Hospital in Beersheba. Netanyahu stated that Iran's actions targeted both the hospital and civilian populations, prompting Israel to continue defending its people.

          <p>Google faces a setback as an advisor to the European Union's top court recommended dismissing its appeal against a record 4.1 billion euro antitrust fine. The advocate general at the European Court of Justice advised the court to uphold the fine, which had already been reduced from 4.34 billion euros. The EU's General Court had previously determined that Google had abused its dominance in the Android mobile operating system market. This opinion strengthens the likelihood that Google will have to pay the substantial fine.</p>

          <p>Amber heat health alerts have been issued across England due to expected temperatures exceeding 30C.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) warns of potential difficulties in managing medicines, workforce challenges, and possible rise in deaths, particularly among vulnerable populations. The rising temperatures are attributed to high pressure and a south-easterly wind drawing in hot weather from Western Europe.</p>

This decision comes after a phone conversation between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Egyptian counterpart.

Ishiba's government is currently grappling with differences with the United States over tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, while also facing rising tensions in the Middle East.

Foreign Secretary David Lammy traveled to Washington to meet his US counterpart Marco Rubio, after Donald Trump said he was considering whether to join Israeli strikes against Iran.

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, allowed Tennessee's ban on transition-related healthcare for minors to remain in effect, arguing it's not sex discriminatory because it applies to all assigned sexes. This ruling is seen as undermining gender equality by circumventing sex equality provisions and allowing states to target trans people. The decision weakens the 14th amendment's applicability to sex discrimination cases and opens the door for further discrimination against women and queer people. The court's action effectively enforces gender conformity, diminishing the dignity of queer individuals and cis women alike.</p>

Department of Water and Power's dust control measures have reduced emissions to a point where other dust sources in the area now cause most of the poor air quality days. Research indicates that significant dust sources include land where floods have left deposits, the Keeler Dunes, and areas disturbed by road infrastructure. Scientists say bringing the area into attainment with air quality standards will require additional efforts to control these off-lake dust sources.</p>
