          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 03:49:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US and China have initiated reciprocal port fees on each other's vessels, marking an escalation in their ongoing trade dispute. This move by the Trump administration follows an investigation that found China's maritime dominance resulted from unfair practices, prompting Beijing's retaliation. Analysts predict significant costs for Chinese carriers like COSCO, further intensifying the trade war which also includes threats of new tariffs on critical minerals and software. This action reflects a broader strategy by both nations to protect their economic interests through trade restrictions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK experienced a slight slowdown in average wage growth to 4.7% in the three months to August, down from 4.8% in July, while the unemployment rate marginally rose to 4.8%. Data from the Office for National Statistics suggests a stabilizing labor market after a period of volatility, with job vacancies falling for the 39th consecutive period. Despite private sector earnings growth being the lowest in four years, it remains ahead of inflation. Economists suggest that persistent wage growth might delay interest rate cuts by the Bank of England, though a gradual easing is anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese chipmaker Wingtech fell sharply after the Dutch government took control of its Netherlands-based subsidiary, Nexperia. This decision, made under the "Goods Availability Act," aims to prevent the unavailability of Nexperia's vital chips, crucial for European technological supply chains. The article also notes broader market reactions across Asia-Pacific, including South Korean and Japanese indices falling, and mentions China's sanctions against Hanwha Marine Corporation in retaliation to US maritime investigations. This highlights growing geopolitical tensions impacting global tech and trade sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has sanctioned five U.S. subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, accusing them of supporting Washington's probe into Chinese maritime industries. This move is a direct retaliation to the U.S. imposing port fees on Chinese-linked vessels and follows Beijing's confirmation of collecting reciprocal charges. Hanwha Ocean's shares dropped significantly after the announcement, reflecting the escalating trade tensions between China and the U.S., which also involve rare earths export restrictions and threats of further tariffs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump declined to commit to a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, stating "We’ll have to see" after signing a historic peace agreement ending two years of fighting in Gaza. His focus is on rebuilding Gaza post-conflict and ensuring the successful implementation of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire and hostage release. Trump's remarks came during a trip that included a global peace summit and a speech in Jerusalem, where he called for a new era of harmony in the Middle East. The agreement remains fragile, with unresolved issues concerning Gaza's postwar governance and Hamas disarmament.</p>

          <p>A new UK campaign will encourage driving licence applicants to register as blood donors, aiming to boost donor numbers, particularly among young people. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) will include a link to register as a blood donor in emails following licence applications, reaching millions annually. This initiative, a collaboration between the DVLA and NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), seeks to replicate the success of the organ donor register prompt. Hospitals require 5,000 daily donations, and the NHS continues to face blood shortages, especially for O negative blood.</p>

          <p>Blake Snell delivered a historic eight-inning, one-hit, 10-strikeout performance, leading the Dodgers to a 2-1 Game 1 NLCS win over the Milwaukee Brewers, despite a confounding fourth-inning double-play. The Dodgers overcame this self-inflicted error, where a potential grand slam was misjudged, thanks to Snell's dominance and Freddie Freeman's go-ahead home run. Manager Dave Roberts' decision to remove Snell in the ninth almost backfired, but Blake Treinen secured the final out.

          <p>European politicians perceive a state of global chaos, likening it to a "three-body problem" due to the United States undermining the global order, China weaponizing critical minerals, and Russia waging war at the EU's borders. This unstable geopolitical environment forces Europe to seek a new trajectory, recognizing that traditional solutions may no longer apply. The analogy, drawn from Chinese science fiction, highlights the unpredictable and potentially unsolvable nature of the current international challenges. European leaders are now focused on survival rather than resolving the chaos.</p>
