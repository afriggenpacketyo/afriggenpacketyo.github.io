          <h2>Violent Crime Rates in the US Experience Significant Decline After Pandemic Spike</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 08:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the remarkable drop in violent crime rates in the US after a surge during the pandemic. The FBI's 2023 crime report showed a nearly 12% decrease in murders year over year, with further declines in 2024 and early 2025. Factors contributing to this decline include the easing of pandemic-related stressors, the return of social services, and government initiatives like community violence interruption programs. While acknowledging that the situation is not perfect, the article highlights that most Americans are unaware of these positive trends due to bad news bias, which focuses on outlier events and can hinder support for effective reforms.</p>

          <p>A major power outage struck Cannes on the final day of the Film Festival, affecting 160,000 homes and causing traffic disruptions. Police suspect arson as the cause, citing a fire at a substation, though a connection to the festival is unconfirmed. The festival organizers quickly switched to an alternative power supply, ensuring the closing ceremony proceeded as planned, but morning screenings were temporarily interrupted. Despite the blackout, the festival continued, with Juliette Binoche and her jury announcing the winners of the top prizes at the closing ceremony, demonstrating the event's resilience.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, potentially ending 17 years of federal control over the mortgage giants. This move has garnered support from investors like Bill Ackman, who believes it could benefit taxpayers and generate substantial revenue for the government. However, critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren warn that privatization could disrupt the mortgage market and raise housing prices. The government created Fannie and Freddie to stabilize the housing market, but they were placed under federal conservatorship after the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

          <p>According to this Fox News opinion article, broadcast networks exhibit bias in their coverage of political books, favoring "tell-all" books critical of Trump while downplaying those with scoops about Biden. The article contrasts extensive coverage of anti-Trump books like Michael Wolff's "Fire and Fury" and Omarosa Manigault-Newman's "Unhinged" with limited attention to Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's Biden "tell-all." The author asserts that networks actively pushed the White House line that questioning Biden's fitness was a fringe MAGA talking point, neglecting to scrutinize Biden's decline.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has achieved error-free acoustic data transmission across 600km of ocean, marking a significant milestone in underwater communication. The feat, detailed in a study published in Acta Acustica, demonstrates the potential for long-range undersea messaging with both civilian and military applications. Led by Professor He Chengbing, the project team developed a self-tuning system that can map signal clusters in noisy environments without prior knowledge of seabed topography, which is critical for naval applications. This advancement could pave the way for reliable communication with underwater drones and synchronized operations.</p>

Doctors initially struggled to diagnose the cause of his swelling and fatigue, but cardiologist Dr. Adam Skolnick suspected the condition based on images of Mauceri's heart. Open-heart surgery, performed by Dr. Eugene Grossi, revealed Mauceri's heart was trapped inside a thick shell of scarring, which was carefully removed. Mauceri recovered quickly after the surgery and was able to conduct an orchestra again, expressing gratitude for the added time in his life.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department's drastic cuts to public safety grants have left police and nonprofits scrambling to replace the lost funds. Announced in late April, the cuts terminated 373 grants, totaling about $500 million, surprising many public safety groups. The cuts affect various programs, including those supporting crime investigations and community violence intervention. While the Justice Department claims the cuts align with the administration's priorities of prosecuting criminals and combating violent crime, critics argue that the decisions were made without sufficient research or consultation, potentially undermining effective strategies for reducing violence.</p>

          <p>President Trump's economic policies, particularly his tax and spending plans, are facing increasing skepticism from Wall Street investors. Concerns center on the US's "twin deficit" position and the potential for Trump's policies to stoke inflation and lead to a recession. Moody's recently downgraded the US's credit rating, reflecting growing unease. Economists warn that persistent deficits and rising debt levels could erode investor confidence, pushing up borrowing costs and crowding out private investment. Investors are wary of Trump's erratic policymaking and its impact on the stability of US assets.</p>

          <p>Despite critics claiming the movement to defund the police failed, some cities like Austin and Seattle are seeing progress. These cities have redirected funds from law enforcement to social services and new public safety departments. Milwaukee allocated funds to affordable housing and youth programming, while Seattle invested in participatory budgeting and a third public safety department for mental health crises. Austin increased investment in homeless services. Though public sentiment shifted after 2020, these initiatives have sparked conversations about city priorities and reimagining public safety, and organizers hope the Trump administration's focus on law enforcement will inspire renewed support for alternatives.</p>

Critics fear the administration is prioritizing threats that resonate with Trump's base while deprioritizing the far right, potentially emboldening far-right terrorist groups.

          <p>A study reveals that UK workers continue to work from home more than most of their global counterparts, averaging 1.8 days a week. This trend has stabilized since 2023, becoming a defining feature of the UK labor market, driven by factors like commuting costs and the desire for flexibility. Despite some companies mandating a return to the office, many workers, particularly women and parents, would resist strict return policies. The research suggests hybrid work is now the expectation, with no strong evidence of reduced productivity, though the impact of fully remote roles varies.</p>
