          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a 7% increase after Elon Musk indicated he would dedicate more time to the company, coupled with President Trump's optimistic remarks regarding China tariffs. Trump suggested that duties on China would not reach 145% and expressed no intention of dismissing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, boosting investor confidence. Tesla's first-quarter results revealed a 20% year-over-year decrease in automotive revenue and a 71% decline in net income, but Musk's renewed focus and tariff optimism outweighed these concerns. Musk also stated he would spend significantly less time at The Department of Government Efficiency starting next month.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 6.2 earthquake struck Istanbul, Turkey, injuring at least 151 people, with most injuries resulting from panic-induced attempts to flee buildings. The earthquake's epicenter was located in the Sea of Marmara, approximately 40 kilometers southwest of Istanbul, and was followed by over 50 aftershocks. The event occurred during a public holiday, causing widespread fear among residents who recalled previous devastating earthquakes in Turkey. Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya reported that the quake lasted approximately 13 seconds.</p>

Acting Governor Tahesha Way declared a state of emergency for Ocean County, and mandatory and voluntary evacuations for around 5,000 residents were lifted. The wildfire started in the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, fueled by dry conditions and low humidity; officials expect full containment by the weekend.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price is surging, heading towards $95,000, driven by renewed optimism after President Trump softened his stance on China tariffs and reduced criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Bitcoin saw a significant spike in inflows, indicating growing interest in the cryptocurrency as a hedge against market turbulence and a weakening dollar. The rally has also triggered short liquidations, further pushing the price upward, although demand for spot Bitcoin needs to increase to sustain the rally and reach new all-time highs. Next resistance is around $95,000, and after that, $100,000 remains the key psychological level. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg revealed that China has returned Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes due to escalating trade tensions and tariffs, impacting the company's delivery schedule. China has stopped accepting deliveries of approximately 50 aircraft planned for this year, prompting Boeing to consider redirecting these planes to other customers. Ortberg stated that Boeing is working with the Trump administration on tariffs and does not expect negative cost impacts but is focused on maintaining a healthy supply chain.

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has indicated a willingness to lower tariffs on US car imports as part of efforts to secure a trade deal with the Trump administration.

          <p>David Frum discusses the Trump administration's approach to due process, particularly regarding immigration and detention, and what can be done about it. He argues that the administration is building an apparatus of lawyers and officials who plan and think every day, How can we apprehend people on American soil and bundle them to a prison without giving them any show of a hearing? He is joined by Peter Keisler, former acting attorney general of the United States under President George W. Bush, who discusses the limits to presidential power.</p>

          <p>Nerys Bethan Lloyd, a former paddleboard firm owner, was sentenced to 10 years and six months in prison after four people died during a paddleboarding tour she led on the Western Cleddau river in Wales. Lloyd pleaded guilty to gross negligence manslaughter, as she was unqualified to lead such a tour in extremely hazardous conditions. The court heard that there had been heavy rain in the days before and "the river was in flood conditions" with a "visibly strong current". The judge criticized Lloyd's "abysmal" approach to health and safety and found that she had shown "a blatant disregard for a very high risk of death".</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering reducing tariffs on some Chinese imports to a level between 50% and 65%, according to The Wall Street Journal. The move would substantially reduce the tariffs set at 145% earlier this month, as the White House recalibrates its trade strategy. Stocks rallied following the report, as well as news that Trump is not planning to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Several options are under review, including a tiered system that would distinguish between strategic and non-strategic goods.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the Trump administration sees "an opportunity for a big deal" on trade between the U.S. and China. Bessent said that the Trump administration wants the U.S. economy to rebalance toward more manufacturing, while urging China to shift away from what he called "export-led manufacturing growth." He added that the International Monetary Fund and World Bank need to be made "fit for purpose" again, and added that both institutions have strayed from their initial missions.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer of lacking "moral courage" on transgender issues during heated exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions. Last week, the UK Supreme Court ruled that the legal definition of a woman should be based on biological sex under equalities law, meaning, for instance, that transgender women, who are biologically male but identify as women, can be excluded from women-only spaces. Badenoch said the prime minister didn't "have the balls" to say where he stood and likened him to a "weather vane".</p>
