          <p>A House Oversight subcommittee has voted to subpoena the Justice Department for its files on Jeffrey Epstein, with three Republicans joining Democrats in a push for transparency. The motion was amended to also seek communications involving former presidents and top justice officials. Separately, the committee chairman issued a subpoena for Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's convicted accomplice, to provide a deposition from prison. These actions reflect escalating bipartisan pressure on the Trump administration to release more information regarding the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>Columbia University will pay over $220 million to the federal government to resolve investigations into alleged anti-discrimination law violations. The settlement, which includes $200 million to the government and $21 million to the EEOC, will lead to the restoration of $400 million in federal research grants that the Trump administration had withheld. The university stated that while it does not admit wrongdoing, it acknowledges that reforms were necessary to address antisemitism on campus. The agreement also formalizes new campus policies, including a ban on identity-concealing masks and requirements for protesters.</p>

          <p>South Korean semiconductor firm SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, surpassing analyst expectations. This surge is attributed to sustained high demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential components in AI technology and used by clients like Nvidia. The company's HBM business has been so successful that it briefly overtook Samsung Electronics in the global DRAM market earlier this year. SK Hynix anticipates continued strong demand and plans to increase capital expenditure to support its HBM customers in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is reportedly intensifying its efforts in the global artificial intelligence race by focusing on brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. According to a presentation by Georgetown experts, the nation is experimenting with systems that merge human cognition with machines, a different approach from the U.S. focus on large language models. This strategy includes invasive and non-invasive BCI methods to potentially achieve artificial general intelligence. The development is framed as part of a broader geopolitical competition for technological dominance, raising concerns among U.S. officials.</p>

          <p>A new study by Common Sense Media reveals that a majority of teenagers are using AI chatbots for companionship, advice, and emotional support, with over a third using them daily or multiple times a week. While some teens find it helpful for mundane questions or building confidence, researchers express significant concern. They warn that relying on AI, which is always agreeable and non-judgmental, could hinder the development of crucial real-world social skills, such as reading social cues and navigating disagreements. The trend has sparked worries about its potential to exacerbate youth loneliness and redefine human relationships.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is experiencing a complex shift, with a notable increase in the number of homes for sale, yet prices continue to hit record highs. According to Redfin data, there were 34% more sellers than buyers in May, the highest rate since 2013, suggesting a potential easing for homebuyers. However, the market still favors sellers as low inventory from homeowners with locked-in low mortgage rates keeps prices elevated, with the median sale price reaching $396,000 in June. Experts advise that market conditions vary significantly by location, with some areas becoming more buyer-friendly than others. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released its "AI Action Plan," a strategic document aimed at ensuring U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence by promoting rapid, unimpeded development. The plan emphasizes deregulation, seeking to streamline environmental reviews for data center construction and limit state-level rules that could slow innovation. Heavily influenced by recommendations from major tech firms like OpenAI and Google, the strategy advocates for a "try-first" culture and aggressive adoption of AI across government and military sectors.

While not legally binding, the ruling sets a powerful legal precedent that can be used in climate litigation worldwide to hold governments and corporations accountable.

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, have filed a defamation lawsuit in the United States against right-wing influencer Candace Owens. The legal action stems from Owens' repeated and widely spread claims that Brigitte Macron was born a man, a conspiracy theory that has circulated on the internet for years. The lawsuit alleges that Owens' campaign of defamation was designed to harass and cause pain, and that she refused multiple requests for a retraction. Owens has responded to the lawsuit by standing by her allegations and dismissing the legal action as a public relations strategy.</p>

          <p>The first six months of President Trump's second term have been characterized by an aggressive "shock and awe" approach to immigration enforcement, according to a report from NPR. This strategy is fueled by a newly passed congressional funding bill that provides tens of billions of dollars for domestic enforcement, the largest such funding in U.S. history. The administration is using these resources to carry out a mass deportation campaign targeting migrants living in the country illegally. This action fulfills a central promise of Trump's presidential campaign to conduct the largest deportation in the nation's history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's pressure to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and lower interest rates is a dangerous power play. The author contends the goal is to subordinate the central bank to the government's borrowing needs, a situation known as "fiscal dominance" that historically leads to high inflation and economic instability. While acknowledging Powell's past policy missteps, the piece asserts that the fundamental problem is not monetary policy but rampant government spending. Forcing the Fed to accommodate this spending would erode confidence and ultimately harm the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>IBM's shares dropped in after-hours trading despite the company reporting second-quarter earnings and overall revenue that exceeded Wall Street's projections. The negative market reaction was primarily due to the company's software revenue, which, while growing 10%, fell slightly short of analyst consensus estimates. CEO Arvind Krishna noted that some clients were reprioritizing spending toward hardware and that U.S. federal spending was constrained. Despite the software miss, IBM's consulting and infrastructure divisions both beat expectations, and the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance for revenue growth and free cash flow.

It noted that initial sales of its new restrictive basic economy fares were weak but have since recovered, though the launch negatively impacted quarterly revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

Gabbard attempted to correct the framing of the question, while Leavitt defended the President's confidence in his DNI. The confrontation highlighted the ongoing friction between the administration and members of the press over issues of intelligence and political motivation.</p>

          <p>According to a search warrant, bomb squad technicians initially believed the grenades that caused a fatal explosion were inert after conducting an X-ray. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s detectives responded to a call about grenades found in a storage unit and transported them to a training academy for disposal. The following day, at least one of the devices detonated, killing three veteran detectives in the department's deadliest incident in over 150 years. An investigation by the sheriff's homicide bureau and the ATF is underway to determine the exact cause of the detonation and how the explosives were handled.</p>
