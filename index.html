        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UN reports that approximately 90 lorry loads of humanitarian aid have reached Gaza after a three-day delay due to security concerns along the approved access route. The aid includes essential supplies like flour, baby food, and medical equipment, which are urgently needed to address the acute levels of hunger among the 2.1 million residents. Despite this influx, humanitarian organizations emphasize that the amount is insufficient to meet the vast needs in Gaza, where shortages of basic foods and skyrocketing prices are prevalent. The UN is pushing for a sustained and unimpeded flow of hundreds of trucks daily to alleviate the crisis, as the current aid only meets a fraction of the population's needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Treasury Department has announced plans to discontinue the production of pennies, citing the rising costs of manufacturing the coin, which now exceed its actual value. The agency's final order for penny blanks has been placed, and the United States Mint is expected to cease penny production in early 2026, resulting in an estimated $56 million in annual savings. The decision follows scrutiny from previous administrations and recent directives from President Trump, who emphasized the wasteful nature of minting pennies that cost more than their face value. This move marks the end of an era for the penny, one of the first coins produced by the U.S. Mint.</p>

          <p>The White House's Make America Healthy Again Commission, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has released a report critiquing chronic disease in America. The report attributes many chronic illnesses to factors like ultra-processed foods, sedentary lifestyles, environmental chemicals, and suggests further studies on childhood vaccines. Kennedy Jr. describes the report as a radical consensus by a government agency on the state of American health. The report lacks specific budget details or policy recommendations, which are expected within the next 100 days, though Kennedy Jr. maintains that addressing these issues would save money in the long term.</p>

          <p>Community groups in Louisiana have filed a federal lawsuit challenging a state law that regulates air pollution monitoring, alleging it violates their constitutional rights. The law requires community groups to use federally-approved equipment and sets restrictions for analyzing and sharing data, which the groups claim hinders their ability to detect and report toxic pollution from refineries and chemical plants. These groups argue that their independent testing is crucial for protecting residents, especially in the industrial corridor known as Cancer Alley. The lawsuit contends that the law's restrictions infringe on free speech and the right to petition the government, effectively silencing community efforts to hold polluters accountable.</p>

Democrats and some analysts express concerns that the bill's steep cuts to the social safety net will lead to exploding federal deficits and weaker long-term fiscal health.

The finding raises concerns about President Trump's expansive claims of authority over the nation's purse strings and sets the stage for a potential constitutional showdown.

The revised text would also reduce itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could lower the benefit of the higher SALT cap.
