          <p>Nicholas Roske, who now identifies as Sophie, received an eight-year prison sentence for the attempted murder of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in June 2022. This sentence is significantly lower than the 30 years sought by the Department of Justice, which highlighted the rising threats against judges and a specific death threat against Kavanaugh. The judge considered Roske's transgender identity and a Trump executive order on inmate detention, alongside mitigating factors like a spontaneous confession. Roske, armed with a pistol and other tools, aimed to alter the outcome of the Dobbs decision and change the court's composition, later expressing sincere remorse for the terror caused.</p>

          <p>Quantum computing stocks, including Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum, recorded substantial double-digit gains this week, with some more than doubling year-to-date. This surge follows positive developments in the sector, such as Rigetti securing $5.7 million in purchase orders for its quantum systems and a major European investment in a quantum venture fund. Tech giants like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon are also increasing their embrace of quantum technology through new chip announcements and investments. While proponents see quantum computing as a solution for complex problems, critics suggest a "real breakout" is still several years away, highlighting ongoing market speculation.

          <p>Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have initiated a fundraiser to support the family of Thomas Jacob Sanford, the accused mass shooter at a Michigan church. The organizer, an "ordinary member" of the LDS church, stated the purpose is to aid Sanford's grieving wife and children, one of whom faces significant medical challenges. The attack, which killed four and injured eight, occurred during worship and was reportedly motivated by the shooter's hatred for the Mormon faith. Despite this, the fundraiser has garnered substantial support, with donors expressing compassion and the shooter's family acknowledging the church's forgiving nature. This unique response highlights a community's struggle with tragedy and an unexpected act of empathy.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to proceed with terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 300,000 Venezuelan migrants, clearing the way for their potential deportation. This action reverses a lower court decision that found the Department of Homeland Security's termination of the program illegal. Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson dissented, with Justice Jackson criticizing the majority for using the emergency docket to disrupt lives. The administration cited national interest and strained local resources as reasons for ending TPS, while advocates warned of severe consequences, including job losses and forced returns to unsafe conditions in Venezuela.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US government shutdown has entered its second week, as the Senate remains deadlocked after failing to pass two spending proposals. The primary point of contention revolves around healthcare funding, with Democrats advocating for continued health insurance subsidies and reversing Medicaid cuts, while Republicans accuse them of attempting to fund healthcare for undocumented immigrants. The White House has warned of potential mass federal worker layoffs and significant economic repercussions, estimating a weekly GDP loss of $15 billion.

          <p>A terror attack at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in Manchester on Yom Kippur led to the deaths of two Jewish men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, and left three others seriously injured. The assailant, Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian descent, drove a car into the crowd and then attacked people with a knife before being fatally shot by police. The incident is being investigated as a terror act potentially influenced by extreme Islamist ideology. Worshippers and security staff demonstrated immense bravery by holding the synagogue doors shut, preventing the attacker from causing further harm inside the building. This article provides an overview of the unfolding tragedy and community response.</p>

          <p>Amazon is closing four additional Fresh grocery stores in Southern California, marking a further pivot in its evolving grocery strategy. These latest closures, which follow similar shutdowns in the UK and other U.S. regions, indicate Amazon's intensified focus on its Whole Foods brand and expanding online grocery delivery services. The Amazon Fresh chain, initially launched in 2020, has experienced a challenging expansion amid company-wide cost-cutting initiatives. Despite scaling back its physical Fresh footprint, Amazon remains committed to grocery innovation, recently introducing a new "price-conscious" brand and enhancing same-day fresh food delivery options to streamline shopping for consumers.</p>

This development follows Trump's ultimatum for Hamas to accept the deal by Sunday evening or face unprecedented military action. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has publicly maintained his longstanding opposition to a Palestinian state, adding complexity to the peace efforts.

          <p>During a government shutdown, federal workers, whether furloughed or deemed essential, are legally entitled to back pay once a funding agreement is reached. Conversely, independent contractors and private sector employees reliant on federal grants and contracts do not have this guarantee, facing potential loss of income. This distinction creates significant financial hardship, as many live paycheck to paycheck, and even fully funded contracts can experience payment delays due to absent government personnel. Previous legislative attempts to provide back pay for contract workers have failed, underscoring a persistent vulnerability for millions whose livelihoods are impacted by federal impasses.</p>

          <p>Recent college graduates are encountering significant difficulties in securing their first full-time jobs, with data indicating the unemployment rate for "new entrants" has reached a nine-year high. This suggests that a bachelor's degree is no longer providing the same career opportunities as in previous decades, as the unemployment rate gap between college and high school graduates has notably shrunk. Contributing factors include an oversupply of graduates relative to demand, the growing influence of artificial intelligence automating entry-level positions, and a prevailing "low-firing, low-hiring environment."

          <p>The White House asserts that California utilizes a "loophole" to fund Medicaid benefits for undocumented immigrants with federal dollars, citing this as a reason for the ongoing government shutdown. However, healthcare policy experts and California officials vehemently dispute this claim, clarifying that the state lawfully uses its own funds for such coverage. They explain that the "Working Families Tax Cut Act" provision, referenced by the White House, pertains to provider taxes and not the federal funding of healthcare for undocumented individuals. This political disagreement underscores contrasting interpretations of healthcare policy and the federal budget impasse, as California prepares to modify its Medi-Cal coverage for non-citizens.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.1 billion in Department of Transportation funding allocated for two significant Chicago transit projects, including the crucial Red Line Extension. The DOT attributed this action to the ongoing government shutdown, blaming congressional Democrats, and cited concerns about "unconstitutional practices" related to race or gender in contracting. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson denounced the move as political retaliation, asserting it harms the local economy and essential public transit. This incident represents the third instance of the administration targeting infrastructure funding in Democratic-led areas amidst the federal budget impasse, impacting vital community development and job creation.</p>

          <p>French photojournalist Antoni Lallican was tragically killed by a Russian drone attack in eastern Ukraine, marking the first instance of a journalist dying from a drone in this conflict. Lallican, accompanied by an injured Ukrainian photojournalist, was wearing protective press equipment when the incident occurred in the Donbas region. His final Instagram post highlighted the widespread deployment of "kamikaze drones" and their devastating impact on local residents. French President Emmanuel Macron condemned the death, directly blaming Russia and asserting that targeting journalists is a deliberate attempt to obstruct the documentation of war crimes. Lallican was celebrated for his dedicated work covering conflict zones and human rights.</p>

          <p>Two victims of the Manchester synagogue attack, including one who died, appear to have been struck by police gunfire as officers engaged the assailant. Police Chief Constable Stephen Watson confirmed that the deceased victim sustained a wound consistent with a gunshot injury. Given that the attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, was not armed with firearms when fatally shot by police, authorities concluded the victims were likely hit by friendly fire. Both individuals were heroically sheltering inside the synagogue, actively preventing the attacker from gaining entry. This tragic revelation adds a somber and complex dimension to the already horrific terrorist incident, highlighting the chaotic and perilous nature of the event.</p>

          <p>Residents of Portland, Oregon, are actively pushing back against President Trump's characterization of their city as a "war zone" or "living in hell." Through social media and local initiatives, they are highlighting Portland's vibrant culture, natural beauty, and thriving community life, including unique events like a planned "Emergency Naked Bike Ride." This counter-narrative emerges despite Trump's orders for military deployment, which local officials and residents argue are based on false pretenses. Local businesses express significant concern that the president's "100% false" depiction could be economically devastating, emphasizing that the city is addressing its issues thoughtfully, rather than being in a state of chaos.</p>

          <p>The government shutdown has delayed the release of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' crucial monthly jobs report, prompting economists to analyze alternative data sources. These alternative indicators, including private payrolls and jobless claims, suggest that the labor market experienced a stable but softening trend in September. While overall employment growth remains modest, employers are generally reluctant to implement widespread layoffs. Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee confirmed the market is not "capsizing," yet acknowledged an uneven landscape where healthcare professions are thriving while sectors like software development are lagging. This situation indicates ongoing economic distress for certain households struggling with job searches. (not investment advice)</p>
