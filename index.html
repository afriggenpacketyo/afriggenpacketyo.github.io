          <h2>Poll Reveals Voters' Concerns Over Trump's Use of Power</h2>

          <p>A recent New York Times/Siena College poll indicates that voters are increasingly concerned about President Trump's expansion of executive power and have doubts regarding his key policy initiatives. The poll reveals that voters perceive the early months of Trump's administration as chaotic and express reservations about his understanding of their daily struggles. While his approval rating remains at 42%, it is historically low for this stage of a presidency, with declining confidence in his handling of the economy and immigration. This data suggests a shift in public sentiment, despite Trump's previous success in battleground states, and highlights growing unease among voters regarding his leadership and policy direction.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-26 13:47:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analyst Craig Moffett casts doubt on the feasibility of Apple's plan to move iPhone assembly to India, citing the continued reliance on Chinese-made components and potential resistance within India. Moffett argues that this move may not effectively reduce costs associated with tariffs and that Apple's supply chain would remain largely anchored in China. He suggests that a global trade war poses a significant challenge to Apple, impacting both costs and sales, and that shifting assembly to India may only address the former. Moffett also notes that carriers are unlikely to absorb tariff costs, potentially leading to decreased consumer demand and slower upgrade rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Just Stop Oil's "last day of action" in London was met with anger as drivers grew frustrated with road blockages. Protesters were seen being pushed by a minivan, leading to police intervention and reminding drivers of the temporary nature of the disruption. The group claims their initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, citing successful court cases halting fossil fuel projects. The Labour government has distanced itself from Just Stop Oil, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer criticizing its actions.</p>

The tribunal, under the Council of Europe, faces limitations compared to the UN Security Council. While investigations into Russian officials are underway, an arrest warrant for Putin is unlikely while he remains president. Questions also remain regarding the period the tribunal will consider, with some arguing it should include the 2014 annexation of Crimea.</p>
