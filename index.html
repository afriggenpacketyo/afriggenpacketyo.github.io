          <p>Wynn Resorts has withdrawn its application for a casino license in New York City, citing that there are better uses for its capital due to persistent opposition during the rezoning process. Wynn had partnered with Related Companies to develop an integrated casino resort in Manhattan's Hudson Yards. This follows Las Vegas Sands' decision to withdraw its bid for a Long Island site due to potential competition from online gaming. Wynn Resorts says it will instead focus on stock buybacks and existing developments, including the first casino resort in the Middle East. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have risen above 7% after Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating, causing bond yields to increase.

Conservative hardliners and moderates remain divided over issues like the state and local tax deduction (SALT) and Medicaid work requirements. President Trump is expected to pressure Republicans to pass the bill, which also includes a debt limit increase.</p>

          <p>The UK and the EU have reached an agreement to "reset" relations following Brexit, covering defense, fishing, trade in food products, and youth mobility. The agreement aims to reduce checks on UK food exports to the EU, extend EU fishing vessels' access to UK waters, and facilitate youth mobility. The deal could affect immigration figures and requires the UK to follow future EU food standards. The deal clarifies that the EU countries can offer eGates to UK nationals once a new Entry/Exit System (EES) comes into effect in October.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering nominating Emil Bove III, a top Justice Department official, to be a federal appeals judge. Bove has been at the center of contentious actions, including the request to dismiss a corruption case against the mayor of New York. Democrats are expected to scrutinize his role in controversial Justice Department decisions during his confirmation process. The judicial post would be a lifetime appointment.</p>

          <h2>Greggs to Move Food Behind Counters to Prevent Shoplifting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 13:53:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Greggs, a UK bakery chain, will move its self-serve food and drinks behind the counter in select stores to combat shoplifting. The company is trialing the measure in locations with high levels of anti-social behavior. Shoplifting offenses have risen significantly, prompting retailers to take action. The move is not expected to be implemented across all Greggs' bakeries, but it may be rolled out to sites where there are high levels of theft.</p>
