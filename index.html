        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 2025 NFL Draft saw the Tennessee Titans select Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick, fulfilling weeks of predictions. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up to pick Colorado's two-way star Travis Hunter, while Shedeur Sanders surprisingly dropped out of the first round. This year's draft emphasized offensive and defensive lines, with seven of the top 12 picks being linemen, in contrast to the previous year's focus on quarterbacks. The draft, held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, continues with rounds two and three on Friday and rounds four through seven on Saturday.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants' decision to draft Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart over Colorado's Shedeur Sanders in the NFL Draft has sparked debate on social media. The Giants traded up to select Dart, a dual-threat quarterback, leading to comparisons with their former player Daniel Jones. While some criticized the pick, others, like NFL analyst Robert Griffin III, offered a balanced perspective. Dart expressed enthusiasm about joining the Giants and learning from veterans Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston, aiming to begin his NFL journey in New York.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer, Amer Aldarawsheh, was arrested and charged with wire fraud for allegedly obtaining nearly $150,000 in COVID-19 relief funds through two sham businesses.
