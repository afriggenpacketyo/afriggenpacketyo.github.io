          <p>Thousands of people participated in a "Unite the Kingdom" march organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson in central London, while a counter-protest, the "March Against Fascism," also took place. The Metropolitan Police deployed around 1,000 officers to maintain order, creating a sterile area between the two groups. Protesters displayed various flags and banners with slogans ranging from anti-immigration to anti-transgender sentiments, and police reported being attacked with projectiles. The Met confirmed it would not use live facial recognition and urged Muslim Londoners not to alter their plans, taking a firm line on discriminatory behavior, with both protests expected to end by evening. The events highlight ongoing tensions and divisions within the UK. Optimism score is based on the fact that no deaths were reported and that there were efforts to de-escalate tensions. </p>

          <p>New Zealand's women's rugby team secured a spot in the World Cup semi-finals by defeating South Africa 46-17 after a slow start in Exeter. South Africa initially led, but New Zealand responded with tries from Theresa Setefano and Braxton Sorensen-McGee, leveling the game at half-time. In the second half, New Zealand dominated with five tries, including two from Renee Holmes and Sorensen-McGee, ultimately setting up a semi-final match against either Canada or Australia. South Africa managed a late try to conclude their memorable World Cup campaign, having reached the quarter-finals for the first time. The Black Ferns overcame early struggles, showing resilience for harder tests to come.</p>

          <p>President Trump urged NATO countries to cease buying oil from Russia and impose tariffs on China to end the war in Ukraine. In a Truth Social post, Trump claimed that NATO's commitment to winning the war has been less than 100% and that purchasing Russian oil weakens their negotiating position. He suggested imposing tariffs of 50% to 100% on China, which he believes has a strong grip over Russia, and said these tariffs should be withdrawn only after the war concludes. Trump also criticized his predecessor and the Ukrainian President for the ongoing conflict, while some lawmakers push for tougher sanctions after failed peace talks. The situation remains tense as Trump seeks to exert pressure on multiple fronts.</p>

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court ruled that Meta violated porn star Esperanza Gómez's right to freedom of expression by deleting her Instagram account. The court found that Meta removed Gómez's account without clear justification and inconsistently applied its policies on nudity. Meta argued that Gómez violated its rules on nudity, but the court noted that similar accounts remained active. The ruling ordered Meta to revise its terms of use to provide clearer mechanisms for challenging moderation decisions and more precisely define its rules on implicit sexual content. This decision underscores the balance between content moderation and freedom of expression on social media platforms.</p>

Cox, who had been pleading for peace in the wake of the shooting, admitted to being unnerved by the alleged killer's identity as a local Mormon man. Cox expressed his dismay that the violence came from within Utah, shattering the state's idealized image of peace and wholesomeness. The event has shaken Utah's sense of exceptionalism and highlighted the intrusion of national political strife into the state.</p>

          <p>Joshua Oliver admitted to starting a fire that caused significant damage to a building housing the constituency office of Labour MP Sharon Hodgson. Oliver pleaded guilty to arson and burglary, though his defense stated the incident was unrelated to the MP. The fire destroyed the front of the building and damaged the offices of a small charity and an NHS mental health service, with estimated damages ranging from £250,000 to £500,000. Oliver also admitted to smashing windows at the building and at his father's house in separate incidents, and will be sentenced at the city's crown court in October.</p>

          <p>Erika Kirk, the widow of Charlie Kirk, announced that his college tour and radio show will continue, stating that his mission has been unleashed across the country and the world. She encouraged young people to join or start Turning Point USA chapters, which promote traditional American values. Kirk's organization has courted controversy, with claims that civil rights legislation has become anti-white and mockery of Martin Luther King Jr. Erika Kirk thanked law enforcement, President Trump, and Vice President Vance for their support and expressed difficulty in explaining her father's death to her daughter. This is about the legacy of someone.</p>

          <p>A presidential commission's report claims America is the "sickest country in the world," but this assertion is inaccurate, as decades of progress in medicine, public health, and environmental quality have significantly improved American health and longevity. While new health challenges like obesity and mental illness exist, Americans are far healthier than their ancestors. Over the 20th century, life expectancy increased by over 30 years, and deaths from infectious diseases, heart attacks, and cancer have declined. The article cautions against catastrophizing the present and urges building on past achievements rather than destroying them.</p>

          <p>Sachem Head Capital Management, holding a 2-4% stake in Performance Food Group (PFG), is pushing for a merger with US Foods and has nominated four candidates for PFG's board. Sachem Head believes a merger could yield $800 million to $1 billion in synergies, citing a similar proposed deal between Sysco and US Foods. While a merger between the first and second largest players was previously blocked, Sachem Head argues a PFG-US Foods merger, combining the second and third largest, may have a different outcome, especially under the current administration.

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has launched an anti-dumping investigation into US analogue chips, targeting commodity interface IC chips and gate drive IC chips. The investigation was initiated following a request from the Jiangsu provincial semiconductor association, citing a 37% increase in import volume from 2022 to 2024, coupled with a 52% decrease in import price. The ministry claims this has suppressed domestic sales prices and caused damage to Chinese industries.
