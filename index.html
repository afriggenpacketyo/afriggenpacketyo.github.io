          <p>The article highlights the struggle of low-income Americans who cannot afford to run their air conditioning due to escalating energy costs, a problem exacerbated by climate change. It brings to light a White House budget proposal to eliminate the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a federal initiative that helps over six million Americans pay their utility bills. The potential termination of this program, combined with rising temperatures and electricity prices, creates a severe financial and health risk for the nation's most vulnerable populations, forcing them to choose between essential needs.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys' star pass rusher Micah Parsons is maintaining his silence regarding his ongoing contract dispute with the team as he enters the final year of his rookie deal. When asked for an update on negotiations, Parsons gave a terse four-word response, stating, "My mouth is closed." This situation unfolds as other top NFL pass rushers have recently secured lucrative contract extensions. Despite Parsons' public trade request earlier, owner Jerry Jones has affirmed his intention to keep the All-Pro player, though talks between the two parties have reportedly not progressed.</p>

          <h2>UK Cities Face Growing 'Firewave' Threat from Hot, Dry Summers, Scientists Warn</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers from Imperial College London are warning that UK cities face a rising danger from "firewaves," a term describing multiple urban wildfires ignited during prolonged hot, dry weather. This emerging threat is driven by climate change, which desiccates urban green spaces and makes them highly flammable, as recently evidenced by fires in London and Edinburgh. Scientists have developed a model to predict these events, urging for the adoption of the term "firewave" to enhance public safety alerts. In response, the London Fire Brigade has invested in new technology like drones and off-road vehicles to better combat this growing risk.</p>

          <p>A new report from the VA's Office of Inspector General reveals that staffing shortages at Veterans Health Administration facilities have surged by 50% in the current fiscal year. The investigation found that 94% of facilities reported severe shortages of medical officers and 79% reported severe shortages of nurses, with psychologists and police officers also being critically understaffed. In response, a VA spokesperson contested the report's methodology, calling it subjective and not a reliable measure of actual vacancies. However, critics argue the findings reflect administration policies that are undermining the VA workforce and harming veterans' access to care.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to seek long-term extensions from Congress to maintain federal control over Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department, a move aimed at addressing crime in the capital. The initial federal takeover is permitted for up to 30 days with congressional notification, but any further extension requires a joint resolution from both the House and Senate. Despite local data showing a recent decline in violent crime, the president stated he would be putting forth a new crime bill for D.C. and expressed confidence that Republicans would unanimously approve the extended oversight.</p>

Air and ground crews worked to extinguish the flames, and one firefighter was treated for apparent heat exhaustion at the scene.

Zelenskyy asserted that Putin is "bluffing" and does not genuinely want peace, urging allies to maintain and increase sanctions to pressure Moscow into a ceasefire. President Trump confirmed he would demand a ceasefire and warned of "very severe consequences" if Russia does not comply, suggesting a follow-up meeting could include Zelenskyy.

          <p>A significant flood threat in Juneau, Alaska, has subsided after the Mendenhall River's water levels receded from record highs. The flooding was caused by an "outburst flood" from the glacier-dammed Suicide Basin, which released a massive volume of water, pushing the river to a peak of 16.65 feet. Newly installed temporary barriers, known as Hesco barriers, were largely successful in preventing what could have been a catastrophic event, protecting hundreds of homes from severe damage.

The Justice Department supported Trump's move, stating it favors an "America first antitrust" approach focused on free markets over the previous administration's more prescriptive regulations.

          <p>This article explores the ongoing revolution in media consumption, where trust is shifting from traditional institutions to individual online creators. While this environment is ripe for misinformation, it has also given rise to a class of "evidence-based creators"—journalists and experts who provide factual, nuanced content on platforms like Instagram and TikTok. The author argues that these creators are building trust directly with audiences but lack the infrastructure for growth, legal protection, and collaboration. To thrive, this new media ecosystem needs innovations like independent certification systems and shared professional frameworks to help audiences identify credible voices.</p>

          <p>Brinker International, the parent company of Chili's, reported strong quarterly earnings, with same-store sales at the restaurant chain increasing by 23.7%. CEO Kevin Hochman credited this growth to a significant boost in marketing spending, which increased from $32 million to $137 million over three years, and the success of its standardized $10.99 value meal. The company has effectively used social media influencers and emphasized a simple, coupon-free value proposition to attract customers. This growth strategy is helping the company combat inflationary pressures on labor and goods by leveraging fixed costs and improving margins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Google is facing a critical juncture as a judge's decision on antitrust remedies looms, with the Department of Justice having previously called for the divestiture of its Chrome browser. The situation was dramatized by a $34.5 billion bid for Chrome from AI search company Perplexity, highlighting the browser's immense value as a gateway to Google's search and advertising empire. Analysts estimate Chrome could be worth up to $50 billion if sold, and its potential loss represents a significant risk to Alphabet's core business model. This pressure comes as the company navigates the costly transition to AI and increasing competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marc Maron, a pioneer in the podcasting world, has criticized the current state of the medium, labeling it as a sea of "mediocre afternoon drive-time radio." In a recent interview, the host of the long-running "WTF" podcast, which he recently announced is ending, lamented that the proliferation of podcasts has lowered the bar for quality content. He described the landscape as being saturated with uninspired conversations, particularly from groups of hosts with little to say. Maron's comments reflect his growing disillusionment with an industry he helped shape, a theme also present in his latest HBO comedy special.</p>

The case is seen by critics as a key indicator of the erosion of legal autonomy and political freedom in Hong Kong.

Unlike Harvard, which appears poised to settle, UCLA's response will likely be determined by Governor Gavin Newsom, whose national political ambitions are intertwined with the outcome. A capitulation could be seen as a sign of weakness and would have devastating financial consequences for the state's premier public university system. The decision represents a critical test for California, positioning it as a line of defense against what critics describe as an authoritarian attack on higher education.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to cancel billions of dollars in congressionally approved foreign aid can proceed, dealing a major blow to global humanitarian efforts. The court determined that the nonprofit groups who sued did not have the standing to challenge the administration's withholding of funds under the Impoundment Control Act. This decision allows the freeze on funding for programs like HIV/AIDS prevention to continue, which critics warn will have a devastating human cost. The ruling also sets a significant precedent, potentially enabling the administration to continue impounding funds appropriated by Congress for other purposes.</p>

The increase is largely attributed to owner Stan Kroenke's vision and investment in the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium and the surrounding Hollywood Park entertainment district.
