          <p>A wildfire in New Jersey, having burned over 13,000 acres and now 50% contained, has prompted air quality alerts for the New York City region. Winds are expected to carry smoke from the Jones Road Fire in Ocean County to New York City and Long Island, potentially impacting sensitive groups. The New Jersey Forest Fire Service anticipates the fire's continued activity due to dry conditions, winds, and low humidity. While not expected to be as intense as the 2023 Canadian wildfire smoke, residents are advised to remain cautious as winds could shift back on Friday, bringing more smoke to the region.</p>

          <p>China refuted U.S. President Trump's claim of ongoing tariff negotiations, asserting any suggestion of progress is unfounded.

China maintains that any resolution requires the complete cancellation of all tariffs currently imposed on them.

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated following a deadly militant attack in Kashmir. Pakistan responded to India's punitive measures by closing its airspace to Indian carriers, reducing Indian diplomatic staff in Islamabad, and suspending all trade with India. The Pakistani government deemed India's actions, including visa revocations and downgraded diplomatic ties, as unilateral and politically motivated. This crisis underscores the fragile relationship between the two nations and the potential for further conflict in the disputed region.</p>

          <p>The UK government, led by Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, is exploring options for reforming the electricity market, including regional energy pricing. This potential shift could result in discounted power for homes near energy infrastructure, while other areas, like southern England, might face higher costs. Miliband insists that any changes must lead to lower bills across the country, but some experts argue that regional pricing could negatively impact millions of Britons. The government is carefully considering options like zonal pricing and reformed national pricing, with no decisions made yet.</p>

          <p>Following two U.S. court rulings that Google violated antitrust laws, critics are urging regulators to break up the company. They argue that Google's dominance in search and digital advertising has stifled competition and undermined journalism. Proposed remedies include divesting parts of Google's ad tech stack, ensuring interoperability, and global coordination in enforcement. Advocates emphasize that these antitrust cases are about power and the need to restructure the infrastructure of the digital economy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has cut hundreds of millions in federal grant dollars allocated to prevent gun violence, opioid addiction, and support victims of violent crimes. The Department of Justice cited a shift in priorities as the reason for rescinding the funding.
