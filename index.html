            <p>California is refusing to comply with a Trump administration order to certify the elimination of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs in its school districts. The state argues that DEI efforts are legal and defends their importance. The U.S. Department of Education has threatened to cut billions in education funding if California does not comply. Sixteen states are attempting to comply, while ten others have also refused, setting up a potential legal and financial battle.</p>

            <p>China's biotech sector is bracing for the impact of the escalating trade war with the US, with some companies emerging as potential beneficiaries. Companies involved in processing human blood plasma have seen gains due to tariffs on US plasma products. However, analysts warn that resource-rich countries like South Africa and those with clothing manufacturing industries under the US African Growth and Opportunity Act could be negatively affected. The trade war's impact on China's economy could have devastating consequences for Africa.</p>

            <p>The law firm Susman Godfrey, which represented Dominion Voting Systems in its case against Fox News, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration. The lawsuit challenges an executive order that seeks to block the firm's access to government buildings and cancel government contracts. Susman Godfrey argues that the order is an abuse of power and an attempt to retaliate against the firm for defending the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. The firm claims that the order would cause irreparable harm, as a significant portion of its work involves federal courts and agencies.</p>

Advocates have criticized the decision, arguing that conditions in Afghanistan have worsened and that the move undermines America's commitment to its allies.

            <p>Southern California Edison (SCE) has identified a dormant, unconnected powerline as a leading theory for the cause of the Eaton fire. SCE is taking steps to harden other idle towers and lines to prevent similar incidents. The theory centers on the possibility that the idle line was reenergized through induction, a rare phenomenon where a nearby active line induces an electric current. The company is revising its internal manual to provide uniformity in grounding idle equipment.</p>
