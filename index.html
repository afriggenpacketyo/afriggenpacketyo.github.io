He also mentioned that the company's sales are being impacted by immigration policies affecting its Hispanic consumer base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia defeated the West Indies by 159 runs in the first Test match, with the victory sealed on the third day. Bowler Josh Hazlewood was instrumental, taking five wickets for 43 runs as the West Indies collapsed, losing all ten wickets in the final session. Despite some resistance from the West Indies' lower order, Australia's dominant bowling performance and a solid second-innings score of 310 secured the win with two days to spare. The match was also notable for discussions between the West Indies coach and the match referee regarding controversial television umpire decisions.</p>

          <p>Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from an Orleans Parish prison, was captured in New Orleans after a six-week search. His arrest leaves only one fugitive, Derrick Groves, still at large from the May 16 jailbreak. The escape occurred when inmates broke through a wall behind a toilet, an incident that has drawn criticism toward the parish sheriff's management of the facility. Massey was facing charges including domestic abuse and motor vehicle theft, and may now face additional charges related to the escape.</p>

This effort comes as NATO members increase defense spending to counter perceived threats from Russia.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court issued a 6-3 ruling that significantly limits the authority of federal judges to impose nationwide injunctions against executive actions. The decision came in a case challenging President Trump's order to end birthright citizenship, granting the administration a partial victory by staying the injunction's nationwide scope. While the ruling does not address the constitutionality of the birthright citizenship order itself, it allows the administration to proceed with implementation plans in areas not covered by specific plaintiffs. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, warning that the decision weakens judicial checks on executive power.</p>

The TdA, a notorious Venezuelan gang, has been designated as a terrorist organization by the administration, a move used to expedite the deportation of its members.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Supreme Court's decision to limit nationwide injunctions represents a dramatic and dangerous expansion of presidential authority. The author contends that by curtailing the power of lower courts to block illegal executive actions, the court has given the president unchecked power to defy the Constitution. The ruling, which arose from challenges to President Trump's birthright citizenship order, creates a chaotic system where rights depend on one's location. The piece concludes that the conservative majority's decision poses an existential threat to the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Sae Joon Park, a 55-year-old U.S. Army veteran and Purple Heart recipient, has self-deported to South Korea to avoid being detained by federal immigration authorities. Park, who has held a green card since he was a child, faced deportation due to drug convictions from nearly two decades ago, which he attributes to PTSD from his military service. Despite being honorably discharged, he is now caught in the current administration's immigration crackdown. Park's case highlights the situation of noncitizen veterans who can face deportation, forcing him to leave his family and life in the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis suggests a resurgence of Tea Party-style fiscal conservatism within the Republican party, driven by opposition to President Trump's latest tax and spending plans. Figures like Senators Rand Paul and Ron Johnson are now criticizing the new GOP bill for not including sufficient spending cuts to offset proposed tax reductions. This internal conflict mirrors the Tea Party's original push against establishment Republicans for what they saw as a lack of fiscal discipline. However, this new wave faces the challenge of opposing a popular Republican president, unlike their predecessors who organized against a Democratic administration.</p>

          <p>Fire chiefs across Southern California have issued a stark warning that the region is facing an almost guaranteed season of severe wildfires due to extremely dry conditions following a winter with little rain. At a press conference, officials described another destructive fire season as "inevitable" and urged residents to be prepared. They emphasized the importance of creating defensible space around homes by clearing dry vegetation, as fire departments cannot protect every property. With Santa Ana winds expected to return soon, residents are being advised to have evacuation plans ready.</p>

          <h2>Minimum Wage to Increase in Two States and Multiple Cities on July 1</h2>

          <p>On July 1, minimum wage rates are set to increase in two states, Alaska and Oregon, as well as in Washington, D.C., and a dozen other cities and counties. According to the Economic Policy Institute, these hikes will benefit over 800,000 workers, with women and minority workers disproportionately seeing a pay increase. The raises are the result of ballot measures and automatic inflation adjustments. These local and state-level actions contrast with the federal minimum wage, which has remained unchanged at $7.25 per hour since 2009.</p>

          <p>A Honduran asylum-seeker is suing the Trump administration after she and her two children, including a six-year-old son with leukemia, were arrested by ICE agents at a Los Angeles immigration court.

The family is currently held in a Texas detention facility, where the mother fears her son is not receiving adequate medical care. The suit seeks their immediate release.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a U.S.-brokered peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, aimed at ending a conflict that has lasted nearly three decades. The deal seeks to stop the violence in eastern DRC, where a militia allegedly backed by Rwanda has caused a massive humanitarian crisis. The president celebrated the agreement as a "glorious triumph for the cause of peace" and stated the U.S. would enforce it with significant penalties for violations. The agreement also reportedly grants the U.S. access to the DRC's valuable mineral deposits.</p>
