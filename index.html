          <p>Beyond the stated goal of neutralizing Iran's nuclear program, Israel's strikes on Iran may aim for regime change, hoping to trigger unrest and topple the Islamic Republic.  This is a high-stakes gamble, as there's no guarantee of a popular uprising, and potential outcomes include chaos or a more confrontational Iran.  The fragmented Iranian opposition presents unclear alternative leadership options.  The article questions whether the attacks will lead to the desired outcome.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Japanese women are struggling with alcoholism, prompting an increase in the number of women joining recovery groups.  The social stigma surrounding alcoholism in Japan, often perceived as a male problem, makes it difficult for women to seek help.  Recovery groups provide a safe space for women to share their experiences and address their unique challenges.  Experts attribute the rise in female alcoholism to various factors, including increased work and childcare stress.</p>
