          <p>President Trump has expressed interest in a Russian proposal for Elon Musk's Boring Company to construct an undersea rail tunnel connecting Russia and Alaska. The pitch, made by a Russian investment envoy, suggested the 70-mile link could be built for a significantly reduced cost using Musk's technology, symbolizing unity between the nations. The proposal raises practical concerns due to the extreme environmental conditions of the Bering Strait and the Boring Company's lack of experience in such projects, alongside geopolitical questions given Musk's existing ties to Russia.</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown is entering its third week without resolution, as Democratic lawmakers cite a profound lack of trust in President Trump as a primary barrier to negotiations. Historically, bipartisan "gangs" have formed to break such stalemates, but they are absent in the current crisis due to fears that Trump would renege on any agreement reached. Democrats are demanding an "ironclad path forward" on issues like healthcare subsidies before reopening the government, while Republicans insist on funding first, leaving Congress at a standstill.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President Trump at the White House to advocate for additional military aid, including Tomahawk cruise missiles, to bolster Ukraine's defense against Russia. While Trump expressed a willingness to consider the request, potentially in exchange for Ukrainian-made drones, he also voiced concerns about depleting U.S. stockpiles. The meeting occurred shortly after Trump's call with Vladimir Putin, with Trump stating he hopes to end the war without further escalation but acknowledging Putin may be stalling for time.</p>

The ban, issued by the city's Safety Advisory Group, cited intelligence about potential violence and hate crimes, sparking criticism from political leaders who labeled it discriminatory.

          <p>The price of gold surpassed $4,300 per troy ounce for the first time, driven by investors seeking a "safe haven" asset amid growing economic uncertainty. Factors contributing to the surge include the prolonged U.S. government shutdown, ongoing trade wars, the prospect of lower interest rates, and heightened geopolitical tensions globally. While some investors view gold as a hedge against inflation, experts caution that it can be a volatile investment and its rising price reflects widespread anxiety about the stability of the broader economy.

          <p>U.S. electricity companies are facing a significant challenge in forecasting future power needs, as they struggle to determine how much of the projected demand from the AI data center boom is genuine. Tech companies are reportedly pitching the same large-scale projects to multiple utilities, creating inflated and unreliable load forecasts that could lead to billions in unnecessary infrastructure investment. This uncertainty complicates grid planning and contributes to rising electricity prices for consumers, even as the market fuels a rally in utility stocks based on these ambitious projections.

          <p>During his visit to Washington, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is pressing the Trump administration for increased intelligence sharing to aid in strikes against Russia's energy infrastructure. This request for targeting assistance comes alongside pleas for long-range weapons like Tomahawk missiles and is seen as a key strategy to cripple Moscow's war funding ahead of winter. The U.S. has reportedly already been providing some intelligence support, enabling successful Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries, indicating a more aggressive, albeit quiet, posture from the administration.</p>

          <p>Recent aggressive Russian air incursions into the airspace of NATO countries like Poland and Estonia were met with a swift and unified response from the alliance, signaling that Vladimir Putin's attempts at intimidation may have backfired. NATO scrambled jets, shot down drones, and established a new coordinated defense initiative called "Eastern Sentry" along its eastern flank. This display of resolve, coupled with President Trump's recent affirmations of support for the alliance, suggests a rare alignment between the U.S. and European leaders in pressuring Moscow.</p>

          <p>A mother has described her ordeal after learning the ashes she received for her stillborn son in 2022 were not his, and that his body had been discovered at the Legacy Independent Funeral Directors premises in Hull.

The mother, Jasmine Beverley, held a second funeral for her son, Sunny, after his body was recovered by police during an investigation that found 35 bodies at the firm's headquarters.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County is set to pay an additional $828 million to settle approximately 400 more cases of alleged sexual abuse that occurred in county facilities. This new award follows a historic $4 billion settlement approved in April for a separate group of victims.

County officials have stated they will be conducting additional vetting to protect taxpayer funds while ensuring legitimate victims are compensated.</p>

          <p>A columnist for The Guardian argues that while President Trump presents himself as a peacemaker abroad, his actions at home are actively fomenting civil war. The article points to the deployment of U.S. troops to Democrat-run cities, not for crime prevention but as a political act of intimidation designed to provoke conflict. This strategy, combined with efforts to purge the military of dissent and use the justice system against opponents, is portrayed as a deliberate effort to polarize the nation and consolidate power by treating political rivals as enemies.</p>

          <p>As the trade war with the U.S. intensifies, China is retaliating with targeted economic measures, including imposing its own tariffs and restricting exports of critical materials. Beijing has curbed the export of rare-earth minerals, essential for defense and technology sectors, where the U.S. is heavily import-dependent. Additionally, China has halted purchases of U.S. soybeans and is actively redirecting its trade to other regions like Africa and Southeast Asia, demonstrating a strategy to reduce its reliance on the American market while leveraging U.S. economic vulnerabilities.

          <p>Health officials in Los Angeles County have reported the first U.S. cases of clade I mpox that appear to be locally acquired, as the patients had no recent travel history to affected regions. This strain is considered more concerning than the clade II virus responsible for the 2022 global outbreak, as it is associated with a higher likelihood of severe illness and death. While the risk to the general public remains low, officials are urging at-risk groups to get vaccinated, as the virus spreads primarily through close, intimate contact.</p>

The news, coupled with recent failures in the private credit market and warnings of an AI-fueled stock bubble, drove the price of gold to a new record high as investors sought safe-haven assets.
