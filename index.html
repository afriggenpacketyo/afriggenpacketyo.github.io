            <p>EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that the Trump administration's deregulatory actions would not adversely impact public health or the environment, emphasizing the need to balance environmental protection with economic growth. Zeldin highlighted that the American public desired common-sense regulations, arguing that the Biden administration's regulations were overly broad and targeted entire industries, leading to trillions in compliance costs. He assured that the deregulatory process would include public comment, encouraging Americans to participate and provide their input. Zeldin's statements came after announcing the EPA would reconsider rules across multiple sectors, including power plants and oil and gas development.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is facing bipartisan criticism for the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen who lived in Maryland, due to an "administrative error." Senator Chris Van Hollen, after visiting Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, called the case a "constitutional crisis," while Senator John Kennedy labeled the deportation a "screw up." Despite a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" his return, the White House claims it cannot force El Salvador to release him, while President Bukele has deemed the idea "preposterous." The administration has also posted documents attempting to link Abrego Garcia to MS-13, a claim disputed by Van Hollen.</p>

            <p>Nursing homes are increasingly becoming targets for cyberattacks, putting residents' personal and financial information at risk, with the recent Hillcrest Nursing Home breach affecting over 100,000 individuals. Experts cite outdated IT infrastructure and the vulnerability of elderly patients as primary reasons for these attacks. To protect loved ones, it's recommended to freeze credit accounts, place fraud alerts, sign up for data removal services, install strong antivirus software, regularly review financial statements, and educate them on internet safety. Taking these steps can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and provide peace of mind. </p>

            <p>Solicitor General John Sauer criticized the Supreme Court's overnight order that temporarily blocked the removal of alleged Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members to El Salvador, calling it "unprecedented" and wrong. Sauer argued that the detainees lack standing to seek an injunction, as the government has paused deportations and is allowing the legal process to unfold. He urged the justices to limit the order to AEA removals, not all removals of Venezuelan gang members, citing the lack of fact-finding in lower courts regarding the government's notice and appeal process.</p>

            <p>Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating a 30-hour "Easter truce" that was announced by the Russian president on Saturday. President Zelensky claimed Ukraine's front line had been hit by more than 46 Russian assaults since the start of the day on Sunday. In response, Russia's defense ministry said it had "repelled" attempted assaults by Ukraine and accused Kyiv of launching hundreds of drones and shells, according to state media sources.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen stated that the El Salvadorian government initially "tried really hard" to prevent him from seeing Kilmar Abrego Garcia, but reversed course after realizing it was a "bad look." Van Hollen criticized the Salvadoran government for staging photos during his meeting with Abrego Garcia to create the impression that he was in paradise, while in reality, he had been in one of the most notorious prisons in the world. He emphasized that the case is about protecting constitutional rights, as the administration hasn't presented evidence to link Abrego Garcia to MS-13.</p>
