          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has clarified that while 274 plainclothes agents were present at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, they were deployed for crowd control after a riot was declared, a mission he states is contrary to FBI standards. Patel accused his predecessor, Christopher Wray, of lying to Congress by not being forthcoming about the agents' presence and role. This revelation comes after former President Trump amplified a report on the matter, suggesting the agents may have acted as agitators. The FBI's statement aims to provide context, asserting that agents arrived after the riot began and were not involved in instigating events.</p>

          <p>Team Europe has secured a commanding 11.5 to 4.5 lead over the United States after the second day of the Ryder Cup, marking their largest-ever lead heading into the final day's singles matches. The European team's performance was dominant, requiring only two and a half more points from the remaining 12 contests to retain the trophy. The day was also marked by a contentious atmosphere, with reports of thuggish and personal insults from the American galleries directed at European players, particularly Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry. Despite the hostility, Europe's golfers maintained their composure and excelled on the course.</p>

          <p>Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Portland city officials have strongly pushed back against President Trump's directive to send federal troops to the city, stating there is no need for military intervention. Governor Kotek described the order as a "threat to communities" and urged residents not to "take the bait." Portland's Chief of Police Bob Day noted that recent protests have been peaceful, without the arrests or vandalism seen in previous years. The move is part of a broader administration effort to crack down on what it terms "domestic terrorism," but local leaders view it as an unnecessary and provocative show of force.</p>

She expressed shock that he was shackled in his hospital bed despite being unconscious. The shooting, carried out by a gunman who died from a self-inflicted wound, killed one detainee and injured Garcia-Hernandez and another man, all of whom were in ICE custody at the facility.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler, the world's top-ranked golfer, has become an emblem of the American team's futility at the Ryder Cup, becoming the first American ever to lose in all four of the opening sessions. Despite entering the competition with a dominant record, Scheffler failed to secure a single win, struggling to adapt to the unique pressures of the team-based format. His performance, particularly his fragile putting, has been ruthlessly exposed by a sublime European team. This unraveling highlights how the intense, high-stakes environment of the Ryder Cup can challenge even the most accomplished individual players in the sport.</p>

          <p>In a new book, retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy reflects on his 30-year tenure, during which he was often the court's decisive "swing vote." Kennedy expresses deep concern about the current state of political discourse in America, stating that democracy is not guaranteed to survive. He provides insight into his landmark decisions, including his majority opinion legalizing same-sex marriage, which he says was influenced by the legal hardships faced by children of gay parents. A devout Catholic, Kennedy also explains his internal conflict over abortion, ultimately concluding that his personal moral views could not dictate his constitutional judgment.</p>

          <p>The booming market for collagen supplements, promising youthful skin, faces skepticism from dermatologists and researchers due to a lack of robust, independent evidence. While collagen is a vital protein for skin structure, experts question whether supplements can survive the digestive system and effectively reach the skin to stimulate new production. Consultant dermatologist Emma Wedgeworth notes that topical creams are ineffective as the molecules are too large to penetrate the skin's outer layer. A recent study comparison found that industry-funded research showed significant benefits, while independent studies revealed no effect, highlighting a potential conflict of interest in the wellness industry.</p>

Tourists arriving with high expectations are often met with traffic congestion, overcrowding, and environmental degradation, a stark contrast to the pristine images seen online. Recent deadly floods, exacerbated by poor waste management and unchecked development, have highlighted the strain on the island's infrastructure. While Bali's cultural richness and natural beauty still exist, locals and observers note that the focus on a superficial, Instagrammable experience is eroding the island's character.</p>

However, following its period of reform and opening up, China has experienced decades of rapid growth and technological development.

While an unlikely outcome in this case, as Humberto is significantly stronger, the possibility highlights the complexity of the current hurricane season.

          <h2>Varying Estimates Complicate Efforts to Address California's Housing Shortage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 16:55:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While there is broad consensus among California's policymakers that a significant housing shortage is driving the state's affordability crisis, there is little agreement on the actual size of the deficit. Estimates for the number of missing housing units have ranged dramatically, from as low as 56,000 to as high as 3.5 million. This wide variation stems from different methodologies, data sets, and definitions of what constitutes a "shortage," including whether to count "pent-up" demand from people living with parents or roommates. This lack of a single, definitive number complicates efforts to craft and measure the success of policies aimed at solving the problem.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani has settled the $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit brought against him by Dominion Voting Systems over his false claims about the 2020 presidential election. The terms of the settlement are confidential, concluding a legal battle that began in 2021 after Giuliani, acting as a lawyer for Donald Trump, promoted baseless conspiracy theories about the company's voting machines. This resolution follows Dominion's nearly $800 million settlement with Fox News for similar claims. The lawsuit was one of several significant legal and financial challenges Giuliani has faced for his role in efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p>

          <p>Israeli airstrikes and gunfire have killed at least 59 people across Gaza, according to health officials, as international pressure for a ceasefire mounts. Despite this, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the United Nations that his nation "must finish the job" against Hamas. The recent casualties include multiple members of the same family killed in strikes on the Nuseirat refugee camp. Medical facilities, such as Gaza City's Shifa Hospital, are facing immense strain, with reports of Israeli tanks approaching and restricting access. The escalating violence and humanitarian crisis continue as diplomatic efforts to broker a deal are reportedly underway.</p>

          <p>The No. 21 USC Trojans lost a close game to No. 23 Illinois, 34-32, after a last-second field goal by the Fighting Illini. The Trojans, playing with a depleted roster due to injuries and illness, were hampered by self-inflicted mistakes and eight penalties throughout the game. Despite a late touchdown that gave them a one-point lead with under two minutes remaining, USC's defense could not prevent Illinois from driving into field-goal range. The loss highlighted ongoing issues for USC, including inconsistent quarterback play, struggles on both the offensive and defensive lines, and questionable clock management.</p>

          <p>UK Labour Party leader Keir Starmer has launched a sharp attack on the rival Reform party, labeling its politics as "toxic divide and decline" ahead of Labour's annual conference. Starmer specifically targeted Reform leader Nigel Farage, calling him "grubby" and "unpatriotic" for allegedly talking down the country while in America. The criticism comes as Labour seeks to position itself as a patriotic alternative to Reform, particularly in response to Reform's controversial proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for migrants. Starmer argued that such policies are divisive and would "tear this country apart."</p>

In their last two matches, the team has managed 39 shots but scored only once. Postecoglou acknowledged the team's lack of ruthlessness but insisted the players have the right mindset to embrace his more attack-minded style, taking responsibility for turning the team's dominance into victories.</p>
