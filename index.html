          <p>President Trump has expressed a willingness to consider a slight tax increase on wealthy Americans to benefit lower and middle-income workers, marking a potential shift from traditional Republican tax policies. However, Trump acknowledged the political challenges, noting that Democrats would likely criticize any such move, referencing George H.W. Bush's broken "Read my lips" promise. Despite his openness, Trump suggested that Republicans should probably oppose the tax hike, creating uncertainty about the proposal's future. Trump also stated that Ross Perot, not the broken promise, cost Bush the election.</p>

          <p>The United States is moving forward with a plan to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza through private companies, establishing "distribution centers" secured by contractors. This initiative aims to circumvent Hamas's alleged diversion of aid, although Israel will provide perimeter security. The UN has expressed its unwillingness to cooperate with this system, citing concerns about its alignment with humanitarian principles. Meanwhile, humanitarian conditions in Gaza continue to deteriorate, with critical shortages of food and fuel forcing the closure of essential community kitchens.</p>

A report indicates that a vast majority of provincial governments are led by members of political families, leading to concerns about governance and economic development. Young voters express frustration that political office seems like a family affair, hindering leadership that represents the needs of all Filipinos. They argue that dynasties perpetuate poverty and undermine checks and balances, and instead called for enforcement of the constitutional ban on political dynasties.</p>

          <p>David H. Souter, a Supreme Court Justice appointed by George H.W. Bush, has died at 85. Souter, a New Hampshire Republican, became a mainstay of the court's liberal wing, often surprising those who expected a conservative justice. Throughout his tenure, Souter remained committed to a view of the Constitution as a charter of "ordered liberty," whose meaning could evolve over time. Souter retired at 69 to return to New Hampshire, and was replaced by Sonia Sotomayor.</p>

          <p>The resumption of the Indian Premier League (IPL) is uncertain and will depend on the "mood of the nation," according to Deep Dasgupta. The tournament's restart is further complicated by the likely absence of overseas players, including those from England and Australia. If a restart is not feasible in the short term, there is a strong desire to complete the tournament later in the year due to its significant financial value. Dasgupta also stated that India-Pakistan cricket is too trivial to talk about given the latest deterioration in the relationship between the two countries.</p>

The resettlement is being funded primarily by the Department of Health and Human Services, as the State Department's refugee program remains suspended.

          <p>A federal judge is holding a bail hearing for Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate detained by immigration authorities after the Trump administration revoked her student visa. Ozturk's lawyers argue that her detainment violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights, as she was targeted for criticizing Israel and participating in pro-Palestinian protests. Tufts University's president has defended Ozturk, stating the university has no information to support the allegations against her. The case raises concerns about the targeting of international students for expressing political views.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested lowering tariffs on China to 80%, ahead of trade talks in Switzerland. While lower than the current 145% tariff on many Chinese goods, the rate remains high and could be seen as prohibitive to trade. It's unclear whether this is a long-term tariff or a negotiating tactic. Trump has also called for China to open its market to the US. The U.S. exported $143.5 billion in goods to China in 2024, while importing $438.9 billion.</p>
