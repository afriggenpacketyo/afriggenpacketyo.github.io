          <p>An SUV crashed into a Domino's Pizza restaurant in Herriman, Utah, leading to a ruptured gas line and a subsequent massive explosion that destroyed the building. Two courageous bystanders rescued the driver and a passenger from the vehicle just moments before the blast occurred. While multiple people involved in the initial three-car accident were hospitalized, authorities confirmed that no one was inside the restaurant at the time and no additional injuries resulted from the explosion itself. The adjacent businesses also sustained significant damage from the powerful blast.</p>

          <p>Firefighting crews are making significant progress in containing the Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, California's largest wildfire this year, which has burned over 80,000 acres. Favorable weather conditions and an increase in personnel have helped raise containment to 30% as of Sunday. The blaze, which started on Wednesday, has threatened around 50 structures and prompted mandatory evacuation orders for over 200 residents. The fire poses a particular threat to the Carrizo Plain National Monument, home to several endangered species, and officials are hoping to make more progress before a predicted midweek heatwave.</p>

          <p>The Washington Nationals have fired both manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo following a period of significant on-field struggles. The decision came after the team was swept by the Boston Red Sox, dropping their record to 37-53. The team's performance has been poor, particularly in June, where they averaged only 2.5 runs per game. In a statement, principal owner Mark D. Lerner thanked the pair for their past contributions, including the 2019 World Series title, but stated that the team's current performance necessitated a "fresh approach and new energy."</p>

          <p>Indirect ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas are scheduled to resume in Doha, Qatar, as Israeli military operations continue across the Gaza Strip. Recent Israeli airstrikes have resulted in at least 38 Palestinian fatalities, according to hospital officials. The talks will focus on a U.S.-backed proposal for an initial 60-day truce involving a partial hostage release in exchange for increased humanitarian aid. However, significant obstacles remain, as Hamas seeks guarantees for a permanent end to the war, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists on the complete elimination of Hamas's military and governmental capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has launched airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, hitting sites in the ports of Hudaydah, Ras Isa, and Saif. The attacks followed evacuation warnings issued to civilians in the areas. Israel's Defence Minister stated the strikes were in response to the Iran-backed group's repeated attacks on Israel and commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Targets included a power station and the Galaxy Leader, a commercial ship hijacked by the Houthis in 2023 that Israel claims was being used for maritime surveillance.

          <p>President Donald Trump sharply criticized Elon Musk following the billionaire's announcement of a new political party, labeling him a "TRAIN WRECK" in a social media post.

The president dismissed the new party as "ridiculous," suggesting it would only create voter confusion and asserting that third parties have never succeeded in the U.S. political system.

          <p>Samsung Electronics is anticipating a significant 39% decrease in its second-quarter operating profit, marking its fourth consecutive quarterly decline and lowest income in six quarters. The projected downturn is largely attributed to delays in supplying its advanced high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to key AI-chip maker Nvidia, a market where competitors like SK Hynix and Micron have seen strong growth. Analysts note that ongoing US trade restrictions on the Chinese market and a slow certification process with Nvidia are compounding the company's challenges. These factors have raised investor concerns about Samsung's ability to compete effectively in the booming AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

This article details the complex web of state-by-state ballot access laws, which are heavily biased toward the two major parties and would require immense financial and temporal investment to navigate. Experts note that creating a nationally recognized party is a multi-year project that would likely cost hundreds of millions in litigation against inevitable challenges from Democrats and Republicans.

          <p>Two decades after the 7/7 London bombings, the UK's counter-terrorism capabilities have become highly sophisticated, but the nature of the threat has grown far more complex. This article analyzes the evolution from combating organized groups like al-Qaeda to confronting self-radicalized, lone-actor attacks inspired by online extremism from both Islamist and far-right ideologies. While MI5 and police have improved intelligence sharing and developed new legal tools, the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing exposed persistent vulnerabilities. The piece concludes that while the state's powers are robust, the diverse and rapidly changing threat landscape means the question of whether the UK is truly safer remains a difficult one.</p>

          <p>This article profiles the surfmen, an elite and highly exclusive unit of the U.S. Coast Guard who train to perform rescues in the most extreme conditions. Their training ground is the treacherous inlet where the Columbia River meets the Pacific Ocean, an area known as the "Graveyard of the Pacific" for having wrecked thousands of ships. To be certified, surfmen must master operating a 47-foot motor lifeboat in 20-foot breaking waves and 50-knot winds. The report highlights the intense, four-week training course that pushes these individuals to their limits, preparing them to save lives on what could be a person's darkest day.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has warned its global trading partners that they must negotiate new trade deals by August 1 or face the reinstatement of higher tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that this is a firm date for tariffs to revert to the higher levels announced in April, following a 90-day pause for negotiations. While talks with the European Union are reportedly progressing, a deal has not yet been reached, and the EU is prepared to retaliate if its goods are hit with tariffs as high as 50%. The administration's "maximum pressure" strategy has already resulted in deals with the UK and Vietnam. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Daniel Park, the man accused of conspiring to bomb a California fertility clinic, has died in federal custody in what his former attorney says is being investigated as a suicide. Park was being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles after being charged with providing material support for the attack, which was allegedly carried out by his deceased co-conspirator. Park's death closes the only prosecution in the case and adds to the mystery surrounding the bombing. The incident has also drawn attention to conditions at the L.A. detention center, with lawyers reporting inhumane conditions and a recent Inspector General report finding significant shortcomings in emergency responses.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly flash floods in Texas, a disagreement has emerged between some state officials and the National Weather Service (NWS) over the accuracy of the weather forecasts. While the NWS maintains it issued timely flood watches and flash flood warnings, some Texas officials, including the Kerr County Judge, argue that no one predicted the unprecedented severity of the event. Meteorologists explain that precisely forecasting the location and intensity of such extreme rainfall is exceptionally difficult. The debate is further complicated by recent staffing cuts at the NWS, which some critics suggest may have impacted the agency's capabilities.</p>

          <p>According to expert Denis Simon, the future of the US-China Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement (STA) is a critical indicator for the broader bilateral relationship. First signed in 1979, the STA has been a foundational element of engagement, fostering collaboration in fields like health and environmental science. However, in the current climate, the agreement is increasingly sensitive due to national security concerns, economic competition in key tech sectors like AI and semiconductors, and rising techno-nationalism in both countries. The very openness that once defined the STA's success is now viewed by some as a significant vulnerability, complicating its renewal.</p>
