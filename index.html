          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested resuming direct negotiations with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, without any preconditions, following calls from Ukraine and its allies for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. This proposal references previous unsuccessful talks held in Istanbul shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. Putin stated his commitment to serious negotiations and didn't dismiss the possibility of a ceasefire during these talks. The offer comes amidst threats of increased sanctions from European leaders if Russia doesn't agree to the ceasefire, with the US also supporting diplomatic efforts to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>Dr. James Ryan, an oral surgeon, was convicted of depraved heart murder for providing his girlfriend, Sarah Harris, with habit-forming drugs that led to her death. Ryan, who was more than twice Sarah's age, allegedly groomed her, starting when she was just 14 years old, and later supplied her with anesthetics like propofol and ketamine, which he took from his office. Texts revealed Ryan offering Sarah injections to alleviate anxiety and administering drugs while she was asleep, with no monitoring. The jury found Ryan guilty, determining that his actions demonstrated a reckless disregard for Sarah's life.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the U.S. remained steady at 6.76%, close to its highest levels this year, according to Freddie Mac. This rate is influenced by factors including global demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and increasing home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for prospective homebuyers, contributing to a lackluster start to the spring home-buying season. In March, sales of previously occupied homes in the U.S. experienced their largest monthly decline since November 2022.</p>

          <p>South Korea's People Power Party (PPP) has reinstated Kim Moon-soo as its presidential candidate after a failed attempt to replace him with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo. This decision comes after the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol and reflects the turmoil within the PPP. Kim, a former labor activist, will now compete in the upcoming elections against opposition candidate Lee Jae-myung, who currently leads in the polls.</p>
