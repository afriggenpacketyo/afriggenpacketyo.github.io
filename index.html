          <p>At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have pledged to resolve their border disputes. The meeting marks a significant diplomatic effort to stabilize relations, which deteriorated after deadly clashes between their soldiers in 2020. Both leaders emphasized focusing on economic development and cooperation rather than rivalry, signaling a mutual desire to prevent the border issue from defining their entire relationship. This rapprochement has been developing for months, with both nations recently agreeing to resume direct flights and border talks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Chinese military researchers reveals how underwater mountain ranges near the Paracel Islands could be used to create submarine "kill zones." The area's complex topography creates "acoustic shadow zones" where sound waves are distorted, making it an ideal location to hide intelligent sea mines from sonar detection. According to the researchers, strategically placing underwater weapons in these sonar dead zones could enhance their concealment and effectiveness. This development could challenge existing naval power dynamics and undersea warfare capabilities in the contested South China Sea region.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 03:57:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A worldwide craze for matcha, fueled by its reputation as a superfood on social media and a post-pandemic tourism boom, has caused severe supply shortages and soaring prices in Japan. The surge in demand has strained the nation's aging farming communities, which struggle to produce the labor-intensive tencha leaves used for high-quality matcha. Consequently, retailers are rationing supplies and prices have doubled in the last year. The Japanese government is now considering subsidies to encourage more farmers to cultivate tencha to meet the overwhelming global appetite.</p>

          <p>Despite stock markets reaching record highs in August, historical data indicates that September is typically the weakest month of the year for major indices like the S&P 500 and Dow Jones. As investors and traders return from summer holidays, they face this seasonal trend with mixed outlooks from market experts. While some analysts remain optimistic about a potential economic soft landing and continued bull market, others express caution, pointing to increasing pressure on the U.S. economy and a potential slowdown in the second half of the year.

          <p>Entrepreneur Lucy Guo, recently named Forbes' youngest self-made female billionaire, credits her success to a frugal upbringing that motivated her to start making money from a young age. She dropped out of Carnegie Mellon University to accept a Thiel Fellowship, a move that disappointed her immigrant parents but ultimately led to her co-founding the AI data company Scale AI. The company was recently acquired by Meta in a deal valuing it at $25 billion. Guo's current venture, the creator platform Passes, is facing a class-action lawsuit over alleged content distribution, which she and the company categorically deny.</p>

          <p>New government data from England reveals a strong correlation between students missing school during the first week of the academic year and becoming persistently absent later on. According to the figures, 57% of pupils who were partially absent in the first week went on to miss at least 10% of the school year, a stark contrast to the 14% of those who had full attendance initially. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has called on schools and parents to prioritize attendance from day one to combat this trend, which has become a larger issue since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

This article argues that the move is part of a broader trend where right-wing politicians on both sides of the Atlantic challenge traditional media outlets, framing them as establishment foils rather than essential accountability mechanisms. While this approach can energize a political base, it also raises significant concerns about government transparency and the health of local democracy.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Councilmember Ysabel Jurado has publicly opposed a planned Home Depot in her Eagle Rock district, accusing the company of being complicit in federal immigration raids. Her statement follows several recent operations by federal agents targeting day laborers in the parking lots of other Home Depot locations, which she described as a "disturbing pattern" of terror. Home Depot responded that it is not notified of or requesting the raids, while immigrant rights groups have condemned the operations and the use of force by agents.</p>

          <p>In anticipation of a potential deployment of federal agents for immigration enforcement, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights. The order seeks to prevent the deputization of local police for federal operations and prohibits city departments from participating in any actions that could violate residents' rights to peacefully assemble. It also urges federal agents to wear clear identification and refrain from using masks, reflecting growing concerns over aggressive federal tactics seen in other major U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans began their 2025 football season with an overwhelming 73-13 victory against Missouri State, marking one of the highest-scoring games in the program's long history. Starting quarterback Jayden Maiava was highly efficient, throwing for 295 yards and two touchdowns before being rested at halftime. The Trojans' offense was explosive throughout the game, and the defense showed significant improvement from last season, tallying five sacks and a defensive touchdown in a dominant but largely untested start against a lower-division opponent.</p>
