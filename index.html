          <h2>Hamas Revises Gaza Casualty Figures, Reveals High Proportion of Combatants</h2>

          <p>Hamas has significantly altered its reported casualty figures from the Gaza conflict, removing thousands of names and revealing that a majority of those killed were men of combat age. HonestReporting's analysis shows a substantial reduction in the number of reported child fatalities. These revised figures contradict earlier claims that most casualties were women and children. The updated data supports claims that the IDF is primarily targeting combatants, challenging previous narratives promoted by Hamas and cited by international organizations.&#x20;</p>

          <p>In a remarkable event, a pair of critically endangered Galapagos tortoises, both around 100 years old, have become first-time parents at the Philadelphia Zoo. The zoo is celebrating the arrival of four hatchlings from Mommy and Abrazzo, marking a significant milestone in its history. Mommy, who arrived at the zoo in 1932, is the oldest known first-time mother of her species. The hatchlings are part of a breeding program aimed at preserving the species and promoting genetic diversity, with a public debut planned for Mommy's 93rd zoo anniversary.</p>

          <p>Veterans in Wyoming express differing views on proposed cuts to the Veterans Affairs (VA) agency, with some fearing the loss of essential services and others supporting reforms to streamline the VA. Many veterans worry about the potential privatization of care and the economic impact on the region, especially given Wyoming's high veteran suicide rate. Some veterans believe the cuts will improve efficiency, while others fear they will negatively impact access to care, particularly for those with trauma. The debate highlights the complex challenges of reforming the VA system while ensuring veterans receive the support they need.</p>

          <p>The United States is revoking all visas for South Sudanese passport holders and halting the issuance of new visas due to South Sudan's failure to comply with US repatriation efforts.

          <p>Storing cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, through self-custody methods presents a unique set of security challenges, including physical risks such as natural disasters and the unexpected death of the owner. While third-party custodians offer convenience, many crypto enthusiasts prefer self-custody due to distrust of institutional control. Multi-signature setups and diversification of storage approaches are recommended to mitigate the risks of single-point failures.

          <p>President Trump's new tariff regime, based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, faces significant implementation challenges due to a lack of resources and coordination within the federal government. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is underfunded and ill-equipped to handle the surge in product classification disputes and compliance actions. The absence of a formal rulemaking process and public comment period further exacerbates the problem. The op-ed suggests that the policy relies on signaling over processes, potentially leading to economic distortions and retaliatory tariffs.&#x20;</p>

          <p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended President Trump's tariffs, asserting that they would not significantly impact American consumers. Hassett argues that other countries will bear much of the tariff burden due to inelastic supply. The announcement of tariffs has been met with stock market declines and retaliatory measures from other countries. Critics warn of a potential recession and damage to U.S. relationships with allies.</p>

          <p>Tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and IBM are heavily invested in quantum computing, but differing perspectives remain on its commercial viability. Quantum computing uses qubits to process information, offering the potential to solve complex problems beyond the reach of classical computers. While companies are pursuing gate-model quantum computing, D-Wave focuses on annealing technology, which is already delivering commercial value in optimization. Applications range from medical insights to supply chain logistics, but the timeline for widespread adoption remains uncertain.</p>
