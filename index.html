          <p>Nvidia has responded to a Financial Times report alleging that at least $1 billion of its AI chips were illegally smuggled into China. The company stated that attempting to build data centers with unauthorized products is a "losing proposition," as they only provide crucial service and support for officially authorized products. This situation arose after the U.S. government implemented stricter export controls on advanced semiconductors to China, citing national security concerns.</p>

          <p>Despite a winter of lavish spending, the Los Angeles Dodgers are approaching the MLB trade deadline with significant roster flaws, most notably in their bullpen. While still a top National League contender, the team has been hampered by injuries and underperformance from key players. The front office now faces the crucial decision of how aggressively to pursue trades, with a high-leverage relief pitcher being a top priority, versus trusting their existing stars to return to form.</p>

          <p>This article examines the daunting task of eliminating $40,000 in credit card debt, illustrating how high interest rates can extend repayment over decades if only minimum payments are made. It provides several scenarios, showing that increasing monthly payments from the minimum to a fixed, higher amount can reduce the payoff time from 41 years to under three and save tens of thousands in interest. The piece also outlines alternative strategies such as debt consolidation and settlement. (not investment advice)</p>
