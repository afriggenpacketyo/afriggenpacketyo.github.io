        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The prosecution of two men accused of spying for China has been dropped in the UK. The Director of Public Prosecutions stated the case collapsed because the government could not provide evidence officially labeling China a "national security threat" at the time of the alleged offenses. This requirement stemmed from a legal precedent set in a separate espionage case earlier in the year. The government has denied withholding evidence, but the collapse has drawn criticism and raised questions about the UK's official stance on China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a compensation scheme for millions of consumers affected by the car finance mis-selling scandal. The plan covers 14 million agreements made between 2007 and 2024, with estimated average payouts of £700 per claim, totaling a potential £8.2 billion from lenders. The scandal involves undisclosed commission arrangements and unfair contracts that led to customers overpaying for loans. While consumer advocates welcome the long-overdue redress, the lending industry has suggested the FCA's compensation estimates may be too high. (not investment advice)</p>

The aircraft had just departed from the UC Davis Medical Center when it experienced an in-air emergency. Remarkably, no vehicles on the busy freeway were involved in the crash, a fact one official described as "mind blowing." Bystanders assisted first responders in lifting the wreckage to free a trapped crew member, and all three were transported to the hospital for treatment.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are poised for a flat opening, reflecting a week of regional instability. The primary driver of uncertainty is the political chaos in France, where Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu's shock resignation has left budget plans in limbo. Additionally, the UK's steel industry is facing a potential crisis after the European Union announced plans to hike tariffs on excess steel imports. These developments, combined with a downturn on Wall Street and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, are contributing to a cautious market sentiment across Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US special envoy Steve Witkoff and former White House advisor Jared Kushner are set to join Gaza peace talks in Egypt, aiming to broker a deal between Israeli and Hamas negotiators. The talks, occurring on the second anniversary of the October 7th attacks, have reportedly been tough, with disagreements over Israeli withdrawal maps and guarantees to prevent renewed fighting. The negotiations are focused on securing a permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and establishing a post-war governance plan for the territory. International pressure is mounting for an agreement to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a new record high, exceeding $4,000 per ounce as investors seek safe-haven assets. This significant rally, the largest since the 1970s, is being fueled by widespread economic and political uncertainty, including global trade tensions and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Analysts note that gold's value typically increases during periods of market turbulence. The weakening U.S. dollar and increased purchasing by retail investors have also contributed to the precious metal's unprecedented climb. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>France is facing intense scrutiny over its fiscal stability following the resignation of its fifth Prime Minister in under two years, Sébastien Lecornu. The political deadlock threatens the country's ability to address its soaring public debt, which stands at 113% of GDP, and a budget deficit of 5.8%, both far exceeding EU limits. President Macron has given Lecornu 48 hours to find a path forward, but the crisis highlights the deep political fragmentation that makes essential fiscal reforms seem unattainable. This instability is causing concern among investors and EU officials in Brussels.</p>

          <p>Charlie Mackesy, the author and illustrator of the bestselling book "The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and the Horse," has revealed that his new book took six years to complete partly because his iPad was stolen. The device, which contained many un-backed-up drawings and ideas for the new book, "Always Remember," was taken from his unlocked car. Mackesy described the theft as a significant setback that forced him to try and recall the lost work from memory. He also spoke about dealing with the grief of losing his mother and his dog during the book's creation.</p>

          <p>Residents of a Portland, Oregon, apartment complex located opposite a federal ICE building describe their neighborhood as a "war zone" due to nightly clashes between protesters and federal agents. People living in the building report tear gas seeping into their homes, forcing some to sleep with gas masks on. The unrest has put Portland in the national spotlight, with President Trump threatening to deploy the National Guard, a move temporarily blocked by a federal judge. While many Portland residents mock the president's portrayal of the city, those at the epicenter of the conflict are living with daily disruption and fear.</p>

          <p>A MAGA influencer is facing widespread mockery for a video praising DHS Secretary Kristi Noem for "staring down an army of Antifa" in Portland, Oregon. The video shows Noem on a rooftop looking down at what appears to be a small group of about a dozen reporters and protesters, including one person in a chicken costume. Critics ridiculed the use of the term "army" to describe the small, peaceful gathering. The incident occurred while Noem was in the city amid ongoing tensions over federal immigration enforcement and local protests.</p>

          <p>Matt Van Epps has won a crowded Republican primary in the special election for a Tennessee U.S. House seat, bolstered by a late endorsement from former President Trump. Van Epps, a Tennessee Army National Guard lieutenant colonel, will face Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn in the December general election. The seat, which covers parts of Nashville and its suburbs, was vacated by former Rep. Mark Green and is considered safely Republican. The race is seen as a potential gauge of Trump's influence and his second-term agenda's popularity in suburban areas.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles is appealing a federal judge's order that restricts the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) from using crowd control weapons like projectile launchers and tear gas against journalists and nonviolent protesters. The injunction was granted after lawsuits alleged the LAPD used excessive force and violated its own guidelines during protests against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The city argues the ban is overly broad and impractical, claiming it is not always possible for officers to identify journalists in chaotic situations, putting police at risk.</p>

          <p>Shares of minerals explorer Trilogy Metals skyrocketed by over 200% after the White House announced it would take a 10% stake in the company. The $35.6 million investment is part of a federal initiative to secure domestic supply chains for critical minerals like copper and cobalt, located in Alaska's Ambler mining district. This move reverses a previous administration's rejection of the associated Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed federal commitment to resource development to reduce reliance on China, which currently dominates the global critical minerals supply chain.

BBC Verify found over 7,200 police crime records mentioning catapults in the last five years.

          <p>A controversial proposal to redraw California's congressional districts mid-decade, known as Proposition 50, has become a fierce point of debate among candidates in the 2026 governor's race. Backed by Democrats, the plan aims to create more favorable districts to counter Republican-led redistricting in states like Texas. Republican candidates and some critics decry the move as a corrupt power grab that undermines the independent commission voters established in 2020. Democratic candidates largely defend it as a necessary political maneuver to protect California's interests and representation in a divided Washington.</p>
