        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florian Wirtz, a 22-year-old German football star, has officially joined Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen for a record-breaking €150 million, marking the most expensive transfer in Bundesliga history. Wirtz, considered one of Germany's biggest talents alongside Jamal Musiala, previously played a key role in Leverkusen's double win, scoring 35 goals and providing 47 assists in 140 games. His early football development was nurtured at home with his sister Juliane, also a professional footballer, and his father, who is now his agent. Known for his offensive prowess and defensive contribution, Wirtz's move to Liverpool is expected to significantly boost their midfield, and he will wear the number 10 shirt. The transfer highlights Liverpool's investment in young talent and their ambition to remain competitive in the Premier League and Champions League.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy focused on lowering energy costs for businesses and supporting key industries to boost economic growth. The plan includes the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme, which will cut energy costs by up to £40 per megawatt-hour for over 7,000 manufacturing firms starting in 2027. Additionally, about 500 energy-intensive firms will receive a 90% discount on network charges from 2026 through the British Industry Supercharger scheme. Other measures include upskilling Britons, attracting global talent, streamlining planning processes, and increasing research and development spending, particularly in AI, while focusing on eight specific sectors including advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and financial services. The strategy aims to create over one million new well-paid jobs over the next decade and marks a shift from fixing inherited problems to delivering tangible change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least seven people have been killed and several others injured in Kyiv following a Russian missile and drone attack.

In recent weeks, Russia has intensified its aerial attacks on Ukrainian cities, leading to increased casualties and infrastructure damage.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge increased defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their GDP, as the U.S. pushes for greater financial commitment from its partners. The proposed 5% target includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure. While some members are supportive, others are hesitant, particularly those struggling to meet the existing 2% threshold. The summit takes place against a backdrop of ongoing conflict in Ukraine and instability in the Middle East, underscoring the need for collective security efforts. However, the key question remains whether these pledges will translate into concrete action and increased military capabilities, especially amidst competing domestic priorities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite extensive sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine, Russia's economy has shown surprising resilience, even outperforming G7 nations in 2024 with a 4.3% expansion driven by military spending and stable oil exports. However, persistent high inflation, soaring interest rates (20%), and labor shortages are creating economic strain, with the economy minister warning of a potential recession. While the rouble has recovered strongly, analysts predict defaults and bankruptcies, though not a complete meltdown, with unemployment remaining low. Sanctions continue to impact technology imports and energy revenues, leading to reallocation of funds from infrastructure projects to military spending, which may affect long-term growth and diversification.

          <p>The United States has entered the conflict between Israel and Iran, striking three critical Iranian nuclear sites and escalating geopolitical tensions. In response, Iran's parliament has voted to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital transit point for approximately 20% of the world's oil supply, causing oil prices to jump over 2% to nearly $80 per barrel for Brent crude. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait, given China's status as Iran's largest oil customer. Analysts warn that oil prices could surge to $100 a barrel if the Strait is closed and Western forces attempt to reopen it by force.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is considering canceling his attendance at a NATO summit, according to a government source. Ishiba was scheduled to make a three-day trip from Tuesday to attend the meeting in the Netherlands. Japan is not a NATO member but is one of the trans-Atlantic alliance's Indo-Pacific partners.

          <p>A portion of Frederick Road in Salford is scheduled to close for six months starting July 12 as part of a major regeneration project. The closure is necessary for the construction of Salford Rise, a 721-foot elevated walkway designed to provide a traffic-free route across the city. A diversion will be in place for drivers, while pedestrians can use Broughton Road East. The project is part of the £2.5 billion Crescent Salford initiative, which aims to transform a 240-acre area of Salford city center with new homes, research facilities, and businesses.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist in Scotland is hoping to establish a ketamine clinic by the end of the year to treat severe depression as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire that began offering ketamine assisted therapy last summer for treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine, while known as a party drug, is being explored for its potential to treat severe depression, though it is not yet licensed for routine treatment. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is expected to release a new report on psychedelics later this year, including updated information on ketamine.</p>

          <p>An 83-year-old woman, Maureen Welch, suffered life-altering injuries after being hit by a cyclist on a Lime e-bike who ran a red light in London. The incident has led to calls for stricter regulation of e-bikes, with her son-in-law, celebrity chef Aldo Zilli, and his wife, Nichola, advocating for better enforcement of rules and regulations. While the government is considering updating cycling legislation, local councils have limited powers to manage dockless e-bikes, and the Zilli family is pushing for more comprehensive action. Trauma surgeons in London have also noted a spike in injuries related to e-bike accidents, highlighting the need for improved safety measures.</p>

          <p>Western leaders are calling for diplomacy and de-escalation in the escalating conflict between the U.S., Israel, and Iran, but are failing to address the root causes of the crisis. Critics argue that these leaders are passengers in Israel's war, unwilling to question its wisdom or challenge the underlying issues. The U.S. and its allies are accused of maintaining a status quo of unconditional support for Israel, which has undermined international law and moral authority. This inaction is seen as a failure of leadership and a betrayal of the public trust, leading to an accelerating nihilism and a widening gap between political elites and the public.</p>

          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is expected to set ambitious goals for member states, particularly concerning defense spending, which could heavily impact Germany's military, the Bundeswehr. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged financial resources to strengthen the Bundeswehr, NATO's target of spending 5% of GDP on defense is contentious, with some coalition members and opposition parties skeptical. To meet these goals, the German military may need to recruit tens of thousands of additional soldiers, potentially requiring a reevaluation of conscription policies, and there is uncertainty about whether Germany can significantly increase its troop numbers in the coming years.</p>

NATO members are considering allocating 3.5% of GDP to core defense needs and 1.5% to security-related investments, but challenges remain in securing commitments from all members, particularly Spain and Italy. For Ukraine, the summit may be disappointing, as its aspirations to join NATO are unlikely to take center stage.</p>
