          <p>Approximately 70 Japanese lawmakers from various parties visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo for its spring festival, a site viewed by neighboring countries like China and South Korea as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. The visit, which included former economic security minister Sanae Takaichi, occurred a day after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba sent a ritual offering to the shrine. The Yasukuni Shrine honors not only millions of war dead but also wartime leaders convicted as war criminals, causing diplomatic friction with countries that experienced Japanese wartime aggression. The group's visits typically occur during spring and autumn festivals and on the anniversary of the end of World War II.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is creating a complex situation for central banks worldwide, presenting both opportunities and challenges related to currency management. While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and lower inflation by making imports cheaper, it also complicates export competitiveness and can trigger capital flight. Central banks are wary of devaluing their currencies due to the risk of stoking inflation and potentially inviting retaliatory trade measures from the U.S. administration. The current environment necessitates a delicate balancing act to avoid a currency war and maintain economic stability.</p>

          <p>Over 100 college and university presidents have jointly condemned the Trump administration's "unprecedented government overreach and political interference" in higher education. The statement, released by the American Association of Colleges and Universities, follows Harvard University's lawsuit against the government over funding threats. The university leaders express openness to constructive reform but oppose undue intrusion into campus life, citing concerns about academic freedom and government measures aimed at universities under the guise of fighting alleged antisemitism. Harvard's lawsuit and the collective statement represent a stronger unified response from universities against the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has been ordered to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students following a temporary restraining order filed in a U.S. District Court in Georgia.

The plaintiffs, some nearing graduation or enrolled in work programs, claim they were charged with minor violations or had charges dropped.

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued dual endorsements in the Republican primary for Arizona governor, backing both U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs and housing developer Karrin Taylor Robson.

Biggs, a former chair of the House Freedom Caucus, has been a staunch Trump ally and supported his claims about the 2020 election.

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, now at 145%, are significantly impacting dropshipping businesses that rely on sourcing products from China. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, which allowed duty-free entry for shipments valued at $800 or less, further intensifies the pressure. Dropshippers are facing reduced revenue, increased inspection delays, and customer refund requests due to packages being stuck at the border. Some businesses are shifting their focus to European markets and seeking diverse supply sources to mitigate the impact of the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

However, analysts note that private and small businesses are more vulnerable to US tariffs compared to state-owned enterprises.

Harvard President Alan Garber stated that no government should dictate what universities teach or whom they admit. The administration claims the universities mishandled pro-Palestinian protests and allowed antisemitism on campuses, a claim refuted by Garber.</p>

The research also revealed structural and cellular differences between macaque and rodent claustrums, offering insights into the evolutionary mechanisms behind consciousness.
