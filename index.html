          <p>A shooting in a Midtown Manhattan office building resulted in three fatalities, including an off-duty NYPD officer who was working a security detail. The incident occurred at 345 Park Avenue, which houses offices for Blackstone and the National Football League. The suspect, who was wearing body armor and carrying a high-powered rifle, was later found deceased from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after barricading himself inside the building. The motive for the attack is currently under investigation by authorities, who advised people in the area to shelter in place.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Public schools across the United States are facing a potential crisis in student mental health services due to the abrupt discontinuation of federal grants. The Trump administration cited diversity, equity, and inclusion issues as the reason for cutting millions in funding, leaving many districts, particularly in rural areas, unable to retain counselors and social workers. This reduction in essential support staff raises significant safety and wellness concerns for students who rely on these services for their mental health. Sixteen states are now suing the Department of Education over the cuts.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old U.S. citizen has spoken out after a video of his violent arrest by immigration agents in Florida gained widespread attention. The high school senior, Kenny Laynez, was told "you got no rights here" by an officer during the May incident, which occurred during a traffic stop involving his mother and undocumented co-workers. The video also captured an officer suggesting they might end up shooting people, followed by a comment about a financial bonus. Advocacy groups are highlighting the incident as a concerning consequence of expanded state law enforcement powers in immigration crackdowns.</p>

          <p>Reports that the Trump administration denied a request for Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te to make a stopover in New York City have raised concerns about potential deference to China. The alleged decision, reportedly made amid pressure from Beijing, has drawn criticism from policy experts and Democratic lawmakers who see it as a break from precedent and a signal that U.S. support for Taiwan might be negotiable. While Taiwan's presidential office stated Lai has no current overseas travel plans, unnamed sources indicated the decision was made after the transit request was denied, possibly in the context of ongoing U.S.-China trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>A significant archaeological finding in China's Qinghai province is providing new insights into the reign of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor to unify China. A researcher from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has analyzed a stone carving found near Zhaling Lake, which is believed to be the only such carving from the emperor's era still at its original site. The inscription details a journey to the source of the Yellow River, which scholars suggest could be linked to the emperor's famed and obsessive quest to find an elixir of immortality.</p>

          <p>In rural Georgia, recent cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are threatening to exacerbate food insecurity, especially among children, and place greater strain on local food banks. Hancock County, which already has the highest rate of child food insecurity in the nation, is seeing residents increasingly rely on pantries to supplement meager benefits. With billions projected to be cut from SNAP over the next decade and other federal food programs also reduced, organizations like Golden Harvest food bank are bracing for a surge in demand while depending more heavily on community donations to fill the gap.</p>

          <p>President Trump has significantly shortened his deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, reducing it from 50 days to just 10 or 12 days. Citing a lack of progress and expressing disappointment over Russia's continued attacks on Ukrainian cities, Trump announced the revised timeline during a meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland. The original deadline was tied to a threat of imposing severe secondary tariffs on countries that continue to trade with Russia.

          <p>A geriatrician and dementia expert explains that the body's ability to process alcohol diminishes significantly with age, leading to more severe effects from drinking. In your 20s, the liver and brain are more resilient, but habits formed then can cause future problems. As people enter their 40s and 50s, health risks like obesity and hypertension increase, and alcohol can exacerbate these conditions, also raising the risk for certain cancers and disrupting sleep. By the 60s, many people lose the enzyme needed to metabolize alcohol effectively, meaning even one drink can feel ill-effects the next day.</p>

          <h2>Market Analyst Explains Lack of Rally Following Trump's Recent Trade Deals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 19:35:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that recent major trade deals, including the one with the European Union, failed to spark a market rally because investor focus is currently elsewhere. He argues that Wall Street is preoccupied with this week's Big Tech earnings reports, an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, and Friday's employment data, which are seen as more impactful than tariff news. Cramer also points to a sense of "tariff ennui," as investors have grown accustomed to a pattern of high tariff threats followed by negotiated deals, and are waiting for resolutions with other major partners like China, Canada, and Mexico.

          <p>A federal appellate court is reviewing a lower court's order that blocked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from conducting indiscriminate "roving patrols" in Southern California. The case centers on whether ICE agents can use factors like race, location, or language as a pretext for detaining individuals without reasonable suspicion, a practice a district judge found unconstitutional. The Justice Department argues the injunction is a judicial overreach, while civil rights groups contend the tactics lead to unlawful arrests of both immigrants and U.S. citizens. The 9th Circuit's ruling could set up another major immigration showdown at the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A court in Bogota has convicted former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe of witness tampering, marking the first time an ex-president in the country has been found guilty in a criminal case. Uribe, who led the nation from 2002 to 2010, was found to have bribed witnesses to provide false testimony in a separate investigation into his alleged ties to right-wing paramilitary groups. The highly politicized case, which could result in a prison sentence of up to 12 years, originated from a 2012 accusation Uribe made against a left-wing senator, which ultimately led to an investigation into Uribe himself.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic suggests that President Trump's stance on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is primarily influenced by what he sees on television rather than by intelligence reports. Despite having access to the world's most powerful information network, Trump's public comments about "real starvation stuff" that "you can't fake" indicate he takes his cues from mass media imagery. This reliance on television makes him susceptible to public opinion shifts but also to manipulation and misinformation, especially given his distrust of expert advice and the intelligence community. The article highlights this as a dangerous vulnerability in his policy-making process.</p>

          <p>As the MLB trade deadline approaches, the Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly looking to upgrade their outfield defense to complement their strong pitching rotation. While the team's offense has struggled recently, a primary focus appears to be on improving run prevention for a potential playoff run. Harrison Bader of the Minnesota Twins, a premium defender who is also having a solid offensive season, has emerged as a potential fit. Adding a strong defensive outfielder would allow the team to optimize its alignment and better support a pitching staff that is expected to be a key to its postseason success.</p>

Backed by billionaire Peter Thiel, Hogan's $140 million victory ultimately bankrupted Gawker and reinforced the idea that individuals, including celebrities, have a right to privacy in the digital age, particularly concerning non-consensual publication of intimate material.</p>

However, the judge upheld the FOMC's long-standing practice of meeting behind closed doors, ruling it is not a government agency subject to the act.
