        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended President Trump's tariffs, asserting they won't significantly raise consumer prices. Hassett claims other countries bear much of the tariff burden due to inelastic supply, leading them to negotiate with the U.S. Trump's tariffs, including a 10% tariff on all imports and larger tariffs on specific countries, have sparked market volatility and retaliatory measures from trading partners. Critics fear a potential recession and strained relationships with allies, but Hassett maintains a positive outlook on the tariffs' impact.</p>

          <p>South Carolina's head coach Dawn Staley criticized ESPN's framing of her comments regarding UConn star Paige Bueckers, suggesting a misleading narrative.

She clarified that her intention was to advocate for balanced coverage, rather than diminish Bueckers' accomplishments, and expressed frustration with narratives overshadowing her team's success.</p>

          <p>National Security Advisor Mike Waltz mistakenly added Jeffrey Goldberg of *The Atlantic* to a Signal group chat discussing US strikes in Yemen due to a contact saving error. The incident, stemming from an email exchange during the 2024 campaign, triggered a White House "forensic review."

          <p>Stanley Plumly's poem "Chickadee" reflects on memories of chickadees filling a feeder outside a kitchen window during a cold Amherst winter. The poem contrasts the sublime with the small, finding solace in the presence of the birds during a time of solitude. It contemplates the fragility of life and the fleeting nature of connection, capturing a moment of warmth and vitality against the backdrop of a snowy landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump urged Americans to "hang tough" as his 10% universal tariffs went into effect, calling it an "economic revolution." He claims the tariffs will bring back jobs and businesses. China has retaliated with a 34% tariff on US products. Trump also warned other countries not to retaliate, asserting that they have treated the U.S. unfairly.</p>

          <p>Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones stated that the era of globalisation has ended following President Trump's imposition of tariffs. Prime Minister Starmer is expected to announce state intervention to protect UK firms.

The UK government continues to pursue a trade deal with the US, while refraining from retaliatory tariffs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's tariffs, initially expected to boost the dollar, are now dragging it down due to rising recession fears. Investors are fleeing to safe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc. The dollar index fell sharply after the tariff announcement, and some analysts believe the U.S. economy is not strong enough to withstand the tariffs. Growing optimism around a potential peace deal in Ukraine is bolstering the euro as an alternative.</p>
