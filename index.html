          <p>Arne Slot has defied expectations by leading Liverpool to their 20th league title in his first season as manager, following Jurgen Klopp's departure. Slot's success places him among an elite group of managers who have won the Premier League in their debut season, with Liverpool securing the title with four games to spare. Observers note that Slot's success stems from being himself rather than trying to emulate Klopp, fostering a seamless transition and building on the existing team's strengths. This achievement is considered remarkable given the initial worries about replacing Klopp's iconic presence.</p>

          <p>Qatar's prime minister indicated minor headway in brokering a Gaza ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, though fundamental disagreements persist regarding ending the conflict. Hamas appears more open to a lasting resolution involving the release of hostages in exchange for a five-year cessation of hostilities and potential disarmament, contingent on Israeli forces withdrawing from Gaza. Meanwhile, Israel appears to have no intention of withdrawing its forces from Gaza. A Palestinian official suggested Hamas might cede governance of Gaza to a mutually agreed-upon Palestinian entity, but Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has dismissed any role for the Palestinian Authority and opposes a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that there is a path to an agreement with China over tariffs, citing recent interactions with Chinese counterparts. Despite conflicting signals from both sides, Bessent expressed confidence that China will find the high tariff levels unsustainable. He acknowledged that negotiations could take months but praised President Trump's negotiating strategy. Top US retailers have reportedly warned the White House that tariffs will cause empty store shelves and price hikes.</p>

          <p>A fatal plane crash at Reagan National Airport has been attributed to the mishandling of a common aviation practice known as "visual separation." The crew of an Army Black Hawk helicopter requested and received permission to navigate around other aircraft visually, rather than relying on air traffic control. This practice, while routine, carries a risk of deadly consequences when mishandled, as highlighted by aviation experts. The incident underscores the importance of proper execution and communication in airspace management.</p>
