          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, also a Democratic mayoral candidate, was arrested at an immigration court in Manhattan while observing proceedings. According to Lander's office, he was taken into custody by ICE agents while requesting a judicial warrant in a specific case. Homeland Security stated that Lander was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer, a claim Lander's wife disputes. Supporters, including Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, condemned the arrest, emphasizing the importance of witnessing and challenging actions within the immigration system. The incident has sparked debate about due process and the treatment of individuals in immigration court. Optimism surrounding the incident remains low due to the nature of the arrest and the circumstances surrounding it.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortions performed later in pregnancy. The Labour MP for Gower, Tonia Antoniazzi, spearheaded the effort, advocating for compassion rather than criminalization for women who undergo abortions after 24 weeks. This change in legislation aims to provide support and understanding for women in difficult situations who seek late-term abortions. The vote reflects a shift in perspective toward viewing these cases as matters of healthcare rather than criminal offenses. The decision is a win for the women in England and Wales who find themselves in these situations.</p>

          <p>Republican Sen. Mike Lee is facing backlash for social media posts referencing the assassination of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband. Lee's initial posts, which have since been deleted, appeared to blame Marxists and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for the shootings. Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin condemned Lee's posts as dangerous and inciting violence, while others called for elected officials to tone down heated rhetoric. Lee later condemned the attacks and called for prayers for the victims and their families, but the initial posts sparked widespread criticism.</p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz announced it will remove artificial food dyes from all U.S. products starting in 2027, with immediate cessation of new product development using these dyes. Nearly 90% of Kraft Heinz's U.S. products are already free of synthetic dyes, with ongoing efforts to remove dyes from remaining products or replace them with natural colors. This decision follows federal health officials' plans to phase out petroleum-based food dyes voluntarily. The company's iconic Heinz Tomato Ketchup has never contained artificial dyes, and Kraft Mac & Cheese previously removed artificial dyes a decade ago, opting for spices like paprika and turmeric.</p>

Lyles did not elaborate on the specific complications that led to the cancellation, but expressed disappointment that the event could not proceed. Hill had challenged Lyles to a 50-yard race after Lyles won 100m gold at the Olympics, and recently ran a personal best of 10.15 seconds in the 100m.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's stance on the conflict between Israel and Iran is complex, with shifting statements and actions. While claiming to be a peacemaker, Trump has also made aggressive remarks toward Iran's leadership, including disclosing the location of Iran's Supreme Leader. Some analysts suggest Israel may have influenced the U.S. to believe military action could advance nuclear talks, while others note Trump's base is divided on military involvement in the Middle East. Trump's decision not to explicitly discourage Israel's actions may have been interpreted as tacit approval, leaving his true position ambiguous.</p>

          <p>A review by House Judiciary Democrats reveals that President Trump's recent pardons have cost crime victims and taxpayers approximately $1.3 billion in restitution and payments. The pardons absolved convicted criminals from paying for damages and restitution caused by their crimes, including corporate fraudsters and tax evaders. This includes restitution payments to victims by Todd Chrisley and Carlos Watson, who were convicted of fraud. The report criticizes Trump's decision to relieve criminals of their restitution requirements, arguing it harms victims and undermines the purpose of presidential pardons.</p>

          <p>Bob Menendez, the former U.S. Senator from New Jersey, has reported to a federal prison to begin serving an 11-year sentence for bribery and acting as an agent of Egypt. Menendez, who maintains his innocence, was convicted of accepting bribes of gold and cash in exchange for political favors. FBI agents found a significant amount of cash and gold bars in his home. Menendez's lawyers described his rise from poverty to a prominent political figure before his conviction, which has now made him a national punchline.</p>
