          <p>EchoStar's stock experienced a remarkable surge of over 80% following the announcement that AT&T would acquire wireless spectrum licenses from the company for approximately $23 billion in an all-cash deal. This strategic acquisition is set to bolster AT&T's network by adding about 50 megahertz of crucial mid-band and low-band spectrum, covering over 400 U.S. markets, with the transaction anticipated to close by mid-2026, pending regulatory approval. EchoStar indicated that this sale, alongside an expanded network services agreement, is a vital step in resolving Federal Communications Commission inquiries into its 5G network compliance, which had been spurred by concerns from SpaceX regarding underutilized spectrum. The arrangement also enables EchoStar to function as a hybrid mobile network operator for Boost Mobile, marking a significant development for both companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Metro Phoenix experienced a significant weather event on Monday as a powerful haboob, a towering wall of dust, swept through the area, dramatically darkening the sky and blinding drivers. This intense dust storm was swiftly followed by a monsoon, which caused widespread disruptions, including over 200 flight delays at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and damage to a terminal roof. Residents reported feeling nervous and scared, tasting dust and feeling strong winds, while over 15,000 people lost power, primarily in Maricopa County. Although Phoenix has been drier than usual this monsoon season, meteorologists characterize such localized and intense weather as typical, with further rain anticipated, highlighting the unpredictable nature of Arizona's summer storms.</p>

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts are highlighted as a beneficial savings option in an inflationary economy, offering returns that currently surpass the inflation rate. This article details the national average CD yields for various terms as of August 20, 2025, alongside a list of top rates available from specific banks, noting a significant difference between the two. It advises savers to explore online banks for more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, and to consider short-term CDs, which currently offer higher interest due to an inverted yield curve. Laddering CDs is suggested as a strategy to capitalize on these high short-term rates while planning for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

The article strongly recommends opting for high-yield accounts, especially those offered by online banks, which typically benefit from lower overhead costs and, in turn, provide more competitive rates and reduced fees. Furthermore, it advises consumers to diligently compare various account options, considering both interest rates and potential fees, to ensure their savings achieve maximum growth and preparedness for future needs.

This current probe builds upon a previous recall in November 2023, which initially targeted connecting rod bearing issues suspected to stem from a crankshaft manufacturing defect. However, NHTSA concluded that the latest wave of engine failure reports extends beyond the scope of the prior recall, necessitating a new inquiry to thoroughly assess the potential problem's full scope and severity. The agency is committed to evaluating all safety-related issues, providing reassurance that, as of now, no deaths or injuries have been linked to these specific engine failures.</p>

          <p>The US House Oversight Committee has issued a subpoena to Jeffrey Epstein's estate, demanding the production of several documents, including a "birthday book" reportedly compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell for Epstein's 50th birthday. This action expands the committee's investigation into the late financier's crimes, particularly after reports surfaced of a bawdy note allegedly from Donald Trump within the book, which Trump denies. The subpoena also seeks non-disclosure agreements and any records that could be construed as client lists involved in sexual acts or sexual assault, despite previous statements from the Department of Justice and FBI, and Maxwell herself, denying the existence of such a list. The move reflects persistent public pressure for greater transparency regarding Epstein's network.</p>

Authorities allege the adults claimed ignorance of the girl's pregnancy, despite her petite stature and the baby's normal size, and noted the child had not seen a doctor in over a year, preventing early detection. This case, described by an assistant district attorney as potentially "the most serious" she has prosecuted, also involves neglect charges for five other children in their care.

          <p>An increasing number of homeowners are choosing to withdraw their properties from the market rather than lower their asking prices, a trend indicative of widespread frustration over the prolonged time it takes to secure a buyer. A recent report from Realtor.com highlights a substantial 38% increase in delistings since the beginning of 2025, and a 48% rise compared to the previous year, suggesting a significant impasse in the housing market. Despite a post-pandemic surge in housing inventory, home sales across the U.S. remain largely stagnant, primarily due to persistently high prices and elevated mortgage rates that continue to deter many prospective homebuyers. This reluctance to reduce prices often stems from sellers benefiting from already favorable mortgage rates on their current homes, leading them to hold out for better market conditions rather than selling at a discount.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly's daily weight loss pill, orforglipron, has successfully completed its latest late-stage trial for patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, meeting its primary goal and paving the way for global regulatory approval. The treatment demonstrated significant weight loss, with the highest dose leading to an average reduction of 10.5% (22.9 pounds) over 72 weeks, and also improved blood sugar levels, with most patients no longer meeting Type 2 diabetes criteria. This needle-free oral option, which does not require dietary restrictions unlike some rivals, could revolutionize the GLP-1 market by boosting supply and accessibility. While side effects were mainly mild to moderate gastrointestinal issues, the drug's "unprecedented efficacy" in this patient group is highly anticipated by medical professionals and the company expects a global launch next year.</p>

          <p>Germany's automobile industry has shed approximately 51,500 jobs in the past year, representing 6.7% of its workforce and nearly half of all industrial job losses, according to an EY study. This decline, accelerating since 2019, is attributed to a 2.1% dip in industrial turnover and significant drops in exports to key markets. Exports to the US fell by 10% due to new tariffs, while China, once Germany's second-largest export market, plummeted to sixth with a 14% year-on-year decrease, impacted by its own growing domestic car industry and ongoing EU-China tariff battles. Major German firms are implementing cost-cutting measures, leading to further layoffs and a challenging future for young engineers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ping An, a major Chinese insurer, reported an 8.8% decline in interim net profit to 68.05 billion yuan, missing Bloomberg's consensus estimate for a 4.4% increase. The company attributed this underperformance to China's interest rate cuts, which eroded its investment returns. Despite the profit miss, Ping An's life and health insurance divisions saw a robust 39.8% rise in the value of new business, driven by strong sales from agents and bancassurance. Chairman Peter Ma Mingzhe acknowledged a stable yet challenging economic environment in China, citing lacklustre domestic demand. The insurer announced an interim dividend of 0.95 yuan per share, a slight increase from the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United's head coach, Ruben Amorim, believes that the club's absence from European competitions this season, a consequence of their 15th-placed Premier League finish and Europa League final defeat, presents a positive opportunity for team development. Amorim stated the team was "not prepared to play in Europe and the Premier League" simultaneously, emphasizing the need for time to evolve as a cohesive unit. This unexpected break from midweek European distractions allows for more focused training and player rotation, particularly for senior players and youngsters. While the Carabao Cup now offers a route back to Europe, Amorim sees the current season as a crucial period for building a strong foundation for future success.</p>

This move is seen as codifying American long-arm jurisdiction, previously resisted by Europe, and aims to sever Beijing’s access to Western capital, technology, and markets, thereby eliminating the transatlantic divisions China once exploited.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Billie Jean King, a lifelong advocate for women's rights and equality in sports, continues to highlight progress while emphasizing the ongoing need for further change. King, famous for her "Battle of the Sexes" victory and instrumental in founding the WTA and achieving equal prize money at the U.S. Open, stresses the importance of men using their power to support women's advancements. She recounts instances where women's voices, like Kendall Coyne Schofield's in establishing the Professional Women's Hockey League, led to tangible industry changes. King's ultimate goal remains the unification of men's and women's tennis leagues, as she continues to embrace aging as an opportunity for more impact.</p>

          <h2>Kilmar Ábrego García Case Highlights "Sadistic Absurdity" of Trump Immigration Policy</h2>

          <p>This opinion article critiques the "Kafkaesque absurdity" of the Trump administration's anti-immigration policies through the ongoing case of Kilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland resident. Ábrego, initially deported to a Salvadorian prison without due process due to an "administrative error," was returned under public pressure but subsequently re-arrested by ICE on unproven allegations. The administration now plans to deport him to Uganda, a country he has never visited, under a new third-country scheme. The article argues that Ábrego is being punished for exposing the "cruelty, randomness, and essential malignant incompetence" of Trump's immigration enforcement, serving as a symbol of the program's disregard for individual rights and legal authority, and unifying anti-Trump forces.</p>

          <p>Southern California congressional Democrats are demanding answers from the Department of Homeland Security regarding a significant Border Patrol presence outside a Gov. Gavin Newsom news conference in Los Angeles. Scores of masked, armed federal immigration agents assembled during Newsom's announcement about countering President Trump’s redistricting plans. Led by Rep. Laura Friedman, the letter questions who authorized the deployment, whether Newsom's political agenda influenced the decision, the force's size, and details about two arrests made, including a strawberry delivery man now facing deportation. Democrats allege the action was an attempt to intimidate them and send a political message, raising concerns about the use of law enforcement for political purposes.</p>
