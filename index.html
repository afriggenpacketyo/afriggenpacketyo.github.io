          <p>Voters in South Texas, largely SpaceX employees, overwhelmingly approved the creation of Starbase, a new city near Elon Musk's rocket launch facility, with a vote of 212 to 6. The area, previously known as Boca Chica, will now have the authority to manage its own roads, utilities, and potentially close a local beach and state park for launch operations. Critics worry about Musk's increased control over the area, while SpaceX officials emphasize the need for community growth and streamlined launch procedures. The city's establishment comes as SpaceX seeks permission to increase launch frequency, and Musk celebrated the victory on X, calling it "now a real city!".</p>

          <p>Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) party is attempting to unseat Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te amid increasing recall petitions against its legislators. The KMT, which favors closer ties with Beijing, faces mounting criticism for obstructing the Lai administration's agenda and weaponizing legislative tools. Recent raids on KMT local chapter headquarters have uncovered documents related to counter-recall efforts, further intensifying the political conflict. The moves have sparked domestic disapproval and drawn concern from the United States and its allies, who have described the tactics as unreasonable and disruptive, leading to questions about the functionality of Taiwan's opposition.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court blocked a lower court's ruling that would have allowed Voice of America (VOA) employees to return to work, creating uncertainty about the broadcaster's future. The publicly funded broadcaster had been largely silenced following an executive order by former President Donald Trump, leading to the furlough of over 1,000 employees and termination of 600 contractors. A dissenting judge warned that the networks may cease to exist in any meaningful form due to the legal battle.

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 a year for home-schooled students. Supporters celebrated the bill as a victory for parents and students, while Democrats argue that it will harm public schools by siphoning funds to benefit wealthier families already in private education. President Trump supported the vote, adding that education would soon be sent back to the states.</p>

          <p>United Airlines is cutting 35 daily flights from Newark Liberty International Airport due to ongoing equipment and staffing shortages, with over 800 delays and 150 cancellations reported since Tuesday. The airline's CEO, Scott Kirby, stated that Newark airport cannot handle the current flight schedule and that the cuts are necessary to protect customers. The FAA attributed the problems to equipment issues, runway construction, and staffing shortages in Philadelphia, where the air traffic control center overseeing Newark's airspace is located.

          <p>A recent survey in Japan revealed that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships chose not to legally marry due to the country's surname law, which requires couples to adopt the same last name. The rate is higher among people in their 20s, with over 60% of that group stating they would marry if separate surnames were permitted. While some political parties support the option of separate surnames, others fear it would undermine traditional family values. Common-law couples in Japan lack access to the same benefits as legally married couples, such as tax deductions and inheritance rights.</p>

While the market is booming, Starbucks' market share has decreased from 34% in 2019 to 14% in 2024, as domestic and international chains compete for market dominance.

          <p>Ginzan Onsen, a popular hot spring town in Yamagata Prefecture, Japan, is implementing visitor restrictions to combat overtourism and preserve its cultural heritage from the Taisho period. The town, known for its picturesque snow-covered streets and resemblance to scenes from "Spirited Away," faces challenges such as congestion and complaints from locals about tourist behavior. Admission restrictions, including shuttle buses and timed tickets, were implemented from December 2024 to February 2025.

          <p>Katy Perry is facing a career slump following online criticism of her Blue Origin spaceflight and subsequent tour. After the spaceflight, Perry's reaction was widely mocked, and her tour received negative feedback for perceived cringeworthy dance moves. Music critics attribute Perry's struggles to her inability to evolve her pop star persona and her past association with producer Dr. Luke. Perry's recent single, Woman's World, also failed to resonate with critics and fans, contributing to what some see as a pattern of failed reinvention attempts, highlighting the challenges she faces in adapting to the evolving landscape of female pop stardom.</p>

Contradictory evidence, such as a running dryer, lack of blood, and the discovery of a packed bag, led detectives to believe Dan staged the scene. The medical examiner later changed the cause of death to asphyxiation after an expert found injuries on Kendy's body suggesting she was strangled before being shot. In April 2023, Dan was charged with murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>
