          <p>During a White House meeting intended to improve relations, President Trump surprised South African President Cyril Ramaphosa by presenting him with a video and claims about the persecution of white Afrikaner farmers in South Africa. Trump's presentation included widely discredited claims of a "white genocide," which Ramaphosa refuted, emphasizing that South Africa's government policy opposes such views. The discussion highlighted tensions between the two nations, particularly regarding land redistribution policies and the asylum granted to Afrikaners in the U.S. Ramaphosa sought to reassure Trump that South Africa is committed to racial reconciliation, pointing to white members of his delegation and emphasizing that crime affects all demographics in the country.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration faced criticism after attempting to deport eight migrants, some with serious criminal records, to third countries, including a flight potentially destined for South Sudan. A federal judge ruled that the administration "unquestionably" violated a court order by not allowing the detainees to contest their removal adequately. Despite DHS officials confirming a deportation flight, they declined to confirm its final destination, citing safety concerns. The judge ordered the government to retain custody of the deportees and provide them with "reasonable fear" interviews, highlighting the administration's controversial approach to immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Following a tornado that killed five people in St. Louis, Mayor Cara Spencer placed the cityâ€™s emergency manager on administrative leave due to the failure to activate tornado warning sirens. The city's emergency management agency did not sound the alarms, and a backup system at the Fire Department was broken. The mayor's office has since changed the protocol for siren activation, giving the Fire Department sole responsibility and ensuring the system is always staffed. This action comes after forecasts warned of severe weather, and the National Weather Service issued a tornado warning, highlighting critical failures in the city's emergency response system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Justice Department under the Trump administration is shifting priorities for a grant program that provides aid to local police departments, according to CBS News. The new guidance eliminates language that encouraged police agencies to seek federal money for initiatives to help "underserved populations," build trust in police, boost diversity in police departments and support community violence intervention. Instead, the administration lists "immigration and border security," "violent crime prevention" and "uplifting the image of the law enforcement profession" as programs that are priorities for the highly sought-after grants. This shift raises concerns about the future of community-focused policing programs and has drawn criticism from congressional Democrats.</p>

The judge's decision invalidated President Trump's executive order that declared USIP "unnecessary" and terminated its leadership and staff.

          <p>President Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, accusing his government of seizing land from white farmers without compensation, a claim Trump has repeatedly amplified. However, this confrontation highlights Trump's own use of eminent domain in the U.S., notably to construct the border wall. Trump's administration filed numerous lawsuits against landowners in Texas to secure land for the wall, even though many conservatives oppose such government land grabs. This juxtaposition reveals a contradiction in Trump's stance on land seizures, criticizing them abroad while employing similar tactics at home.</p>

          <p>President Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa engaged in a tense exchange at the White House over claims of white genocide in South Africa. Trump presented a video alleging violence against white South Africans, which Ramaphosa refuted, stating that it did not represent government policy. The meeting occurred amid tensions over the U.S. granting refugee status to white Afrikaners. Ramaphosa emphasized that crime affects all demographics in South Africa, while Trump insisted that white farmers were being targeted.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced its withdrawal from federal oversight plans for the Minneapolis Police Department, just before the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death. Officials and residents expressed dismay, citing the need for oversight to end what federal authorities described as a pattern of violent, racist, and unconstitutional practices. Minneapolis officials, however, stated their commitment to the reforms outlined in the agreement, despite the Trump administration's decision. The agreement aimed to overhaul police training, monitoring, and accountability.</p>

The man boarded a cargo vessel in the Taiwan Strait and disembarked in Kaohsiung, traveling undetected across Taiwan for over a month. He voluntarily turned himself in and was charged with violating Taiwan's Immigration Act, receiving a lenient sentence due to his self-surrender.
