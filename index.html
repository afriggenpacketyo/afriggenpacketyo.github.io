        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada has rescinded its controversial digital services tax, which was set to take effect and apply retroactively to large technology firms. The decision came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a halt to all trade discussions with Canada in protest of the 3% levy, which he described as discriminatory against American companies. Following the reversal, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed that trade negotiations have resumed, aiming to secure a comprehensive economic and security agreement. The tax was originally intended to address a gap where major tech companies earned significant revenue from Canadians without being taxed locally.</p>

          <p>The UK punk-rap duo Bob Vylan is facing condemnation and a police review after leading anti-Israel chants during their performance at the Glastonbury Festival. The group's singer, Bobby Vylan, repeatedly shouted "Death to the IDF" and led the crowd in chanting "Free Palestine," sparking outrage from political officials and festival organizers. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer denounced the act as "appalling hate speech," and the BBC has reportedly removed the performance from its streaming service. Glastonbury organizers issued a statement condemning the chants, stating they "crossed a line" and that there is no place for antisemitism or incitement to violence at the festival.</p>

          <p>At least two firefighters were killed and another person was injured in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, after being ambushed by a shooter while responding to a wildfire on Canfield Mountain. Law enforcement officials reported taking "sniper fire" from high-powered rifles during the incident, which prompted a large-scale response and a shelter-in-place order. A SWAT team later located a deceased man with a firearm nearby, believed to be the suspect, and subsequently lifted the order. Idaho Governor Brad Little described the incident as a "heinous direct assault," and authorities are investigating if the fire was intentionally set to lure first responders into the attack.</p>

          <p>The jury has begun deliberations in the murder trial of Erin Patterson, an Australian woman accused of killing three relatives with a poisoned beef Wellington. Prosecutors allege Patterson intentionally used toxic death cap mushrooms in the meal served in July 2023, which led to the deaths of her former in-laws and an aunt. A fourth guest, an uncle, fell critically ill but survived. The defense maintains that the poisoning was a tragic accident and that Patterson panicked, leading her to lie to investigators. The judge instructed the jury to base their verdict on the facts presented and not on emotion or moral judgment.</p>

          <p>Mexico is facing tropical weather systems on both its coasts, with Tropical Depression Barry making landfall and Tropical Storm Flossie forming in the Pacific. Barry, the second named storm of the Atlantic season, came ashore south of Tampico with sustained winds of 35 mph and is expected to bring heavy rainfall across several Mexican states. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Flossie formed off Mexico's southwest coast and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane while remaining offshore. Although Flossie is not expected to make landfall, it will likely cause significant rainfall in the coastal regions of Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Jalisco.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that Russia's muted response to the recent conflict between its ally Iran and Israel demonstrates its declining status as a global superpower. The author contends that Moscow's preoccupation with its protracted war in Ukraine has severely drained its military and economic resources, limiting its ability to support its international partners. Despite a strategic partnership with Iran, which has supplied Russia with drones and missiles, Moscow only offered verbal condemnation and mediation after U.S. and Israeli strikes. This failure to act decisively, the article suggests, is part of a broader pattern of strategic neglect that undermines Russia's credibility on the world stage.</p>

The Yellow Springs Police Department confirmed the sighting on social media, humorously naming the bear "Mosey" and advising residents that it is likely just looking for food and solitude. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) reiterated that black bears are typically shy and will avoid humans. To prevent encounters, ODNR advises residents to secure trash, take down bird feeders, and keep pet food indoors, while emphasizing that people should not approach or feed the animal.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is debating President Trump's major legislative package, which combines increased spending on border security and defense with cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. A new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add nearly $3.3 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade, creating challenges for its passage. Senate Republicans are advancing the bill through the budget reconciliation process, which requires only a simple majority and bypasses the need for Democratic support. The process is expected to culminate in a "vote-a-rama" with numerous amendments before a final vote on the controversial legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

The data reflects ongoing challenges for manufacturers, including a domestic price war, sluggish consumer demand, and the impact of higher U.S. tariffs.

          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more prevalent, a growing body of research indicates they are more likely to induce motion sickness than traditional combustion engine cars. Studies from researchers in China and Hong Kong point to the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly their regenerative braking systems. This technology, which converts kinetic energy back into battery power, can cause low-frequency deceleration that provokes queasiness and discomfort in passengers. The findings highlight an unexpected challenge for the automotive industry as it transitions to new energy, impacting passenger health and comfort in these increasingly popular vehicles.</p>

The threat was a direct response to Tillis's refusal to support the president's major spending and tax bill, citing concerns over its proposed Medicaid cuts. In his retirement statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and compromise in Washington, stating that leaders who demonstrate independent thinking are becoming an "endangered species." His departure will open up a key Senate seat in a state that has consistently voted Republican in recent presidential elections.</p>

          <p>The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, has stated that recent U.S. airstrikes caused "severe damage" to Iran's nuclear facilities but did not completely destroy them. Grossi emphasized that Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to rebuild its program if it chooses to do so. His assessment appears to contradict more optimistic claims from U.S. officials that the program was obliterated. Grossi also highlighted the urgent need for IAEA inspectors to regain access to Iranian sites to verify the status of its nuclear materials and activities, stressing that military action alone cannot definitively solve the issue.</p>

          <p>Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams has been forced to withdraw from the remainder of the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia after suffering a significant hamstring injury. Williams sustained the injury after scoring a try during the team's victory over Western Force in Perth. Head coach Andy Farrell described the injury as "worse than expected" and confirmed it would sideline the player for the medium to long term. Scotland's Ben White has been called up to the squad as a replacement, leaving flanker Jac Morgan as the only remaining Welsh player on the 38-man tour roster.</p>

          <p>The UK's official Covid-19 inquiry has started a new phase focused on the pandemic's devastating impact on the social care sector. Bereaved families and care staff are seeking answers regarding key government decisions, such as the rapid discharge of hospital patients into care homes without testing in early 2020, which is blamed for seeding the virus. The inquiry will also scrutinize issues like the use of "do not resuscitate" notices and restrictive visiting policies that isolated residents. Nearly 46,000 care home residents in England and Wales died with Covid, and this module aims to hold officials accountable and learn lessons for future crises.</p>

While homosexuality is not a crime in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan's government has adopted increasingly harsh rhetoric against the LGBTQ+ community, and human rights groups warn of a growing hostile environment.</p>

The prosecutor, identified by a pseudonym, alleges that after the assault, she was pressured into silence and later slandered by a colleague who spread false rumors. Despite the former chief prosecutor initially admitting to the charge, he has since recanted and pleaded not guilty, prolonging her legal battle. This case highlights the significant challenges and "secondary victimization" faced by survivors of sexual assault within Japan's hierarchical justice system.</p>

LISAs offer a 25% government bonus on savings for a first home or retirement, but early withdrawals for other reasons incur a charge that results in a 6.25% loss of the individual's original capital. The Treasury Committee report also criticized the product as overly complex and potentially unsuitable for those on benefits, as LISA savings can affect eligibility for Universal Credit.
