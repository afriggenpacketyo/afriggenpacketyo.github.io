          <p>A suspect identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman has been charged with first-degree murder and other felonies after allegedly attacking a pro-Israel demonstration in Boulder, Colorado, using a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary device. Eight people were hospitalized with burns, ranging in age from 52 to 88, with one in critical condition. Witnesses reported that Soliman yelled "Free Palestine" during the attack, leading the FBI to investigate the incident as a targeted act of terrorism, with FBI Director Kash Patel stating that officials were investigating the incident as a "targeted terror attack." The attack occurred during a Run for Their Lives walk, an event aimed at raising awareness about hostages in Gaza, and comes amid heightened violence and antisemitic incidents. The victims included four women and four men ranging in age from 52 to 88, police said, and President Donald Trump has been briefed on the attack, while Colorado Gov. Jared Polis condemned it as a heinous act of terror. Optimism is limited given the violent nature of the event and the motivations behind it.</p>

          <p>Former yokozuna Hakuho, a Mongolian-born sumo wrestler who achieved a record 45 top-division championships, will retire from the Japan Sumo Association on June 9. The association approved his retirement at an extraordinary board meeting in Tokyo, amid uncertainty surrounding the future of his Miyagino stable, which has been closed since April 2024 due to a scandal involving Hakuho's protege. Hakuho, now known as elder Miyagino, plans to return from Mongolia later this week and will hold a press conference on his retirement day. Hakuho won 1,187 matches, more than any other wrestler in sumo history, before retiring from competition in September 2021 and becoming a stablemaster the following July. The situation is unfortunate given the circumstances surrounding his stable, but the end of his career marks the end of an era.</p>

          <p>Six Bulgarian nationals have been sentenced to prison in London for their involvement in a Russian plot to kill investigative journalist Christo Grozev. The group, operating out of England for over two years, engaged in surveillance of Grozev and another journalist, Roman Dobrokhotov, as well as a U.S. military base in Germany and a former Russian law enforcement officer. The trial marks the first successful prosecution of Russian agents operating on British soil in recent history, but the Bulgarians seem to be only one part of a multiyear, multicountry operation to kill Grozev. The case highlights the ongoing threat posed by the Kremlin to silence its opponents abroad through various means, including kidnappings, poisonings, arson, and terrorist attacks, but the successful prosecution serves as a small victory.</p>

          <p>Federal funding cuts and uncertainty under the Trump administration are impacting domestic violence programs across the country, leading to facility closures and staff reductions. In Maine, a shelter for human trafficking victims had to temporarily close due to a leaking roof and broken boiler, issues the organization could not afford to fix due to financial instability. The director of the Office of Family Violence and Prevention Services was placed on administrative leave, and domestic violence organizations have experienced frequent changes in their Department of Justice contacts. This chaos is affecting local communities, as evidenced by the potential loss of a full-time domestic violence prosecutor in Lewiston, Maine, due to grant uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Despite repeated promises to prioritize Native Americans' health care, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is facing criticism as significant cuts to federal health programs disproportionately impact tribal nations. Navajo Nation leaders expressed concerns over the effects of these cuts, which include reduced funding for community health workers, vaccinations, and programs aimed at Native American youth interested in science and medicine. Tribal health officials report difficulties in obtaining technical support and funding for federally funded health projects due to staffing cuts. These actions are seen by some tribal leaders as a violation of treaties in which the U.S. pledged to provide for the health and welfare of tribes in exchange for their land.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have engineered a new type of rice, dubbed "tea rice," that is enriched with catechin, an antioxidant compound found in green tea. This innovation aims to provide the health benefits of tea, such as regulating blood pressure and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, without the side effects of caffeine. Catechins, which make up a significant portion of tea's dry weight, have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. The researchers believe that this new grain could offer a convenient and caffeine-free way to consume these beneficial compounds.</p>

          <p>Conservative Karol Nawrocki has won Poland's presidential election, narrowly defeating liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski.

The talks occur after Ukraine launched drone attacks on strategic bomber bases inside Russia, and Russia reported the collapse of railway bridges and derailment of trains in regions bordering Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Putin of sabotaging peace talks, while Trump has expressed frustration with both leaders.</p>

The redesign aims to allow planes to climb quicker during takeoff and descend more smoothly, reducing aviation's climate change impacts. The changes, the largest redesign of UK airspace since the 1950s, also intend to pave the way for new technologies like flying taxis.

          <p>Germany's former foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, is nominated to become the new president of the United Nations General Assembly for a one-year term in September. Baerbock's nomination followed the change in German government and was not without internal controversy, as Germany had initially planned to nominate diplomat Helga Schmid. During her time as foreign minister, Baerbock was known for her commitment to a "value-based foreign policy" and her outspokenness on human rights issues, but her comments sometimes led to diplomatic challenges. Despite the challenges, her new role offers a significant opportunity.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's promise to achieve peace in Ukraine within a day, progress remains elusive, with Russia and Ukraine entrenched in their positions. Trump has shown frustration with the process, hinting at a potential withdrawal of U.S. involvement if progress isn't made soon. While some experts caution that such a move could shift the balance of power to Russia, others suggest that reduced presidential engagement might not be detrimental. The article outlines the Trump administration's efforts, including high-level meetings and ceasefires, but notes the ongoing challenges in securing a lasting peace agreement.</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist backed by U.S. President Donald Trump, has won the Polish presidency in a close election, posing a challenge to the country's pro-EU government. Nawrocki's victory means he will succeed Andrzej Duda, wielding a critical veto over legislation and potentially hindering Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda. The election raises questions about Poland's alignment with Brussels and Kyiv, with Nawrocki taking a more critical stance toward Ukraine and its NATO aspirations.

          <p>Children attending schools near oil and gas operations in New Mexico are experiencing health problems, including headaches and nausea, due to pollution from nearby wells. At Lybrook Elementary School, many students miss classes due to these symptoms, which are linked to emissions from natural gas wells. An analysis of state and federal data revealed that many schools in New Mexico are located within a mile of active oil and gas wells, potentially exposing around 29,500 students to harmful fumes. While the oil and gas industry provides economic benefits to the state, the health costs for students raise concerns about their well-being and academic performance.</p>
