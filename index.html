            <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already convicted of murdering her two children, is currently on trial in Arizona for conspiring to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow. Daybell is representing herself in the trial, arguing that her brother's shooting of Vallow was an act of self-defense. Prosecutors contend that the shooting was a premeditated act to obtain Vallow's $1 million life insurance policy and to enable Daybell's relationship with Chad Daybell. The prosecution highlighted text messages and religious beliefs as motives for the alleged conspiracy, arguing that Daybell and her brother used twisted religious beliefs to justify the murder. The jury is currently deliberating the verdict. Optimism score is 60.</p>

            <p>US trade officials have finalized tariff levels on solar cells and panels imported from Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. This decision concludes a year-long trade case initiated by American manufacturers who allege that overseas competitors are flooding the market with unfairly cheap goods. The Commerce Department calculated dumping duties ranging from 6.1% to 271.28% and countervailing duties between 14.64% and 3,403.96%, depending on the company and country. The case was brought by companies seeking to protect their investments in US solar manufacturing, arguing that Chinese companies with factories in Southeast Asia are undercutting American goods through unfair pricing and subsidies.</p>

Hilton aims to end what he describes as one-party rule in California and restore the state's status as a land of opportunity. He faces an uphill battle in a state that has become increasingly liberal, but he hopes to capitalize on frustrations over issues such as crime, inflation, and the cost of living.

            <p>A federal court in Denver is hearing a case challenging the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants, particularly Venezuelans. Immigrant rights groups argue that the administration is providing insufficient notice to those facing deportation, violating their due process rights. The ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network are arguing that 24 hours' notice is not reasonable for individuals detained and lacking legal representation. The case raises concerns about the legal rights of migrants and the potential for abuse of the Alien Enemies Act, which was last invoked during World War II.</p>

Cramer asserts that the government is biased against these companies, believing Nvidia isn't doing enough to stop China from obtaining its products and that Apple should manufacture in the US. He suggests that the White House prioritizes cutting off China over advancing American interests, creating uncertainty and making it difficult for investors to bet on these companies. Cramer believes the administration could potentially roll back punitive policies if the situation worsens, but the future remains unpredictable.</p>

            <p>UCLA's football program is facing criticism for hiring Nico Iamaleava, a quarterback who recently left Tennessee amid disputes over his name, image, and likeness (NIL) compensation.

Critics argue that UCLA's decision to bring in Iamaleava undermines their existing quarterback, Joey Aguilar, who transferred to UCLA in December and spent the spring establishing himself as the team's offensive leader. The situation raises ethical questions about player accountability and the impact of NIL deals on team dynamics.</p>
