        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ron Howard’s new film, “Eden,” chronicles the true story of a group of disenchanted Europeans who, in the 1930s, sought to establish a utopian society on a remote Galapagos island. The article details how this ambitious experiment quickly devolved into intense power struggles and ultimately, murder, providing a lurid and unvarnished look at human nature. Starring Jude Law and Sydney Sweeney, the film is described as an entertaining yet unsettling portrayal of mismatched survivalists, paced like a compelling beach read. It critically examines the fragility of human ideals when confronted with the harsh realities of isolation and conflicting personalities, proving that even paradise can breed conflict. The movie serves as a stark reminder of the complexities inherent in creating a perfect society.</p>

          <h2>Lawmakers Greene and Sanders Advocate for Ending Gaza Famine</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US lawmakers Marjorie Taylor Greene and Bernie Sanders have forged an unexpected bipartisan alliance, both publicly urging the United States to take action to end the deepening famine in Gaza. Senator Sanders criticized President Trump's perceived inaction, while Representative Greene, departing from many of her Republican colleagues, described the humanitarian crisis as a genocide and questioned the continued flow of US taxpayer dollars to Israel's military. This rare convergence of political voices follows a stark UN-backed report that declared a "man-made" famine in parts of Gaza, particularly Gaza City, a finding that Israeli authorities have vehemently rejected as biased. The article underscores the mounting domestic and international pressure on the US administration to address the severe and rapidly spreading starvation crisis in the region, highlighting the moral imperative to intervene.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Syrian government has announced the postponement of parliamentary elections in the provinces of Sweida, Hasaka, and Raqqa, citing the need for a "safe environment." Sweida is experiencing ongoing tensions between Druze militias and Sunni Bedouin tribes, while Hasaka and parts of Raqqa remain under the control of Kurdish-led forces, who are in a tense standoff with the new Islamist government. This delay marks a significant challenge for President Ahmed al-Sharaa's administration, which recently dissolved the existing parliament and approved an interim constitution. Critics argue this new constitution concentrates excessive power in his hands and fails to adequately represent Syria's diverse ethnic and religious groups, raising concerns about the country's political transition.</p>

          <h2>EU Faces Pressure to Respond to Escalating Serbian Protests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 14:26:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Serbia is grappling with escalating anti-corruption protests, marked by increasing police violence and arrests, prompting calls for a more robust European Union response. While the EU has issued statements urging de-escalation and investigations into excessive force, many critics, including EU lawmakers, argue this stance is too soft. The article suggests the EU's strategic interests, such as access to Serbia's lithium reserves and concerns about its ties with Russia, may be influencing a lenient approach. This "strategy of appeasement" is seen by some as undermining the EU's fundamental values and eroding Serbian public trust in accession. Experts propose economic incentives or fund cuts as potential leverage to compel reforms.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has expanded an order, effectively blocking the Trump administration from withholding federal funding from dozens of "sanctuary" cities and counties, including major hubs like Los Angeles and Chicago. This ruling builds on an earlier decision that found President Trump's attempts to freeze funds for jurisdictions limiting cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to be unconstitutional. The administration contends that sanctuary policies impede federal law enforcement and compromise public safety. Conversely, the affected cities argue these policies are an abuse of power, violating the Tenth Amendment, and are crucial for building trust between local police and immigrant communities. The article underscores the ongoing legal and constitutional battle over immigration enforcement and local autonomy.</p>

          <p>FBI agents have reportedly raided the Bethesda, Maryland, home and Washington D.C. office of former National Security Adviser John Bolton. The raids are linked to a probe concerning allegations that Bolton sent classified documents to his family from a private email server while serving in the White House. This development exacerbates Bolton's already difficult relationship with President Trump, who publicly disparaged him. While some reports connect the probe to his memoir, a senior US official indicated it is a separate investigation. The article highlights the renewed focus on classified information handling, a topic Bolton himself had previously criticized Trump for.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda, according to his attorneys, who accuse the government of using this threat to coerce him into a plea deal. Abrego Garcia, previously wrongfully deported to El Salvador, declined an offer for deportation to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges and remaining in jail. His lawyers argue that this threat of deportation to Uganda, where his safety would be jeopardized, constitutes vindictive and selective prosecution.

          <p>Turkey's First Lady Emine Erdogan has made a public appeal to Melania Trump, urging her to advocate for children suffering in Israel's war in Gaza. Erdogan praised Trump's past support for Ukrainian children and requested she extend this advocacy to Palestinian children, describing Gaza as a "children's cemetery." In a letter, Erdogan encouraged Trump to directly appeal to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the humanitarian crisis. This diplomatic effort follows a UN-backed report confirming famine in Gaza City, which projects that malnutrition will threaten the lives of 132,000 children under five.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's "purge" within national security continues, with Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard revoking security clearances for 37 former and current intelligence officials, some with expertise in Russian election interference. This action follows the FBI raid on former National Security Adviser John Bolton's home, further escalating tensions. Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic discussed these developments, with some observers interpreting them as politically motivated retribution rather than an effort to de-politicize the intelligence community.

The article highlights the "historic event" and the role of luck in preventing disaster, as the popular tourist destination was empty at the time.

Billions of dollars are flowing into speculative niche strategies like single-stock, leveraged, or inverse ETFs, which are predominantly owned by retail investors. The article highlights that these volatile products, particularly yield-focused ones, carry significant risks and could become "train wrecks" if underlying stocks falter.

While some advocate for a slower approach, experts and advocates warn that ending care can severely harm patients' mental health.
