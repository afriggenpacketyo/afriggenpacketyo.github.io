He transitioned from deckhand to superyacht captain over a decade, even appearing on "Below Deck." Ortega now mentors aspiring yachties through his "Superyacht Sunday School," emphasizing the willingness to learn and a customer service personality over prior boating experience. He highlights the significant earning potential, especially with tips, and lower expenses while at sea, but cautions against entering solely for money due to the demanding lifestyle.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $815 million for Wednesday night's drawing, making it the seventh largest in the game's history. This increase follows Monday night's drawing, which saw no winning tickets for the $750 million grand prize. A single winner could choose between a lump sum cash payment of $367.9 million before taxes or an annuity paid over 30 years. The odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million, and tickets cost $2 in 45 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>

          <p>Approximately 10 million YouTube TV subscribers could lose access to Fox News, Fox Business, and Fox sports channels, including local affiliates, due to an ongoing fee dispute. The Google-owned service notified customers that channels might be dropped as early as Wednesday if a new distribution agreement is not reached, potentially affecting college football and NFL season broadcasts. YouTube claims Fox is demanding payments "far higher" than comparable content partners, while Fox accuses Google of exploiting its "outsized influence." This dispute highlights increasing tensions between programmers and pay-TV providers over rising content costs, particularly for sports rights.</p>

          <p>California Republicans have filed an emergency petition with the state Supreme Court, seeking to block a November special election on Governor Gavin Newsom's redistricting plan, Proposition 50. The measure, signed into law last week, aims to redraw congressional maps to favor Democrats, a move framed as a response to Texas Republicans' similar actions. Opponents argue the plan violates the state constitution by undermining an independent redistricting commission, bypassing a public review period, and combining multiple subjects into one ballot question. The legal challenge underscores the contentious battle over electoral maps and partisan power in the state.</p>

U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung also discussed new energy cooperation, including a partnership to develop Alaska's natural gas reserves. These announcements follow a July trade deal that reduced U.S. tariffs on South Korean exports, strengthening economic ties between the two nations. The leaders also touched on regional security and the potential for future talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared he had fired Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, citing allegations of false statements on mortgage applications, which the Department of Justice is investigating. Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, immediately countered that Trump lacks the legal authority to dismiss her "for cause" and stated she would not resign. This unprecedented move escalates Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence, which he has criticized for not cutting interest rates. Legal experts anticipate a challenge to the firing in federal court, potentially reshaping the Fed's governing board.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists claim a significant breakthrough in making airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft virtually invisible to adversaries. These vital command nodes, typically vulnerable due to their powerful radar emissions, can now employ a new frequency diverse array (FDA) technology. This method assigns each antenna a minutely varied frequency, making the signal chaotic and obscuring its directional origin from a distance. This innovation represents a "paradigm shift" from traditional phased array radars, potentially enhancing the survivability and operational effectiveness of these high-value military assets.</p>

          <p>Attendees at this year's Burning Man event in Nevada's Black Rock Desert are encountering challenging weather conditions, including dust, wind, and a forecast of thunderstorms and potential hail for the next few days. While the storms haven't fully reached the event site, meteorologists predict slow-moving systems capable of producing significant rain, which could also help dampen the fine desert dust. Despite some social media videos showing participants battling high winds and dust clouds, these weather patterns are considered relatively normal for the region during monsoon season. Organizers expect around 80,000 people at the event, which runs until next Monday.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump expressed his hope to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, possibly this year, aiming to revive stalled nuclear diplomacy during an Oval Office meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung. Trump praised his relationship with Kim and suggested he was the only one who could resolve the decades-old standoff. During the meeting, Trump also controversially raised the prospect of the U.S. taking ownership of South Korean land currently hosting a U.S. military base, an idea likely to provoke strong reactions. These remarks come amid ongoing wrangling over military spending and trade details between the U.S. and South Korea.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to impose "substantial" new tariffs and restrict U.S. chip exports on countries that maintain digital services taxes (DSTs), which he claims discriminate against American technology companies. Trump stated on Truth Social that these taxes, implemented by dozens of nations, are designed to harm U.S. tech giants like Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon. He warned that unless these discriminatory actions are removed, the U.S. would institute export restrictions on highly protected technology and chips. Trump has previously used such threats to pressure trade partners, successfully compelling Canada to rescind its digital tax earlier this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in education funding for U.S. schools, including allocations for after-school programs, teacher training, and English-language learner support. This decision follows a multi-state lawsuit led by California's attorney general, which accused the administration of illegally withholding congressionally-allocated funds. The White House had previously indicated a review found instances of federal education money being "grossly misused to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda." The delayed funds, frozen weeks before the school year, had created uncertainty for programs benefiting approximately 1.4 million children, predominantly from low-income families.</p>

          <p>The Pickett Fire, the largest wildfire in the San Francisco Bay Area this year, is threatening vineyards in Northern California and raising concerns about smoke damage to wine grapes. While fire crews have kept homes and businesses from burning, winery owner Chris Jambois, who lost two vintages to smoke from the 2020 Glass Fire, fears a repeat. Smoke taint can render grapes unusable, leading to significant economic losses for vineyards. The Pickett Fire, burning nearly 7,000 acres, follows a similar path to the destructive Glass Fire. This situation adds to the challenges faced by the region's wine industry, which is grappling with increasingly frequent wildfires.</p>

His story highlights the administration's hardline agenda, including increased deportations and raids, and challenges to due process. Despite his 2019 "withholding of removal" order based on fear of persecution, he was detained and deported, then re-detained upon return, symbolizing the complex and often controversial nature of current immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Dr. Xand van Tulleken, a medical doctor and BBC presenter, challenges conventional wisdom about posture, asserting that rigidly sitting "up straight" can be detrimental. He proposes three dynamic rules for better back health: prioritize movement, build strength, and adopt a positive mindset. Instead of static positions, regular breaks, stretching, and varied movements are crucial. Strengthening core and back muscles through simple exercises like pilates or yoga supports the body naturally. Furthermore, recognizing the emotional and psychological links to pain, such as stress from work, is essential for holistic back care, suggesting that easing one's schedule can be as important as physical adjustments.</p>
