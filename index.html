          <p>A 52-year-old man, Eric Slate, died from blunt force injuries sustained within a kangaroo and wallaby enclosure at 5 Star Farm, a South Carolina petting zoo. Slate, a relative of the owner, reportedly had a history of entering the enclosure to engage in rough play with one of the animals. The animal involved in the fatal encounter has not been euthanized, and the investigation is ongoing with an autopsy ordered. The petting zoo features various animals, and authorities have assured the public that all animals are accounted for and pose no risk to the community.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced its intention to release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander as a gesture to advance ceasefire negotiations with Israel. This decision precedes President Trump's visit to the Middle East and aims to facilitate humanitarian aid entry into Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade for 70 days. Alexander, captured during the October 7, 2023, attack, is believed to be the last living American hostage held in Gaza. The release requires a temporary halt to Israeli military activity during the handover, with ongoing talks between Hamas and mediators to finalize the process.</p>

          <p>The Argentine Supreme Court discovered 83 boxes of Nazi materials confiscated during World War II in its basement, originally sent from the German embassy in Tokyo in 1941. Argentine authorities seized the shipment due to concerns about its potential impact on Argentina's neutrality in the war. The boxes contained postcards, photographs, Nazi propaganda, and thousands of notebooks belonging to the Nazi party. The court has transferred the boxes to a secure room and invited the Holocaust Museum in Buenos Aires to assist with preservation and analysis to uncover more information about the Holocaust, including possible international financing networks.</p>

          <p>CVS Caremark will exclude Zepbound from its formulary in July, favoring Wegovy despite research indicating Zepbound results in greater weight loss. This decision stems from secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers aimed at lowering drug prices for employers, potentially limiting patient access to the most effective treatments. Patients like Ellen Davis, who experienced significant weight loss and improved health on Zepbound, face the prospect of switching to a less effective medication. While Caremark claims the decision will lower drug prices by 10-15%, doctors prefer Zepbound for many patients, citing its superior weight loss results.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has granted refugee status to 49 white South Africans, relocating them to the United States under a new program citing racial discrimination. This decision has drawn criticism from refugee groups who question prioritizing this group over those fleeing war and natural disasters. The Trump administration claims the South African government is pursuing racist policies against Afrikaners, allegations South Africa denies. The South African government asserts Afrikaners are among the most economically privileged and that there is no justification for their relocation, though they respect their freedom of choice.</p>

          <p>A head-to-head trial comparing weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy has revealed that Mounjaro is more effective. The trial showed that Mounjaro led to a 20% weight reduction after 72 weeks, compared to 14% with Wegovy. While both drugs resulted in substantial weight loss, researchers suggest Mounjaro may be more beneficial for individuals needing to lose more weight. Both drugs work by mimicking hormones that induce feelings of fullness, but Mounjaro impacts two hormones, while Wegovy affects only one, explaining the difference in effectiveness. The study was funded by Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of Mounjaro.</p>

          <p>Jeanine Pirro, a Fox News personality and former judge, has been selected to replace Edward Martin as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia after Martin's nomination collapsed. Martin, a "Stop the Steal" advocate, faced criticism for his views on the January 6th Capitol riot and his controversial social media posts. While some Democrats have criticized Pirro's selection due to her past promotion of conspiracy theories, others note that she does not raise the same immediate red flags as Martin. Pirro will oversee a broad range of cases, from federal corruption to local criminal prosecutions in D.C. Superior Court.</p>

His sudden arrest and extradition to The Hague has sharply divided the Philippines, with some polls showing majority support for the international investigation.

Duterte's camp is using his case as a campaign tool, rallying supporters with calls to bring him home.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has expressed reservations about cutting the consumption tax to combat inflation, citing concerns about the potential strain on state finances. Senior officials from his administration and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have dismissed the idea as the coalition government prepares an economic package ahead of the House of Councillors election this summer. The current consumption tax is 8% for food and beverages and 10% for other items. This stance highlights the government's cautious approach to fiscal policy amidst ongoing economic challenges.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. is projected to suffer the largest losses from President Trump’s trade war, estimating a $1.2 billion profit drop over two months due to tariffs. This impact reflects Toyota's decision to maintain sticker prices and production volumes in the U.S. amid ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S. and Japan. The company relies on imports of key vehicle parts and models, making it vulnerable to increased duties. Other automakers, such as General Motors and Ford, also anticipate significant financial hits from the tariffs.

          <p>The United States has temporarily suspended imports of live cattle from Mexico through southern border ports to reassess the joint strategy against the screwworm pest. The screwworm, a potentially fatal parasite, was recently detected in farms as far north as Oaxaca and Veracruz. U.S. officials cited an "unacceptable northward advancement" of the screwworm as the reason for the suspension, emphasizing the need to protect animals and the nation's food supply. Mexico's Agriculture Secretary expressed disagreement but remained confident in reaching an agreement soon. The U.S. had previously restricted Mexican cattle shipments in November but lifted the ban in February.</p>

          <p>The Argentine Supreme Court discovered documents associated with the Nazi regime among its archives, including propaganda material used to spread Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina during World War II. The material was found while preparing for a museum with historical documents. The boxes are believed to be related to the arrival of 83 packages in Buenos Aires in 1941, sent by the German embassy in Tokyo. President of the Supreme Court Horacio Rosatti has ordered the preservation and analysis of the material.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to sign an executive order directing the Department of Health and Human Services to tie Medicare payments for certain medications to the lowest price paid by other countries. This "most favored nation's policy" aims to lower U.S. drug costs, a long-standing issue across party lines. The proposal, which targets drugs administered in doctor's offices, faces opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it will hurt profits and innovation. A similar effort by Trump during his first term was blocked by a court order.</p>

The technology bypasses spinal cord injuries, sending signals wirelessly from the brain to the intact part of the spinal cord. Spinal cord stimulators may also show promise in helping people with Parkinson's Disease. This early clinical trial helping people regain a certain amount of mobility, which for people in later stages of Parkinson's can be a huge issue. The goal is to offer a menu of therapies to address various issues, such as restoring hand function, normalizing blood pressure, and improving incontinence and sexual function.</p>
