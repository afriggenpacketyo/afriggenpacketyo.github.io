          <p>Russia and Ukraine completed a large prisoner exchange, a rare moment of cooperation amidst ongoing conflict.

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy urged Western partners to increase sanctions on Russia, emphasizing the need for strong international pressure to stop the ongoing violence, while U.S. President Trump stated he was considering further sanctions against Russia after the attacks.</p>

          <p>Research into brain injuries among veterans could change the way veterans are treated and trained. Dr. Daniel Perl discovered microscopic scarring in the brains of service members and veterans who died by suicide. Unlike earlier findings, some of these cases were not linked to major bombings, leading to further investigation into the impact of low-level blasts. Studies are being planned to explore the effects of cumulative, low-level blasts on brain structure and function, potentially leading to improved diagnosis and treatment for veterans suffering from invisible brain injuries.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, resulted in the deaths of at least seven children from the al-Najjar family, with two more missing and presumed dead. The strike occurred near a structure storing car tires, causing a fire that spread to the family's home. The Israeli military stated that it had struck suspects in the area but was checking if uninvolved civilians were harmed. The incident is part of a renewed round of fighting between Israel and Hamas, contributing to the already immense civilian toll in Gaza.</p>
