          <p>The body of Arizona hiker Hannah Moody was discovered off-trail in the McDowell Sonoran Preserve in Scottsdale, approximately 16 hours after she was reported missing by concerned friends. Scottsdale police have initiated an investigation into Moody's death, noting no immediate indications of foul play or trauma. Search efforts, involving officers on foot, bicycles, drones, and the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, were suspended overnight and resumed in the morning, ultimately leading to the discovery of Moody's body about 600 yards from the Gateway Trailhead. The Maricopa County medical examiner's office will determine the cause of death as authorities continue their investigation.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of workers were temporarily unable to exit the Kloof gold mine near Johannesburg following a 'shaft incident' involving a rock winder skip door that opened at a loading point, impacting multiple levels below. Sibanye-Stillwater, the mining company, reported that all 260 employees were accounted for and safe, provided with food while safety procedures were implemented. A detailed risk assessment led to the decision to keep employees at the sub-shaft station to avoid long-distance walking until it was safe to proceed to the surface. The company expected to bring all affected employees to the surface later in the day after completing safety and shaft examinations.</p>

          <p>A Florida court has ordered Genaro Garcia Luna, a former Mexican security chief convicted of drug trafficking, and his wife to pay over $2.4 billion to Mexico for corruption and money laundering involving public contracts. Garcia Luna, who served as Mexico's secretary of public security, was previously convicted in the U.S. of accepting millions in bribes from the Sinaloa Cartel to facilitate cocaine smuggling. The court's award is three times the amount initially sought by the Mexican government, with Garcia Luna ordered to pay nearly $749 million and his wife Linda Cristina Pereyra to pay $1.74 billion. Garcia Luna is currently serving a 38-year prison sentence in the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's energy regulator, Ofgem, announced a decrease in the energy price cap effective July, leading to an average monthly saving of Â£11 for typical gas and electricity bills. This is the first price drop in a year, potentially saving households around Â£129 annually; however, prices remain significantly higher than historical levels. Ofgem encourages consumers to shop for fixed-rate deals, which could yield annual savings of up to Â£200, though this excludes those already on fixed tariffs. The regulator is also considering changes to standing charges, as many households face significant debt to energy suppliers.</p>

Authorities neutralized 650 domains and seized â‚¬3.5 million in cryptocurrency, focusing on malware variants like Bumblebee and Qakbot.

Hotze's Christian healthcare firm, Braidwood Management, objects to the Affordable Care Act's requirement to cover pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), an HIV prevention medication, claiming it violates their religious beliefs by supporting 'sexual promiscuity'. If the Supreme Court sides with Braidwood, it could lead to widespread loss of access to free preventative healthcare, threatening coverage for services like cancer screenings, contraception, and vaccinations.

          <p>President Trump has repeatedly claimed that military recruitment is at a 30-year high due to his leadership, but military records indicate that enlistments began rebounding before his reelection. While recruitment numbers have increased, experts attribute this to Biden-era programs like the Army's Future Soldier Prep Course and the Navy's Future Sailor Prep Course. These programs help candidates meet enlistment requirements, as over 70% of American youths don't meet the qualifications for military service. Trump also falsely claimed that enlistments fell to record lows during President Biden's last year in office.</p>

While acknowledging Biden's policy missteps, the author contends that the main issue was his inability to communicate effectively, and that the media prioritized drama over Biden's perceived boring persona.</p>

Critics argue it's a tax shelter for the wealthy, as donors could profit through capital gains tax avoidance, while supporters say it provides families with greater educational choice.
