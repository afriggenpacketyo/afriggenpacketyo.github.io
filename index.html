          <p>The German parliament is set to vote on a draft budget for 2025 that includes a significant increase in government spending, facilitated by easing the country's debt brake. Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil's plan involves taking on new debt to fund infrastructure repairs, a stimulus package for the economy, and record military investments. The defense budget is projected to more than double by 2029, reaching ‚Ç¨152.8 billion, which aligns with Germany's growing security concerns due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and pressure from the U.S. to increase military spending. The vote has been delayed due to national elections and a split between political parties over budget spending, with final approval expected in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire, Israel accused Iran of violating the agreement by launching missiles, prompting a vow to "respond with force." Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz instructed the IDF to continue attacking Tehran to thwart regime targets and terrorist infrastructures. Iranian officials denied the claims, stating they did not launch missiles after the ceasefire took effect. The conflict, which began on June 13 with Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, has resulted in nearly 1,000 deaths, and the U.S. has taken military action against Iran, raising fears of a wider war.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republicans are proposing a tax deduction of up to $10,000 on annual interest for new auto loans, as part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," but the structure of the tax break would largely benefit buyers of expensive vehicles. According to Cox Automotive, it would take a loan of roughly $112,000 to use up the full deduction, implying a vehicle purchase price of about $130,000. The tax break is temporary and ends after 2028, and is reduced once an individual's annual income exceeds $100,000, or $200,000 for married couples, making it unlikely that most households would claim the full benefit. Qualifying cars must also receive final assembly in the U.S., further limiting the potential roster of vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics argue that these efforts could lead to the creation of surveillance tools and the erosion of privacy protections, with the potential to impact all Americans.</p>
