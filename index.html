          <p>China nominated Zou Jiayi, a former vice-minister of finance, to succeed Jin Liqun as president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).

Her election is highly likely given China's significant voting share in the AIIB, a key component of China's Belt and Road Initiative.</p>
