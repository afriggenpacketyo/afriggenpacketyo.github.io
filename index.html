        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lloyds Banking Group is increasing its provision for compensating customers who were sold car finance with hidden commission payments. The total fund now stands at nearly £2 billion, reflecting a higher-than-expected number of eligible claims. This follows a proposal from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) which could see lenders pay out over £8 billion in total for unfair deals made between 2007 and 2024. The scale of this issue is significant, though still less than the massive PPI scandal that previously cost Lloyds £22 billion.</p>

          <p>Hamas has released the first seven of the final surviving Israeli hostages as part of a ceasefire agreement reportedly brokered with assistance from U.S. President Donald Trump. The exchange, facilitated by the Red Cross in Gaza, is the first step in a deal that also includes Israel freeing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The release coincides with a high-stakes summit in Egypt attended by world leaders, including Trump, aimed at establishing a lasting peace and rebuilding Gaza after a two-year conflict. Iraqi Prime Minister Al-Sudani praised the U.S. initiative, expressing hope for a sustainable truce.</p>

          <p>18-year-old darts sensation Luke Littler has won his first World Grand Prix title, defeating world champion Luke Humphries with a decisive 6-1 victory in the final. This win marks Littler's seventh major PDC televised title and significantly closes the prize money gap between him and the world number one ranking, currently held by Humphries. Despite having a lower average score in the final, Littler's clinical finishing in crucial deciding legs secured him the £120,000 prize. The victory continues the remarkable rise of the young player who is now putting immense pressure on his rival for the top spot.</p>

Simultaneously, states from the Carolinas to New York are under emergency declarations due to the nor'easter, which is causing heavy rain, coastal flooding, and high winds.

          <p>The presidency of Madagascar has announced that an illegal attempt to seize power is underway, as more military units join youth-led protests against President Andry Rajoelina. An elite army unit, CAPSAT, has urged soldiers to back the demonstrators and claimed command over the country's security operations, appointing a new army chief. The protests, which began over two weeks ago due to shortages of water and electricity, have escalated into calls for the president to resign. With the president's whereabouts unknown, the situation remains tense as the African Union calls for calm and restraint.</p>

          <p>Across Israel, families and communities have erupted in celebration and tears of joy as Hamas began releasing the final group of living hostages held in Gaza for over two years. The article focuses on the family of Alon Ohel, who gathered with hundreds in their small village to watch the release, celebrating with cheers and the blowing of traditional horns. Ohel, a musician, had become a symbol of the hostage crisis, with pianos placed in his honor across the country. The emotional release marks a significant moment for a nation that has been deeply affected by the plight of the captives since the October 7, 2023 attack.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has arrived in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, for an international summit to formalize a Gaza peace plan, where he is expected to credit U.S. President Donald Trump's role in brokering the deal. However, the UK's diplomatic involvement has been questioned, with an Israeli official stating that recent UK actions, like recognizing Palestinian statehood, had emboldened Hamas rather than helped negotiations. The summit, co-led by Trump and Egyptian President al-Sisi, aims to secure a lasting ceasefire and humanitarian aid for Gaza after two years of conflict. The event highlights the complex international diplomacy surrounding the resolution of the war.</p>

          <p>New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye is showing signs of being the franchise's long-awaited successor to Tom Brady, delivering impressive performances early in his second season. After a standout road win against Buffalo, Maye led the team to another victory over the New Orleans Saints, throwing for 261 yards and three touchdowns without any turnovers. His development has been rapid, showcasing improved composure, decision-making, and a significant reduction in risky plays compared to his rookie year. Now considered a potential MVP candidate, Maye's accelerated growth has made the Patriots contenders again, ending their post-Brady search for a star quarterback.</p>

Despite these efforts, challenges remain, as many young people feel the EU is disconnected from their key concerns like housing and employment.

The move is symbolic, reinforcing Beijing's strategy to reduce its dependence on American technology across various sectors.

          <p>Krone, a major European farm machinery company, has been forced to suspend its exports of large equipment to the United States due to newly imposed and complex tariffs on steel derivative products. These tariffs, part of a list of 407 specific items, require an unprecedented level of bureaucratic certification for the origin and value of every steel component, which the company finds nearly impossible to provide. The issue highlights the unexpected and challenging consequences of U.S. trade policies, which are impacting hundreds of products beyond the scope of widely publicized blanket tariffs. The company is now sending a smaller "test container" to see if its paperwork can satisfy U.S. customs.</p>

Badenoch accuses the government of weakness towards Beijing and has raised questions about the involvement of the Prime Minister's national security advisor, Jonathan Powell.

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has cautioned UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves against implementing "directionless tinkering and half-baked fixes" to raise government revenue in the upcoming Budget. With pressure mounting to meet self-imposed fiscal rules, the IFS warns that some potential tax rises could be economically harmful and instead urges broader, principled reforms. The think tank suggests overhauling property taxes, such as council tax and stamp duty, to create a fairer and more growth-friendly system. This advice comes as the Labour government seeks to raise significant funds without breaking its manifesto promise not to increase income tax, National Insurance, or VAT.</p>

The crackdown on the Zion Church, including its founder Jin Mingri, is seen by Christian groups as the most extensive persecution against the faith in China in decades. The Chinese Communist Party exercises tight control over religion, and this move is viewed as part of a broader campaign under President Xi Jinping to suppress religious groups that operate outside state-sanctioned bodies.

          <p>Former England rugby centre Luther Burrell claims that his career was effectively ended after he publicly exposed the racism he experienced within the sport. In 2022, Burrell described racism as "rife" in rugby, detailing incidents of discriminatory "banter" and being called a "slave" by a teammate. Since making these revelations, the 34-year-old has not been offered a professional contract, which he directly attributes to his decision to speak out. An official report later found his claims to be credible, prompting the Rugby Football Union to implement new inclusion and diversity initiatives, but Burrell believes his personal sacrifice was the price for bringing the issue to light.</p>

          <p>Contrary to political claims that foreign countries would pay for U.S. import tariffs, early data and academic studies indicate that American companies and consumers are bearing the primary financial burden. Research shows that U.S. firms are absorbing most of the cost, passing some of it on to consumers through higher prices on imported goods. Foreign exporters have not significantly lowered their prices to absorb the tariffs, meaning the duties are effectively paid by the U.S. importers. This economic reality is creating upward pressure on inflation and complicating the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has drawn criticism for a social media post in which he referred to the Watergate scandal as an "illegal hoax." In the post, which was primarily aimed at attacking Senator Adam Schiff, Trump claimed his own impeachment over Ukraine was a bigger hoax than the scandal that led to President Richard Nixon's resignation. Critics quickly pointed out that the Watergate scandal was a well-documented series of crimes, not a hoax. The comment is being viewed as another example of the former president attempting to rewrite U.S. history to minimize his own political and legal challenges.</p>
