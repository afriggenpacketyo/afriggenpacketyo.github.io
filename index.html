          <p>Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection again, marking its second such filing within a year. This move follows a previous restructuring in March that failed to establish a stable financial footing for the budget carrier. The airline's leadership acknowledged that the initial effort, which focused on reducing debt, was insufficient and that more comprehensive measures are now necessary to secure the company's future. Consequently, Spirit is re-evaluating its operations, including its aircraft fleet and overall market presence, to achieve long-term viability.</p>

          <p>In response to a Senate probe and growing safety concerns, Meta is implementing temporary changes to its AI chatbots for teenage users. The company is training the AI to avoid generating responses on sensitive topics like self-harm and to prevent inappropriate romantic conversations, instead directing teens to expert resources. This action follows a report about the chatbots engaging in "sensual" conversations with minors, which prompted an investigation by Senator Josh Hawley. Advocacy groups like Common Sense Media have criticized the platform's safety, urging a complete rebuild.</p>

          <p>Missouri Governor Mike Kehoe is contemplating calling a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional districts. This consideration comes after former President Donald Trump publicly urged Republican-led states to create maps that are more favorable to GOP candidates for the upcoming midterm elections. The proposed changes in Missouri aim to alter the partisan composition of the 5th District, potentially giving Republicans an additional seat in the U.S. House. Democrats have criticized the potential move as a partisan effort to rig elections.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has revised its guidance for the next round of COVID-19 vaccines, restricting their availability to specific high-risk groups. Unlike previous rollouts where vaccines were accessible to anyone aged six months and older, the updated shots will now be limited to individuals aged 65 or older and those with underlying health conditions that put them at risk for serious complications. This policy shift marks a significant change in the nation's public health strategy for managing the virus, moving from broad availability to a more targeted approach.</p>

          <p>With the 2026 midterm elections approaching, the landscape for control of the U.S. Senate is beginning to take shape. Democrats will defend 13 seats while Republicans defend 24, creating a challenging map for Democrats who need to flip four seats to secure a majority. Key contests are emerging in states like North Carolina, where an open seat is expected to draw massive spending, and Georgia, where incumbent Senator Jon Ossoff faces a tough reelection battle. Retirements and contentious primaries in other states are also setting the stage for a high-stakes election cycle.</p>

CEO Max Levchin highlighted strong consumer transaction frequency and overall business momentum, driven by key partnerships with major retailers like Shopify and Amazon, which helped offset the recent loss of Walmart as a client.

          <h2>U.S. to Deny Visas for Palestinian Officials Attending UN General Assembly</h2>

          <p>The United States has announced it will deny or revoke visas for Palestinian officials planning to attend the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the decision was due to Palestinian efforts to seek unilateral statehood recognition and undermine peace negotiations. This move is highly unusual, as the U.S., as the UN's host country, is generally obligated to facilitate travel for officials from all member and observer states. The decision comes as several countries, including France, are leading a push to recognize a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>A tragic detail has emerged from the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting, revealing that the mother of one of the critically injured victims is a pediatric critical care nurse at the hospital where her daughter was taken. Twelve-year-old Sophia Forchas remains in critical condition after undergoing emergency surgery. Her mother had rushed to work at Hennepin Healthcare to assist with the influx of victims from the mass casualty event before she was aware that the attack was at her children's school and that her own daughter was among the severely wounded.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market finished August on a high note, with the S&P 500 gaining approximately 2% to mark its fourth consecutive month of advances.

Key market events during the month included a closely watched earnings report from Nvidia, which initially caused some stock volatility, and the release of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, which showed persistent price pressures.

          <p>The federal public defender's office in Los Angeles has filed a motion to disqualify acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, arguing that he is unlawfully holding his position. The motion claims the Trump administration used an unprecedented legal maneuver to extend Essayli's term as "acting" U.S. Attorney without the required Senate confirmation or judicial appointment. This challenge mirrors similar legal actions in other districts where the administration has bypassed traditional confirmation processes to keep political allies in top prosecutor roles, raising questions about the validity of indictments brought under their authority.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have identified a new species of dinosaur, Spicomellus, which is now the oldest known ankylosaur, having lived 165 million years ago. Fossils discovered in Morocco reveal that this herbivorous dinosaur had a unique and elaborate defense system, with long bony spikes fused directly onto its rib bones—a feature never before seen in any vertebrate, living or extinct. Researchers have described the creature as one of the "strangest" dinosaurs ever found, suggesting it resembled a "punk rocker." The discovery is prompting a reassessment of the evolutionary history of these tank-like dinosaurs.</p>

          <p>In a federal court hearing, lawyers for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook argued that President Trump is using unconfirmed mortgage fraud allegations as a "weapon of choice" to attack the central bank's independence. Cook is suing the president over his attempt to fire her, which her legal team claims was done without the required legal cause. They contend the move is a pretext for Trump's broader effort to gain political control over the Fed's interest rate policies by installing a majority on its board. The case raises significant questions about presidential power and the autonomy of the nation's central bank.</p>

This would empower Republicans to block the Democratic governor's legislative agenda in her final year in office. The primary is scheduled for February 3, 2026, with the general election on May 5, meaning the district will remain unrepresented for over a year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to cut $5 billion in foreign aid that Congress has already allocated by using a rare budgetary maneuver known as a "pocket rescission." This tactic involves requesting to cancel funds so late in the fiscal year that they are likely to expire before Congress can act to protect them. The proposed cuts target funding for USAID, the State Department, and international peacekeeping operations. The move is expected to face legal challenges, as critics argue it unconstitutionally bypasses Congress's authority over federal spending.</p>

By law, protection is provided for six months but can be extended, which former President Joe Biden had reportedly done for Harris. The decision has drawn criticism from prominent Democrats who call it politically motivated retribution. However, some security experts suggest the move may be due to practical reasons, as the Secret Service is reportedly overstretched and needs to reallocate resources to protect current officials and address more immediate threats.</p>
