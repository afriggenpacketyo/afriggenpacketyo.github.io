          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested more than 20 individuals at a protest in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act. The ban, which makes supporting the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison, followed what the government called a "long history of unacceptable criminal damage," including an incident at an RAF base. The protest group Defend Our Juries, which organized the demonstration, criticized the police response. Palestine Action's legal challenge to block the ban was unsuccessful in the High Court.</p>

          <p>Severe flash floods in Kerr County, Texas, have resulted in at least 27 deaths, with children among the victims. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically after intense rainfall, inundating the area and leaving dozens of summer campers from Camp Mystic unaccounted for. Emergency crews are conducting extensive search and rescue operations, while officials have urged residents to shelter in place as more severe weather is expected. President Trump has acknowledged the "shocking" tragedy and confirmed his administration is coordinating with state officials to provide aid.</p>

          <p>The death toll from devastating flash floods along Texas's Guadalupe River has climbed to 27, with nine children confirmed among the deceased. More than 20 girls from the Camp Mystic summer camp remain missing after the river surged eight meters in just 45 minutes. While hundreds of rescue workers search the area, a UK-based hydrology professor noted that the downpour was predicted, suggesting that warning systems may have failed to adequately inform those in harm's way.

          <p>The U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing criticism for sending an email claiming a new spending bill signed by President Trump eliminates federal income taxes for most beneficiaries. Critics, including former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers, have labeled the communication a "blatant political statement" and a "lie." The bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary, income-phased deduction for seniors, a nuance constrained by the legislative process used to pass the bill. The unprecedented nature of the email from the traditionally apolitical agency has raised concerns about its politicization under the Trump administration.</p>

Participants felt the government has not delivered on key promises, particularly concerning immigration, and described a sense of being "lied to." While some showed a degree of patience, acknowledging the difficulty of turning the country around in one year, many were concerned by the government's frequent U-turns, viewing them as a sign of weakness and a lack of direction. The discussion also highlighted the growing appeal of Reform UK, with some former Labour voters considering supporting Nigel Farage's party.</p>

          <p>President Trump has intensified his rhetoric against political adversaries, recently threatening figures like Elon Musk, prospective NYC mayor Zohran Mamdani, and a former Biden official with retribution ranging from deportation to arrest. This article analyzes these actions as a significant assault on constitutional norms and freedom of speech, designed to intimidate any opposition. Pro-democracy advocates express deep concern, arguing that even if the threats are not immediately acted upon, they create a chilling effect that undermines the rule of law. The pattern of retaliation suggests a weaponization of state power against anyone who criticizes the president, eroding the very definition of freedom.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. military strikes on Iran may reinforce North Korea's belief that nuclear weapons are essential for its survival, according to security policy analysts. Experts suggest that Pyongyang could interpret the U.S. actions as evidence that President Trump is an unpredictable and untrustworthy force, making denuclearization an unviable option. This development could push North Korea to further enhance its nuclear arsenal, focusing on mobility, second-strike capabilities, and hardened underground facilities. The analysis indicates that any remaining hope for North Korean denuclearization will likely be terminated by these geopolitical events.</p>

However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there are no credible studies to support these claims. Endocrinologists explain that cortisol is a necessary hormone, and doctors rarely advise patients to lower it outside of specific medical conditions like Cushing's Syndrome.

          <p>A long-lost prototype of the MingKwai Chinese typewriter, invented in the 1940s by linguist Lin Yutang, has been discovered in a New York basement, exciting scholars. The machine is considered a crucial artifact in the history of modern Chinese computing, as its innovative design for handling complex characters laid the groundwork for today's input methods. The typewriter ingeniously breaks down characters by shape rather than sound, allowing access to tens of thousands of characters. Now acquired by Stanford University, the discovery highlights a pivotal moment in preserving the Chinese language in the technological age.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 1923, Parisians are officially allowed to swim in the Seine River, following a $1.5 billion cleanup project. The century-long ban was lifted after officials confirmed the water quality now meets safety standards on most days, a promise tied to last year's Olympics. On Saturday, designated swimming areas near the Eiffel Tower opened to the public, with Mayor Anne Hidalgo and eager residents taking a celebratory plunge.

          <p>At Oregon State University's Big Fish Lab, scientists are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to better understand ocean health and change the public's negative perception of the creatures. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team examines shark stomach contents to assess their diet, health, and the quality of the surrounding water, viewing healthy sharks as an indicator of a healthy ecosystem. Despite public fascination with sharks, the researchers note that securing financial support for their vital conservation and research work remains a significant challenge due to the animals' fearsome reputation.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has suggested that a new political party, which he has considered funding, could effectively influence U.S. legislation by focusing on a small number of key congressional races. Amid a public feud with President Trump over a new spending bill, Musk proposed that winning just a few pivotal seats in the House and Senate could be enough to act as a deciding vote in the narrowly divided chambers. In a poll on his social media platform X, a majority of respondents supported his idea of forming an "America Party" to challenge the two-party system.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened a massive new luxury beach resort in Wonsan, a project that took nearly a decade to complete amid sanctions and pandemic delays. The sprawling complex features high-rise hotels, a water park, and other amenities, reflecting Kim Jong Un's long-stated goal of boosting tourism to support the nation's economy. However, the country remains largely closed to the outside world, and it is unclear if the resort will be open to anyone beyond domestic tourists and select groups from allied nations like Russia.

          <p>An Arizona couple was fined $4,000 by their property management company for posting negative online reviews about their rental experience, which included issues like black mold. A clause in their lease prohibited negative reviews and imposed a $2,000 penalty per post, but such "gag clauses" are illegal under the 2016 federal Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA). The act protects consumers' rights to share honest feedback without fear of retaliation. After being contacted by local news, the real estate company stated it would remove the clause from future contracts, bringing attention to this unlawful business practice.</p>

          <p>A multi-story residential building collapse in southern Pakistan has resulted in the deaths of at least 16 people, with search and rescue operations ongoing. The building collapsed on Friday, and rescuers have been working to pull survivors and bodies from the rubble, with at least eight more people believed to be trapped. Such incidents are unfortunately common in Pakistan, where poor construction standards, substandard materials, and a lack of regulatory enforcement frequently lead to structural failures. The narrow street where the building was located has hampered the use of heavy machinery in the rescue effort.</p>

          <p>A doctor working in a public hospital argues that new congressional work requirements for Medicaid will cause millions of Americans to lose insurance, not because they don't qualify, but because of insurmountable bureaucratic hurdles. The article uses patient examples—such as a homeless man in a wheelchair and a non-English-speaking stroke victim—to illustrate how the "time tax" of proving employment or exemption will disproportionately affect the poor and disabled. The author contends the policy is engineered to save money by making it too difficult for entitled individuals to access their benefits, ultimately leading to worse health outcomes and financial strain on safety-net hospitals.</p>

          <p>Former Google X executive and happiness researcher Mo Gawdat advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage anger and stress. Based on neuroscientific findings, the rule posits that the physiological response to an emotional trigger, like a surge of cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this period, any lingering anger is a result of consciously or unconsciously rerunning the negative thought, giving individuals a window to choose a different reaction. Gawdat suggests that by acknowledging this brief chemical process, people can gain control and more quickly recover from life's daily upsets.</p>

Furthermore, the directive revokes Obama-era and Biden-era initiatives that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion in the management and storytelling within the national park system.
