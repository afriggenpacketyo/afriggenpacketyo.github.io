As new members like Iran join and others like Turkey show interest, what began as a regional security pact is evolving into a major platform challenging the existing global power structure.</p>

This follows Vance's social media post where he rebuked senators, a message that Kennedy himself endorsed, highlighting ongoing political tensions and divisions within the government.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will host the 2026 Group of 20 (G20) summit at his Trump National Doral golf resort in Florida. The decision revives a plan from his first term that was dropped amid ethical concerns about profiting from the presidency. The White House stated the resort would host the event "at-cost" with no profit, but the move is still likely to generate significant scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>A public conflict has erupted between Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., and Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui. The judge has sharply criticized prosecutors for bringing weak cases to support President Trump's crime crackdown, noting that grand juries have refused to indict in multiple instances. Pirro fired back at a press conference, accusing the judge of being political and telling him to "do his job," highlighting significant friction within the D.C. justice system.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Kiko, a powerful Category 4 storm with winds of 130 mph, is currently moving across the Pacific Ocean on a path toward Hawaii. While no coastal warnings are in effect yet, forecasters anticipate the storm will bring dangerous, life-threatening surf and rip currents to the islands by the end of the weekend. Direct impacts, including heavy rainfall and potential flooding, could begin affecting Hawaii as early as Monday, with the main threat expected on Tuesday.</p>

          <p>The United States is effectively surrendering its role in the global information war by dismantling programs designed to provide independent news to people in repressive countries. Under the Trump administration, agencies like the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America, are being systematically defunded. This unilateral disarmament allows autocratic powers like China and Russia to fill the void with their own propaganda, undermining democratic values and potentially harming U.S. national security.</p>

          <p>An investigation has revealed that close relatives of Bill Pulte, the federal official who accused Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of housing fraud, have themselves claimed primary residence tax exemptions on two different homes. Public records show Mark and Julie Pulte, Bill Pulte's father and stepmother, claimed "homestead exemptions" in both Michigan and Florida, a practice generally not allowed. After being contacted by reporters, tax officials in Michigan said they were revoking the exemption and would issue revised tax bills.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of crime data for Chicago challenges claims that the city is a "murder capital." While Chicago did have the highest total number of homicides last year, its homicide rate per capita was lower than at least nine other major U.S. cities, including Memphis and Baltimore. Furthermore, overall violent crime in Chicago has been falling, down 11% from 2023 and significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels, placing it near the bottom among large cities for its violent crime rate.</p>

While the short-term EV target is paused, the government stated that the long-term goals for 2030 and 2035 will remain in place.</p>

          <p>A significant rally in tech stocks, led by Alphabet, added a combined $420 billion to the market cap of the eight largest U.S. tech companies this week. The surge was largely driven by a federal judge's remedy ruling in Google's antitrust case, which was less severe than investors had feared and did not require the company to sell its Chrome browser. The decision pushed the total value of the eight tech giants to $21 trillion, representing a historic 36% of the S&P 500's total market capitalization. (not investment advice)</p>
