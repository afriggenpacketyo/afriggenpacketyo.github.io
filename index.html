          <p>Analysts are raising concerns about the high costs and complexities associated with the Trump administration's proposed 'Golden Dome' missile defense shield, designed to counter China's growing missile arsenal. While reports initially suggested a partnership between SpaceX, Palantir, and Anduril to build key components, Elon Musk refuted the claims. Boeing is also reportedly vying to have its products integrated into the system, potentially including the X-37B spaceplane and missile-tracking satellites. The project aims to create a network of satellites capable of detecting and intercepting enemy missiles, but its feasibility and potential impact on international relations remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's strict immigration policies and deportations are causing a significant decline in overseas visitors to the United States, projected to cost the tourism industry billions of dollars this year. The number of overseas visitors dropped by 11.6% in March, with a particularly sharp decline from Western Europe and Canada due to safety concerns and unhappiness with Trump's policies. This downturn reverses previous expectations of a tourism rebound following the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting various industries from entertainment to transportation and affecting both Democratic and Republican states.</p>

          <p>S&P Global Ratings has lowered the bond ratings for the city of Los Angeles due to a nearly $1 billion budget deficit and a weakening financial position. The downgrade reflects concerns about the city's rapidly declining reserve fund and an emerging structural imbalance. The agency warned of further downgrades if the city does not promptly address its budget management issues, potentially leading to higher borrowing costs.

          <p>This opinion piece argues for the left's embrace of space exploration, countering the notion that it distracts from terrestrial issues. Space science is presented as essential for Earth science, enabling monitoring of climate change, deforestation, and other environmental challenges. Remote sensing technology can improve agriculture, urban planning, and disease tracking, while publicly funded space agencies are crucial for pioneering these efforts. The author advocates for a left-wing space policy that prioritizes public benefit and addresses negative externalities like satellite pollution, rather than solely pursuing private profit.</p>

          <p>The White House Correspondents' Dinner faces a somber atmosphere, with neither President Trump nor a comedian headlining the event, signaling a departure from its traditionally humorous tone. The decision to withdraw Amber Ruffin's invitation amid criticism of her remarks about the Trump administration reflects concerns about avoiding divisive politics. Critics view the event as a potential 'wake' for legacy media struggling to counter Trump's tactics and the rise of Maga media. The dinner, intended to celebrate journalism and raise scholarship funds, may instead highlight the challenges and anxieties facing the media landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is experiencing a surge in cocaine use, attributed to a saturated North American market and a shift in drug trade focus to Europe. Experts are concerned about the rapid spread of cocaine across social classes, with rising seizures and wastewater analyses indicating increased consumption. Factors contributing to the surge include a heroin shortage due to the Taliban's opium cultivation ban and the legalization of cannabis potentially making cocaine more appealing. The drug is easily accessible through messenger services, posing serious health risks, while authorities struggle to combat drug cartels effectively.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Durham University study has revealed that chimpanzees exhibit empathetic behaviors, comforting each other in distress through actions like embracing and holding hands. The research, comparing chimpanzees and bonobos, found that chimpanzees are as likely to console one another as bonobos, challenging the common perception of chimpanzees as violent and despotic. The study also indicated that younger apes are more likely to offer consolation, suggesting that emotional sensitivity emerges early in ape development. These findings contribute to understanding the evolution of human social behavior.</p>
