          <p>A powerful storm system swept through the Northeast and Canada, leaving a trail of destruction with downed trees, power lines, and widespread outages. The New York Times article reports that at least four people died in Pennsylvania due to electrocution and falling trees, with over 400,000 customers in the state left without power. Pittsburgh's mayor urged residents to stay indoors as crews worked to clear debris, while similar conditions affected southern Quebec, leaving thousands without power. The National Weather Service confirmed that the storms were stronger than smaller tornadoes, and the interactive map shows the share of customers without power by county.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is deliberating on a case concerning the establishment of an online Catholic charter school in Oklahoma, which could set a precedent for public funding of religious schools. According to the CBS News article, the outcome hinges on Chief Justice John Roberts, who is focused on the level of state involvement. Conservative justices appear sympathetic to the school's argument against religious discrimination, while liberal justices express concerns about weakening the separation of church and state. The decision could impact charter school systems across the country and the flow of government funds to religious entities.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is considering whether Oklahoma can use public funds for a Catholic charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School. The New York Times article explains that the case raises questions about the separation of church and state, as the school aims to integrate Catholic teachings into its curriculum. Justices appeared divided, with conservative appointees seemingly supportive and liberal justices wary. A ruling in favor of the school could impact charter school laws in numerous states and potentially blur the lines between government funding of private and religious schools. Justice Barrett recused herself from the case.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive immigration policies, particularly those targeting alleged gang members, are facing increasing legal scrutiny. According to ABC News, a Venezuelan migrant, Alessandro Paredes, was detained and faced deportation based on gang affiliation claims, which he denied. The administration's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act and deportations to CECOT have raised concerns about due process violations. While border crossings have decreased, there are growing concerns about wrongful deportations and the administration's resistance to court orders. Americans are divided on Trump's handling of immigration, and many policies face ongoing legal challenges.</p>

According to NPR, the reliability and accuracy of polygraphs have been debated for decades. Polygraph tests measure changes in heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, and sweat activity, with the rationale that lying could increase a fight-or-flight response. Experts caution against federal agencies using the test too broadly, as the technology could be a helpful step in investigations, but stressed that polygraphs are the most effective not for detecting a lie, but for triggering someone to confess or disclose information.</p>

According to CNBC, some advertisers are already feeling the effects of changes to the de minimis exemption, which allows shipments under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. Fears of an economic slowdown have also fueled concerns that companies could reduce advertising spending, which is a key revenue source for Snap.

          <p>The disappearance of an 18-foot-long, 2,000-pound gray whale calf carcass from Scripps Canyon near San Diego has puzzled divers and marine biologists. According to The New York Times, the calf, which had been spotted searching for its mother, was found at a shallow depth, attracting divers and photographers. After initial observations of the carcass being scavenged by sharks, it vanished entirely. Marine biologists speculate that gas buildup during decomposition may have caused the carcass to rise and be swept deeper into the canyon by strong currents.</p>

He also asserted that tariffs would soon stimulate the economy and that companies were moving into the U.S. in record numbers. This claim is inaccurate as the GDP figure reflects a wave of imports that companies made to try to get ahead of Trump's promised tariffs.</p>
