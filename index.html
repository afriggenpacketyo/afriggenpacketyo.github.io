          <p>Mourners gathered in a Nairobi stadium to view the body of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga were met with police force, including gunshots and tear gas. The ensuing chaos led to multiple injuries as large crowds, which had overwhelmed the initially planned venue, surged and breached a gate at the larger sports center. Odinga, a towering figure in Kenyan politics who died in India, was being honored with a public viewing before his state funeral, but the unexpectedly massive turnout created a volatile security situation. The incident highlights the deep public grief and the challenges authorities faced in managing the large-scale event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of MI5, Sir Ken McCallum, has stated that Chinese state operatives pose a daily national security threat to the United Kingdom, revealing that the agency disrupted Chinese activity just last week. His comments come amid significant political controversy following the collapse of a prosecution against two men accused of spying for Beijing. The Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case, reportedly due to insufficient evidence that China was a threat at the time of the alleged offenses, a decision that has drawn sharp criticism from opposition parties and raised questions about potential political interference to protect economic relations with China.</p>

          <p>Two Federal Reserve Governors, Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller, have publicly expressed conflicting opinions on the central bank's next move, signaling a clear path toward further rate reductions but disagreement on the pace. Miran is advocating for an aggressive half-percentage-point cut at the upcoming October meeting to counter a weakening labor market and geopolitical tensions. In contrast, Waller supports a more moderate quarter-point reduction, aligning with what appears to be the broader consensus on the committee, while emphasizing a cautious approach to avoid reigniting inflation. This debate unfolds as a government shutdown complicates economic analysis by delaying key data releases. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 3,000 people in the United Kingdom have launched a joint legal claim against Johnson & Johnson, alleging that the company's talcum-based baby powder was contaminated with carcinogenic asbestos, leading to cancer and other diseases. The lawsuit, estimated to be worth more than £1 billion, claims the company was aware of the contamination for over fifty years but continued to sell the product, only removing it from UK shelves in 2023. This action follows numerous similar cases in the United States, where J&J has faced multi-million dollar verdicts and settlements, though the company continues to deny that its talc products contain asbestos or cause cancer.</p>

          <p>Tax filings released by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker's campaign revealed that he and his wife reported nearly $10.7 million in total income for 2024, which included over $1.4 million in gambling winnings. According to his campaign, the winnings came from playing blackjack at a Las Vegas casino during a vacation. Governor Pritzker, a Democrat often mentioned as a potential presidential candidate for 2028, plans to donate the full amount of his winnings to charity. The disclosure provides a glimpse into the personal finances of the prominent politician, who has frequently clashed with former President Donald Trump on various policy issues.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Mark Kelly has called on President Donald Trump to become directly involved in negotiations to end the ongoing government shutdown, now in its third week. Kelly argued that Republican leaders in the House and Senate seem to follow Trump's lead, making his engagement essential for a resolution. The primary point of contention remains the Democratic push to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, a measure Republicans insist should be debated separately after the government is reopened. With the Senate repeatedly failing to pass a stopgap funding bill, the impasse continues to affect federal operations and services.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced its hottest summer on record in 2025, with average temperatures 2.36 degrees Celsius above normal, fueling widespread anxiety about the country's future under climate change. Scientists attribute the extreme heat to a combination of global warming, high ocean surface temperatures, and persistent weather patterns, warning that this trend could severely impact agriculture, fisheries, and public health. The rising temperatures are also linked to more powerful and destructive typhoons. Some researchers predict that if current trends continue, Japan's traditional spring and autumn seasons could effectively disappear within 30 years, leaving a nation of only two seasons.</p>

This added income can currently reduce or eliminate eligibility for the valuable ACA premium subsidies, forcing retirees to carefully balance the long-term tax benefits of a conversion against the immediate cost of higher health insurance premiums.

Smoking prevalence in the region fell from 54% to 23% between 2000 and 2020. However, this public health achievement is now being challenged by the rapid rise of e-cigarettes, especially among adolescents. While some countries like Thailand and Singapore have banned vaping outright, others are hesitant to implement strict regulations, creating a new front in the region's fight against nicotine addiction.</p>

          <p>John Furner, the CEO of Walmart U.S., stated that the resurgence of American manufacturing is a real and beneficial trend for business, employment, and the country's supply chain. Speaking at a CNBC forum, he highlighted that nearly two-thirds of the products sold by Walmart are already made, grown, or assembled in the United States. The company is actively increasing its investments in domestic production, including a new beef processing facility in Kansas and a partnership to bring back the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals like amoxicillin. This strategic priority aims to create jobs and enhance the flexibility of Walmart's supply chain.</p>

          <p>Newly released documents detail the allegations against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, the two men at the center of a collapsed UK espionage case. They were accused of collecting and passing inside information on UK politics, including Tory leadership contests and meetings with Taiwanese officials, to a Chinese intelligence agent. This information was then allegedly forwarded to Cai Qi, a top official in the Chinese Communist Party. Both men denied the charges, with Cash stating he believed he was sharing political gossip with a friend who worked for a strategic advisory company, not passing information to Chinese intelligence.</p>

          <p>Tensions between the Armenian government and the influential Armenian Apostolic Church have escalated with the recent arrests of two high-ranking archbishops on politically charged accusations. One archbishop was convicted of making public calls to seize power, while another was placed in pre-trial detention for allegedly coercing people to join assemblies. The crackdown follows a period of increasing political activism by the Church, which has taken on an opposition role since the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war.

          <p>Cardiff is set to become one of the first UK cities to charge more for residential parking permits for heavier vehicles like SUVs, after the city council's cabinet approved the new 10-year parking plan. The policy aims to reduce congestion and emissions by introducing a surcharge for vehicles weighing over 2.4 tonnes, which the council argues cause more pollution and road wear, and pose a higher safety risk. While the exact cost increase has not been set, the plan is part of a broader strategy to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport use. The proposal has drawn mixed reactions from residents and tradespeople.</p>

India has become a major buyer of discounted Russian crude since the war in Ukraine began, providing a crucial revenue stream for the Kremlin.

For decades, detecting such targets from orbit was considered nearly impossible due to the immense challenge of filtering out background clutter from the Earth's surface, which drowns out the faint radar signature of an aircraft. This technological claim, if proven effective in real-world scenarios, could represent a significant shift in military surveillance capabilities, potentially undermining the strategic advantage of expensive stealth programs.</p>

The article, written by a nuclear weapons expert, commends the film for its plausible scenario and its accurate portrayal of how rational, professional decision-makers can be dragged along an inexorable path to disaster by the rigid logic of nuclear deterrence.
