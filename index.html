          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina announced he will not run for a third term, citing frustration with political theater and partisan gridlock. His decision came shortly after former President Donald Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him for opposing the GOP's signature "One Big Beautiful Bill." Tillis objected to the bill's Medicaid provisions, which he argued would jeopardize coverage for hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians. In his statement, he lamented that bipartisan, independent-thinking leaders are becoming an "endangered species" in Washington.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that a group of "very wealthy people" is prepared to acquire TikTok, the popular video-sharing app facing a potential U.S. ban over national security concerns. The sale would require approval from the Chinese government, a step Trump believes President Xi Jinping will likely take. This development comes as Trump has repeatedly delayed the enforcement of a law mandating the sale of TikTok's U.S. operations by its parent company, ByteDance. A previous deal to sell the platform to an American buyer fell apart in April.</p>

          <p>A collapse at an artisanal gold mine in a government-controlled area of Sudan resulted in at least 11 deaths and seven injuries. The state-owned mining company stated it had previously suspended work at the specific mine shaft due to significant safety risks. The incident highlights the perilous conditions within Sudan's gold mining sector, which is a crucial source of funding for both the military and paramilitary forces in the country's devastating civil war. Much of the gold is reportedly smuggled out of the country to fund the conflict.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won the Austrian Grand Prix after a tense, race-long battle with his teammate Oscar Piastri, securing a dominant one-two finish for the team.
