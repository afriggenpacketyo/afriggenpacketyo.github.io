          <p>A late-stage clinical trial showed that Eli Lilly's popular diabetes drug, Mounjaro, offers significant heart health benefits, comparing favorably to its older drug, Trulicity. The study found Mounjaro reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events and also showed a 16% lower rate of death from any cause. While the results were largely expected by clinicians, the data provides a stronger case for Mounjaro as a first-choice treatment for Type 2 diabetes patients with cardiovascular disease. The company plans to submit the data to regulators, which could lead to expanded insurance coverage for the drug in 2026.</p>

          <p>A new report concludes that the UK's National Health Service failed to listen to a mother's concerns before the death of her five-year-old son, Yusuf Nazir. The boy died from a lung infection in 2022, days after being sent home from a hospital. The investigation identified 13 missed opportunities to escalate his care, highlighting a systemic issue of prioritizing clinical metrics over caregiver insight. The family is demanding a full inquest and accountability, while the NHS has accepted the report's recommendations to improve communication and training.</p>

          <p>CVS Health reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, leading to a more than 9% jump in its stock price. The company raised its adjusted profit outlook for fiscal 2025, citing strong performance in its retail pharmacy division and improvements within its Aetna insurance unit. CEO David Joyner attributed the success to ongoing recovery efforts at Aetna, which has been managing higher medical costs, and operational efficiencies in its pharmacies. This positive report marks the third full quarter under Joyner's leadership, who is steering a broader turnaround plan for the company. (not investment advice)</p>

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as "showcase killings" and a response to Ukraine's desire for peace, calling for regime change in Moscow. While the Ukrainian Air Force intercepted most of the drones, there were still 27 hits reported in Kyiv alone. The attacks come as Russian forces claim to have captured the town of Chasiv Yar, a claim Kyiv denies.</p>

          <p>Canada has announced its intention to formally recognize a Palestinian state in September, making it the third G7 nation to do so recently, following France and the UK. Prime Minister Mark Carney stated the decision is contingent on democratic reforms within the Palestinian Authority, including holding elections without Hamas's involvement. The move, prompted by the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza and expanding Israeli settlements, has been rejected by Israel as a "reward for Hamas." The announcement also drew a warning from U.S. President Donald Trump, who suggested it could complicate a potential trade deal.</p>

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that its troops fired "warning shots" in response to a perceived threat and was not aware of casualties from its fire. The incident occurs as a US special envoy arrives in Israel and as the UN warns that famine is actively unfolding in the territory.</p>

          <p>An Indian court has acquitted former parliamentarian Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, a Hindu nationalist nun, and six other individuals in connection with a 2008 bombing near a mosque that killed six people. The judge ruled that the prosecution failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove the charges of terrorism and criminal conspiracy. The verdict has drawn criticism, with some political figures alleging a "deliberately shoddy investigation" and claiming the victims were targeted for their religion. Thakur, who spent nine years in jail before receiving bail, had been a controversial figure in Indian politics.</p>

          <p>Comcast is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings, with investors closely watching its broadband customer numbers, which have been a point of concern. The company and its cable industry peers have faced a slowdown in broadband growth due to increased competition from alternatives like 5G fixed wireless. This follows a previous quarter where Comcast lost 199,000 domestic broadband customers, causing its stock to drop.

          <p>This article recounts the infamous Hillside Strangler case, where cousins Angelo Buono and Kenneth Bianchi terrorized Los Angeles between 1977 and 1978. The pair posed as police officers to lure, torture, and murder at least ten young women, sparking widespread panic. The investigation was complex, and the prosecution nearly fell apart when the district attorney's office moved to drop charges against Buono due to the unreliability of Bianchi as a star witness. However, in a rare move, the presiding judge ordered the case to proceed, leading to the longest murder trial in U.S. history and Buono's eventual conviction.</p>

          <h2>Experts Express Skepticism Over "Japanese Walking" Fitness Trend</h2>

          <p>A viral fitness trend known as "Japanese walking," which promises the benefits of a 10,000-step walk in just 30 minutes, is gaining popularity on social media but drawing skepticism from health experts. The routine involves alternating between three minutes of fast walking and three minutes of slow walking, based on a small 2007 Japanese study. While experts agree that any form of activity, especially vigorous intervals, is beneficial, they caution that the study has design flaws and is not robust enough to support the trend's sweeping claims. They also note that the catchy, low-barrier trend reflects a broader social desire for accessible health solutions.</p>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that the Trump administration's practice of "rescissions"—withholding funds already appropriated by Congress—is illegal and irresponsible. The author cites historical precedent, including President Nixon's failed attempts at impoundment and a unanimous Supreme Court ruling, to argue that a president cannot simply refuse to spend money allocated by law. The piece criticizes the administration for ignoring the Impoundment Control Act and pursuing these cuts while having created a large deficit with tax cuts. The author warns this approach damages public programs and undermines the bipartisan appropriations process.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece urges California officials to accelerate the development of renewable energy projects to capitalize on federal tax credits before they expire. The author notes that the Trump administration's repeal of incentives created by the Inflation Reduction Act puts a 2027 deadline on these affordable energy sources. The article suggests innovative approaches like "surplus interconnection"—building solar and wind projects at existing gas plant sites to use their grid connections.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that U.S. fiscal policy avoids the crucial question of what level of government Americans are actually willing to pay for. The author contends that politicians obscure the true costs of spending, leading to unsustainable debt that constitutes a "generational injustice." The piece dismisses raising taxes on the rich as an insufficient solution, noting that federal revenues have remained stable as a percentage of GDP regardless of tax rates. The author concludes that a realistic conversation is needed to align government spending with what taxpayers can and will fund, likely requiring significant cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a deadly shooting, a note left by the gunman claimed he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) due to playing high school football, intensifying questions about the risks for youth athletes. While a definitive diagnosis of CTE requires a post-mortem examination, experts say it is possible for high school players to develop the degenerative brain disease. The incident has renewed debate over youth tackle football, particularly in California, where lawmakers have focused on safety regulations rather than an outright ban. Experts stress that the risk correlates with the duration and intensity of head impacts over a player's career.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is employing a novel strategy to protect its newly acquired F-16 fighter jets by using mobile, truck-mounted complexes for mission planning, maintenance, and munitions. This allows the jets to operate from dispersed and non-traditional locations, avoiding fixed airbases that are priority targets for Russian strikes. This tactic of dispersal has been crucial for the survival of Ukraine's air force throughout the war.

Medvedev, who has become an outspoken anti-Western hawk, retorted that Trump's nervous reaction proves Russia is "doing everything right."

Despite the falling volumes, the company's quarterly operating profit and revenue increased, beating analyst expectations due to consumers paying higher prices for its beer brands like Budweiser and Corona.
