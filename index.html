          <p>Authorities in Washington state are searching for Travis Decker, a father suspected of murdering his three young daughters. The girls, aged 5, 8, and 9, were reported missing after Decker failed to return them following a scheduled visit. Their bodies were discovered near a campground, with police suspecting asphyxiation and finding their wrists zip-tied, according to court documents. The mother of the children had expressed concerns about Decker's mental health, and police are urging the public not to approach him due to safety concerns, while a reward of up to $20,000 is being offered for information leading to his arrest. Optimism surrounding the event is minimal due to the tragic loss of life and the ongoing search for the suspect.</p>

          <p>Dollar Tree anticipates a significant decrease in second-quarter earnings, potentially as much as 50%, due to tariffs imposed on Chinese imports. The company sources a substantial portion of its merchandise from China, making it vulnerable to increased costs from the tariffs. CEO Mike Creedon acknowledged the volatility of the tariff landscape and stated the company is actively working to mitigate the impact. Despite the expected near-term challenges, Dollar Tree forecasts a rebound in earnings during the third and fourth quarters as it implements cost-mitigation strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

While a rate cut in June is unlikely, comments made by Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell after the meeting could influence HELOC rates. If Powell indicates an imminent rate reduction, lenders may preemptively lower HELOC rates, while hawkish comments could lead to slight upward movement. Borrowers should consider both HELOCs and home equity loans, weighing the variable rate of HELOCs against the fixed rate of home equity loans, to determine the best option for their financial situation.

          <p>This Vox article explores the ongoing debate about women in combat roles, featuring Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer and graduate from Ranger School. The article discusses the historical barriers women faced and the policy changes that opened combat jobs to them. It also addresses concerns raised by figures like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who insists standards were lowered for women in combat roles. Vanasse refutes these claims, emphasizing that she met the same standards as men and that lethality involves more than just physical fitness.

          <p>Former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has left the Democratic party to become an independent, coinciding with the upcoming release of her book detailing Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race. The book, titled "Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines," promises a behind-the-scenes account of the weeks leading to Biden's decision. Jean-Pierre's move reflects a growing trend of Americans identifying as independents, as she advocates for transcending party lines. The announcement comes amid scrutiny of the Democratic party's support for Biden's candidacy despite concerns about his age and health.</p>

Park allegedly shipped approximately 180 pounds of ammonium nitrate to Bartkus and paid for an additional 90 pounds leading up to the attack.

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to raise tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50% has taken effect, potentially increasing costs for a range of consumer products. Experts predict higher prices for cars, sports equipment, canned goods, and household appliances due to the increased cost of manufacturing. While some domestic steel makers may benefit, economists warn that businesses will likely pass on tariff-related costs to consumers. The tariffs aim to reduce reliance on foreign nations but could also negatively impact affordability and trade relations.</p>
