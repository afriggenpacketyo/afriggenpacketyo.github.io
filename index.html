          <p>Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, was fatally shot during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. The incident occurred while he was on stage answering a question from the audience, after which he was rushed to a hospital and pronounced dead. Kirk was an influential voice for young conservatives and a prominent ally of President Trump, who issued a statement mourning his death. An investigation into the shooting is ongoing, and authorities have reportedly taken a person of interest into custody.</p>

          <p>A shooting at Evergreen High School in Colorado has left three students with critical gunshot wounds, one of whom is the suspected shooter. The incident took place just before 12:30 p.m., prompting a large-scale response from law enforcement agencies across the Denver metro area. The school was cleared room by room, and a nearby elementary school was also placed on lockdown. This event has once again raised concerns among parents and officials about school safety protocols, particularly how to respond to active threats during less structured times like lunch periods.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan measure to repeal the legal authorizations used for the 1991 and 2003 wars in Iraq. Proponents argue that these decades-old Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMFs) are obsolete and risk being abused by presidents to engage in military action without new congressional approval. The amendment, which was attached to the annual defense spending bill, represents a significant move by Congress to reassert its constitutional authority over declaring war. Similar efforts have previously stalled, but this vote indicates growing bipartisan consensus on the issue.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the pandemic began, COVID-19 has fallen from the list of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States, according to early data from the CDC for 2024. The virus, which was the third leading cause of death in 2020, now ranks lower, reflecting a significant decrease in mortality and a broader 4% decline in overall U.S. deaths.

          <p>The fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has drawn widespread condemnation from across the American political spectrum. President Trump ordered flags to be flown at half-staff and called the event horrific, while former President Joe Biden stated there is no place for such violence in the country. Other prominent figures, from California Governor Gavin Newsom to House Speaker Mike Johnson, echoed these sentiments, rejecting political violence in any form. The bipartisan response highlights a rare moment of unity in denouncing an act that has shocked the nation.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is being analyzed as a deeply troubling manifestation of the rise of political violence in the United States. This article frames the shooting not as an isolated incident but as a consequence of extreme polarization and rhetoric, where individuals become radicalized to act against their perceived political enemies. It posits that when political discourse becomes existential, violence can be seen as a viable tool to end debate. The widespread availability of firearms in the U.S. is noted as a factor that makes such conflicts potentially lethal.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team suffered a 14-run defeat to South Africa in a rain-affected opening T20 match in Cardiff. The game was initially shortened to nine overs per side, but another weather disruption led to England's target being revised to a challenging 69 runs from just five overs. Despite a quick 25-run contribution from Jos Buttler, England's aggressive chase fell short as they lost crucial early wickets. The team finished their innings at 54-5, giving the tourists a comfortable victory in the farcical, weather-disrupted contest.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Doha, Qatar, has killed six people, including the son of a senior Hamas negotiator, in an act the Qatari prime minister labeled "state terrorism." The attack has stunned Qatar, a key U.S. ally that hosts both a major American military base and Hamas's political leadership. As a primary mediator in the Gaza conflict, Qatar warned that the strike has severely jeopardized ongoing ceasefire negotiations, suggesting Israel is actively sabotaging peace efforts. The incident represents a major escalation of the conflict and dashes immediate hopes of ending the nearly two-year war.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock value surged by nearly 36%, marking its best single-day performance since 1992 and adding an astounding $244 billion to its market capitalization. This historic rally was triggered by the company's announcement of a massive $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, shattering analyst expectations. The unprecedented demand is being driven by Oracle's cloud infrastructure business, which has become a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom. The stock's performance briefly elevated founder Larry Ellison to the status of the world's richest person, underscoring Oracle's ascendant role in the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has announced a landmark discovery from its Perseverance rover, which has collected a rock sample on Mars containing "potential biosignatures." Scientists describe this as the closest humanity has come to finding evidence of ancient life on another planet. The sample, from the Jezero Crater, has mineral compositions and textures that, on Earth, are typically associated with microbial life. While non-biological processes cannot be entirely ruled out with current data, the finding is a major breakthrough. The next crucial step is the ambitious Mars Sample Return mission to bring the rock to Earth for definitive analysis.</p>

He contends that this pricing model, where costs fluctuate based on demand, will exclude many passionate fans by making tickets unaffordable, thereby prioritizing profit over the event's atmosphere. The petition demands an end to dynamic pricing, a cap on resale values, and a 15% allocation of tickets for local residents to ensure community access to the global event.</p>

A majority of those arrested were South Korean nationals who were alleged to have improper work visas. The raid occurred in a predominantly Republican rural area, a notable shift from the administration's frequent focus on targeting Democratic-led "sanctuary cities."

The development site is less than a mile from the nest of Jackie and Shadow, a pair of bald eagles who have gained international fame through a 24-hour livestream. Advocates from the nonprofit Friends of Big Bear Valley argue that the construction, noise, and increased human presence will disrupt the eagles' critical foraging habitat.

          <p>An opinion article examines the recent controversy where the Holocaust Museum LA faced intense online backlash for a social media post stating, "Never again. For anyone." Critics accused the museum of diluting Jewish suffering and making an inappropriate political statement related to the conflict in Gaza, prompting the museum to delete the post and apologize. The author argues that this incident highlights a growing, possessive ethnonationalist interpretation of Holocaust memory, which contrasts sharply with the universalist, human-rights-oriented approach that has been central to institutional commemoration for decades.</p>

Wilson stated that the airline has since conducted a "significant safety pause" to ensure all procedures are fully embedded. This renewed emphasis on safety is occurring alongside the carrier's massive, ongoing modernization and fleet expansion effort since being privatized three years ago.</p>

          <p>A widespread bus strike that was set to disrupt dozens of routes in London over the weekend has been largely called off. The Unite union announced that a majority of the workers, employed by the company London United, voted to accept an above-inflation pay offer, thus canceling their planned walkout. However, negotiations are still underway with a second operator, London Transit. If these talks fail, a much smaller-scale strike will still affect a handful of routes, but the widespread travel chaos initially feared by Londoners has been averted.</p>
