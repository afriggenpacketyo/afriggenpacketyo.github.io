          <p>The United States has issued a warning based on "credible reports" that Hamas is planning an imminent attack on civilians in Gaza, which would constitute a grave violation of the current ceasefire agreement. The State Department has informed other guarantors of the peace deal, including Egypt and Qatar, and stated that protective measures will be taken if the attack proceeds. This development comes amid a fragile truce, with Hamas denying the allegations and accusing Israel of supporting rival armed groups as it tries to re-establish control in the region.</p>

          <p>New media reports allege that Prince Andrew used his police protection in 2011 to seek personal information about his accuser, Virginia Giuffre, who claimed she was sexually exploited by Jeffrey Epstein's circle. These claims have intensified pressure on the Royal Family, with public calls for King Charles III to remove Andrew's "prince" title, a move his brother, Prince William, is reportedly in favor of. The developments follow Andrew's decision to relinquish his other titles amid ongoing scrutiny of his association with Epstein and the settlement he paid to Giuffre.</p>

          <p>Major corporations like Accenture, Lufthansa, and Salesforce have recently announced significant job cuts, publicly attributing the restructuring to the increased efficiency of artificial intelligence. However, some industry critics and academics argue that AI is being used as a convenient excuse to conceal other business challenges, such as overhiring during the pandemic and a general economic slowdown. While employees fear AI-driven job replacement, recent economic data from institutions like Yale University suggests that widespread, AI-caused unemployment has not yet materialized, indicating a potential gap between corporate narratives and reality.</p>

          <p>A long-running investigation, aided by secret filming from the BBC, has culminated in the conviction of 14 individuals involved in a £28 million timeshare fraud. The company, Sell My Timeshare (SMT), targeted over 3,500 mostly elderly victims who were desperate to exit their timeshare contracts, using high-pressure tactics in a "bait-and-switch" scam. Instead of providing a service, the company sold them useless "credits" and used the proceeds to fund a lavish lifestyle for its owners, leaving victims out of pocket and still locked into their original contracts.</p>

          <p>Fred Done, the co-founder of betting company Betfred, has stated that a significant hike in gambling taxes could force the closure of all 1,287 of its UK shops, putting 7,500 jobs at risk. The warning comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves considers increasing taxes on the sector, a move supported by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown to fund child poverty initiatives. Done argues that such a tax rise would eliminate profitability and push bettors towards untaxed offshore operators, echoing similar concerns from other major industry players like William Hill.

          <p>North Korea is actively cultivating relationships with Southeast Asian nations, notably Vietnam and Laos, in a strategic effort to find new allies and circumvent international sanctions. High-level visits, including the first trip by a Vietnamese leader to Pyongyang in 18 years, have resulted in agreements to boost cooperation in defense and healthcare. Analysts view these moves as a diplomatic win for the isolated regime, providing it with legitimacy and potential corridors for illicit trade, while its Southeast Asian partners see opportunities for limited economic engagement.</p>

          <p>A tactical analysis suggests Liverpool's recent run of poor form is significantly affected by the departure of right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid. The team's ability to build up play from the back has been hampered, as they miss his unique skill in playing accurate passes with his weaker foot to bypass high presses. Furthermore, the frequency of Liverpool's long, diagonal switches of play—a key tactic for disrupting defensive shapes—has dropped dramatically, forcing other players like Florian Wirtz into deeper, less effective roles to compensate.</p>

For many women, a disconnect between physical and psychological arousal, often influenced by societal messaging and a lack of prioritized pleasure, can also contribute to a lower libido, highlighting the importance of open communication and mutual affection to maintain intimacy.</p>

          <p>Japan appears set to appoint its first female Prime Minister, as reports indicate the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will form a new coalition with the Japan Innovation Party. This alliance would provide the necessary support in parliament for LDP leader Sanae Takaichi to be elected to the nation's top office. The move comes after Takaichi's path to the premiership was jeopardized when the LDP's long-standing junior coalition partner, Komeito, departed, forcing the ruling party to seek a new political partnership to maintain its majority.</p>

          <p>The 20th-ranked USC Trojans saw their College Football Playoff hopes significantly diminished after a 34-24 road loss to the 13th-ranked Notre Dame Fighting Irish. In a game plagued by heavy rain, USC's offense committed costly errors, including a fumbled trick play and two fourth-quarter interceptions from quarterback Jayden Maiava. The Trojans' defense struggled mightily, allowing 306 rushing yards, which ultimately sealed the defeat in what might be the final meeting of the historic century-long rivalry between the two schools.</p>

          <p>UCLA continued its midseason resurgence with a dramatic 20-17 victory over Maryland, secured by a last-second field goal. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava overcame a frightening knee injury late in the fourth quarter, returning to the field with just 35 seconds left to lead a rapid game-winning drive. The win marks the Bruins' third consecutive victory after starting the season 0-4, setting up a nationally televised matchup next week and highlighting the team's newfound belief and resilience under interim coach Tim Skipper.</p>
