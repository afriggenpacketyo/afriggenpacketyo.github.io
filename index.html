          <p>Police in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, used tear gas to disperse anti-government protesters gathered near the presidential palace. The demonstrations, which saw tens of thousands of participants, coincided with the country's local elections. The forceful police response aimed to push the crowds away from the government building, highlighting significant political tensions within the nation. The rally underscores a period of heightened civic unrest and opposition to the current government's policies.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police arrested 175 individuals in central London during a protest in support of Palestine Action, a group proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government in July. The demonstration, organized by Defend Our Juries, proceeded despite calls from ministers and police to postpone it following a recent deadly synagogue attack in Manchester. The majority of arrests occurred in Trafalgar Square, with police noting that the process was slow as many protesters had to be physically carried away.</p>

In a 2-1 victory against Leeds, Kudus provided an assist for Mathys Tel before scoring the winning goal himself, earning praise from manager Thomas Frank. The Ghana international has been one of Tottenham's most creative players this season, and his performance is seen as a significant boost, especially with injuries to other key midfielders.</p>

          <p>Contrary to the trend of declining church attendance in America, a new study from the Barna Group suggests a surprising increase among Gen Z and Millennial men. This reversal shows young men attending church more frequently than some older generations, with experts suggesting they are seeking authentic community over a virtual world. The report also notes a gender split, as young women are leaving the church at higher rates, a trend some analysts link to the influence of feminist ideologies and suspicion of traditional institutions.</p>

          <p>Markeiz Ryan, a 36-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran, has found a higher quality of life in Vietnam after leaving the military in 2019. He lives comfortably in a two-bedroom apartment in Ho Chi Minh City for $850 a month, supporting himself on an income of roughly $4,000 a month from VA disability, the GI Bill, and teaching English. Ryan contrasts his current lifestyle, which allows him to focus on personal happiness and goals, with the financial pressures and feeling of being stuck in "survival mode" he experienced in the United States.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is causing severe financial distress for hourly and low-wage contract workers who, unlike some federal employees, are not guaranteed back pay. The article profiles several individuals, including a 65-year-old food service worker at the Library of Congress, who live paycheck to paycheck and now face the risk of losing their homes and cars. Labor unions are highlighting the immense strain on these workers, who are often forced to borrow money and ration food to support their families during the funding lapse.</p>

          <p>After a renovation project spanning over two decades, the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III in Egypt's Valley of the Kings has reopened to the public. The massive tomb, first discovered in 1799, underwent extensive restoration led by a Japanese team to preserve its wall paintings and structure. Amenhotep III, one of the 18th Dynasty's most prominent rulers, reigned in the 14th century B.C.

          <p>Jon Godfread, North Dakota's Republican insurance commissioner, warns that Congress is running out of time to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, a key issue in the ongoing government shutdown. He stresses that failure to act before the November 1 open enrollment period will cause premium costs to skyrocket for millions, pricing many out of the market. Godfread, representing a consensus among state insurance regulators, argues that this is a non-partisan issue critical for maintaining affordable healthcare access for consumers, particularly in rural areas.</p>

          <p>According to sources, the FBI is contemplating a high-profile arrest and "perp walk" for its former director, James Comey, who was recently indicted on charges of lying to Congress. An FBI supervisory agent who refused to participate in the plan, deeming it inappropriate for a white-collar defendant, was reportedly suspended for insubordination. The potential move comes after President Trump publicly pressured the Attorney General to investigate Comey, escalating the long-standing feud between the two figures.

The author warns this trend reflects a growing acceptance of "fetal personhood," potentially leading to broader surveillance and criminalization of pregnant individuals' behavior.</p>
