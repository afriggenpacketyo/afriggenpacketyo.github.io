          <p>Three Merseyside Police officers have been recognized for their bravery in confronting Axel Rudakubana, the teenager who murdered three young girls and injured others at a Southport dance workshop in July 2024. Sgt Gregory Gillespie, PC Luke Holden, and PCSO Timothy Parry were the first to arrive and entered the building to face the attacker, who was armed with a large knife. They successfully disarmed and arrested Rudakubana, who was later jailed for a minimum of 52 years, with the officers receiving their honors at the 2025 Police Federation bravery awards.</p>

          <p>President Trump is visiting Texas to survey the damage from catastrophic floods that killed at least 121 people, including many children at a summer camp. His visit comes as local and federal authorities face scrutiny over the adequacy and timing of their emergency response to the disaster. In a departure from his typical criticism of officials during crises, Trump has praised Texas Governor Greg Abbott and focused on providing federal support, while questions about his administration's cuts to the National Weather Service and plans for FEMA remain.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents. The ruling, issued on Thursday, prevents the order from being implemented anywhere in the country. This judicial action represents a significant legal setback for a key component of the administration's immigration policy, halting the effort to change the long-standing interpretation of the 14th Amendment.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a new interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, which could be the oldest comet ever observed, potentially predating our solar system by three billion years. A team from Oxford University suggests the object, which is only the third of its kind ever detected, originated in the Milky Way's "thick disk" of ancient stars. Made largely of water ice, 3I/Atlas is expected to develop a glowing tail as it approaches the Sun later this year, potentially becoming visible with amateur telescopes.</p>

          <p>As the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) welcomes new leadership after a decade, it continues to face skepticism from the West, particularly the United States. Founded with a focus on infrastructure rather than poverty reduction, the China-led bank has grown its membership from 57 to 110 economies, demonstrating broad support for its mission across the developing world. Despite its growth, the AIIB still works to convince critics that China can be a positive force for global prosperity and adhere to international best practices.</p>

          <p>The UK government has shelved plans to reduce the tax-free allowance for cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) following significant opposition from banks, building societies, and consumer groups. Chancellor Rachel Reeves was reportedly considering the change to encourage more investment in stocks and shares to boost the economy. While the immediate reform is on hold, the Treasury has not ruled out future changes and still aims to promote investment through other means, such as education programs. (not investment advice)</p>

The transfer is seen as an opportunity for Henderson to remain in contention for the England national team ahead of the next World Cup, and he will help fill the midfield gap at Brentford left by the departure of Christian Norgaard.</p>

          <p>A regional hosepipe ban has come into effect for millions in Yorkshire, but residents are expressing frustration over numerous, long-standing water leaks. Despite Yorkshire Water's claims of reducing leakage, many have reported water pouring down streets for weeks without repair. This situation has created public anger, with people questioning the fairness of imposing restrictions on consumers while the utility company loses an estimated 260 million litres of water to leakage daily.</p>

The pilot program proposes a "one in, one out" system, where for each migrant the UK returns to France, it will accept one who has made a legal asylum claim there. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the plan is designed to be robust against legal challenges and will help break the business model of people smugglers, though critics have dismissed it as a "gimmick."</p>

          <p>This article explores the irony of major global sports like Formula 1, cricket, and soccer finally gaining significant traction in the lucrative American market at a time when US political rhetoric is becoming more isolationist. As the US prepares to host mega-events like the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics, sports organizations are confronting an administration that imposes travel bans and tariffs on its international partners. This creates a challenging environment where global sports are welcomed for their commercial value but are hosted by a nation increasingly contemptuous of its guests.</p>

          <p>A senior official from Reliance Industries has urged India to significantly increase its petrochemical production to meet rising demand and challenge China's growing control over the sector. With global petrochemical margins shrinking due to a surplus created by China's expansion, India sees an opportunity to grow its own capacity as its economy expands. The executive noted that as Indian demand for transport fuels eventually peaks, refiners will need to pivot more heavily into petrochemicals to maintain growth and profitability.
