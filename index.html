          <p>Police in Liverpool have been granted additional time to interrogate a 53-year-old man arrested following an incident where a car drove into a crowd of football fans during the Premier League victory parade. The suspect, from the West Derby area, is being held on suspicion of attempted murder, dangerous driving, and driving while unfit through drugs. The incident, involving a Ford Galaxy, occurred on Water Street shortly after 18:00 BST on Monday, resulting in 79 identified casualties, with seven individuals remaining hospitalized.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest homeowners should carefully consider several factors before borrowing against their home equity in June, particularly in the current high-interest rate environment. Key considerations include ensuring affordability, having a clear purpose for the funds (such as home improvements or debt consolidation), choosing the right home equity option (loan vs. HELOC), limiting financial risk by borrowing conservatively, and confirming stable income. Experts caution against using home equity for non-essential expenses like vacations and highlight the importance of understanding the terms and potential risks of home equity products. Home equity loans and HELOCs are tied to your home, and the lender could foreclose if you fall behind on payments (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>In Oklahoma, around 300 individuals participated in a military simulation organized by MilSim West, paying $250 each to engage in a 40-hour pellet-gun battle between NATO and Russian forces. Participants, including a 17-year-old aspiring Army recruit, donned uniforms closely resembling those of Russian troops fighting in Ukraine, highlighting a growing trend of re-enacting contemporary conflicts. The event, set in a dystopian Russia where George W. Bush is still president, provides a manufactured war experience without the trauma, drawing criticism and raising ethical questions about profiting from real-world conflicts. Despite the controversy, organizers maintain that the simulations are purely fantasy-based and not intended to reflect current events, although participants often draw inspiration from the war in Ukraine for their attire and equipment.</p>

          <p>The State Department has instructed U.S. embassies to temporarily suspend scheduling new student visa appointments in anticipation of expanded social media screenings for applicants. This pause, outlined in a cable from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, is due to the impending expansion of required social media screening and vetting for all student visa applicants. The department emphasizes the importance of national security in visa adjudications, citing the need to ensure applicants do not pose a risk to the United States. The move follows recent scrutiny of visa applicants for antisemitic activity and pro-Palestinian activism, reflecting the administration's broader efforts to control international student access.</p>

          <p>According to new research from Vanguard, having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is the top predictor of financial well-being, surpassing the impact of higher income or assets. The survey of over 12,000 Vanguard investors revealed that $2,000 in savings increased financial well-being by 21%, compared to 12% for a $500,000 income and 18% for $1 million in assets. This finding highlights the importance of preparedness for unexpected expenses, with the median cost of an emergency being around $2,000. Having readily available cash provides confidence and reduces financial anxiety, as those with emergency savings spend less time worrying about their finances (not investment advice).</p>

Chairman Chen Lei acknowledged that a slowdown in growth is inevitable and that external policy changes like tariffs are creating significant pressure for merchants.

Le Scouarnec, now 74, committed the sexual abuse while victims were sedated or recovering from operations, and he kept detailed diaries of his crimes.

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest rocket ever built, reached space but failed to complete its return to Earth during its ninth test flight. The upper-stage vehicle experienced a propellant leak, causing it to spin out of control and break up during atmospheric reentry. Despite this setback, the flight showed progress in fixing issues from previous tests, with the spacecraft reaching the scheduled engine cutoff and experiencing no significant heat shield tile loss during ascent. Elon Musk stated that the next three Starship test flights would occur more frequently, but acknowledged that progress has been slower than promised.</p>

Zaki suggests that a mindset shift towards "hopeful skepticism" can be learned by anyone. The book challenges the notion that success requires cynicism, highlighting that cynics tend to be unhealthier, unhappier, poorer, and more often wrong.</p>
