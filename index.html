A five-year deal with OpenAI, valued at up to $11.9 billion, significantly contributes to the company's revenue backlog, which reached $25.9 billion.

          <p>Democratic Representative Shri Thanedar withdrew his privileged resolution to impeach President Donald Trump after facing opposition from both Republican and Democratic leaders. Thanedar stated he intends to add to his articles of impeachment, citing Trump's plan to accept a Boeing 747 from Qatar as a gift, but House leaders planned to table the resolution, effectively killing it. Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar criticized Thanedar's effort as a distraction from healthcare concerns, while Speaker Mike Johnson labeled it an embarrassing political stunt. Thanedar, who faces a challenging reelection, insists he will continue to fight to remove Trump from office for his alleged misconduct.</p>

She testified about participating in "hundreds" of alleged "freak offs" during their relationship, and none since, claiming she was often numb to cope with the experiences. Ventura revealed that she settled a civil lawsuit against Combs in November 2023 for $20 million, and is testifying now because she can no longer carry the guilt and is here to do the right thing.</p>

          <p>Utah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks argues that state financial officers have a fiduciary duty to combat environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Oaks believes that ESG introduces motivations that violate fiduciary standards by addressing societal issues through capital markets, while DEI changes hiring practices away from merit-based systems, ultimately harming companies and their financial output. He contends that these practices negatively impact state pensions, harming firefighters, teachers, and police officers who depend on them for retirement. Oaks was among two dozen state financial officers who cautioned the SEC on the financial risks of prioritizing political agendas over financial returns.</p>

          <p>A new investigation by Consumer Reports, The Guardian, and the Food & Environment Reporting Network (FERN) reveals that Kroger customers are frequently overcharged due to price tag errors, such as expired discount labels. The investigation, prompted by allegations from Kroger employees, found overcharges on more than 150 grocery items, averaging $1.70 per item, at over half of the 26 Kroger and Kroger-owned stores examined. While Kroger disputes the findings, citing a small number of errors compared to total transactions, similar allegations have been made against other retailers, and customers have filed class-action lawsuits over pricing inaccuracies.</p>

          <p>A Princeton University history professor, Jacob S. Dlamini, discusses President Trump's decision to grant refugee status to white Afrikaners from South Africa. Dlamini argues that there is no legitimate basis for this claim, as Afrikaners do not face persecution and remain a privileged class in South Africa, as the typical Black household has 5 percent of the wealth of the typical white household. Dlamini suggests that Trump's policy is influenced by a cohort of white men who have not come to terms with democracy in South Africa and the loss of their power. He also hopes it will be a wake-up call for the current African National Congress government to take South Africa's poor much more seriously.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is delaying the timeline for water utilities to comply with reducing PFAS chemicals in drinking water and reconsidering the allowable levels for some of these chemicals. The EPA is proposing to extend the compliance deadline to 2031 for PFOA and PFOS, while rescinding and reconsidering the limits for four other PFAS chemicals. Environmental advocates express skepticism, suggesting the move is about providing cost relief to water systems rather than strengthening protections, while water utilities praise the decision. The EPA estimates that 6-10% of water systems serve water with excess PFAS levels, affecting approximately 100 million people in the U.S.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are expressing grievances with key components of the megabill encompassing President Trumpâ€™s legislative agenda, particularly the Medicaid overhaul plan, which includes work requirements that wonâ€™t take effect until 2029 and imposes more frequent eligibility checks for beneficiaries. Hardliners are demanding changes to the Medicaid provisions, while Republicans from states like New York and California object to the current proposal of a $30,000 deduction on the state and local tax deductions cap. Speaker Mike Johnson faces a critical test of his speakership as he tries to corral his divided conference around the final reconciliation package.</p>

          <p>Republicans in the House Ways and Means Committee have advanced President Trump's economic package, which includes a provision to eliminate federal income tax on money earned from tips. The proposed law would create an above-the-line deduction on tips received by anyone in an occupation "which traditionally and customarily receives tips." The deduction phases out for individuals making more than $160,000 a year and expires after 2028, and the full impact on tipped workers remains uncertain as the bill progresses through Congress.</p>

          <p>Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee have voted to include a federal school voucher program, worth $20 billion over four years, in a reconciliation bill that would also extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts. The plan would use the federal tax code to create a national school voucher program, even in states where voters have fought such efforts. Funding would come from private citizens who make charitable donations to Scholarship Granting Organizations (SGOs), and the federal government would give these donors a dollar-for-dollar tax credit.

          <p>In the current interest rate environment, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is significantly cheaper than a personal loan, due to HELOCs being secured by the home and the likelihood of further rate cuts.

Borrowers can save hundreds of dollars per month by using a HELOC instead of a personal loan, but it is important to calculate repayments with precision to ensure long-term affordability.

          <p>Boeing and Qatar Airways announced a deal for the Middle Eastern airline to buy up to 210 jets, notching the U.S. planemaker's largest-ever order of widebody aircraft. The order includes 130 of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners and 30 of its much-delayed 777-9s, with options for up to 50 more planes. The deal could be a boon for Boeing, which has not posted a profit since 2018, and has been beset by major safety concerns, manufacturing defects, cost overruns and a nearly two-month-long machinist strike last year.</p>
