          <p>Container ships carrying goods subject to President Trump's tariffs have arrived at U.S. ports. These ships, originating from China, contain goods from companies like Amazon, Home Depot, Ikea, and Ralph Lauren, encompassing various consumer items such as housewares, apparel, and furniture. Many companies are importing essential products despite tariff concerns, while Amazon stated it is supporting its selling partners in adapting to the changing trade environment. The tariffs have caused confusion and uncertainty for businesses, leading them to continually adjust their planning and freeze decisions, especially concerning products priced before the tariffs were announced.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reached a preliminary trade agreement with the United Kingdom, reducing tariffs on British-made cars and eliminating duties on steel and aluminum. This deal opens the UK market to American farmers but maintains the UK's ban on chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef, addressing welfare and environmental concerns. The agreement also includes provisions for digital trade, facilitating smoother data flows and enhancing cybersecurity cooperation.

Harvard's resistance to the administration's demands, including audits and changes to admissions practices, has intensified the conflict.

          <p>David H. Souter, a former Supreme Court Justice nominated by President George H.W. Bush, has died at the age of 85. Souter, a Republican appointee, surprised conservatives by becoming a key member of the court's liberal wing, often siding with liberal justices on critical issues. He retired at 69 to return to his home state of New Hampshire, and his replacement was Sonia Sotomayor. Souter's moderate stance and commitment to the Constitution's evolving interpretation marked him as a judicial figure who defied easy categorization.</p>

The spacecraft, intended for a Venus mission but failed to leave Earth's orbit, poses a small risk of impact on the surface. Experts predict it will likely land between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude, with a higher probability of landing in the ocean due to Earth's surface composition. While the risk of hitting someone is low, the spacecraft's durable construction for Venus's atmosphere raises concerns about its potential to survive reentry.</p>

          <p>A rapid analysis by climate scientists found that the severe storms in the central Mississippi valley in early April were intensified by the burning of fossil fuels. The study indicated that the record rainfall, which led to catastrophic flooding and numerous fatalities, was made more intense and likely due to human-caused climate change. Warmer ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, driven by the climate crisis, contributed to the storm's moisture and intensity. The study also highlighted the importance of well-resourced forecasting and early warning systems, such as the National Weather Service, in mitigating the impact of extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>The United States has granted refugee status to 54 white Afrikaner South Africans, who are expected to arrive in Washington D.C. This action follows an executive order from President Trump directing the government to prioritize Afrikaners who claim to face discrimination. The move has drawn criticism due to the historical context of apartheid and the economic privilege still held by many white South Africans. The US State Department stated that it is prioritizing consideration for refugee resettlement of Afrikaners who are victims of unjust racial discrimination.</p>

The U.S.-Canadian border, the longest international border globally, largely follows the 49th parallel. While technically man-made, it has a deep history and is an important part of everyday life on the North American continent.</p>
