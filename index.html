          <p>Following a procedural failure in the House, former President Trump met with Republican holdouts, successfully persuading them to support a package of cryptocurrency-related bills. The legislation, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation, had initially been blocked by 13 Republicans. This reversal highlights Trump's significant influence over the party, as the bills are now expected to pass. The initial failure caused a temporary dip in the stock prices of crypto-related companies like Coinbase and Circle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities at Germany's Cologne Bonn Airport intercepted a package from Vietnam containing approximately 1,500 young tarantulas hidden inside spongecake boxes. The discovery was made after customs officials were alerted by a noticeable smell from the nearly 15-pound shipment. Many of the spiders did not survive the journey, and the recipient is now facing criminal proceedings. Officials described the seizure as extraordinary and highlighted the issue of animal smuggling for profit.</p>

          <p>At a summit in Pittsburgh, former President Trump announced that 20 leading technology and energy companies will invest over $90 billion in Pennsylvania. The initiative aims to develop a new artificial intelligence economy by leveraging the state's energy resources to power data centers and establish an innovation hub for worker training. The announcement, which included plans for new nuclear reactors and a partnership between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, was met with protests concerning its focus on corporate interests and fossil fuels.</p>

This pressure follows President Trump's intervention in a dispute over a proposed gas power plant near Nashville, which he opposed after musician John Rich campaigned against it.

Over 95% of Florida's Elkhorn coral has been lost due to warming oceans and disease, threatening coastal protection. By introducing genetic diversity from the more resilient Honduran corals, which thrive in tougher conditions, researchers hope the new "Flonduran" hybrid will be better equipped to survive future marine heatwaves.

          <p>In response to the Trump administration's heightened immigration enforcement, some migrant workers are using mobile applications like Coqui to track the real-time locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Users, including those with legal status, report feeling traumatized and fearful of detention, using the apps to find safer routes for work and daily life. While developers say the apps are a practical tool to protect people, ICE officials have expressed concern that such technology is dangerous and could be used to ambush law enforcement officers.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Prosecutor-General has formally urged the Supreme Federal Court to find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of attempting a coup following his 2022 election loss. The filing accuses Bolsonaro and seven others of forming an "armed criminal association" to violently overthrow the democratic order, citing his unfounded claims of voter fraud and the subsequent storming of government buildings by his supporters. If convicted, the former president could face up to 40 years in prison, though he maintains the charges are a politically motivated "witch hunt."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from local mines instead of on the international market, according to the World Gold Council. This strategy allows them to bolster their reserves using local currency, thereby preserving foreign exchange assets like the U.S. dollar. The practice is also seen as a way to support domestic mining industries and acquire gold at a potential discount, though it can present challenges if the country lacks certified refining capabilities.

Cramer noted that investors focused on BlackRock's lower-than-expected net inflows and Wells Fargo's reduced guidance for net interest income. He concluded that while he remains confident in the long-term prospects of all three companies, earnings season can be "terrifying" for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their titles changed to "assistants." The recommendation aims to reduce patient confusion and clarify the distinction between these roles and fully qualified doctors. The review also suggests that associates should wear standardized uniforms and not be responsible for diagnosing patients. This follows concerns raised by doctors' unions and the families of patients who died after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors.</p>
