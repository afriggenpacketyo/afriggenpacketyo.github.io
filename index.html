          <p>Amidst a truce between India and Pakistan following cross-border strikes, China faces a challenging balancing act in the region. China prioritizes de-escalation to protect its geopolitical and economic interests in South Asia, even as its public expresses support for Pakistan. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has urged restraint, recognizing that its own border security with India depends on regional stability. A brewing crisis involves India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, potentially leading to hydrological warfare and regional destabilization. Despite historical tensions, China and India share common ground as Brics members, cooperating on issues like Russia's war with Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Trump appointed Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, as acting librarian of Congress, leading to a staff revolt. Library staff refused access to two Justice Department officials selected by Blanche for key roles, citing the need for congressional input. The officials, designated for top positions in the U.S. Copyright Office and as deputy librarian, were denied entry, leading to a standoff. Robert Newlen, the principal deputy librarian, is recognized as acting librarian until Congress provides direction. Representative Joseph D.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans have introduced legislation that would require many Medicaid recipients to prove they are working, volunteering, or in school for at least 80 hours a month to receive coverage. The proposal aims to find $880 billion in savings over the next decade to help pay for President Trump's tax bill. Policy experts and Democrats warn that these cuts would hurt vulnerable Americans, potentially causing millions to lose coverage and posing financial risks to hospitals. The bill also includes more rigorous income verification for Affordable Care Act enrollees and would take effect in 2029 if passed. Some experts argue that work requirements do not significantly increase employment.</p>

          <p>Zillow reports that renters now need at least $80,000 annually to comfortably afford the typical apartment rental, a significant increase from $60,000 in 2020. In major metropolitan areas like Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose, renters need to earn $100,000 or more. New York City tops the list, requiring an annual income of roughly $135,000 to comfortably afford rent. The national housing supply shortage is a key factor driving up rents, with wage growth lagging behind. Experts suggest expanding programs like the Low Income Housing Tax Credit to increase affordable housing supply.</p>

          <p>House Republicans acknowledge they do not anticipate receiving a full analysis from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) before marking up legislation proposing massive changes to Medicaid. Despite this, a letter from the CBO confirms that the panel's recommendations would meet its target of $880 billion in savings over the next decade. President Trump has urged Republicans to unify around the bill, citing prescription drug cuts and tariff money as factors to consider. Democrats highlight prior CBO analyses suggesting millions could lose Medicaid insurance by 2034, while Republicans insist their policy revisions are not fully encompassed in those figures.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China reached a temporary truce in their trade war, reducing tariffs in a "90-day pause," but this move highlights the contradictions in Trump's trade strategy. While significant tariffs risk economic damage, modest tariffs may not be impactful enough to rebalance the global trading order. The current global trading order is entrenched, making it difficult to dislodge without severe economic pain. Trump's team appears to be seeking a "Goldilocks tariff level," but this may be impossible to achieve. These tariffs are not expected to restore manufacturing in the U.S. or reduce dependence on China.</p>

          <p>China and the United States agreed to reduce tariffs drastically for 90 days as they continue to negotiate a more permanent trade deal, providing welcome news for investors. The temporary truce will see the United States lower tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, and China reduce its import duties on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%. However, supply shortages and price increases on Chinese products may still affect American consumers due to weeks of uncertainty.

          <p>Homeowners may find a home equity line of credit (HELOC) a viable financing option in 2025, especially for home projects, given the tax-deductible interest. HELOCs have variable interest rates, requiring borrowers to calculate future repayment costs tied to available rates. HELOCs can be the cheapest home equity borrowing option compared to home equity loans, cash-out refinances, reverse mortgages, personal loans, and credit cards. However, it's crucial to consider individual financial health before using a HELOC, as it uses the home as collateral, and failure to repay could result in foreclosure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Yeshiva University has reversed its decision to recognize an LGBTQ student club, citing violations of Jewish principles and a legal settlement. The university claims the club, renamed Hareni, was operating as a pride club, conflicting with the Torah values of the institution. Lawyers for the students argue the university violated the agreement with hostile religious rhetoric. This reversal follows a years-long legal battle and has sparked debate over religious freedom and civil rights. The club's lawyers cited guidelines prohibiting social events and the use of Pride symbols.</p>

          <p>Hamas released Edan Alexander, the last living American hostage, after back-channel dialogue between the U.S. and the terrorist group, circumventing the Israeli government. President Trump hailed the release as a step toward ending the war and returning all hostages. This disconnect highlights a divide between Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu, as most Israelis support a hostage deal over continuing the war. Trump's envoy emphasized the commitment to retrieve all hostages. Polls show about 70% of Israelis support a deal to free the remaining hostages, contrasting with Netanyahu's coalition, which seeks to escalate the conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to lower U.S. drug costs by linking prices to those paid in other developed countries, but experts doubt its feasibility. The "most favored nation" policy aims to tie U.S. drug prices to lower international ones, affecting both commercial and public markets. However, it remains unclear how much the policy will reduce prices for patients and whether Trump can enforce it. Experts question whether other nations and drugmakers will comply with the order. Some believe that the move is more symbolic than a substantive policy shift, given the need for congressional approval and potential legal challenges.</p>

The Treasury Department will send notices to 5.3 million borrowers about the collection activity, beginning as soon as June. Self-employed individuals may face challenges in wage garnishment. Borrowers can challenge the garnishment if they've been unemployed, filed for bankruptcy, or face financial hardship.

          <p>A documentary reveals that Paul Reubens, known as Pee-wee Herman, hid his homosexuality out of self-preservation and ambition, choosing to remain in the closet. This revelation prompts reflection on the complexities of the closet, its impact on identity, and the evolving LGBTQ cultural landscape. The article explores the historical context of the closet, from its origins as a tool of oppression to its modern reinterpretation as a choice. With growing anti-LGBTQ sentiment, the author questions the notion that gay people can live their lives without at least some degree of sequestering their lives, and what that might mean for the future.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose and then roll back tariffs on Chinese products highlights the limitations of his aggressive trade approach. The tariffs caused significant trade disruptions, leading companies to reroute business and Chinese factories to shutter. The recent agreement reduces tariffs, but the absence of other concessions from China raises doubts about the worth of the disruptions. Trump's approach of manufacturing trade crises to extract quick concessions faces challenges against an economic power with similar might. The U.S. has determined that it does not want to decouple its economy from China.</p>
