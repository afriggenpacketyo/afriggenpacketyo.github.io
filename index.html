          <p>Senator Tammy Duckworth anticipates a challenging confirmation hearing for Mike Waltz, President Trump's nominee for U.N. ambassador, citing his involvement in a Signal chat leak where classified information was shared. Duckworth argues that Waltz is unqualified for the position due to his demonstrated inability to handle classified information appropriately, pointing to the incident where the timing and targets of an attack on Houthis in Yemen were shared in an unclassified channel. She also criticizes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's competence and advocates for his dismissal, while Representative Mike Turner defends Waltz's background and experience, expressing confidence in his ability to serve in a strong role in the administration.</p>

          <p>The CEOs of NPR and PBS are exploring options to challenge the Trump administration's executive order to cut off public funding to the news and media organizations. NPR CEO Katherine Maher and PBS CEO Paula Kerger have stated that potential funding cuts would disproportionately affect local stations and their audiences, particularly in rural communities where access to alternative news sources is limited. Maher noted that NPR has 246 member organizations with newsrooms in every state, and potential funding cuts would damage journalists covering their local communities, while Kerger said they have never seen a circumstance like this and are going to be pushing back very hard.</p>

          <p>California's ambitious high-speed rail project, approved by voters in 2008, faces significant delays and tripled costs, raising questions about the state's ability to build big things. The article follows eminent-domain lawyer Mark Wasser as he visits clients whose properties have been acquired for the rail project, which now aims to connect Bakersfield and Merced by 2033, far short of the original Los Angeles to San Francisco promise. Wasser argues that eminent domain is not the primary cause of delays, and local farmers express frustration over the disruption to their land and livelihoods, highlighting the complexities and challenges of the project.

          <p>A ballistic missile launched from Yemen struck near Israelâ€™s international airport close to Tel Aviv, causing a temporary suspension of flights and prompting a threat of retaliation from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The strike, claimed by the Iranian-backed Houthi militia, injured several people and drew condemnation from Israeli leaders, with Netanyahu vowing to respond to both the Houthis and Iran. The article notes that the attack slipped through Israel's aerial defenses and came amid ongoing negotiations between the Trump administration and Tehran over its nuclear program.</p>
