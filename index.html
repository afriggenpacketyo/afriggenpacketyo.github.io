          <h2>Tariffs Have Not Yet Increased Inflation Due to Several Factors</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns that President Trump's tariffs would raise inflation, traditional inflation measurements have not yet reflected this. Recent consumer and producer price readings were stable, with prices rising only slightly in May. Several factors have contributed to this, including companies stockpiling imported goods before tariff announcements, the time it takes for tariffs to affect the economy, and limited pricing power due to cautious consumer spending. While the full impact of tariffs is expected to materialize in the coming months, these factors have kept inflation in check for now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has escalated his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "numbskull" and urging him to lower interest rates. Trump claimed that a two-percentage-point rate cut would save the U.S. $600 billion annually, but Powell has not acted. This attack follows recent data indicating that producer prices rose less than expected in May, easing inflation fears. Other administration officials have also pressured the Fed to cut rates, arguing that the economy is ready and inflation is low. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A congressional report reveals that proposed federal funding cuts to public television and radio would disproportionately impact outlets in states won by President Trump in 2024. Approximately 60% of the affected stations are located in these states, including both large and small communities. These cuts are part of a Republican plan to eliminate $9 billion in funding for programs approved before Trump's second term, with $1.1 billion specifically targeting the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS. Advocates argue that these cuts would harm communities with limited local news sources and disrupt essential emergency communications.</p>

The American Hospital Association has cautioned that these cuts could have a devastating impact on rural hospitals, which often serve as the sole source of care for rural communities.

          <p>This article argues that the presence of Mexican flags at immigration protests in Los Angeles is not a sign of a foreign invasion, but a symbol of the power and identity of Mexican Americans. Republicans have used images of protesters waving Mexican flags to incite fear, but the author contends that the flag represents a connection to roots and a shared experience between Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants. The author criticizes the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to suppress the protests, arguing that it is an attempt to intimidate and destroy the bodies of those who are asserting their rights.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed eight new members to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), including some well-known vaccine critics. This decision follows Kennedy's removal of all 17 previous members of the committee. Among the new appointees is Dr. Robert Malone, a physician who has spread misinformation about vaccines. Public health experts have expressed concern that these appointments could negatively impact vaccine policy and availability in the U.S. The new advisors will attend ACIP's meeting later this month to discuss new recommendations for several vaccines.</p>

          <p>A survey of retail executives indicates that most expect President Trump to walk back his proposed "reciprocal" tariffs on goods imported from the European Union, Vietnam, India, and Mexico. The executives anticipate that the 10% duties currently in place will remain after the 90-day pause lapses in July, rather than the higher rates initially imposed. This optimism stems from recent trade negotiations with China and a court ruling challenging Trump's authority to impose the tariffs. However, some caution that this optimism may be premature, as other countries lack China's leverage in negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Heads of the Valleys road officially opens after a Â£2bn upgrade, residents are still dealing with the impact on their homes. John Watkeys, who has lived near the A465 for 65 years, lost part of his garden and a beloved oak tree to the project. Despite the road's completion, he and other residents are still fighting with the Welsh government over the impact on their properties. While the road aims to bring prosperity to the area, some residents feel the stress of the project has taken a toll.</p>
