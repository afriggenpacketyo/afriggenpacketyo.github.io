          <p>A preliminary report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau into the crash of Air India Flight 171 reveals a critical finding. Just seconds after takeoff, the fuel-control switches for both engines were moved to the “cut-off” position, leading to a total loss of power. The crash tragically killed 242 people on the plane and 19 on the ground in Ahmedabad, with only a single survivor from the aircraft. The investigation is ongoing to determine why the switches were activated, with cockpit audio capturing a pilot denying he had done so.</p>

          <p>A farm worker has died from injuries sustained after falling from a greenhouse roof during a federal immigration raid at a California cannabis farm. The Department of Homeland Security stated the man was not being pursued by law enforcement when he fell. However, the United Farm Workers union asserted that the worker died as a result of the enforcement action. The incident occurred amid a broader immigration crackdown, sparking protests and a federal judge's order to temporarily pause some aggressive tactics used by agents in the state.</p>

          <p>The Welsh national rugby team secured a much-needed victory, defeating Japan 31-22 in Kobe to end an 18-test losing streak that spanned 644 days. The tourists built an early lead with tries from Kieran Hardy and Josh Adams, and despite a strong second-half comeback from Japan, a late try sealed the win. This victory, the first for Wales since the 2023 World Cup, provides a significant morale boost and breaks a historic losing sequence for the tier-one nation. The win also marks a positive end to interim head coach Matt Sherratt's tenure.</p>

          <p>France's far-right National Rally party is carefully managing its relationship with the Trump administration, balancing ideological alignment with potential political risks. While sharing nationalist and anti-immigration views, the party is wary of a close association with Donald Trump, whose policies are viewed negatively by many French voters, including some of their own. Analysts suggest the party is maintaining a cautious distance to avoid alienating its electorate, especially concerning potential US tariffs that could harm its blue-collar base. This delicate act is part of its broader strategy to normalize its image ahead of the 2027 presidential election.</p>

          <p>A proposal by German Education Minister Karin Prien to introduce a quota limiting the number of students with immigrant backgrounds in schools has sparked a nationwide debate.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against the AI startup Lovo can proceed. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege their voices were used to create and sell AI-generated voice clones without their consent. They claim they were hired for limited internal use but later discovered their voice clones on Lovo's platform. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to their voices, claims of breach of contract and deceptive business practices will move forward, marking a notable victory for artists' rights in the age of AI.</p>

          <p>This analysis of the Air India Flight 171 preliminary report focuses on the baffling mystery of why the engines' fuel-control switches were cut off. The article explores the unlikelihood of accidental activation due to safety features and the lack of any declared emergency by the pilots. Investigators are examining a past FAA bulletin about the switch design, but the central question remains whether the action was intentional or the result of a severe, uncommunicated malfunction. The cockpit voice recorder is considered crucial to solving the puzzle of this catastrophic event.</p>
