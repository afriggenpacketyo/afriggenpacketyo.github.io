          <p>A construction tunnel collapsed in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles, trapping at least 15 people inside. The Los Angeles Fire Department has dispatched all of its Urban Search and Rescue teams to the site, but communication with those trapped has not been established. The incident occurred at the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel project, a seven-mile-long wastewater management tunnel under construction. The collapse happened approximately six miles from the tunnel's only access point, complicating rescue efforts.</p>

          <p>To combat rising youth unemployment and stimulate its economy, the Chinese government has announced a new subsidy program. Companies that hire unemployed individuals aged 16 to 24 will receive a one-time payment of up to 1,500 yuan per new hire. This initiative is part of a broader effort to stabilize the labor market amid sluggish growth and trade tensions. The program will be funded by China's unemployment insurance reserves and will remain in effect until the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in South Africa has issued a warning to its citizens about an increase in kidnappings, particularly targeting Chinese women. The advisory urges nationals to avoid going out alone and to inform others of their whereabouts, following multiple recent incidents. Analysts suggest Chinese traders are being targeted due to a perception that they carry large amounts of cash and operate outside the formal banking system. This warning comes amid a general rise in kidnappings and violent crime in the country this year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a federal lawsuit against California, arguing that the state's strict animal welfare laws for egg-laying hens create unnecessary regulations that illegally drive up egg prices nationwide. The lawsuit names Governor Gavin Newsom and other officials, asserting that federal law should ensure national uniformity in egg safety standards. The administration contends that California's rules, which require more space for chickens, cannot be imposed on eggs imported from other states. This legal challenge follows previous unsuccessful attempts by other states to overturn California's regulations.</p>

The announcement caused an immediate surge in copper prices, with the U.S. importing nearly half of its copper supply, primarily from Chile. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that corporations should cease profiting from what it terms Israel's "economy of genocide," drawing parallels to historical events where businesses benefited from major atrocities. The piece cites a report by UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese, which claims that many corporate entities have materially contributed to the destruction in Gaza by providing weapons and technology. The author contends that the complicity of the corporate sector is extensive and that entities like American defense contractors have provided some of the most destructive weapons used in the conflict.</p>

          <p>Journalist Mario Guevara, who was arrested by local police while covering a protest in Georgia and then turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), remains in custody. An immigration judge granted him a $7,500 bond, but his family's attempt to pay it was denied as ICE has appealed his release. Guevara, who has a work permit and a path to citizenship, alleges he is being persecuted for his journalistic work. Press freedom organizations and his lawyer are calling for his release, arguing there appears to be a concerted effort to keep him detained.</p>

          <p>Bishop Alberto Rojas of the Diocese of San Bernardino has issued a decree allowing the region's one million Catholic parishioners to miss Sunday Mass. The decision was made in response to widespread fear within the community over the Trump administration's recent and intensive immigration enforcement sweeps. The bishop stated that such fear constitutes a "grave inconvenience" and that church members can maintain their spiritual communion through prayer at home. The move highlights the profound impact that the immigration raids are having on daily life and community activities in Southern California.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that life expectancy in California has not fully recovered from its sharp decline during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2024, the average lifespan was still nearly a year shorter than in 2019, with only two-thirds of the pandemic-era loss regained. While COVID-19 was the initial driver, the current shortfall is now primarily attributed to increases in deaths from drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease. The study also highlights persistent disparities, with Black and Hispanic Californians experiencing a much slower recovery in life expectancy compared to white and Asian residents.</p>

In response, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stated that Brazil is a sovereign nation with independent institutions and will not accept tutelage.

He laughed while suggesting that a small drone might strike the president. The remark was made during a discussion about Iran's military technology.
