She believes the organization's stance on allowing biological males to compete in the women's category represents a leftward political shift. Worley encourages female gymnasts to push back against male competitors claiming to be female and advocate for the protection of women's sports.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles has experienced several days of demonstrations sparked by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, leading to clashes between protesters and law enforcement. The unrest began after federal agents executed search warrants at businesses suspected of unlawfully employing undocumented immigrants. President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard, despite objections from state and city officials, further escalated tensions. Protests have also emerged in other cities in solidarity, with demonstrators calling for an end to ICE activity and denouncing the federal response.</p>

          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2, priced at $449.99, is a worthy successor to the original, taking an 'if-it-ainâ€™t-broke' approach to gaming. It is a refinement of the original Switch's ideas, offering improvements in size, strength, resolution, and new features like mouse-capable Joy-Cons and enhanced chat. Battery life in handheld mode may be a challenge, with about two hours of gameplay for demanding titles. While the launch lineup is limited, the improvements and potential of new games like 'Mario Kart World' make it a worthwhile investment for those seeking an upgraded gaming experience.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has requested a federal judge to swiftly block President Trump's deployment of National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles. The lawsuit argues that Trump's actions are illegal, stoking fear, and escalating civil unrest, violating the 10th Amendment. Trump's lawyers have dismissed the request as "legally meritless" and accused the plaintiffs of jeopardizing the safety of Homeland Security personnel. The dispute centers on the legality and necessity of the federal government's intervention in the state's response to protests against immigration raids.</p>
