        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court, seeking permission to deploy federalized National Guard troops in Illinois, despite a lower court order blocking the move. This legal challenge underscores a significant dispute over the President's authority to mobilize federal forces against local objections, particularly concerning his Commander-in-Chief powers. The Justice Department asserts that preventing deployment jeopardizes federal immigration officers and property amid protests, while Illinois maintains that the conditions do not justify such federal intervention. This article highlights the escalating tension between federal and state powers regarding domestic military deployment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk declined after President Trump announced his administration's goal to reduce the cost of GLP-1 weight loss drugs, like Ozempic, to $150 per month. This proposed price, significantly lower than current list prices, aims to align U.S. drug costs with those in other developed nations. While the administration has not yet finalized negotiations, the announcement signals intent to pressure drugmakers, potentially making these popular medications more accessible and competitive with compounded alternatives. This move could drastically alter the market for weight loss treatments. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent significant loan losses, including a near-total wipeout for Zions and Western Alliance due to alleged fraud by a commercial real estate firm, have prompted bank investors to search for hidden risks. The focus is on loans made to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs), a rapidly growing category since the 2008 financial crisis. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of potential widespread issues, highlighting how regulatory changes pushed riskier lending outside traditional banking. Investors are concerned about the opacity and high loss rates associated with NDFI loans, despite an otherwise improving interest rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Trump suggested that both Ukraine and Russia should declare victory and "let history decide" to end the ongoing conflict. Zelenskyy confirmed that discussions about long-range weapons like Tomahawks were kept private to avoid escalation, despite Trump's earlier openness to a drone-for-Tomahawk exchange. Trump also indicated a potential upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, with U.S. and Russian advisers set to meet beforehand.

          <p>Northampton Saints claimed the top position in the Prem table after a decisive 36-19 bonus-point victory against Newcastle Red Bulls at Kingston Park. The Saints' impressive performance, which included five tries, moved them ahead of reigning champions Bath. Despite playing a significant portion of the match with a man down due to two sin-bins for JJ van der Mescht, Northampton consistently found another gear. Newcastle, still searching for their first league win since last November, showed brief resilience but ultimately couldn't capitalize on their opportunities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military attacked a vessel identified by President Trump as a "drug-carrying submarine" from Venezuela, resulting in two captured survivors now held aboard a Navy ship.

Trump defended the actions as targeting "narco-terrorists," while Venezuela's President Maduro accused the U.S. of seeking to colonize the nation.

          <p>At least 11 individuals were detained following clashes between Illinois state police and protesters outside the Broadview ICE detention center in the Chicago area. Tensions escalated when officers moved to clear roadways after demonstrators reportedly advanced beyond designated "protest zones." The incident, partly captured on video, involved officers tackling and dragging protesters, drawing chants of "Who do you protect?" from the crowd. This event follows a court order requiring federal agents in Illinois to wear body cameras during immigration operations, reflecting ongoing controversy over federal force use and protest management.</p>

          <p>A man, 49, and a woman, 65, from Sandwell have been arrested in connection with the sexual assault of a Sikh woman in her 20s in Oldbury, West Midlands. This attack, previously described by police as racially motivated, sparked protests and vigils last month within the Sikh community. The suspects were initially arrested for a separate sexual assault incident in Halesowen before being linked to the Oldbury case. The Sikh Federation UK welcomed the arrests, questioning the time taken but hoping for sufficient evidence to bring charges for these "disgusting attacks."</p>

          <p>Athletic shoe company On is facing a class-action lawsuit from U.S. customers alleging that its popular "CloudTec" sneakers, costing around $200, produce an "audible and noticeable squeak." The plaintiffs claim the defect renders the shoes unwearable in daily life, particularly for professionals like nurses. Accusing On of "deceptive marketing," the lawsuit seeks refunds and damages, noting the company's failure to address the issue or offer fixes. Despite this, On, backed by Roger Federer, reported better-than-expected earnings recently, driven by strong sales of models like Cloudmonster and Cloudsurfer.</p>

          <p>Americans are receiving an alarming 2.5 billion robocalls monthly, the highest level in six years, alongside a tripling of robotexts since 2021, according to a U.S. PIRG Education Fund report. These unsolicited automated messages, often driven by crime rings, aim to extract personal or financial information. Scams are becoming more sophisticated with AI voice-cloning tools and fraudulent links. Despite the 2019 TRACED Act requiring stricter anti-robocall technology, less than half of phone companies have fully complied, leading to significant financial losses for victims, who average thousands of dollars lost per scam.</p>

          <p>Honeywell is commencing its multi-stage corporate breakup by spinning off its Solstice Advanced Materials unit later this month. Shareholders will receive one share of Solstice for every four Honeywell shares, with independent trading beginning October 30. This move, initially pushed by activist investor Elliott Management, aims to simplify Honeywell's conglomerate structure. Solstice, a specialty chemicals business with nearly $4 billion in sales, focuses on refrigerants, building solutions, and electronic materials. While Solstice boasts strong margins and returns, its recent sales growth has stagnated, leading to a "good house in a bad neighborhood" investment outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Seven fully preserved skeletons discovered in an ancient well in Croatia have been identified as Roman soldiers who lived 1,700 years ago. Found in the Roman city of Mursa, the well was repurposed as a mass grave. Researchers determined the robust adult men, aged 18-50, were likely soldiers from a 260 C.E. battle or skirmish, with some showing weapon-inflicted injuries. DNA analysis revealed none were local, suggesting origins from Northern/Eastern Europe or the Byzantine Empire. This article offers significant archaeological insight into Roman military life and conflict.</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown persists, federal student loan borrowers face uncertainty regarding their debt, though most loan tasks handled by contracted servicers remain operational. Borrowers can still apply for repayment plans and forgiveness programs, but actual debt cancellation approvals are delayed due to furloughed Education Department staff. This delay could lead to tax implications for some, as a federal tax-free forgiveness provision expires at the end of 2025. The article advises borrowers not to panic, emphasizing that core servicing functions continue, but warns of significant holdups in receiving debt relief. (not investment advice)</p>
