        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick advocates for Taiwan to produce only half of America's semiconductor demand, shifting the other half to U.S. domestic manufacturing. This initiative, discussed with Taipei, aims to reduce American dependence on Taiwan's chip production, currently over 90% of advanced semiconductors. Lutnick argues this 50-50 split would enhance Taiwan's security, downplaying the "Silicon Shield" theory. The Trump administration's goal is to reach 40% domestic production by term-end, requiring significant investment.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed agents from the FBI, DEA, and other Justice Department agencies to assist in guarding Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities. This directive follows a fatal shooting at an ICE office in Dallas and other recent threats, which Bondi described as "extreme political violence." She also announced an "ICE Protection Task Force" and singled out Portland and Chicago for increased protection and federal prosecution of those threatening law enforcement. This move comes as ICE reports a spike in attacks amid increased arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Minnesota, Hennepin County, Minneapolis, and St. Paul, challenging their sanctuary policies. Attorney General Pamela Bondi asserts these policies are illegal and jeopardize public safety by allowing undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes to avoid federal removal. Local officials, including St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, defend their "separation ordinance" as essential for public safety and community trust, vowing to fight the "unconstitutional claims." This action follows similar DOJ lawsuits against other sanctuary jurisdictions.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government has enforced a nationwide telecommunications shutdown in Afghanistan, resulting in a total internet blackout. This move, which follows weeks of severed fiber-optic connections, has disrupted international news agencies, mobile internet, and satellite TV. While no official reason was given, a Taliban official confirmed the shutdown would last indefinitely. The drastic measure is expected to severely impact banking, e-commerce, and educational opportunities, drawing comparisons to North Korea's internet restrictions and causing widespread loneliness and disruption for citizens.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed performance, influenced by China's manufacturing activity contracting for a sixth consecutive month, though less severely than anticipated. The official Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered 49.8, indicating continued contraction. Concurrently, Australia's central bank maintained its benchmark policy rate at 3.6% due to persistent inflation concerns, which remain at their highest in over a year. These economic indicators contribute to a cautious outlook across the region, with investors assessing the impact of China's industrial slowdown and Australia's monetary policy decisions.

          <p>Germany's ruling coalition, comprising the CDU/CSU and SPD, is holding a closed-door session to address deep divisions and record-low public satisfaction. Key contentious issues include the national budget, with debates over relaxing the "debt brake" and potential tax increases. Welfare payments, immigration policies, and defense spending also highlight significant disagreements between the conservative and social democratic partners. The retreat aims to foster team-building and prioritize economic competitiveness and state modernization, as the government faces pressure from internal dissent and the rising far-right Alternative for Germany party.</p>

          <p>Zijin Gold, the overseas gold-mining arm of China's partially state-owned Zijin Mining, saw its shares surge over 60% during its Hong Kong trading debut. The company's initial public offering raised nearly $3.2 billion, making it the world's second-largest IPO this year. This successful launch coincides with gold prices reaching record highs, driven by strong safe-haven demand, expectations of rate cuts, and global economic uncertainty. The listing contributes to a resurgence in Hong Kong's IPO market and positions Zijin Gold as a significant player in the global gold industry. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan, agreed upon by Trump and Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for detained Gazans, and a future Gaza without Hamas governance. It also leaves the door open for an eventual Palestinian state and outlines an economic development plan for Gaza's reconstruction.

          <p>A Guardian opinion article argues that the growing anti-diversity sentiment in Germany's cultural institutions is a deliberate strategy rather than genuine "fatigue." The piece highlights a shift away from anti-racist and inclusive work, with diversity programs being cut under austerity. It draws parallels to the U.S. backlash under Donald Trump, where critical race theory is deemed a threat. The author contends that this "neutrality" masks a return to the status quo, undermining efforts to broaden perspectives and address underrepresentation in cultural spaces.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to deliver a pivotal speech at the Labour Party conference, describing Britain as being "at a fork in the road." He will contrast Labour's vision of "renewal" and "decency" against an alternative he portrays as decline and division, specifically challenging Nigel Farage's Reform UK Party. The speech comes amidst internal party criticism, a ministerial reshuffle, and dire opinion polls. Starmer will emphasize a "hard path" requiring difficult decisions to rebuild the country, aiming to unite around common good and improve living standards.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan, presented with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is deemed a significant diplomatic move despite Trump's characteristic hyperbole. The BBC analysis highlights that while the plan shifts the U.S. position and adds pressure on Netanyahu, its success faces fundamental obstacles. Hamas's response remains uncertain, with hints that the terms may not fully safeguard Palestinian interests. The plan's ambiguities could allow either side to appear to accept it while sabotaging negotiations, potentially leading to further delays in ending the war.</p>

          <p>Paralympic long jumper and sprinter Stef Reid, an amputee, is campaigning for major brands like Nike and Adidas to sell single shoes instead of pairs. Reid, who lost her right foot in a boat accident, highlights the financial waste and lack of inclusivity for amputees who only need one shoe. She also points out that many people with different sized feet face similar issues. Reid argues that while brands feature inclusive imagery with bladed mannequins, their retail practices often fail to match this commitment, calling for a more adaptable and equitable buying experience.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has reiterated his threat to impose a 100% tariff on all films not made in the U.S., claiming the American film industry has been "stolen" by other countries.

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against Minnesota, Hennepin County, Minneapolis, and St. Paul, challenging their sanctuary city immigration policies. Attorney General Pamela Bondi argues these policies are illegal and compromise public safety by hindering federal immigration enforcement. This action is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to crack down on sanctuary jurisdictions, with similar lawsuits filed against other Democratic-led cities and states. A federal judge recently blocked the administration from cutting funding to 34 such jurisdictions, adding complexity to the ongoing legal and political battle over immigration.</p>

This call for investigation follows the recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, signaling Trump's increasing pressure to prosecute political foes.

The author argues this move would aid UN reforms and reinforce Beijing's global governance vision, leveraging Hong Kong's unique status with English as an official language, common law, and low corporate taxes. China, as the UN's second-largest donor, could utilize Hong Kong to strengthen its international engagement and bring the world closer to China.

The political blame game is in full swing, with Republicans believing they hold the high ground.
