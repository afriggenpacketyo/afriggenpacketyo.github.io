          <p>Global financial markets experienced a significant downturn following President Trump's announcement of new tariffs, sparking investor fears about the economic repercussions. Japan's Nikkei 225 index plummeted nearly 8%, while Hong Kong shares plunged over 12%, marking their worst day in over 16 years. U.S. stock futures also faced heavy selling pressure, with Dow Jones Industrial Average futures down 1,100 points. The tariffs, affecting numerous countries, have raised concerns about inflation, reduced consumer spending, and hindered economic growth, with some analysts warning of a potential severe global trade war.&#x3C;br/&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposed bill in New York aims to prohibit police from making traffic stops for minor violations, such as a broken taillight or expired registration, to address racial disparities in arrests and traffic stops. The bill's proponents argue that minorities are disproportionately targeted, citing data from Nassau County where black and Latino residents account for a higher percentage of arrests and traffic stops compared to their population share. Critics, including law enforcement officials and the district attorney, argue that the measure would endanger public safety by removing a tool for identifying dangerous drivers and preventing more serious crimes. The debate highlights the tension between addressing racial bias and maintaining effective law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Marine Le Pen's supporters gathered in Paris to protest her conviction for embezzling public funds and subsequent ban from running for office, framing the verdict as politically motivated. Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's protégé, accused the French judiciary of attempting to silence the opposition, echoing concerns about judicial interference. Counter-rallies were organized by left-wing parties, warning against what they perceive as a growing trend of U.S.-style authoritarianism within the French far-right, highlighting a nation divided over issues of justice and power.

          <p>China's central bank is signaling a preference for stability over devaluation of the yuan as trade tensions with the U.S. escalate. While the yuan's daily reference rate has been set to a four-month low, it has not breached the 7.2 benchmark against the U.S. dollar, suggesting efforts to stabilize the currency. This approach indicates that China is opting for a measured response to the tariff hikes rather than a sharp devaluation to offset their impact. The central bank is expected to maintain this strategy until the next round of tariffs is announced.&#x3C;br/&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>A federal judge has strongly criticized the U.S. government's deportation of a Maryland man to a prison in El Salvador, calling the decision "wholly lawless." The judge found little evidence to support allegations that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was involved with the MS-13 gang and noted that an immigration judge had previously barred his deportation to El Salvador. The case has raised concerns about due process and the government's authority to detain and deport individuals without proper justification.</p>

          <p>Many senior venture capitalists are leaving big firms, with insiders attributing the trend to a few key reasons. The reasons for these departures include a perception by some investors that decision-making at many large firms is slow, and funds are focused on increasing the pools of money they manage rather than working with promising founders. Some investors in that camp also say they are capitalizing on big changes in the industry, leaving the drawbacks of big firms for the benefits of smaller ones.&#x3C;br/&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>
