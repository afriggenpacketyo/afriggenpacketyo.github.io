          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to nominate economist E.J. Antoni as the new commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The nomination follows Trump's recent dismissal of the former commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, whom he accused of manipulating employment data. Antoni's appointment would place a key Trump ally at the head of the federal agency responsible for producing vital economic statistics, including the monthly jobs report. This move signals the administration's desire for closer oversight of economic data reporting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The three-year mystery of missing cyclist Tony Parsons was solved thanks to the quick thinking of his killer's girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead. After Alexander McKellar confessed to a fatal hit-and-run, he showed her where he had buried the body. Muirhead secretly dropped a Red Bull can to mark the remote location and later informed the police, leading to the recovery of Parsons' remains. This critical clue provided long-awaited answers and a measure of justice for the Parsons family.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified the gunman who attacked the CDC headquarters in Atlanta as Patrick Joseph White, a man who allegedly believed COVID-19 vaccines had negatively impacted his mental health. White fired over 180 shots at the facility, killing a police officer before he died during the incident. His father had reportedly contacted police, noting his son's fixation on vaccines and distress over his dog's death. The event has prompted calls from a CDC workers' union to condemn vaccine misinformation, which they argue fuels hostility and violence against scientists.</p>

          <p>Newly released police documents detail a grim timeline of abuse leading to the death of 10-year-old Rebekah Baptiste in Arizona. The child was found unresponsive at a rural campsite and died days later from injuries including a brain hemorrhage and extensive bruising. Her father and his girlfriend are facing first-degree murder charges, with evidence suggesting they knew of her deteriorating condition but failed to seek medical help. The case has also raised questions about the state's child protective services, which had been contacted multiple times about the family.</p>

          <p>President Trump has federalized the Washington, D.C. police department and deployed at least 800 National Guard troops, citing the need to address crime. This action places the city's police under temporary federal control for up to 30 days, a move permitted by law but raising concerns among critics. While Trump depicted the city as lawless, official data shows that violent crime in D.C. has actually been on a significant decline, reaching a 30-year low. The move is seen by many as a political gesture rather than a response to an actual public safety emergency.</p>

          <p>The cause of death for talent agent Brandon Blackstock, ex-husband of singer Kelly Clarkson, has been confirmed as melanoma. The Butte-Silver Bow County coroner stated that Blackstock died from natural causes at his Montana home while under hospice care, surrounded by his family. His family had previously announced that he had been battling cancer for over three years. Clarkson had recently postponed several of her Las Vegas residency shows for personal reasons, stating she needed to be present for her and Blackstock's two children during their father's illness.</p>

          <p>Former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has stated that male rapists should "probably" lose the right to choose their gender identity. Her comments come in the wake of a controversy in 2023 involving a transgender offender being placed in a women's prison. Sturgeon also admitted some personal responsibility for the debate on gender recognition laws losing its "sense of rationality." This represents a significant evolution in her public stance on the complex issue, which has been a point of intense political and social debate in Scotland.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece characterizes President Trump's federal takeover of the D.C. police as a farcical display of power aimed at a uniquely vulnerable target. The author argues the move is not a response to a genuine crisis, as violent crime rates are at a 30-year low, but rather a performative act of a bully. While the presence of federal officers patrolling quiet neighborhoods may seem absurd, the column warns that the real harm will be felt by the city's most vulnerable populations, particularly the homeless. The action is seen as an admission of weakness, not a prelude to a full authoritarian takeover.</p>

          <p>European leaders are expressing anxiety over their exclusion from the upcoming bilateral summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where the war in Ukraine will be a central topic. While Trump has indicated that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky could potentially attend, the rest of Europe has not been invited to participate in the talks. This has prompted a scramble in Brussels to unify their position and pressure the U.S. to include Ukraine in any peace negotiations, fearing that a deal could be made without their input or consent.</p>

          <p>Ford has announced a major investment to retool its Louisville Assembly Plant to produce a new, more affordable midsize electric pickup truck. The vehicle is targeted to be in the $30,000 price range and is expected to roll out within 18 months. This move represents a strategic pivot for Ford toward smaller, cheaper EVs, aiming to compete with both gasoline-powered trucks and lower-cost Chinese EV manufacturers. The plan focuses on simplifying the vehicle's design and manufacturing process to achieve profitability, a challenge that has previously hindered the company's EV ambitions.</p>

          <p>This satirical article humorously imagines an "Extreme Home Makeover" of the White House, led by President Donald Trump and hosted by J.D. Vance. The piece lampoons Trump's aesthetic preferences, envisioning an Oval Office redesign inspired by King Midas and Versailles, complete with a leopard on a gold leash. It also pokes fun at his political agenda, with jokes about ghost-hunting teams being put in charge of national healthcare and tearing up the Rose Garden to install an Au Bon Pain patio. The overarching theme is Trump's desire to transform the people's house into his own "forever home."</p>

The move prevents U.S. duties on Chinese imports from reverting to the peak levels seen in April. This extension was the expected outcome of recent trade negotiations between the two countries and is the latest example of the administration's unpredictable, shifting trade policy. The pause continues the current state of reduced tariffs, with the U.S. at 30% and China at 10%. (not investment advice)</p>

Once a dominant force with over 30 million subscribers, AOL's dial-up has been largely replaced by faster broadband alternatives.

          <p>The stock prices of lithium mining companies, including U.S.-based Albemarle, surged on Monday following news that a major mine in China has suspended production. Chinese battery maker CATL confirmed it halted operations at its Yichun Project because its permit expired, and it is now working on a renewal. This mine is responsible for approximately 4% of the global lithium supply forecast for 2025. The suspension has tightened an already constrained market, leading investors to anticipate a rise in lithium prices due to the reduced supply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study on a recent major earthquake in Myanmar suggests that the next large earthquake on California's San Andreas fault may not follow expected patterns. Researchers found that the magnitude 7.7 Myanmar quake ruptured a much longer section of a similar fault than anticipated, indicating that seismic events are not simple repeats. This implies California's next "Big One" could be a different size or rupture a different segment than historic quakes like those in 1857 or 1906. The findings highlight the complexity of earthquake behavior and the need to prepare for a wide range of possible scenarios.</p>
