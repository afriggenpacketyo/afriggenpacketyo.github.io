          <h2>JPMorgan Chase Criticizes Fintech Middlemen Like Plaid for Overloading Its Systems with Data Requests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 16:04:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase claims that fintech aggregators, such as Plaid, are overwhelming its systems with excessive and often unnecessary data requests. An internal memo revealed that only 13% of 1.89 billion API calls in June were initiated by customers for actual transactions, with the majority being for data harvesting or product improvement. The bank is now planning to charge these middlemen for data access, a move that could disrupt the fintech ecosystem that has long benefited from free access. This conflict arises as a Biden-era "open banking" rule, which mandated free data sharing, faces a legal challenge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's women's football team, the Lionesses, returned home to a jubilant reception after winning the Euro 2025 tournament. They secured their title in a dramatic 3-1 penalty shootout against Spain, with goalkeeper Hannah Hampton making two crucial saves. Hundreds of fans greeted the team at the airport, and they later attended a reception at Downing Street hosted by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. An open-top bus parade is scheduled in London to celebrate the victory, which was the most-watched television event of the year in the UK.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tensions have emerged within the typically harmonious National Governors Association (NGA) as some Democratic governors are considering withholding their dues. Governors Laura Kelly of Kansas and Tim Walz of Minnesota have expressed frustration that the NGA has not been forceful enough in opposing President Trump's policies, which they see as infringing on states' rights. Incoming NGA vice chair, Democrat Wes Moore, acknowledged that some of the frustrations are justified. However, Republican Governor Kevin Stitt, the incoming NGA chair, cautioned against politicizing the bipartisan group, suggesting it's not the time for members to "take their ball and go home."</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied a request from an investment fund, Azoria Capital, to force the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC) to open its interest rate meetings to the public. The judge ruled that the FOMC is not subject to the "Sunshine Act," which requires open meetings for government agencies. The lawsuit, filed by a firm whose CEO is an ally of President Trump, claimed the Fed was maintaining high interest rates to undermine the president's economic agenda. During the hearing, the judge questioned whether the lawsuit was primarily a publicity stunt for the newly launched investment fund.</p>

          <p>The article explains the "4% rule," a well-known retirement strategy suggesting that withdrawing 4% of a portfolio annually will likely make it last for 30 years. When applied to annuities, this rule serves as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income from an annuity against what a traditional portfolio could provide. For instance, an annuity offering a 5% payout rate might seem superior to a 4% withdrawal, but factors like inflation adjustments and liquidity must be considered. The rule helps retirees evaluate if an annuity's security and longevity protection outweigh the flexibility of traditional investments, often suggesting a hybrid approach. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposal was developed in coordination with France and Germany following the breakdown of recent U.S.-led talks.

President Trump indicated his immediate focus is on getting aid into Gaza, particularly feeding children, before moving to broader peace discussions.

The outcome highlights the legal and social complexities surrounding the campus protests.</p>

          <h2>Major Study Finds Lifestyle Changes Can Improve Cognitive Function in Older Adults</h2>

          <p>A large-scale, two-year study of over 2,100 older adults provides strong evidence that a combination of diet, exercise, and brain training can significantly improve thinking and memory. Participants in the intensive program, which included aerobic exercise, a Mediterranean diet, and cognitive training, showed cognitive function scores similar to people one to two years younger. The results from the POINTER study suggest that such lifestyle interventions can alter the trajectory of age-related cognitive decline. Researchers are now focused on translating these findings into accessible community programs to promote better brain health nationwide.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has significantly accelerated his timeline for a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, now demanding a deal within "10 or 12 days." Speaking during a visit to the UK, Trump expressed frustration over the lack of progress in negotiations, stating "there's no reason in waiting." This new, urgent deadline marks a shift from a previous 50-day timeline and reflects a more aggressive posture from his administration. Trump also voiced his disappointment in Vladimir Putin after recent Russian missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, indicating that such actions are not conducive to achieving a peaceful resolution.</p>

          <p>President Trump's sweeping new tariffs are expected to increase prices for American consumers across several key categories. The article highlights that clothing and footwear, the vast majority of which are imported, will likely see sharp price hikes. Other affected goods include coffee, olive oil, and certain fresh produce, as well as imported beer, wine, and spirits. Cars are also expected to become more expensive, and the tariffs on materials like steel, copper, and lumber could raise the cost of building new homes. These price increases are the direct result of extra taxes being levied on imported goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Congresswoman Delia Ramirez is calling for a congressional hearing into the use of federal funds to detain immigrants at a high-security prison in El Salvador. Her request follows reports of severe human rights abuses, including torture and sexual assault, against nearly 300 Venezuelan immigrants sent to the Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot) by the Trump administration. Ramirez expressed concern that taxpayer dollars may have funded these violations. The men were recently released in a prisoner swap, and their accounts of horrific treatment have intensified scrutiny of the secretive deal between the U.S. and Salvadoran governments.</p>

          <p>A new United Nations report indicates that more than 2.3 billion people worldwide experience moderate to severe food insecurity, with 673.2 million being chronically undernourished. While global hunger levels have slowly declined since the pandemic, the number of people unable to afford a healthy diet has increased due to rising food prices. The report highlights stark regional inequalities, with Africa being the hardest-hit continent, where nearly 58% of the population is food insecure. Gender disparity is also a major issue, as women are disproportionately affected by food insecurity globally, a gap most pronounced in Latin America.</p>

Among those convicted was a lead administrator nicknamed "Boss," who was described as one of the world's most significant purveyors of this material and was sentenced to life in prison.

Despite Coy's claim that he feared for his life, prosecutors argued Hill was following commands and posed no threat. The case was one of several fatal police shootings of Black people that led to national outcry and local reforms, including a $10 million settlement with Hill's family.</p>

Critics lamented that the EU failed to secure more concessions and accepted a deal that is still damaging to European businesses.

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell's legal team is petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal of her 2021 sex trafficking conviction. The core of their argument is that a non-prosecution agreement made with Jeffrey Epstein in Florida should have also protected her from any criminal charges. Her lawyers contend that the government has an obligation to honor this agreement, which they claim was not geographically limited and applied to any co-conspirators. Federal prosecutors have maintained that the agreement was only valid in Florida and does not apply to Maxwell, who was not a party to the original deal.</p>
