        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Craig Moffett, a top-ranked analyst, questions the feasibility of Apple's plan to shift iPhone assembly to India to mitigate tariffs, arguing that components would still originate from China. He suggests that this move may not significantly reduce costs and that Apple's supply chain remains heavily reliant on China. Moffett also anticipates potential backlash against Apple in China due to U.S. tariffs, potentially impacting iPhone sales. He lowered Apple's price target to $141, citing valuation concerns and potential deceleration in consumer demand. (not investment advice)</p>
