          <p>The U.S. Office of the Special Counsel has launched an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who led probes into Donald Trump. The inquiry focuses on potential violations of the Hatch Act, which limits the political activities of federal employees. The investigation follows a request from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged Smith's actions, such as pushing for a rushed trial before the 2024 election, constituted political interference. Smith, who resigned in January 2025, had brought two criminal cases against Trump, both of which were closed after Trump's reelection.</p>

          <p>Actress Kristin Davis recently revealed that a co-star on the 1990s hit show "Melrose Place" refused to speak to her during filming. In a podcast appearance, Davis described the set as competitive and recalled that while she was friends with co-star Marcia Cross, another unnamed actress would not even respond to a "good morning." Davis, who played the villainous Brooke Armstrong for one season, said the experience was intimidating but also felt like she had "won the lottery" as a young actor. She noted this experience later inspired her to be a "welcoming committee" for guest stars on "Sex and the City."</p>

Industry leaders like EY's Paul Brody describe Ethereum as becoming the "plumbing" of Wall Street, integrating with traditional financial systems to handle trillions in payments and tokenized assets.

          <p>President Trump has ordered the firing of Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), following the release of a jobs report that showed slower-than-expected hiring. The July report also included a significant downward revision for job creation in May and June. Trump criticized the numbers as inaccurate and politically motivated, a claim disputed by economists who warned the move threatens the integrity of nonpartisan federal data. The firing of the Senate-confirmed commissioner has been called "basically unprecedented" and has drawn concern from both policy experts and some Republican lawmakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a ruling that places restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming that agents must have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that basing stops on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish is unconstitutional. The decision stems from a lawsuit over raids conducted by the Trump administration that targeted workplaces and led to protests. While the administration argued agents rely on intelligence, the court found the factors used described only a broad profile, violating the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures.</p>

Corbyn and fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana are asking their reported 600,000 registered supporters to help choose a title that encapsulates the party's platform. The process is more than just branding, as the party cannot field election candidates until a name is officially registered with the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules to prevent confusion with existing parties. This unconventional, supporter-led approach aims to build a grassroots identity from the ground up.</p>

The potential sale is also linked to the club's need to comply with the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules, especially after spending nearly £130 million on other players this summer.</p>

The animal, named Winston, was a diplomatic gift intended to curry favor during World War II. For decades, it was rumored that the platypus died from shock caused by a nearby German U-boat attack. However, researchers examining archival records, including the attendant's logbook, have concluded that the creature most likely died from heatstroke as the ship crossed the equator, as water and air temperatures far exceeded what the species can tolerate.</p>

          <p>Decades after David Berkowitz's reign of terror, two of his surviving victims have shared their stories of that fateful period. Robert Violante was on a first date with Stacy Moskowitz when Berkowitz shot them in their car; Moskowitz died from her wounds, while Violante was permanently blinded. In a separate attack, Carl Denaro was shot in the head while sitting in his car, surviving after doctors installed a metal plate in his skull. Both men rejoiced at Berkowitz's capture but have lived with the physical and emotional scars of being targeted by one of New York's most notorious serial killers.</p>

          <h2>Ohio Sheriff's New Patrol Boat Sinks in Marina Just Two Months After Launch</h2>

          <p>The Ottawa County Sheriff's new $360,000 patrol boat sank at a marina in Port Clinton, Ohio, during a severe storm. The 34-foot vessel, which had its maiden voyage just two months prior, was submerged after heavy rains and a suspected seiche—a rapid, wind-driven rise in water level—compromised its dive doors. Officials believe the boat was dragged under while tied to the dock. The boat has since been raised, but its electronics are likely ruined, though the engines are expected to be salvageable. The incident is a significant setback for the sheriff's Lake Erie patrol capabilities.</p>

          <h2>Criminals Exploit TikTok Trend with Dangerous Counterfeit Labubu Dolls</h2>

          <p>A global TikTok craze for Labubu dolls has led to a flood of dangerous counterfeit versions entering the market, according to UK authorities. Trading Standards officers have seized thousands of fake dolls, which are often made with cheap materials that pose a choking hazard to children as small parts easily break off. The authentic dolls, made by Pop Mart, are in such high demand that they sell out in seconds, creating a lucrative market for both scalpers and criminals producing knock-offs. Authorities warn that counterfeit toys can also contain toxic chemicals and are urging consumers to be cautious of "too good to be true" prices.</p>

          <p>Fifteen people were arrested across England following clashes between anti-migrant groups and counter-demonstrators outside hotels housing asylum seekers. Protests took place in London, Newcastle, and Manchester, with police making arrests for public order offenses and other infractions. The demonstrations highlight ongoing tensions surrounding the UK's asylum policy. In response to the situation, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans to fast-track the asylum appeals process to "restore order and control" and reduce the number of migrants being housed in hotels.</p>

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin publicly criticized his players' effort and mentality following a disappointing 1-1 draw against Motherwell in their first league match of the season. Martin stated his team was "lucky to get a point" and lambasted what he called a "mentality problem," accusing some players of needing to "drop their ego." The unusually harsh public comments so early in the season have raised concerns among pundits and fans. This marks the third consecutive season that Rangers have failed to win their opening league fixture, putting early pressure on the new manager and his squad.</p>
