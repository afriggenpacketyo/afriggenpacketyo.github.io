          <p>A U.S. District Judge in New York has denied Saudi Arabia's motion to dismiss a long-running lawsuit, allowing families of 9/11 victims to continue their legal action. The lawsuit alleges that the Saudi government provided material support to some of the al Qaeda hijackers, a claim the kingdom has consistently denied. The judge found that the plaintiffs presented reasonable evidence regarding the roles of individuals with alleged ties to the Saudi government in assisting two of the hijackers, overcoming the defendant's arguments that their assistance was coincidental. This ruling, enabled by the 2016 Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, allows the case to move forward toward a potential trial.</p>

          <p>Investigators have revealed that the perpetrator of the Annunciation Catholic School shooting, Robin Westman, expressed extreme hatred towards a wide variety of groups and held a "deranged obsession" with previous mass murderers. According to law enforcement, writings left by the 23-year-old indicated a primary desire to kill and watch children suffer, rather than a specific grievance against the church, which Westman had previously attended. The attack, which killed two children and injured 18 others, was intended to cause maximum terror for personal notoriety. Officials emphasized the shooter's indiscriminate animosity, noting expressions of hate toward numerous racial, ethnic, and religious groups.</p>

The White House confirmed the firing, stating Primus did not align with the President's "America First agenda" and that new nominations would be made shortly. The dismissal occurs as the board is reviewing a major proposed merger between freight rail companies Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern, adding to a series of recent high-profile firings by the administration.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has publicly called for the Cleveland Browns to start rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who is currently third on the depth chart. Speaking on his "New Heights" podcast, Kelce argued that starting Sanders would generate significant excitement and viewership, stating "give the people what they want." His brother, Jason Kelce, offered a counterpoint, defending the Browns' coaching staff for making decisions they believe give the team the best chance to win. The discussion comes amid ongoing public debate and conspiracy theories regarding Sanders' limited playing time and draft position, which some pundits have controversially attributed to league-wide collusion.</p>

          <p>Best Buy reported fiscal second-quarter revenue and earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by a modest recovery in sales. However, the consumer electronics retailer maintained its full-year forecast, citing uncertainty around the potential impact of tariffs on consumer spending and its own business operations.

          <p>A recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) hiring expo near Dallas aimed to recruit thousands of new officers as part of the Trump administration's plan to significantly expand deportations. The event attracted a diverse crowd, including military veterans and individuals seeking a sense of purpose, with many citing the president's immigration policies as a key motivation for applying. The administration plans to hire 10,000 new officers by next year, nearly tripling the current workforce, and has streamlined the training process to deploy them more quickly. Applicants expressed a desire to "defend the homeland" and "clean up the country," reflecting the strong appeal of the agency's mission to its new recruits.</p>

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a hose in the rear brake system can rupture, which could lead to increased brake pedal travel and longer stopping distances, elevating the risk of a crash. Ford will notify the affected owners in early September, though the remedy for the issue is still under development and is not expected to be available until next April. This action adds to a series of recalls issued by the automaker this year.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while President Trump's political pressure on the Federal Reserve is concerning, the more significant threat to its independence is "fiscal dominance" driven by rising U.S. public debt. As debt surpasses 100% of GDP and interest payments consume a large portion of federal spending, the Fed faces increasing pressure to keep interest rates low to manage the government's borrowing costs. This dynamic subordinates monetary policy to fiscal needs, potentially forcing the Fed to tolerate higher inflation to erode the real value of the debt. The author contends that regardless of who is president, this fiscal reality will persist, making congressional spending restraint essential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon is significantly expanding its grocery business by adding fresh and perishable items to its existing same-day delivery service in over 1,000 cities. This strategic move allows Prime members to order items like eggs and produce alongside non-perishables and other goods for unified, rapid delivery from the company's fulfillment hubs. The initiative leverages Amazon's extensive logistics network, which has been retrofitted with temperature-controlled environments to handle fresh food at scale. While this expansion poses a threat to competitors like Instacart and traditional grocers, analysts note that Amazon's initial selection is limited and that success will depend on further investment.</p>

          <p>A North Carolina election official, James Yokeley Jr., has been arrested and has since resigned after he allegedly placed illegal drugs into his granddaughters' ice cream. The incident came to light when Yokeley himself flagged down a police officer, claiming the children had found pills in ice cream purchased from a Dairy Queen. However, a police investigation, including a review of video footage, allegedly showed Yokeley placing the pills, later identified as containing MDMA and cocaine, into the food himself. He has been charged with contaminating food with a controlled substance and felony child abuse, though a motive has not been shared.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched one of the largest air attacks on Kyiv since the war began, killing at least 18 people and injuring dozens more. The overnight barrage of missiles and drones damaged multiple buildings, including the offices of the EU delegation to Ukraine and the British Council. European leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen and Emmanuel Macron, strongly condemned the attack as an act of "terror and barbarism" and a sign that Russia is not interested in peace. The attack comes amid a faltering diplomatic process, with recent talks failing to secure any meaningful progress toward a ceasefire or lasting peace agreement.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, has won a decisive victory in the town's first formal election in at least 60 years. Braxton's win, with 66 votes to his opponent's 26, solidifies his position four years after he was initially locked out of the town hall by the previous all-white leadership. Previously, the town's government positions were handed down without elections, a practice challenged in a federal lawsuit by Black residents. The federally-mandated election marks a significant moment for the majority-Black town and serves as a conclusive resolution to the prolonged dispute over its leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nike is conducting another round of layoffs as it continues a broad business realignment under CEO Elliott Hill. The cuts are expected to affect less than 1% of the company's corporate workforce and are part of a strategy to refocus the organization around specific sports categories rather than broad gender-based divisions like men's and women's. This restructuring aims to reverse a recent sales decline and reignite the brand's innovation pipeline by creating "sport-obsessed teams." The move undoes a previous organizational structure and is intended to bring the company's focus squarely back to athletes and sport culture, which some critics felt was lost in recent years.</p>

In interviews, former leaders like Demetre Daskalakis and Debra Houry stated their group resignation was a signal that public health is in danger due to political interference from Health and Human Services. They reported that CDC experts were prevented from briefing Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on critical issues like measles and COVID-19. The departures, spurred by the ouster of Director Susan Monarez, have left remaining staff demoralized and fearful for the agency's future.</p>

The sportswear retailer Fanatics reported it was the single biggest sales day for Kelce's jersey since the last Super Bowl. This follows a similar pattern from last season, when jersey sales jumped 400% after Swift attended her first Chiefs game to support him. The huge increase underscores the immense cultural and commercial impact of the couple's relationship, as Swift's massive fanbase continues to enthusiastically engage with Kelce's NFL career and related merchandise.</p>

          <p>A 36-year-old woman was seriously injured after being attacked by a bear while jogging near her home in Kenai, Alaska. The attack occurred early in the morning near her driveway, and the bear, believed to be a brown bear, dragged her approximately 100 yards before a neighbor found her. The woman was medically evacuated to a hospital for treatment of her injuries. State troopers and wildlife officials searched for the animal but were unable to locate it, and have since warned local residents to remain on high alert. While Alaska is home to a large bear population, attacks on humans resulting in hospitalization or death remain relatively rare.</p>

          <p>A financial filing from Nvidia has revealed a significant concentration in its customer base, with two unnamed direct customers accounting for 39% of its revenue in the most recent quarter. "Customer A" and "Customer B" comprised 23% and 16% of total sales, respectively, a notable increase from the previous year. This disclosure is fueling debate about the sustainability of Nvidia's growth, as it suggests a heavy reliance on a few large partners, likely major cloud service providers. While Nvidia's data center business continues to boom, the high level of customer concentration raises concerns for some analysts about potential risks to its future revenue streams.

          <p>A new analysis indicates that American workers are becoming less likely to switch jobs as the labor market cools, marking a significant downshift from the "Great Resignation" era. Data from Bank of America shows the rate of job changes has trended downward since its 2022 peak and is now only slightly above 2019 levels. Correspondingly, the median pay increase for those who do switch jobs has fallen from a high of 20% in 2022 to just 7% in July. This trend suggests that bargaining power is shifting from employees back to employers as hiring slows and business uncertainty leads companies to reduce new opportunities.
