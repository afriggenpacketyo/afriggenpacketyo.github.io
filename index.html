          <p>Despite a US-brokered ceasefire between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, diplomats and experts express skepticism about its long-term sustainability due to deep-seated distrust and unresolved issues. The article highlights that while the ceasefire ended a period of intense hostilities, analysts from both sides emphasize that underlying problems such as Kashmir, terrorism, and the Indus Waters Treaty still strain relations. The US, Saudi Arabia, and Iran played mediating roles, but the ceasefire's stability remains uncertain, with both militaries remaining on high alert and continued accusations of violations. Experts warn that the deal is no guarantee of future stability, and enduring peace will require addressing the complex dynamics of civil-military relations, particularly in Pakistan.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering accepting a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One, with ownership transferring to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation before the end of his term. The article details that the unusual arrangement has raised legal questions about potential violations of bribery laws and the Constitution's emoluments clause. Lawyers from the White House counsel's office and the Department of Justice have analyzed the proposal, concluding that it is legally permissible because the gift is not conditioned on any official act and is given to the Air Force, then the library foundation. The Air Force would modify the aircraft to meet military specifications before transferring it to the foundation.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed reservations about cutting the consumption tax to combat inflation, citing concerns about the impact on state coffers. Senior officials in his administration and the Liberal Democratic Party are reportedly hesitant to reduce the tax, which is currently 8% for food and beverages and 10% for other items. The coalition government is working on an economic package ahead of the House of Councillors election this summer. Meanwhile, the article also notes that app-based digital salary payments are struggling to gain traction in Japan, despite the country's move toward a cashless society.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Marine Corps has established the Marine Corps Attack Drone Team (MCADT) to address the rapid development of armed first-person view (FPV) drone technology. The article explains that the team will integrate FPV drones into the Fleet Marine Force to enhance small-unit lethality. Experts argue that the United States lags behind countries like China and Russia in drone production and needs to view drones as a form of ammunition. The MCADT aims to refine drone employment tactics and ensure Marines remain agile and lethal in modern combat, as the U.S. enters a drone arms race with its adversaries.</p>

          <p>A plan to replace public basketball courts with pickleball facilities in Fort Lauderdale's historic beachfront area has sparked controversy, with some residents suggesting racial motives. The article outlines that the basketball courts, built shortly after segregation ended on the city's beaches, are popular among a diverse group of players. Critics fear that the conversion to pickleball will destroy a long-standing community tradition and exclude minority residents who frequent the courts. While developers claim pickleball was chosen for its broader appeal, opponents argue that the decision reflects an effort to 'whiten' the beach.</p>

          <p>Germany has begun rejecting asylum seekers at its borders, marking a shift in immigration policy under the new government of Chancellor Friedrich Merz. The article reports that, out of 365 undocumented entries, 286 migrants and refugees were sent back, including 19 asylum seekers, due to invalid visas, fake documents, or entry suspensions. The move aims to curb illegal migrant entries, with Merz arguing that Germany is surrounded by safe EU states where migrants should first apply for refuge. The decision has drawn criticism from politicians and neighboring EU countries, particularly Poland, citing concerns about border congestion and compliance with EU law.</p>

          <p>The rise of luxury dog hotels in South Africa has sparked controversy due to the country's extreme inequality, with some questioning the ethics of extravagant pet care amid widespread poverty. The article highlights the contrast between these hotels, offering amenities like plunge pools and gourmet treats, and the homeless population living nearby. While hotel owners argue they provide employment and support animal adoption programs, critics contend that prioritizing luxury pet services over addressing basic human needs underscores the lack of political will to tackle structural inequality. The existence of these establishments serves as a constant reminder of the unfulfilled promises of post-apartheid South Africa.</p>
