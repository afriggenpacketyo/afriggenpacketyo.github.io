        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This year's San Diego Comic-Con proceeded without major presentations from Hollywood giants like Marvel Studios, leading to a different atmosphere for the renowned pop culture event. However, many attendees expressed that the change had a silver lining, as it made it easier to access panels in the famously crowded Hall H. The programming highlighted other growing areas of fandom, including television series like "Alien: Earth" and the significant presence of anime, such as "Demon Slayer." This shift suggests the convention is evolving beyond blockbuster films to reflect broader trends in fan culture.</p>

          <p>A Wyandotte County Sheriff's Deputy, 34-year-old Elijah Ming, was shot and killed while responding to a domestic violence call in Kansas City, Kansas. The nine-year veteran of the force was accompanying a woman to her home to safely retrieve her belongings when a man inside opened fire without warning. The suspect, identified as Shawn Harris, later surrendered after a standoff with police and was taken into custody. Local officials mourned the loss, describing it as a senseless act of violence and asking the community for prayers for the deputy's family.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have successfully negotiated a trade agreement, averting the threat of escalating tariffs that were set to begin on August 1. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods, a lower rate than previously threatened, while also securing commitments from the EU to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make $600 billion in new investments. This agreement provides stability for the transatlantic trading relationship, though some European leaders noted the new tariffs will still present challenges for trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the England Lionesses' historic victory in the Euro 2025 final, Downing Street has indicated there are no plans to announce an extra bank holiday to celebrate the occasion.

While a celebratory parade is planned in London, the government appears to be weighing the economic cost of a public holiday, which has been estimated to be over £1 billion.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the political challenge Donald Trump faces with the Jeffrey Epstein controversy, arguing that his history of promoting anti-establishment conspiracy theories complicates his position. Having profited from distrust in government, he now presides over that same government and is expected by his base to reveal hidden truths. His inability to provide satisfactory answers or documents regarding Epstein only deepens suspicion among the very supporters he cultivated with such theories. This creates a unique political dilemma where his usual tactics of deflection may be proving less effective.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article from The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration's dismantling of U.S. anti-corruption initiatives has signaled a global tolerance for kleptocracy. It posits that leaders worldwide have observed this shift and are acting accordingly, citing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's recent move to weaken his country's anti-corruption agencies as a key example. The author suggests that by removing pressure for transparent governance, the U.S. is fostering a new world order where corruption is no longer a liability, even for leaders once seen as champions of democracy.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators, led by Chris Van Hollen, is formally urging the Trump administration to cease all U.S. funding for the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). In a letter to the Secretary of State, they expressed grave concerns over the private organization's methods and the high number of civilian deaths reported at its distribution sites. The senators advocate for resuming support for the established UN-led aid mechanisms, with enhanced oversight, to address the catastrophic humanitarian crisis and growing starvation in Gaza.</p>
