          <p>An Air India plane bound for London crashed shortly after takeoff in Ahmedabad, India, resulting in 246 fatalities, marking the first fatal incident for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The aircraft, carrying 242 people, reached a maximum altitude of 625 feet before crashing into a residential area. Investigators will examine the plane's black boxes, maintenance records, pilot training, and weather conditions to determine the cause of the crash. Boeing and GE Aerospace will assist in the investigation, which will explore factors ranging from mechanical issues to pilot error. The families of the deceased will be provided approximately $116,000 and medical expenses for the injured will be covered. Optimism is understandably low given the loss of life and potential implications for the airline industry.</p>

          <p>Brazilian meat giant JBS commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.65 per share, valuing the company at approximately $30 billion. The company's U.S. listing follows a history of corruption and bribery allegations, including a $3.2 billion fine paid by its holding company in 2017 to settle bribery charges. Despite the scandals, the SEC approved JBS's listing in April, and shareholders narrowly approved the move the following month. JBS operates globally, with divisions in Brazil, the U.S., and Australia, and owns over 80% of Pilgrim's Pride. While the company's U.S. debut represents a significant milestone, its past controversies continue to cast a shadow over its operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychological research indicates that far-right narratives surrounding the LA protests could increase support for authoritarian leaders like Donald Trump. Studies suggest that perceptions of societal instability can lead individuals to favor leaders who promise order and control. The Trump administration's response to the protests, including deploying the National Guard and comparing demonstrators to a "foreign invasion," aligns with this dynamic. Experts emphasize the importance of addressing uncertainty and communicating the meaning and purpose of political actions to counteract the appeal of authoritarianism. The article argues that the perception of society breaking down can increase support for authoritarianism and the desire for a strong leader.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration from implementing further sections of an executive order seeking to overhaul U.S. elections.

The ruling affirms that states, not the president, have the power to set election rules, according to the Constitution.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is modifying planned disability benefit cuts to reassure Labour MPs concerned about the reforms. The changes include extending the transitional payment period for those losing Personal Independence Payment (Pip) from four to 13 weeks. Benefits recipients with severe health conditions will not be reassessed and will receive additional income support through Universal Credit. A scheme will be introduced to allow disabled individuals to try employment without losing benefits. While some Labour MPs remain critical, others view the protections as sensible, as there is disagreement among MPs as to the impact of the new protections.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump urged Iran to reach a nuclear deal "before there is nothing left" following Israeli airstrikes against Iran. Trump claimed that he gave Iran numerous opportunities to make a deal and warned them of the U.S. and Israel's military capabilities. He stated that further bloodshed could be prevented if Iran makes a deal to save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. Trump's comments come amid heightened tensions in the Middle East and ongoing concerns about Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Seven men have been convicted of sexually exploiting two teenage girls in Rochdale over a five-year period, with the victims subjected to repeated sexual assault and abuse. The girls, groomed from the age of 13, were treated as "sex slaves," provided with drugs, alcohol, and accommodation by the men. The prosecution stated the girls were "children passed around for sex, abused, degraded and then discarded." The case highlights failures by authorities at the time and has led to apologies from Greater Manchester Police, who say they have since improved their handling of such investigations.</p>

          <p>Following Israel's attack on Iran, Hezbollah's restrained response has raised questions about its capabilities and priorities. The group, once Iran's strongest militia, issued a statement condemning the attack but did not offer to retaliate.

The situation reflects growing pressure on Hezbollah and efforts by Lebanon's government to contain the group's influence.

These issues include unusual or lingering odors, a weak online presence with poor listing photos, inadequate lighting, and improper furniture layout. Clutter can also negatively impact buyer perception, making a house appear smaller and disorganized. Addressing these less obvious factors can create a more inviting atmosphere and increase the likelihood of receiving a full-price offer.</p>

          <p>Zornitsa Gyutsova, a Bulgarian influencer, has sparked outrage for her misogynistic online content that encourages violence against women. Gyutsova's views promote the idea that women prefer men who physically assault them and that men should control their partners psychologically and physically. Despite complaints filed with authorities, no charges have been brought against Gyutsova due to the lack of a specific law against gender discrimination. This case highlights the challenges in addressing online misogyny and the need for societal and legal changes to protect women from violence.</p>
