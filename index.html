          <p>Apple's second fiscal quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street's expectations, driven by strong iPhone, Mac, and iPad sales. Revenue reached $95.4 billion, exceeding the estimated $94.66 billion, while earnings per share came in at $1.65, slightly above the projected $1.63. However, the Services division, which includes iCloud subscriptions and Apple Music, underperformed, generating $26.65 billion in revenue compared to the expected $26.70 billion. CEO Tim Cook highlighted the company's strategic sourcing of iPhones from India and other products from Vietnam to mitigate tariff impacts, also noting Apple's commitment to increasing its dividend and share repurchases.</p>

          <p>Airbnb's first-quarter results were generally in line with expectations, but the company's revenue guidance for the second quarter disappointed investors, leading to a decline in shares. The company projects revenue between $2.99 billion and $3.05 billion, slightly below analysts' forecasts of $3.04 billion. Airbnb cited "softer results" in the U.S. due to broader economic uncertainties, including softness in travel from Canada to the U.S. The company is also planning updates to its platform beyond places to stay and has removed 450,000 listings since updating its host quality system in 2023.</p>

Authorities were not initially requested to respond due to the call being medical in nature, but the Sheriff's Office initiated an investigation after Sperbeck's death. Elway expressed his devastation at the loss of his close friend and business partner, while Sperbeck's family also released a statement mourning his passing.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) reported first-quarter revenue of $29.27 billion, falling short of the $29.42 billion expected by analysts, marking the third consecutive quarter of revenue misses. Despite the miss, AWS operating income totaled $11.55 billion, exceeding estimates, with an operating margin of 39.5%, the widest since 2014. Amazon is investing in data centers to support AI models from Anthropic and other cloud clients, and CEO Andy Jassy anticipates the cost of AI for customers will decrease over time due to Amazon's custom chips.

          <p>This article examines how gold performs during economic recessions, noting its historical tendency to gain value as investors seek safe-haven assets during downturns. The article highlights gold's performance during the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic, attributing its resilience to factors like its safe-haven appeal, central banks' monetary policies, and concerns about currency devaluation. While past performance is not indicative of future results, gold's long-standing reputation as a store of value suggests it could remain a resilient asset during economic uncertainty. Other factors, such as central bank purchasing, inflation, geopolitical tensions, and currency movements, can also influence gold prices. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the change, President Trump respects Waltz and has offered him a high-profile new role.

However, the company projects second-quarter operating income between $13 billion and $17.5 billion, below the consensus forecast, and sales between $159 billion and $164 billion, also slightly below expectations. Amazon cited "tariffs and trade policies" as factors that could impact its guidance, and sales in the cloud division came in just below consensus estimates for the third consecutive quarter.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas ruled that the Alien Enemies Act does not authorize President Trump to deport Venezuelan immigrants alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The ruling, which applies to migrants detained in the southern district of Texas, is significant as it directly addresses the government's use of the 1798 act. The judge determined that the president's invocation of the act exceeded its scope, as the proclamation did not suggest an organized armed attack or a threat from Venezuela through Tren de Aragua members. The Trump administration had relied on the law to aggressively deport Venezuelan migrants, but the Supreme Court ruled that those being removed needed adequate notice to file a legal challenge.</p>

Maher emphasized that his criticism is not based on reflexive Republican opposition but on his assessment that these issues are "just objectively bad."</p>

          <p>The death toll from sectarian violence in Syria has exceeded 100, according to a war monitoring group, as unrest spreads to new areas. The violence began after an audio clip circulated on social media, allegedly featuring a Druse cleric insulting the Prophet Muhammad, leading to attacks by Sunni Muslim extremist groups on Druse populations. Clashes have spread from the outskirts of Damascus to Sweida, a Druse-controlled region, raising fears of further fracturing in the country. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that extremist militants killed 35 Druse on the road connecting Sweida to Damascus.</p>

          <p>New York lawmakers are considering a deal that would significantly weaken oversight of religious schools, potentially benefiting the Hasidic Jewish community. The proposal has raised concerns among education experts, including State Education Commissioner Betty Rosa, who described the changes as a "travesty" for children attending religious schools that lack a basic secular education. The potential deal is the culmination of years of lobbying by Hasidic leaders and their political representatives, with the state also considering lowering the standards schools must meet to demonstrate compliance with the law.</p>

          <p>A fourth round of Iran-US talks over Tehran's nuclear program has been postponed, with Iran citing "logistical and technical reasons." The US stated that the timing of the talks had not been confirmed. This comes after President Trump threatened action against those buying Iranian oil or petrochemicals, following fresh sanctions imposed on companies linked to Tehran. Despite the postponement, both sides appear eager to avoid war, although reports from Tehran suggest growing doubt about the usefulness of the talks due to the new sanctions and perceived contradictory positions from the US delegation.</p>

Nvidia dismissed these claims as "tall tales," advocating for American firms to focus on innovation instead. The restrictions, called the "AI Diffusion Rule," aim to prevent rival nations like China from advancing in the AI arms race.</p>
