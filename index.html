          <h2>China Implements Export Restrictions on Key Electric Vehicle Battery Technologies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 06:00:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has officially enacted export controls on eight critical technologies related to electric vehicle (EV) battery production, requiring government licenses for their transfer abroad. The restrictions target key components like battery cathodes, including materials such as lithium iron phosphate (LFP), and also cover five technologies for lithium extraction and processing. This move is seen as a strategic effort by Beijing to maintain its dominance in the global EV supply chain by controlling the dissemination of its advanced manufacturing techniques. The article details the specific technologies affected.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kenneth Roth, a former Human Rights Watch director, speculates on whether Donald Trump could be persuaded to pressure Israel regarding its actions in Gaza. The article suggests that Trump's susceptibility to ego and his transactional nature might create an opening for a policy shift, unlike other US presidents who are more constrained by domestic political pressures. Roth argues that Trump's desire for a Nobel Peace Prize and aversion to large financial commitments could potentially be leveraged to alter his stance, despite his administration's previous support for the Israeli government's hardline policies.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Party is experiencing an internal debate among three competing factions, shaping its future direction following the Biden era. The establishment is being challenged by the "Abundance" faction, which prioritizes tangible progress in housing and energy, and by a reinvigorated left, inspired by Zohran Mamdani's primary win in New York. While all groups criticize the party's past effectiveness, they offer different visions for governance and electoral strategy, from deregulation and building to expanding social programs, setting the stage for a prolonged ideological contest.</p>

          <p>Russia's Defense Ministry reported intercepting at least 126 Ukrainian drones in an overnight attack that targeted 11 regions, including the area around Moscow. The barrage, one of the largest since the conflict's escalation, caused flight disruptions at major airports and resulted in casualties and damage in several regions, with three deaths reported in Belgorod. Concurrently, Russia launched its own drone attack on Ukraine. The events highlight a significant increase in drone warfare by both sides in recent months amid stalled ceasefire negotiations.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking 61% year-on-year surge in its second-quarter profit, significantly exceeding market estimates.

Despite the strong performance, TSMC acknowledges potential future risks, including uncertainties related to US tariff policies and potential order reductions from smartphone and PC clients due to macroeconomic conditions.

          <p>Recent polling indicates significant public doubt regarding the performance of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, with a third of voters believing the country's situation has worsened since he took office. The survey reveals that only 22% of voters see an improvement, and even among his own party's supporters, opinions are divided. This lukewarm public sentiment comes as Merz travels to London to sign a major friendship treaty with the UK, a move aimed at resetting post-Brexit relations and strengthening European security amidst regional and transatlantic pressures.</p>

          <p>A devastating fire at a new shopping mall in al-Kut, Iraq, has resulted in the deaths of at least 61 people, with many victims, including women and children, dying from suffocation. The blaze broke out late Wednesday in the five-story building, which had opened only a week prior. While rescue teams managed to save over 45 people, many are still reported missing. The incident has once again drawn attention to the persistent issue of poor building standards and lax safety enforcement in Iraq, which have contributed to numerous fatal fires in recent years.</p>

          <p>A body has been found by rescue teams in the Italian Alps who were searching for Matthew Hall, a 33-year-old British hiker from Hull. The discovery was made in a crevice near a mountain viewpoint where Hall had sent a photograph to friends on the day he went missing.

His family has been informed, and a helicopter was required to assist in the recovery due to the dangerous terrain.</p>

          <p>Andre Correa do Lago, the diplomat presiding over the upcoming UN climate talks in Brazil, acknowledges the difficulty of keeping climate change a top priority for global leaders. In an interview, he explained that ongoing wars, trade disputes, and political shifts are drawing attention away from the escalating climate threat. He emphasized that despite these immediate crises, climate change is progressing and poses a larger long-term danger. A key objective for the upcoming summit is to better integrate climate considerations into economic and financial policies, reframing climate action as a driver of growth.</p>

This follows a report of three other students who lost contact with their families after traveling to the same area, allegedly invited by an online acquaintance.

          <p>A potential new trade agreement between the U.S. and China is likely to be structured similarly to the phase one deal from Donald Trump's first term, according to former Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, Biegun suggested the core of any new deal would involve a commitment from China to make substantial purchases of American agricultural and industrial goods. He noted that Chinese officials seem to recognize they must offer this to balance the trade relationship, as the trade deficit remains the primary metric for fairness for the Trump administration.

          <p>The exclusion of Wales captain Jac Morgan from the British and Irish Lions' squad for the first Test against Australia is being seen as a stark symbol of Welsh rugby's recent struggles. For the first time since 1896, no Welsh players will feature in a Lions Test against one of the three major southern hemisphere nations. This is a dramatic shift from 2013, when ten Welshmen started in a series-clinching victory. The lack of representation underscores the challenges facing the national team, which recently ended an 18-match losing streak, and the professional game in Wales.</p>

The vote followed a lengthy session where numerous amendments to protect the funding were rejected, and it passed despite opposition from two Republican senators who joined the Democrats, citing a lack of detail from the administration.</p>
