          <p>Prominent Ukrainian politician Andriy Parubiy was shot and killed in the western city of Lviv. Parubiy, who formerly served as the speaker of Ukraine's parliament, was a key figure in the 2014 Maidan movement that sought closer ties with the European Union. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the killing as a "terrible murder" and has directed national police and security services to launch a full investigation to find the perpetrator. The motive for the attack remains unclear at this time.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that the majority of tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump are illegal, stating they exceed the authority granted to the executive branch by law. The court emphasized that the power to impose tariffs is constitutionally vested in Congress. The ruling has been temporarily paused to allow the Trump administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court, a move the administration has confirmed it will pursue. This decision marks a significant legal challenge to the core of Trump's aggressive trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the United Kingdom are continuing their legal efforts to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling against such a measure. The court overturned an injunction obtained by Epping Forest District Council, but this has not deterred other councils, who cite planning law breaches and unsustainable strain on local services. The UK government maintains that using hotels is a temporary solution, while critics argue the situation has become a flashpoint for community tensions and far-right targeting.</p>

The display includes the original English version, the first U.S. edition, and the earliest Chinese translation from 1938. Snow's work provided one of the first Western accounts of the Chinese Communist Party's early days, featuring interviews with key figures like Mao Zedong.

          <h2>US Senators Urge for an Immediate and Massive Surge of Humanitarian Aid to Gaza</h2>

          <p>A group of five Democratic U.S. senators is calling on the Secretary of State to facilitate a "massive surge" of humanitarian aid, particularly baby formula, to Gaza, where international monitors have officially declared a famine. The letter highlights the dire situation for infants and malnourished mothers, as severe restrictions on aid entry and distribution have led to deaths from starvation. The senators argue that the U.S. has a moral obligation to use its full authority to address the crisis, reflecting growing pressure within the Democratic party to take a stronger stance on the humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

          <p>A Department of Homeland Security policy under the Trump administration is being used to keep immigrants in custody indefinitely, even after immigration judges have granted them bond. The policy argues that all individuals who entered the U.S. illegally are ineligible for bail, and it employs a rarely used maneuver to automatically pause a judge's release order while the government appeals. This practice is affecting long-term residents like Luis Fernandez, a father from Ecuador, whose case illustrates the administration's strategy of making the immigration process highly punitive.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, the New Orleans education system continues to feel the effects of the mass termination of over 4,000 teachers, most of whom were experienced Black women. This drastic change occurred as the state took over most of the city's schools, transitioning them to a charter system that initially employed a significantly whiter, less experienced workforce. While the number of Black teachers has partially recovered, it has never returned to pre-Katrina levels. Black-led organizations are now working to rebuild the educator pipeline and restore representation in schools.</p>

The article advises brides to start shopping about a year in advance and to create a comprehensive "attire budget" that includes not just the dress but also alterations, a veil, and other accessories, which can add substantial, often overlooked, expenses.</p>

          <p>In an interview, author and anti-diet advocate Virginia Sole-Smith addresses the growing anxiety surrounding children's diets, particularly concerning ultra-processed foods. She argues that restricting kids' food can be harmful and that the focus should be on ensuring access to enough food rather than obsessing over nutritional minutiae. Sole-Smith suggests that much of the panic is rooted in "diet culture," which teaches people to distrust their bodies and creates unhealthy power struggles. She advises parents to focus on fostering a joyful relationship with food and respecting a child's bodily autonomy.</p>

          <p>The Ndlovu Youth Choir from South Africa has released a Zulu-language translation of Queen's iconic song "Bohemian Rhapsody," marking the first time the band has ever authorized a translation of the anthem. The project received the blessing of Queen's surviving members and the Mercury Phoenix Trust, coinciding with the song's 50th anniversary. The choir's artistic director noted the connection to Freddie Mercury, who was born in Zanzibar, Tanzania. The new version carefully translates the original lyrics while weaving in African musical traditions, creating a unique celebration of the classic rock song.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh—Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean—have set a new world record for the fastest non-stop, unsupported row across the Pacific Ocean, completing the 9,000-mile journey in just under 140 days. Their voyage from Peru to Australia was perilous, involving encounters with violent tropical storms that forced lengthy detours and even swept one brother overboard. The trio undertook the grueling challenge to raise over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar. After arriving in Cairns, Australia, they were reunited with family and expressed relief and excitement for simple comforts.</p>

          <p>Preliminary data from the CDC indicates that fatal drug overdoses in the United States have fallen to their lowest level in five years, with a steady decline observed since mid-2023. Despite this significant drop in deaths, President Donald Trump has continued to frame the fentanyl crisis as a growing threat to justify policies such as new mandatory minimum sentences and trade tariffs. Public health experts are studying the reasons for the sharp decline, attributing it to a combination of successful supply chain disruptions and improved access to addiction treatment and healthcare services.</p>

          <p>Many European countries are reconsidering or modifying their military conscription policies in response to the changing security landscape. Germany, which ended its draft in 2011, is introducing a new voluntary service model that could become mandatory if needed. Meanwhile, nations like Sweden have already reinstated conscription, and countries with existing drafts, such as Denmark and Finland, are expanding their programs. This trend reflects a broader move across the continent to bolster military readiness and increase the number of available reserve forces, with each nation tailoring its approach based on its unique needs.</p>

          <p>At least three people have died after protesters set fire to a regional parliament building in Makassar, Indonesia, amid widespread and violent demonstrations across the country. The protests were initially sparked by public anger over a new, generous housing allowance for lawmakers at a time of economic hardship for many citizens. The unrest escalated significantly after a video circulated showing the death of a ride-hailing driver during a clash with police in Jakarta. Human rights groups have criticized the government's violent crackdown on the protests, which has led to hundreds of arrests.</p>

          <p>Despite the artificial intelligence sector being a major driver for the stock market, recent events have raised questions about its sustainability. AI chip leader Nvidia saw its stock fall even after reporting blockbuster earnings, reflecting investor uncertainty. A recent MIT survey found that 95% of companies experimenting with AI are not yet seeing revenue from it, suggesting the promised economic benefits have not materialized for most. This, combined with political pressures from the White House on tech companies, is creating doubts about whether the AI bubble can continue to prop up the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Cody and Liam Townend had entrusted Amie Upton with their daughter's funeral arrangements but later found the baby's body on a sofa at Ms. Upton's residence. The incident has led to calls for stricter regulation of the UK's funeral industry, as the parents feel their child was "robbed of her dignity." A police investigation found no criminal offenses, but the local hospital trust has banned the funeral director.</p>
