          <p>A large-scale rally in central London, organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, resulted in violent clashes and injuries to 26 police officers, four of them seriously. The "Unite the Kingdom" protest drew an estimated crowd of up to 150,000, significantly exceeding expectations and leading to tensions as demonstrators tried to breach police lines separating them from a counter-protest. Tech billionaire Elon Musk addressed the rally via video, calling for a change in government, while authorities condemned the violence and made 25 arrests.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists, including NASA researchers, has identified significant shortcomings in the U.S. space agency's capabilities for establishing a long-term lunar presence. The report highlights that past funding cuts and policy decisions have created "critical gaps," particularly in bioregenerative life support systems. This assessment comes as China and Russia collaborate on building a joint lunar research base, raising concerns about U.S. competitiveness in the new space race. The scientists urge NASA to develop these crucial capabilities to successfully operate a future lunar outpost.</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats are insisting that any legislation to avert a government shutdown must include key healthcare provisions, creating a potential impasse with Republicans.

The expiration of these credits could cause insurance premiums to rise by an average of 75% for millions of Americans. With the September 30 funding deadline approaching, this hardline stance complicates negotiations and increases the likelihood of a shutdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Thai government has granted working rights to approximately 80,000 long-term refugees from Myanmar residing in border camps, reversing a decades-long policy. The decision comes after significant cuts in humanitarian aid, particularly from the United States, led to the cancellation of food rations and rising malnutrition in the camps. The move is intended to allow refugees to become self-sufficient and support their families. The UN Refugee Agency praised the resolution as a potential "regional benchmark" for rights-based refugee solutions.</p>

          <p>The plight of thousands of Ukrainian children forcibly relocated to Russia since the 2022 invasion remains a critical issue, with Ukraine demanding their return as a condition for peace talks. While Ukraine has a list of over 19,500 named children, the exact number is disputed, and Russia denies any abductions, claiming it "rescued" them. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and his children's rights commissioner for the war crime of unlawful deportation. Efforts by groups like Save Ukraine are helping to repatriate some children, but the process is bureaucratic and challenging.</p>

          <p>Russia and Belarus have commenced their quadrennial joint military exercise, "Zapad 2025," amid heightened tensions with neighboring NATO countries. The drills, which simulate repelling enemy attacks and include nuclear-capable missile preparations, are taking place primarily in Belarus, near the borders of Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania. The exercise is causing concern among NATO members, as the 2021 Zapad drills were a prelude to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In response, Poland has closed its border with Belarus and launched its own military exercises.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued an ultimatum to NATO allies, stating that the U.S. will only impose "major sanctions" on Russia if all member nations agree to do the same and cease purchasing Russian oil. In a letter to his counterparts, Trump criticized some allies for their continued energy trade with Moscow, arguing it weakens their collective bargaining power. He also urged the alliance to impose 50% to 100% tariffs on China to help end the war in Ukraine, a demand European officials consider unlikely to be met. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FBI has increased its reward to $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of a man who allegedly fired a pistol at federal officers during an immigration raid at a Camarillo cannabis farm. The incident occurred on July 10, when a sweep of Glass House Farms led to clashes between hundreds of protesters and law enforcement. The raid resulted in over 300 arrests of suspected undocumented workers and the death of one worker who fell while trying to flee.

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has described the recent incursion of Russian drones into Polish airspace as an "unacceptable and dangerous development." However, he stopped short of declaring the act intentional, stating that it remains unclear whether Russia deliberately targeted Polish territory. The incident, which prompted Poland to shoot down the drones, was the first time a NATO member has fired on Russian targets during the war in Ukraine. In response, NATO has announced plans to bolster its defenses on the alliance's eastern flank.</p>

          <p>Immigration lawyers and advocates are expressing alarm that the U.S. government is planning to deport approximately 1,000 unaccompanied children from Honduras and El Salvador, expanding on a recent attempt to remove hundreds of Guatemalan minors. The fears arose after a flight to deport 76 Guatemalan children was halted by a federal judge's emergency order over Labor Day weekend. Attorneys argue the removals violate the children's rights to have their asylum cases heard and would return them to dangerous situations, a claim supported by evidence that many of their parents did not request their return.</p>

          <p>While authorities have identified 22-year-old Tyler Robinson as the suspect in Charlie Kirk's killing, his motive remains unclear, fueling political speculation. Utah's governor stated that investigators believe Robinson was "deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology," but offered no specific evidence. Reports have also circulated that Robinson lived with a transgender partner, a community Kirk often criticized. In the absence of a clear motive, commentators have focused on narratives of political radicalization, while the suspect's family background appears to be that of registered Republicans from a small Utah town.</p>

          <p>The BBC understands that Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office questioned Lord Peter Mandelson about his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before appointing him as UK ambassador to the US. The questions were reportedly sent after initial vetting flagged the relationship. Mandelson was dismissed from the post this week after newly surfaced emails showed him sending supportive messages to Epstein in 2008 after his conviction. Downing Street sources suggest Mandelson was "economical with the truth" in his responses, though the newly reported emails were not discovered during two official vetting processes.</p>

Another aims to phase out ultra-processed foods like chicken nuggets and corn dogs from school cafeterias. A third bill, AB 715, establishes a state Office for Civil Rights to combat discrimination in schools, a measure that grew out of concerns over antisemitism in some ethnic studies curricula.</p>
