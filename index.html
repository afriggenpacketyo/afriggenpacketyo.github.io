Three children—a 16-year-old girl and two boys aged 14 and 15—have been arrested on suspicion of murder and are currently being held in police custody. Authorities have cordoned off the area, which is near a popular beach, and are appealing for any witnesses to come forward with information.

The incident reportedly occurred in the early morning hours, more than 36 hours before he was scheduled to pilot a return flight to London.

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has announced she will not be a candidate for Governor of California in 2026, a move that has significantly altered the political landscape for the primary. Shortly after her decision, a prominent contender, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, withdrew from the gubernatorial race to run for state treasurer instead. The field remains crowded with other notable Democrats like Katie Porter and Xavier Becerra, creating an open and unpredictable contest to find a successor for Governor Gavin Newsom. No clear frontrunner has emerged in the wake of these developments.</p>

          <p>Despite an FBI pivot away from investigating right-wing extremism under the Trump administration, some far-right factions are expressing frustration with Donald Trump. His steadfast support for Israel and other policies have stirred rage among certain white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups, who increasingly view him as an enemy to their cause. Experts point out the irony that these groups are freer to organize due to his administration's policies, including pardons for January 6 participants. This dynamic reveals a complex and fractured relationship between Trump and some of the most extreme elements of the political right.</p>

          <p>An Ohio law is forcing public school districts to provide transportation for private and charter school students, creating a crisis for their own students. In Dayton, this has left approximately 2,000 public high schoolers without bus service, compelling them to rely on costly alternatives like ride-sharing services. This situation stems from a combination of a bus driver shortage and a state mandate that fines districts for not transporting non-public school students. Critics argue the law is part of a broader political effort to divert resources from public education to private and religious institutions.</p>

          <p>The tween accessories chain Claire's has filed for bankruptcy for the second time in seven years and has commenced the liquidation of its stores. Despite a 2018 restructuring that cleared $1.9 billion in debt, the company struggled to adapt to the shift towards e-commerce and faced macroeconomic pressures. The company's efforts to modernize through partnerships and influencer marketing were insufficient to overcome its challenges. Claire's is currently in negotiations with over 150 potential buyers, with analysts suggesting its nostalgic brand value could be a key factor in its potential rescue.</p>

          <p>In its first major move since merging with Skydance, Paramount Global has acquired the U.S. media rights for the UFC in a seven-year deal valued at $7.7 billion, effective from 2026. The agreement will bring all UFC events, including 13 marquee pay-per-view cards and 30 "Fight Nights," exclusively to the Paramount+ streaming platform. This new arrangement eliminates the pay-per-view model for UFC events in the U.S., making them accessible to all Paramount+ subscribers.

The decision comes as the capital reportedly sees nearly 2,000 dog bites daily and India accounts for over a third of global rabies deaths.

          <p>Hospitality unions in Las Vegas are attributing a notable decline in tourism, which they call a "Trump slump," to the current administration's hardline immigration policies. Visitor numbers have fallen, particularly from international markets, with unions reporting layoffs in the hospitality sector as a result. The Culinary Union, representing 60,000 workers, argues that the unwelcoming atmosphere created by fears of ICE raids and trade wars is deterring travelers. With immigrants comprising a large part of Nevada's workforce, the slowdown and the policies behind it are causing both economic and personal anxiety for many in the community.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. automakers are recalibrating their electric vehicle strategies following the Trump administration's moves to eliminate key EV incentives. The impending end of the $7,500 federal tax credit and the regulatory credit system is creating significant financial headwinds for the industry. In response, companies like Ford are increasing their focus on hybrid models and delaying some EV launches, while EV-centric companies like Tesla and Rivian are bracing for potential negative impacts on revenue. These policy changes are forcing the entire automotive sector to reassess the pace and profitability of its transition to electrification. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The leadership of America's top universities is fractured over how to navigate pressure from the Trump administration, creating a significant internal conflict within higher education. One faction, the "reformists," believes universities must proactively address criticisms of campus culture to regain public trust. The other, the "resistance," argues that these criticisms are politically motivated attacks on academic freedom that must be firmly opposed. This fundamental disagreement has led to public disputes and a lack of a unified strategy, paralyzing the sector's ability to effectively respond to major threats like funding cuts and endowment taxes.</p>

          <p>A significant update to driving laws in Great Britain is under consideration, including a proposal for compulsory eye tests for motorists over the age of 70. This potential change is part of a new road safety strategy prompted by a coroner's report labeling the UK's current self-reporting system for vision issues as dangerously lax. The government is also weighing other measures, such as lowering the drink-driving limit in England and Wales to align with Scotland's stricter standard.

The agency's chief has acknowledged that resource demand is outpacing availability, leading to calls for all fire-qualified personnel to be ready for deployment.

The court's decision finalizes the demotion and confirms that Nottingham Forest will take the vacated spot in the Europa League.</p>
