        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European defense company stocks, including Sweden's Saab and Germany's Hensoldt, experienced a significant rally. This market movement directly followed former U.S. President Donald Trump's unexpected shift in stance, where he expressed strong support for Ukraine's efforts to reclaim all its territory from Russia. Trump's comments, made at the UN General Assembly, suggested that with sustained European and NATO support, Ukraine could successfully restore its original borders, boosting investor confidence in the defense sector. The gains contrasted with a broader downturn in European markets, which were affected by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's warnings about inflated asset prices.</p>

          <p>In an emotional return to his late-night show, Jimmy Kimmel criticized what he called "anti-American" threats to free speech following his brief suspension over comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. During his monologue, Kimmel clarified it was never his intention to make light of the murder and also took aim at Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr for threatening the broadcast licenses of ABC. The controversy has sparked a national debate, with many local affiliate stations refusing to air his return, even after ABC reinstated the program.</p>

          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered almost £500 million lost to fraud over the past year by employing a new artificial intelligence tool. A significant portion of the reclaimed funds, £186 million, was linked to fraudulent activities during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as bogus Bounce Back Loans. The AI tool, known as the Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator, identifies weaknesses in new policies before they can be exploited. Following its success, the UK plans to license this technology to international partners, including the US and Australia, to combat fraud on a global scale.</p>

During the meeting in Beijing, the first of its kind in six years, Wang urged Washington to view China objectively and properly manage differences, particularly regarding Taiwan. The visit, led by Democrat Adam Smith, is seen as a crucial step in reopening channels of communication and stabilizing the complex bilateral relationship between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced that China will no longer seek "special and differential treatment" reserved for developing countries in future World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations. The declaration, made at the UN General Assembly, is a gesture aimed at supporting multilateralism and free trade amidst global economic fragmentation. By relinquishing these privileges, Beijing is positioning itself as a responsible major power committed to upholding the international trade system, even as it criticizes decoupling trends that it argues harm the global economy.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that former President Donald Trump is openly dictating whom the Department of Justice should prosecute and protect, creating a clear double standard in the application of justice. The piece cites the recent firing of a federal prosecutor who failed to indict Trump's political opponents and the dropping of charges against allies as evidence of direct interference. The author expresses concern that this politicization of the DOJ erodes the traditional wall between the White House and law enforcement, setting a dangerous precedent for future administrations and undermining public trust.</p>

This sentence is the longest ever imposed under the country's industrial safety law, which holds business owners accountable for fatal workplace incidents.

          <p>Australia's national broadcaster, the ABC, has been ordered to pay A$150,000 in penalties for the unlawful dismissal of presenter Antoinette Lattouf. A Federal Court found that the ABC fired Lattouf in December 2023 due to her political views after she shared a Human Rights Watch post about the war in Gaza, and that the decision was influenced by lobbying from pro-Israel groups.

          <p>The 80th session of the UN General Assembly saw world leaders address a range of pressing global issues, marked by tense rhetoric and diplomatic maneuvering. Former U.S. President Donald Trump delivered a wide-ranging speech questioning the UN's effectiveness, while also shifting his stance to support a Ukrainian victory. In a sharp response, Colombian President Gustavo Petro called for a criminal investigation into Trump over U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats. Other key topics included European efforts to salvage the Iran nuclear deal and Turkey's President Erdogan highlighting the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region fell on Wednesday, following a downturn on Wall Street triggered by comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell stated that equity prices are "fairly highly valued" and indicated that the path for future interest rate cuts remains uncertain, creating a cautious sentiment among investors. Major indices in Japan, Australia, and South Korea all posted losses, although South Korean defense stocks bucked the trend, rallying on news of potential continued U.S. support for NATO and Ukraine.

          <p>An escalator carrying former President Donald Trump and Melania Trump at the United Nations headquarters abruptly stopped, prompting speculation from the White House of intentional sabotage. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt suggested the incident "doesn't look like a coincidence" and that if UN staff were responsible, they should be investigated. However, a UN spokesperson stated that an investigation showed a built-in safety mechanism was likely triggered inadvertently by a videographer from the U.S. delegation who was walking ahead of the couple. The incident was compounded by a malfunctioning teleprompter during Trump's subsequent speech.</p>

Lane, who missed the previous game with an upper body injury, returned to practice, but Paige was not seen on the field. Coach Lincoln Riley declined to provide a specific update, referring to the Big Ten's official availability report which is released just before kickoff. The potential absence of both a star deep-threat receiver and the starting left tackle could pose a significant challenge for USC's offense.</p>

          <p>A new bronze statue has been temporarily installed on the National Mall in Washington D.C., satirically celebrating the "long-lasting bond" between former President Donald Trump and the convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The sculpture, which has a permit to remain through Sunday, depicts the two men holding hands and frolicking. Plaques on the installation include quotes from an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein, highlighting a controversial past relationship that continues to be a point of criticism for the former president.

          <p>This article fact-checks several inaccurate claims made by former President Donald Trump during a press conference, where he suggested a link between Tylenol use during pregnancy and autism. The report refutes his assertions, clarifying that no causal link has been scientifically established between Tylenol (acetaminophen) and autism. It also debunks other common anti-vaccine talking points he repeated, such as the false claims that Amish children do not get autism because they are not vaccinated and that children receive an excessive number of "horse-sized" vaccine shots.</p>

          <h2>Canadian Investigation Concludes TikTok's Child Data Protection Measures Are Inadequate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 21:46:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A probe by Canada's privacy commissioner has found that TikTok's measures to prevent underage use and protect children's data are insufficient. The investigation concluded that hundreds of thousands of Canadian children under 13 use the app annually, and that the platform has collected their sensitive personal information for targeted advertising and content algorithms. In response, TikTok has agreed to enhance some of its protective measures but stated that it disagrees with some of the report's findings. This adds to the global scrutiny the Chinese-owned app faces over its data practices and impact on young users.</p>
