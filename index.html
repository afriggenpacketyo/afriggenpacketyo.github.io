          <p>Vance Boelter, the suspect in the shooting of two Minnesota lawmakers, has been apprehended after a massive 43-hour manhunt. Boelter is accused of fatally shooting State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and attacking Senator John Hoffman and his wife. Authorities discovered a target list of Minnesota Democrats, including Governor Tim Walz and U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, in Boelter's vehicle. Boelter surrendered to law enforcement near his farm and is believed to have disguised himself as a police officer to gain entry to the lawmakers' homes, using a vehicle resembling a police cruiser. The shootings have sparked condemnation and highlighted concerns about political violence.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has instructed federal immigration officials to prioritize deportations in cities governed by Democrats, following protests in Los Angeles and other major cities against his administration's immigration policies. Trump urged ICE officials to expand efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. This announcement comes after weeks of intensified immigration raids and amid concerns about the impact of federal immigration measures on industries such as farming, restaurants, and hotels. Protests against these policies have been occurring across the country, with some clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Trump attributed peaceful protests in Los Angeles to the presence of the National Guard.</p>

The PLA asserted that these patrols are meant to safeguard China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights, and that any military activities stirring up trouble in the South China Sea are under control.

          <p>Japan has requested that eight countries and regions block its residents from accessing licensed online casino websites, citing the illegality of gambling with overseas-based betting sites in Japan. The government aims to address the issue by urging operators to cut off access to their sites, many of which are provided in Japanese. This move follows media revelations of some professional athletes and celebrities using online casinos, with a police survey estimating over 3 million people in the country have gambled online. Japan is also expected to enact a law to tighten regulations on illegal online gambling by prohibiting websites from directing traffic to casino sites.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales grew at their fastest pace since December 2023, driven by government subsidies that boosted consumption. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year, surpassing analysts' estimates, while industrial output slowed to 5.8%. Fixed-asset investment expanded by 3.7% year-to-date, with a deepening contraction in property investment. The rise in retail sales is attributed to the ongoing consumer goods trade-in program and a surge in online shopping, though falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment.

Santos' board intends to unanimously recommend shareholders vote in favor of the potential transaction, given no superior proposal emerges. The acquisition would give the consortium control of multiple Australian liquefied natural gas operations and stakes in other LNG projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shared ownership schemes, intended as a stepping stone to property ownership, face growing discontent as complaints rise. Many shared owners report issues with repairs, costs, and selling their properties. Some describe the schemes as a "big con" and a "nightmare," citing a lack of rights and increasing costs. The number of complaints to the housing watchdog has risen significantly, with the most common issues relating to repairs, costs, managing relations, and moving and selling properties.</p>
