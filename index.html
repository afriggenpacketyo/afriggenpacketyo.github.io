          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, fulfilling weeks of predictions. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up to select Colorado's two-way star Travis Hunter, while Shedeur Sanders' draft position remained uncertain. The draft saw a focus on offensive and defensive lines, with seven of the first 12 picks being linemen, contrasting with the quarterback-heavy 2024 draft. Jaxson Dart of Ole Miss was the second quarterback taken, going to the New York Giants after a trade back into the first round. This year's draft was held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, a first for the city.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants traded with the Houston Texans to select Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart as the No. 25 pick in the NFL Draft.

Dart's draft stock rose after a strong showing at the NFL combine, where he displayed arm power and precision, and now looks to live up to the legacy of Giants legend Eli Manning.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump directly appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the attacks on Kyiv, following the deadliest strike on the Ukrainian capital this year. The attack occurred amid Trump's renewed efforts to end the Ukraine war, reportedly on terms favorable to Russia. Meanwhile, a federal judge blocked Trump's attempts to change voting requirements, which advocates argued would disenfranchise millions of voters.</p>

          <p>More than 170 organizations have signed an open letter to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, claiming that the supported housing sector is in crisis due to funding cuts and rising costs. The letter states that one in three providers in England had to shut down services last year, creating a shortfall of about 325,000 places. The organizations are calling for long-term increased funding for housing-related support and for supported homes to be included in the government's housing plans.</p>
