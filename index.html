            <h2>China Returns Boeing Jet Due to Tariff Costs</h2>

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for China's Xiamen Airlines has returned to Boeing's US production hub due to the increased costs imposed by tariffs. Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, prompting China to impose a 125% tariff on US goods. With a new 737 MAX having a market value of around $55m, Chinese airlines could be crippled by the tariffs, which has caused confusion and uncertainty in the aircraft delivery process. Some airline CEOs have indicated they would defer delivery of planes rather than pay the duties.</p>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared details about an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen in March via a second Signal chat, including flight schedules, with his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. This revelation follows reports of Hegseth sharing similar details with the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic. The Pentagon's inspector general is evaluating Hegseth's use of the Signal app to determine compliance with DoD policies. Former officials contend that sharing sensitive information over unapproved channels could put troops at risk, potentially complicating ongoing investigations into leaks. Ullyot, the Pentagon's former top spokesman, described "a month of total chaos at the Pentagon" and predicted Hegseth's departure. </p>

            <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has kept its loan prime rates unchanged, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%, as strong macro data allows the central bank room to focus on stabilizing the yuan amid trade tensions with the U.S. This decision follows China's report of better-than-expected economic data, including a 5.4% year-on-year GDP rise in the first quarter. The PBOC's move is in line with expectations, as the bank is likely waiting for April's economic data to reflect the impact of U.S. tariffs before making any adjustments. The Chinese onshore yuan appreciated following the announcement.</p>

            <p>China has warned countries against striking trade deals with the United States that would harm its economic interests, threatening countermeasures against nations that appease Washington. This warning comes after reports that the US plans to pressure countries to curb trade with China to avoid new US tariffs. China insists that appeasement will not bring peace and compromise will not be respected, vowing to take reciprocal countermeasures against any nation acting against its interests. Several countries are reportedly negotiating with the US to avoid the tariffs, potentially impacting their trade relations with China.</p>

Beijing's retaliatory tariffs of 125% on top of existing 22% tariffs have significantly increased the cost of US beef. Restaurants like Home Plate BBQ are switching to Australian beef and Canadian pork ribs to cope with the rising prices. This shift reflects the broader impact of the trade war on various goods and industries.</p>

            <p>The gunman responsible for the mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart, where 23 people were killed, is expected to accept a plea deal in state court to avoid the death penalty. Patrick Crusius, who targeted Hispanics in the attack, will plead guilty to capital murder and receive life in prison without parole. The decision to forgo the death penalty was influenced by the majority of victims' relatives who want the case to be resolved. Crusius has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms at the federal level for hate crimes and weapons charges.</p>

            <p>Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has proposed a prisoner swap with Venezuela, offering to exchange Venezuelan deportees held in El Salvador for political prisoners in Venezuela. Bukele directed his offer to President Nicolás Maduro, listing family members of opposition figures, journalists, and activists detained during Venezuela's electoral crackdown. Venezuela's prosecutor's office criticized Bukele's proposal as "cynical," while El Salvador has faced scrutiny for accepting Venezuelans and Salvadorans deported by the Trump administration. The proposal comes amid controversy over the treatment of deportees in El Salvador's "mega-prison."</p>
