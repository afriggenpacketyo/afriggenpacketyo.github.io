          <p>A significant rescue operation is in progress in central Chile to save five miners trapped after a partial collapse at the El Teniente copper mine. The collapse, triggered by a magnitude 4.2 tremor, has already claimed the life of one worker. Rescue teams are working to clear the final stretch of debris to reach the miners, who are located over 900 meters underground, though no contact has been established yet. The El Teniente mine is the world's largest underground copper mine and a major contributor to Chile's economy.</p>

The nomination is in recognition of his role in brokering a ceasefire agreement that ended a deadly border conflict between Cambodia and Thailand. Cambodia's deputy prime minister thanked Trump for his efforts in bringing peace to the region, which ended fighting that had killed dozens and displaced over 300,000 people. This follows similar nominations proposed by officials in Israel and Pakistan for Trump's diplomatic interventions.</p>

          <h2>Chinese-Led Research Uncovers Ancient Genetic Link Between Tomato and Potato</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A scientific study led by Chinese researchers has revealed a surprising evolutionary connection between the tomato and the potato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, the team discovered that the modern potato originated from a hybridization event about nine million years ago. This event involved an ancient ancestor of the tomato and a tuberless, potato-like plant, which was key to the development of the potato's edible tuber. The findings, published in the journal Cell, provide new insights into the origins of one of the world's most important food crops.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic Leagues Cup match, Los Angeles FC secured a victory over Mexican club Pachuca in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw in regular time. Despite the win, LAFC's chances of advancing in the tournament are slim, as they needed an outright victory to stay in strong contention. The match was eventful, with both teams receiving a red card after VAR reviews. LAFC's Dennis Bouanga scored early, but Pachuca equalized shortly after an LAFC player was sent off, leading to the decisive shootout.</p>

Medical professionals state there is little scientific evidence for the long-term effectiveness of such products, warning they could cause skin irritation. Critics argue these trends promote harmful beauty standards and prey on insecurities, particularly among young consumers, by suggesting even sleep must be optimized for aesthetics.</p>

The case involved a Tesla Model S on Autopilot that struck and killed a 22-year-old woman and severely injured her boyfriend. The plaintiffs' lawyers argued that the Autopilot system failed to prevent the crash when the driver became distracted, as it did not restrict its use to controlled-access highways. Tesla plans to appeal the verdict, maintaining that the driver is solely responsible and that the ruling is a setback for automotive safety technology.</p>

          <p>Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla is expected to attend a major fundraiser for a pro-Trump super PAC at the president's New Jersey golf club. The attendance comes just one day after President Trump publicly sent letters to Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies, demanding they lower U.S. drug prices to match rates paid in other countries. The juxtaposition of the demand for price cuts and the CEO's attendance at a high-dollar fundraiser highlights the complex relationship between the administration and the pharmaceutical industry. The White House is seeking commitments from drugmakers within 60 days.</p>

          <p>A three-day NTSB hearing has uncovered critical details about the fatal midair collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and a regional jet near Washington, D.C. Key revelations include that the helicopter's altimeter was likely inaccurate, a problem the Army knew could occur, and that air traffic controllers were under pressure to "make it work" in a complex airspace. Investigators also confirmed that FAA staff had previously raised concerns about the helicopter's flight path proximity to commercial flights, but no action was taken. The crash resulted in the deaths of all 67 people on board both aircraft.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Seal Beach, California, are reporting a significant uptick in stingray-related injuries, rising from one to as many as 15 stings per day. Officials attribute the increase to calm, warm waters drawing the rays closer to shore, combined with hot weather bringing more people to the beach. A specific area near the San Gabriel River, known locally as "ray bay," is a particular hotspot. To avoid being stung, beachgoers are advised to shuffle their feet in the sand to alert the camouflaged fish of their approach.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposal to roll back greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles is projected to increase gasoline prices, according to the administration's own regulatory analysis. While the EPA claims the move will save consumers money, data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency cited in the report shows that disincentivizing electric and fuel-efficient vehicles will lead to higher gas demand and prices. The analysis also projects the loss of nearly half a million jobs by 2035 as a result of repealing the Biden-era policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has defended President Trump's decision to fire the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer.

The defense came hours after a disappointing jobs report prompted the firing and accusations of data manipulation from the president. The move has been widely criticized, including by McEntarfer's own Trump-appointed predecessor, as a dangerous precedent that undermines the credibility of vital economic statistics.

          <p>Trade experts are warning that President Trump's latest executive order hiking tariffs on imports will likely lead to higher prices for consumers and create prolonged uncertainty for businesses. With the U.S. effective tariff rate now at its highest in decades, economists predict that everyday goods from clothing to cars will become more expensive. Businesses, which had been seeking clarity, are now faced with a complex and unpredictable trade environment. This could lead to supply-chain disruptions and fewer product choices as companies struggle to absorb or pass on the increased costs. (not investment advice)</p>

The extraordinary assault on the central bank's independence comes as the administration faces growing questions about its economic policies and a deteriorating jobs market.
