          <p>High-end jewellery houses such as Gübelin, Annoushka, and Kia Schwan are crafting pieces with hidden details that transform them into symbols of meaning and memory. Gübelin integrates rubies into concealed areas of their designs, while Annoushka's Touch Wood collection subtly embeds ebony for protection and hope. Designers are also incorporating personal elements like hair into lockets and pendants, creating intimate connections between the wearer and the jewellery. These subtle details offer wearers a private connection to their jewellery, turning each piece into a tangible extension of a memory or moment from the past.</p>

The incident resulted in numerous injuries, with witnesses reporting scenes of chaos and panic as the car sped through the crowd. Police arrested a 53-year-old man in connection with the incident, and counter-terrorism police are investigating.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's labor market is more vulnerable now than during President Trump's first term due to a chronic housing slowdown and high youth unemployment. Economists warn that escalating trade tensions and tariffs could lead to significant job losses in China's manufacturing sector, potentially affecting millions of workers. While China and the U.S. have temporarily reduced tariffs, a full-blown trade war could exacerbate unemployment issues, particularly among young graduates and those in sectors affected by tighter regulations. The United States also faces liabilities, including dependence on China for rare earth minerals and the risk of product shortages, but China has a greater capacity to withstand economic hardship according to some economists.

He is known for his bleak and graphic stories that scrutinize the gap between China and the West, and the impact of new technologies on society. Mr. Han, who also works as a journalist for China’s state news agency, has recently focused his writing inward, detailing his own struggles with dementia and declining health on social media. His work aligns with an earlier vision of science fiction's role in China, revealing the country's weaknesses to inspire reform.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits grew for the second consecutive month in April, climbing 3% year-on-year, despite U.S. tariffs and deflationary pressures. The growth was bolstered by stronger earnings in equipment and high-tech manufacturing sectors, with profits in the high-tech manufacturing industry climbing 9% from January to April. A government scheme subsidizing consumers who trade in old electronics also boosted household appliance manufacturers' profits by over 15%. While some sectors faced headwinds, such as the automobile and apparel industries, statisticians attributed the overall improved profitability to the industrial sectors' resilience and ability to withstand shocks.

          <p>Funding cuts for North Korean schools in Japan have reignited tensions over identity and loyalty, with members of the North Korean community accusing Tokyo of undermining ethnic Korean schools. Chosen Soren, a pro-Pyongyang organization, has voiced strong dissatisfaction and urged Tokyo to restore funding. This dispute stems from Tokyo's colonial rule of the Korean peninsula and ongoing divisions over allegiance. The organization is a legacy of Japan's colonial rule, during which many Koreans were brought to Japan for work, leading to uncertain loyalties after Japan's surrender.</p>

The yen's depreciation boosted the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, while Germany benefited from a large current account surplus.
