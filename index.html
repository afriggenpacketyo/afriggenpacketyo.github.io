          <p>Researchers are increasingly uncovering instances of harmful AI responses, including hate speech, copyright infringements, and sexual content, highlighting the urgent need for regulations and thorough testing. Javier Rando, an AI researcher, points out the current inability to fully control AI behavior, while Shayne Longpre advocates for expanding AI testing to include diverse users like journalists and subject matter experts. Standardized AI flaw reports and incentives are proposed to disseminate information effectively, mirroring successful practices in software security. Combining user-centered practices with governance and policy is crucial for understanding and mitigating the risks posed by AI tools and users. The adoption of these practices would ensure a better understanding of AI's potential risks.</p>

          <p>Despite a Tennessee judge's order for his release, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported and later returned to the U.S., is likely to be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) due to an immigration detainer. Abrego Garcia faces criminal charges for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants, but Judge Barbara Holmes found the government's evidence of flight risk and gang membership unconvincing. Holmes highlighted the lack of criminal history and the reliance on double hearsay in the government's case, scheduling a hearing to determine release conditions. The U.S. Attorney has filed a motion to stay the judge's order, setting the stage for a continued legal battle over Abrego Garcia's detention and potential deportation.</p>

          <p>Following US military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, including the Fordo site, former President Trump posted about 'regime change' in Iran. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth clarified that the US is not seeking regime change but targeting Iran's nuclear program. Iran has condemned the attacks and reserved 'all options' to defend itself, warning of 'everlasting consequences'. The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting, with Iran's envoy accusing the US of warmongering and warning against stumbling into a quagmire, with the international community now watching to see how Iran will respond to the strikes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a worldwide caution for American travelers due to potential demonstrations against U.S. citizens following recent strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. The advisory cites disruptions to travel and periodic airspace closures across the Middle East, urging increased caution globally. This warning follows previous alerts advising against travel to places like Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank due to armed conflict and unrest. The State Department also cautions government officials in Turkey to maintain a low profile due to potential negative sentiment toward U.S. foreign policy, advising travelers to review alerts specific to their destinations.</p>

This comes as Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) experienced a record-low result in the Tokyo assembly election, signaling potential risks for his leadership in the upcoming national vote. A recent poll indicates that most Japanese citizens are concerned about the impact of the escalating Israel-Iran war on their daily lives, given Japan's reliance on the region for oil.</p>

Cyberstalking, involving digital harassment and threats, causes fear and distress in victims, with young people often dismissing it as flattery. Experts suggest that sharing locations and checking online activity, commonly seen as signs of love and care, can set precedents for unhealthy relationships, highlighting the need for clear communication about consent and boundaries.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian rights activist recently released from ICE detention, reaffirmed his dedication to Palestinian freedom at a New York rally. He criticized Columbia University's attempts to suppress pro-Palestine activism and accused the university of funding violence in Gaza. Khalil, who missed the birth of his child during his detention, plans to continue advocating for Palestinian rights. Despite facing potential further detention, Khalil remains steadfast in his commitment to speaking out for Palestine, while the Trump administration has stated it will appeal the order to release Khalil.</p>

          <p>Following America's attacks on Iran, the UK government has made it known that while it was informed in advance, it did not participate in the strikes. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has repeatedly pressed publicly for 'de-escalation,' and questions have seemingly been raised privately within the government about the legality of getting involved. The British government is navigating a delicate balance between maintaining a good relationship with President Trump and potentially facing difficult trade-offs depending on Iran's response to the attacks.</p>

The Royal College of Psychiatrists has urged caution over the use of ketamine therapy but is due to publish a new report on psychedelics later this year, with updated information on ketamine.</p>
