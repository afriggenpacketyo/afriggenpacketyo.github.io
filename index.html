          <p>Grace Chambers, a 97-year-old from Belfast, has set a new European record by becoming the oldest person to complete 250 Parkrun events. She accomplished this milestone at Ormeau Park just four weeks after undergoing a heart procedure to have a stent fitted. Having only started running at the age of 88, Chambers has become a local inspiration, demonstrating remarkable resilience and a passion for the community event, which she credits for bringing people from diverse backgrounds together. She has no intentions of stopping her running journey anytime soon.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of 96 British Members of Parliament has formally requested that the government expedite plans to bring sick and injured children from Gaza to the United Kingdom for medical treatment. The letter to senior ministers highlights the "decimated" healthcare system in Gaza and the urgent risk of death for many children. The MPs are calling for evacuations based solely on clinical need, the removal of bureaucratic barriers like biometric checks, and adequate funding for the initiative. The government has stated that plans are being accelerated.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Anchorage, Alaska, but concluded their talks without securing a ceasefire for the war in Ukraine. Following the meeting, Trump stated on social media that both sides determined a direct peace agreement would be preferable to a ceasefire, which he claimed "often times do not hold up." The summit, which lasted less than three hours, yielded no tangible breakthroughs, though Trump described it as having made "great progress." Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is now scheduled to travel to Washington D.C. for discussions.</p>

          <p>The press office of California Governor Gavin Newsom has been using social media to troll President Donald Trump by mimicking his distinct writing style, characterized by all-caps text and nicknames. Following the Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin, Newsom's team posted messages on X accusing Trump of having "low energy" and being terrified of Newsom's political maneuvering regarding redistricting maps. The posts are part of a broader, aggressive communications strategy by the Democratic governor's office to directly confront and satirize the president's public persona and political actions.</p>

          <p>Coffee shops in New York are anticipating significant price increases for consumers following the Trump administration's imposition of steep 50% tariffs on imports from Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer. Small business owners express concern that these tariffs, combined with existing high operating costs and inflation, could jeopardize their businesses. While some cafes are trying to absorb the initial costs, many acknowledge that price hikes are inevitable, potentially making a daily coffee an unaffordable luxury for some customers. The tariffs also affect other coffee-producing nations and are expected to shift trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Global music superstar Bad Bunny's 30-concert residency in San Juan has become a significant cultural event, drawing thousands of Puerto Ricans who have moved away back to the island. Titled "I Don't Want To Leave Here," the shows serve as a cathartic experience, addressing the sorrow and melancholy associated with leaving the homeland due to economic and social challenges. The concerts celebrate Puerto Rican heritage and have been described as a "healing balm" for members of the diaspora, reinforcing their identity and inspiring a renewed sense of pride and connection to the island.</p>

          <p>Across the United States, electricity prices have increased at more than double the rate of overall inflation over the past year, placing a significant financial burden on households, especially during summer. This surge is driven by several factors, including the massive energy consumption of new AI data centers and the rising cost of natural gas, a primary fuel for power generation, due to increased exports. Consumer advocates are concerned about the impact on low-income families, who already struggle to pay their bills and may face difficult choices between electricity and other necessities.

          <p>A recent executive order signed by President Trump is set to facilitate the inclusion of "alternative assets," such as cryptocurrency, real estate, and private equity, into 401(k) retirement plans. This move aims to democratize access to investment types previously reserved for institutional or wealthy investors. However, financial experts caution that these assets carry higher risks, greater complexity, and often much higher fees compared to traditional stocks and bonds. Plan administrators, who have a fiduciary duty to act in employees' best interests, will ultimately decide whether to offer these new, more volatile options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The summit between Presidents Trump and Putin in Alaska has elicited a mixed international response, with many expressing disappointment over the lack of a concrete ceasefire agreement for Ukraine. Some U.S. Democratic lawmakers accused Trump of being "played" by Putin, while some Republicans expressed cautious optimism about potential future meetings. In Ukraine, officials voiced frustration that the conflict continues unabated, though President Zelenskyy accepted an invitation to Washington. Meanwhile, the Russian delegation portrayed the meeting as a positive step, highlighting Putin's return to the global stage.</p>

This program grants residency to non-EU nationals who make a significant investment, typically in real estate.

For three consecutive months, China has been trimming its holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds, which are now at their lowest level since 2009. The article, published in a central bank-supervised journal, suggests that China should gradually adjust its reserves, potentially increasing its holdings of gold and other strategic resources in response to the perceived risks associated with U.S. fiscal policy.
