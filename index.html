          <p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has issued a stark warning about the exodus of companies from the London Stock Exchange, calling it a "pivotal moment" for the UK's financial sector. Since 2016, 213 firms have departed, prompting the CBI to advocate for lighter regulations, better marketing, and new incentives to encourage investment in British companies. The group's chair, Rupert Soames, even suggested potential changes to tax-free cash ISA savings accounts to steer more capital into productive investments rather than cash savings. This call to action aims to bolster a financial services industry that contributes significantly to UK tax revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Seven of Britain's largest housebuilding firms have agreed to a £100 million settlement to support affordable housing, thereby avoiding a formal legal ruling on potential competition law violations. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had been investigating allegations that the companies were improperly sharing commercially sensitive information, such as sales prices and incentives offered to buyers. As part of the agreement, the firms have also committed to refraining from such information sharing in the future, except in limited circumstances. The CMA stated that accepting this offer means it will not need to conclude whether the housebuilders officially broke the law.</p>

        </div>

          <p>Heavy rains triggered severe flash flooding in the Ruidoso area of southern New Mexico, leading to the deaths of at least three people, including two children and an adult man. The rapid rise of the Rio Ruidoso, which surged 19 feet in minutes, prompted dozens of swift-water rescues as people were trapped in homes and vehicles. The area, which was devastated by wildfires last year, is particularly vulnerable to flooding due to the unstable soil in the burn scar. A dramatic video captured a house being swept away by the torrent, highlighting the destructive power of the floodwaters that hit the region.</p>

          <p>Television presenter Gregg Wallace is facing new claims of misconduct from an additional 50 people, following an initial investigation into allegations of inappropriate behavior. The new claims, which Wallace denies, range from inappropriate sexual comments to accusations of groping and indecent exposure from 11 women. In response to Wallace's defense, Baroness Helena Kennedy, who chairs an industry watchdog, publicly advised him not to dismiss the women's claims as fabricated if he hopes for a future comeback. This development comes as an independent inquiry into the initial allegations is expected to conclude, with reports suggesting Wallace has been dismissed from his role on "MasterChef."</p>

          <p>G8 Education, a major Australian private childcare operator, has announced it will accelerate the installation of CCTV in its 400-plus centers. The decision follows the emergence of deeply disturbing allegations against a former employee, who faces over 70 charges, including child sexual assault, involving eight children at a Melbourne facility. In addition to the surveillance rollout, the company will allow parents to choose who can handle nappy changes and toilet visits for their children. While the company apologized for the pain caused, child safety experts caution that CCTV is not a complete solution and requires proper management to be effective.</p>

          <p>In recent discussions, the Trump administration has signaled a significant policy reversal by planning to send more defensive weapons to Ukraine, a move President Trump attributed to President Putin's actions. Simultaneously, the administration is actively engaged in Middle East diplomacy, hosting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss efforts to free hostages held by Hamas and a potential ceasefire deal. Domestically, Trump has also floated the idea of the federal government taking over the governance of Washington, D.C., to address crime. These developments reflect a dynamic period of policy announcements across foreign and domestic fronts from the White House.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a warning to its diplomats about a campaign using artificial intelligence to impersonate high-level officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The alert came after an impostor tried to contact foreign ministers and U.S. officials via text and voicemail, though the attempts were reportedly unsophisticated and unsuccessful. This incident is part of a growing trend of "deepfake" deceptions targeting public figures, prompting cybersecurity experts to highlight an escalating "arms race" between AI-driven fraud and the technology designed to detect it.

          <p>This article argues that while Donald Trump made significant gains with Latino voters, his administration's recent aggressive and widespread immigration enforcement actions risk reversing that progress. The author contrasts Trump's potential to focus on serious criminals with the current reality of raids affecting long-term residents and families, drawing parallels to how California Republicans alienated Latino voters with Proposition 187 in the 1990s. The piece suggests that the perceived cruelty of the current deportation strategy is activating a new generation of activists and causing concern even among Latino Republicans, potentially squandering a major political opportunity for Trump.</p>

This incident adds to previous criticisms of the chatbot and occurs as developers across the industry face scrutiny over issues like hate speech, bias, and accuracy in their AI models.

          <p>As the UK's privatized railways transition back to state ownership under the Labour government's policy, a new conflict is emerging over the role of "open access" operators. These private companies, which compete with government-franchised services and take on full revenue risk, are credited with improving service and lowering fares on lines like the East Coast Main Line. However, the new transport secretary has signaled a more rigorous approach to their applications, raising fears that the government may be seeking to protect the newly nationalized services from competition. This debate creates a potential clash within the government over the future structure and competitiveness of Britain's rail network.</p>

A four-mile section of Southern Boulevard, which runs from the local airport to his Mar-a-Lago resort, will now be known as 'President Donald J. Trump Boulevard.' In a social media post, Trump thanked the county, Governor Ron DeSantis, and state lawmakers for the "wonderful honor."

          <p>School food providers in the UK are being forced to serve smaller portions, use less meat, and switch to cheaper ingredients to cope with rising costs and inadequate government funding. The incoming chair of LACA, a school food organization, stated that schools are increasingly subsidizing the cost of free school meals. This comes as the government plans to expand free meal eligibility, a move welcomed by caterers but one they argue requires more funding to be viable. A recent government increase in the per-meal funding rate by just 3 pence has been described as an "insult," highlighting the growing financial strain on providing nutritious lunches for children.</p>

A recent case in London, where men were convicted for an arson plot at a warehouse storing Ukrainian supplies, revealed how Russian handlers allegedly recruit young, amateur operatives online for such missions.

Experts note that the area's steep terrain and rocky ground cause it to react extremely quickly to heavy rainfall, leaving little time for warnings. Records show the Guadalupe River has experienced major, deadly flooding more than a dozen times over the last century, with similar events overwhelming campsites and taking lives in the past. This history underscores the known risk of such a disaster, though experts say pinpointing the exact location of extreme rainfall remains a significant forecasting challenge.</p>

          <p>AI server manufacturer Super Micro Computer intends to significantly increase its investment in Europe, including expanding its manufacturing capabilities in the region. CEO Charles Liang stated that the decision is driven by rapidly growing demand for the company's AI-focused servers, which are essential for training and deploying large artificial intelligence models. The company, which already has facilities in the Netherlands, is planning further expansion to capitalize on what Liang describes as a global and long-term trend. This move aligns with recent calls from partners like Nvidia for Europe to bolster its own computing infrastructure to support the AI boom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meeting minutes reveal that officials in Kerr County, Texas, discussed implementing a flood warning system at least 20 times since 2016 but failed to act before last week's deadly disaster. The idea was first introduced due to the area's high flood risk, but it stalled after the county did not secure grant funding and faced opposition from some commissioners who called the proposal "extravagant." Instead, some officials argued that an informal "river calling" phone tree was sufficient to warn camps. This history of inaction is now under intense scrutiny following the catastrophic flood that claimed dozens of lives along the Guadalupe River.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their fifth consecutive loss, falling 3-1 to the Milwaukee Brewers, largely due to the dominant performance of rookie pitcher Jacob Misiorowski. The 23-year-old right-hander struck out 12 Dodgers batters over six impressive innings, allowing only one run from a leadoff home run by Shohei Ohtani. Despite a solid outing from their own veteran pitcher, Clayton Kershaw, the Dodgers' offense was unable to generate any further momentum against Misiorowski's high-velocity pitching. The loss highlights a difficult stretch for the Dodgers, who have been hampered by injuries and are now dealing with their longest losing streak of the season.</p>

The proposed 25% tariffs target key exports like automobiles and steel, threatening to slow growth in economies that are already facing headwinds and, in Japan's case, a potential recession. Both countries rely heavily on exports to the U.S., their largest or second-largest market. While President Trump indicated a willingness to negotiate if the countries open their markets, the policy raises the specter of a sharper economic downturn for the region.

Trump has consistently attacked the group, which aims to increase the influence of emerging economies from the Global South and reform Western-dominated international institutions.

In contrast, China is taking a more proactive role, exemplified by the launch of the China-initiated International Organisation for Mediation in Hong Kong.
