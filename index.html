          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under Labour, with the inaugural nationalized service departing from Woking to Surbiton. While the government hails this as a "new dawn for rail," they stopped short of promising fare reductions, instead emphasizing service improvements and infrastructure investment. Unions have voiced concerns regarding the potential outsourcing of security and cleaning staff, and the Conservatives are urging Labour to fulfill its promises. SWR's operations will now be managed by the Department for Transport (DfT) Operator and integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval. </p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized Harvard University's handling of foreign students, alleging that their home countries contribute nothing to their education despite Harvard receiving billions in federal funding. This criticism comes amid an ongoing dispute between the Trump administration and Harvard over the university's ability to enroll foreign students. Trump demanded transparency regarding the identities and countries of origin of these students, arguing that Harvard should utilize its substantial endowment instead of relying on federal grants. The administration has already frozen nearly $3 billion in federal funding to Harvard over alleged failures to address campus antisemitism and eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion practices. </p>

          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has declined to confirm whether the government intends to abolish the two-child benefit cap, stating she won't speculate on future government actions. This policy restricts most families from claiming means-tested benefits for third or subsequent children born after April 2017. Rayner pointed to the establishment of a Child Poverty Taskforce, which is evaluating the cap alongside other measures. She also refuted allegations that she leaked a memo suggesting child benefit payment clawbacks from wealthier families and denied any leadership aspirations. </p>

The article also suggests delaying Social Security, finding an employer with a 401(k), and consulting a financial planner for personalized retirement advice.

While state officials maintain they cooperate with federal authorities on criminal immigrants, the Trump administration views sanctuary policies as impediments to public safety.

Despite calls for reform, public opinion has largely swung back in favor of aggressive law enforcement, leading to a diminished appetite for change. While the LAPD has become smaller and shifted its focus to violent crimes, concerns remain about a culture of aggression and the continued use of less-lethal weapons. Efforts to overhaul the department's disciplinary system have stalled, and activists worry that officers feel emboldened to bend or break the rules. </p>

He criticized past administrations for misusing the military in unintended missions and touted his "Golden Age" agenda. Trump contrasted military service with careers in the business world, highlighting the qualities of honor and sacrifice. He framed his foreign policy as prioritizing core national interests and avoiding nation-building crusades. </p>

          <p>Venezuelans are participating in elections for lawmakers and governors, amid increased government repression and rising calls from the opposition to boycott the polls. The vote marks the first major electoral event with broad voter eligibility since last year's presidential election, which incumbent President Nicolas Maduro claimed to have won despite credible evidence of fraud. The main opposition, led by Maria Corina Machado, is urging voters to abstain, calling the elections a "parody" designed to legitimize Maduro's rule. A smaller opposition faction, led by Henrique Capriles, rejects the boycott, arguing that low turnout only helps Maduro tighten control. </p>

          <p>Venezuela is holding elections for the National Assembly and state governors a year after President NicolÃ¡s Maduro falsified the results of the presidential election. With no independent monitors present, many believe the results will be manufactured to project a veneer of democracy. The vote has reopened a rift among opposition activists, with some calling for a boycott and others participating to signal their desire for change. The government has detained opposition leaders and lifted bans on political participation for some activists in an attempt to divide the opposition. </p>

          <p>This article examines the ethical concerns surrounding President Trump's business dealings and potential conflicts of interest, highlighting instances where his family has profited significantly from his position. It notes the normalization of moneymaking schemes that once would have generated scrutiny, citing examples such as the $TRUMP cryptocurrency and a luxury jet donation from Qatar. Critics argue that Trump has dismantled accountability measures and erased ethical boundaries, while the White House defends his actions by claiming he is abiding by applicable conflict of interest laws. Despite some signs of public pushback, Democrats are split on how much to focus on Trump's profitmaking. </p>

By examining the often-fractious relationship between these two founders, Monticello hopes to encourage visitors to consider how to disagree better and bridge divides. The tour also acknowledges the complicated legacy of Jefferson, including the issue of slavery, and seeks to foster a civic engine for thinking about current divisions. </p>

          <p>President Trump's recent warming toward Syria and its new leader, Ahmed al-Shara, is complicating Israel's military strategy in the region. Since Trump's embrace of al-Shara, Israeli airstrikes on Syria have subsided, despite Israel's concerns about the new government's extremist leanings. This shift in American foreign policy is undercutting Israel's efforts to prevent the rise of another anti-Israel neighbor. The situation highlights the complex dynamics in the Middle East and the challenges Israel faces in navigating its security interests amid changing alliances. </p>

By serving short stints in this relatively safe unit, officials can return to Russia with a hero's welcome and increased prospects for promotion. The trend highlights a disparity in service conditions, with ordinary soldiers facing indefinite deployments at the front lines while elite figures enjoy a more comfortable and politically advantageous experience. The use of Kaskad as a career stepping stone is seen as a way to game President Putin's call to promote veterans to leadership roles. </p>

          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens expect rice prices to decrease under the leadership of the new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, following the dismissal of his predecessor due to controversial remarks about gifted rice. While 44.7% believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kilograms, a target lower than pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, 45% find Ishiba's rollback target appropriate. The survey also indicates that 42.2% think the removal of the former farm minister, Taku Eto, should have occurred sooner. The approval rating for Ishiba's Cabinet has slightly increased, but the disapproval rating remains high. (not investment advice)</p>
