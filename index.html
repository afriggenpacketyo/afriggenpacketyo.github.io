          <p>A lawyer representing families of victims from the 2018 Lion Air crash has criticized a deal between Boeing and the US Justice Department as "morally repugnant." The deal allows Boeing to avoid prosecution over two fatal crashes that killed 346 people by paying $1.1 billion. The lawyer argues that the payout is insufficient and allows Boeing to sidestep true criminal accountability, provoking outrage from his clients. Two 737 Max aircraft crashed in separate but almost identical accidents due to faulty flight control systems.</p>

          <p>Negotiations between the U.S. and Iran over Iran's nuclear program face uncertainty due to public disagreements over the terms of an interim agreement. Iran's Supreme Leader rejected the proposal, insisting on continuing uranium enrichment, while President Trump stated that the agreement would not allow any enrichment. The conflicting positions have raised doubts about whether a sixth round of negotiations will occur. An Iranian official described the U.S.'s proposed terms as unreasonable and unconventional.</p>

The study showed that young children with this bacteria had half the risk of being admitted to hospital with lung infections. Researchers believe this finding could lead to therapies that boost good bacteria in babies. The protective bacteria were found only in babies that came into the world via a vaginal delivery rather than a caesarean.</p>
