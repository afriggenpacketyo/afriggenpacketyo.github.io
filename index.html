        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article outlines the nascent stages of the 2028 Democratic presidential primary, highlighting a familiar ideological divide within the party. One camp consists of centrists who advocate for moving away from progressive policies to appeal to a broader electorate, a view echoed by figures like Rahm Emanuel. The opposing camp is composed of populists, inspired by Bernie Sanders' past campaigns, who argue for a stronger focus on combating corporate power and corruption. The piece suggests the party's future will be shaped by this ongoing struggle for its ideological direction.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has given New York prosecutor John Sarcone III a new title to maintain his authority after a judicial panel rejected his permanent appointment as U.S. attorney. He is now a “special attorney to the attorney general,” a move critics suggest stretches the law to bypass traditional oversight. The appointment is controversial due to issues surrounding Sarcone's credibility, including questions about his legal residence and a disputed claim of being attacked by an undocumented immigrant. This action highlights a pattern of using interim appointments to circumvent Senate confirmation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is testing robotic coyotes as an innovative solution to prevent dangerous bird strikes at military airfields. Developed over five years, these remote-controlled vehicles, disguised as coyotes, are designed to scare away birds and other wildlife that pose a threat to aircraft. Early trials have shown promise in keeping runways clear, and future versions aim to incorporate AI for autonomous operation and species recognition. This technology represents a creative and practical approach to a persistent aviation safety problem.</p>

          <p>At the urging of President Trump, the Texas Legislature is set to begin a special session to redraw the state's congressional map, an unusual mid-decade move aimed at increasing the number of Republican-held seats. The effort comes as the GOP holds a slim majority in the U.S. House and follows a Justice Department letter alleging the current map contains racial gerrymanders. Critics argue the redrawing is a purely political maneuver to benefit Trump and could backfire by creating less secure districts in a demographically changing state, while also inviting immediate legal challenges.</p>

          <p>The article explores two seemingly contradictory future economic scenarios: one of labor shortages due to declining birthrates and another of mass joblessness from AI automation. Experts suggest that long-term economic progress is more dependent on technological innovation than on population growth, pointing to historical examples. However, there is significant uncertainty about whether AI will boost productivity enough to offset the challenges of an aging workforce and rising public debt. The consensus is that while these trends are intertwined, their ultimate impact remains a major unknown for policymakers and economists. (not investment advice)</p>

Key questions include how the camp mitigates heat risks with shade and hydration, whether it is located in a floodplain, and what its specific emergency action plans are for floods or wildfires.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a major policy reversal, U.S. lawmakers have voted along party lines to eliminate all federal funding for public broadcasting for the next two years, cutting $1.1 billion. The move follows sustained pressure from President Trump, who has accused organizations like NPR and PBS of ideological bias. While national networks receive a small portion of their budgets from federal sources, many smaller local stations, especially those serving rural and tribal communities, rely heavily on this funding and warn they could be forced off the air. The decision shatters a decades-long bipartisan consensus that supported public media.</p>

          <p>A broad, bipartisan group of over 160 members of Congress is advocating for the "Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025" to impose aggressive new penalties on Moscow. The effort has gained momentum amid the deteriorating relationship between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, with lawmakers seeing a new opening to force Russia to the negotiating table over the war in Ukraine. The bill proposes steep tariffs on Russian goods and its trading partners, along with bolstering asset freezes on officials. While congressional leaders are currently letting the White House take the lead, sponsors are eager to advance the legislation quickly.</p>

For higher education, it overhauls the federal student loan system by setting new borrowing limits for graduate students and parents, and it streamlines repayment plans.

          <p>Netflix has used generative AI to create visual effects in one of its original shows for the first time, a move aimed at reducing production costs and time. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealed that the technology was employed for a building collapse scene in the Argentine sci-fi series "The Eternauts," completing the sequence ten times faster than traditional methods. The use of AI in entertainment remains controversial, with concerns over job displacement and copyright, which were central issues in the 2023 Hollywood actors' strike.
