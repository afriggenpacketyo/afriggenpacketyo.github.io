          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly stated to President Trump that Canada is not for sale during an Oval Office meeting, countering Trump's suggestions of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state. Carney emphasized the importance of partnership and collaboration between the two nations, despite Trump's continued interest in the idea of acquiring Canada. The meeting took place amidst strained relations due to U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods, with Trump asserting that tariffs would remain in place, setting the stage for potentially difficult trade negotiations. Trump also claimed that the U.S. subsidizes Canada significantly, a claim disputed by economic data, while Carney pledged to protect Canada's interests in future discussions.</p>

          <p>New U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, reaching up to 145%, are expected to cause supply-chain disruptions and potential shortages of various goods in the U.S., possibly as early as this summer. Many retailers had increased inventories before the tariffs took effect, but imports have since slowed down, leading to concerns about future restocking challenges, particularly for back-to-school and holiday items. The article identifies toys, down feathers, textiles, footwear, cutlery, glassware, furniture, and apparel as especially vulnerable product categories. Container bookings from China to the U.S. have already decreased significantly, with canceled voyages to the Port of Los Angeles on the rise.</p>

          <p>Following a fatal bear attack on an 89-year-old man and his dog near Naples, Florida, Florida Fish and Wildlife officers killed three bears in the vicinity. The authorities are conducting DNA testing to determine if the euthanized bears were responsible for the attack, which is the first deadly bear attack on a human in Florida's history. Officials are advising residents and visitors to exercise caution and avoid approaching or feeding bears. The state's black bear population has been increasing, leading to more frequent interactions with humans, particularly in rural areas of north and central Florida.</p>

          <p>Amazon's Zoox autonomous vehicle unit has issued a software recall for 270 of its robotaxis following a crash in Las Vegas last month. The recall addresses a defect in the automated driving system that could lead to inaccurate predictions of other vehicles' movements, thereby increasing the risk of collisions, according to a report submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The incident occurred on April 8 and involved an unoccupied Zoox robotaxi colliding with a passenger vehicle, though no injuries were reported. Zoox has paused and since resumed driverless operations after implementing a software update to correct the identified issue.</p>

          <p>In a White House meeting with President Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly rejected the idea of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state, emphasizing that Canada is not for sale. This declaration followed Trump's remarks romanticizing the notion of merging the U.S. and Canada, which Carney countered by highlighting the importance of partnership and mutual benefits. Despite the lack of Canadian support for the idea, Trump insisted on not dismissing it entirely, while both leaders acknowledged existing tensions in trade relations. The meeting, the first since Carney's election, aimed to address these strains, with Carney underscoring Canada's commitment to its own terms in trade and security discussions.</p>

          <p>Israeli fighter jets bombed the main international airport in Sanaa, Yemen, in response to a missile attack near Israelâ€™s main airport by the Houthi militia, which controls much of northwestern Yemen. The airstrikes resulted in at least three fatalities and over 30 injuries, according to Houthi-affiliated health officials. The strikes targeted civilian planes, the departures hall, the runway, and a military air base, severely disrupting airport operations, which serve as a crucial link to the outside world for millions of Yemenis. Despite the Israeli military's claim of disabling the airport, Houthi officials have vowed retaliation, declaring an air blockade on Israel.</p>

          <p>The U.S. trade deficit reached a record high of $140.5 billion in March, indicating a surge in imports as businesses and consumers anticipated President Trump's new tariffs. The deficit has nearly doubled in the past year, with imports of goods and services climbing to $419 billion, driven by a significant increase in consumer goods, especially pharmaceutical products from Ireland. Economists caution that these tariffs will likely increase operating costs for businesses and raise prices for consumers, despite the White House's insistence that the measures will reduce trade deficits and boost domestic manufacturing. The surge in imports contributed to a decline in U.S. economic growth during the first quarter.</p>

          <p>A declassified U.S. intelligence memo contradicts President Trump's assertions that the Venezuelan government, under Nicolas Maduro, controls the Tren De Aragua (TDA) criminal gang. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence concluded that there is no evidence of widespread, organized cooperation between the Maduro regime and TDA, and that Maduro views the gang as a threat. This contradicts the Trump administration's justification for deporting alleged gang members under the Alien Enemies Act. The memo also suggests that TDA is decentralized and unlikely to coordinate large-scale human trafficking or migrant smuggling, further undermining the administration's claims about the gang's power and reach.</p>

          <p>Social media star Christina Najjar, known as Tinx, released her debut novel, "Hotter in the Hamptons," which explores themes of cancel culture, reinvention, and unexpected romance. The novel follows content creator Lola Fine as she retreats to the Hamptons after being canceled and unexpectedly begins a summer fling with the culture critic who wrote a scathing exposÃ© about her. Najjar aimed to create a complex and layered heroine that readers could relate to, incorporating real locations in the Hamptons for reference. The book also includes queer romance elements, for which Najjar collaborated with a queer writer to ensure authentic representation.</p>

          <p>Bezalel Smotrich, Israel's far-right Finance Minister, expressed his vision for defeating Hamas, which involves the complete destruction of Gaza and the displacement of its civilian population to a "humanitarian zone" in the south, with eventual emigration to third countries. Smotrich also voiced his hopes for the formal annexation of the West Bank. This stance contrasts with international reservations, including those expressed by Paris and Beijing, regarding Israel's plans for an expanded offensive in Gaza. The proposal reflects a hard-line approach amid ongoing conflict and humanitarian concerns.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer and his allies are facing challenges in their efforts to regain a Senate majority in 2026, as they focus on recruiting candidates capable of winning in traditionally Republican states. Democrats confront a difficult map where most of the Republican-held seats up for election are in states that strongly favor Trump. While the Democrats have grown more optimistic about their midterm prospects as President Trump's approval rating has declined, a narrow path to retaking the Senate runs through red states. The effort highlights the broad ideological divide between the left-leaning faculty members who dominate the senate and want to protect it and the trustees, who are mostly wealthy businesspeople and lawyers with a fiduciary responsibility to make sure that the university functions.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer and his allies are actively recruiting candidates in traditionally Republican states to increase the Democrats' chances of reclaiming a Senate majority in 2026. This strategy aims to expand the Senate map, which currently presents limited opportunities for Democrats due to the majority of Republican seats being in states heavily favoring President Trump. With Democrats growing optimistic about the midterm prospects, they are focusing on identifying viable candidates in conservative areas to challenge Republican incumbents. The success of this approach hinges on recruiting candidates capable of appealing to a broad electorate and overcoming the challenges of running in deeply red states.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York ruled that the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to deport alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang was unlawful, marking the second such ruling against the administration's policy. The judge granted a preliminary injunction for two plaintiffs who were detained and slated for deportation to El Salvador, arguing that they were not given adequate notice or due process to challenge their removal. This decision challenges the administration's claim that the gang constitutes an invasion justifying the use of the AEA, an 18th-century wartime authority.</p>

          <p>With credit card debt on the rise and average interest rates near record highs, financial experts recommend building healthy borrowing habits, including limiting credit utilization to 30% of the credit limit. For example, if a consumer has a $1,000 credit limit, they should aim to spend no more than $300 to maintain a healthy credit score and avoid accumulating unmanageable debt. By keeping utilization low, borrowers demonstrate financial responsibility, which can lead to better interest rates on various financial products and prevent the accumulation of high-interest debt.

With adjusted oil prices near levels only seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, he expects activity levels to decline, resulting in a production decrease this quarter.
