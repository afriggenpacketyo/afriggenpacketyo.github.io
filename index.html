          <p>A federal jury has ordered Tesla to pay over $240 million in total damages after finding the company partially liable in a 2019 fatal crash involving its Autopilot system. The case centered on the death of a 22-year-old woman whose vehicle was struck by a Model S when its driver became distracted. The jury concluded that defects in the self-driving technology significantly contributed to the incident, a verdict that plaintiffs' lawyers argue holds Tesla accountable for prioritizing its valuation over human safety. Tesla has stated its intention to appeal the decision, calling the verdict wrong and a setback for automotive safety technology.</p>

          <p>Dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters, including New York City Council Member Tiffany Caban and State Representative Claire Valdez, were arrested during a demonstration at Senator Chuck Schumer's office in Manhattan. Organized by Jewish Voice for Peace, the activists used pots and pans in a noise protest, demanding an end to the bombing of Gaza and the allowance of humanitarian aid. The event was one of several similar protests across major U.S. cities, with another demonstration occurring at New York's Egyptian Consulate. These actions reflect ongoing efforts by activists to advocate for a ceasefire nearly two years into the military conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market showed signs of a significant slowdown as employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, well below economists' forecasts of 115,000. The Labor Department also issued sharp downward revisions for May and June, reducing previous estimates by a combined 258,000 jobs, indicating weaker hiring than initially reported. With the unemployment rate ticking up to 4.2%, some analysts suggest the subpar growth reflects the economic impact of U.S. trade tariffs. The weak report could increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider an interest rate cut at its next meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he has ordered two nuclear submarines to be repositioned to undisclosed regions in response to what he termed "highly provocative statements" by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The move comes amid escalating rhetoric, with Medvedev warning that Trump's new deadline for Russia to end the war in Ukraine is a "step towards war." This action follows Trump's recent praise for a guided-missile submarine's role in strikes against Iran, where he highlighted the power of the U.S. nuclear submarine fleet. The public disclosure of submarine movements is highly unusual and marks a significant escalation in signaling to Moscow.</p>

During arguments, a three-judge panel sharply questioned the Justice Department's claim that the 14th Amendment does not automatically grant citizenship to the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants. The judges referenced the 1898 Supreme Court precedent in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, which has long been interpreted as guaranteeing birthright citizenship. This legal challenge is a key test for one of Trump's signature hardline immigration policies and is likely destined for the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) following a weak jobs report has raised alarms about political interference in economic data. The move, which Trump justified with unsubstantiated claims of data manipulation, coincided with a global stock market downturn prompted by his new, widespread tariff policies. Economists and analysts expressed concern that questioning the integrity of the BLS could create significant problems for businesses and policymakers who rely on unbiased data. This article notes the firing shocked Wall Street and connects the domestic political decision to its immediate international financial repercussions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This analytical article argues that President Trump's social media post about repositioning nuclear submarines is a dangerous and irresponsible departure from presidential conduct regarding nuclear weapons. The author contends that Trump is treating the nation's most powerful deterrents like personal toys, waving them around to distract from a week of bad news and to engage in a petty feud with a Russian official. Unlike his predecessors, who treated nuclear declarations with extreme gravity, Trump is using the implied threat of nuclear war to manage his public image. While this instance may not spark a crisis, it sets a troubling precedent for using nuclear signaling for political gain.</p>

Kugler, a Biden nominee whose term was set to expire in January 2026, did not state a reason for her departure. Her resignation provides Trump with a crucial opportunity to appoint a new member to the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee at a time when he is actively pushing for lower interest rates.

However, the ruling did uphold one consumer's claim that their agreement was "unfair" under the Consumer Credit Act due to the large, undisclosed commission, setting a potential precedent for similar egregious cases. Analysts believe that while a widespread compensation crisis has been averted, a redress scheme for certain discretionary commission agreements could still cost the industry billions.

          <p>This analysis piece characterizes President Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner as a foolish, impulsive act rather than a calculated power grab. The author argues the move stems from a long-brewing conservative suspicion that government economic data is manipulated for political purposes, a theory Trump has championed for years. The article points out the logical inconsistencies in Trump's complaints, as he simultaneously claims the economy is strong while demanding the Federal Reserve act as if it's weak. Ultimately, the author suggests that attempting to control economic data through partisan loyalty is futile, as voters judge the economy based on their personal reality, not official reports.</p>

The analysis also considers that future inflation readings are difficult to predict and that strong stock market performance may temper the demand for gold as a diversification tool.

          <p>A woman has died and another person was injured after being attacked by a pack of more than a dozen stray dogs in a San Bernardino, California park. Police responded to a chaotic scene at Perris Hill Park where they found the two victims with multiple dog bites. One of the dogs, a pit bull, charged at an officer and was shot and killed. Animal services were called to the scene and ultimately removed a total of 14 dogs from the park. Authorities are still investigating the origin of the stray dogs involved in the fatal attack.</p>

          <p>This article provides a global overview of business reactions to President Trump's newly imposed tariffs, which have reshaped U.S. trade relationships with over 90 countries. Business leaders from Mexico, Thailand, Italy, Brazil, and Canada expressed a mix of relief, concern, and uncertainty. While some countries negotiated lower rates than initially threatened, the new duties are still expected to cause price hikes for consumers and significant disruption for exporters in sectors from agriculture to high-tech manufacturing. The varied responses highlight the widespread and unpredictable impact of the administration's aggressive trade policies on the international business community.</p>

          <p>An Ohio couple has welcomed a baby boy who developed from an embryo that was frozen for more than 30 years, a period believed to be the longest an embryo has been stored before a live birth. The couple used an embryo donated in 1994 through a process known as embryo adoption, which is gaining traction among those who oppose discarding unused embryos. The original donor, who had the embryos left over from her own IVF treatment, was able to connect with the adoptive parents through an open adoption program. The successful birth highlights advances in fertility technology and raises complex questions about the fate of millions of frozen embryos.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging its actions targeting gender-affirming health care for minors. The suit supports children's hospitals and doctors who have faced pressure from the administration to cease providing such care. The states contend that the administration's efforts are illegal and represent an overreach of federal power. This legal action marks a significant pushback against the administration's policies on transgender healthcare, escalating the conflict between state and federal governments over the rights and medical treatment of transgender youth.</p>

          <p>This article features an interview with the economist who originally coined the acronym BRICS to describe the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, and China. He discusses how his original vision of an economic bloc has evolved into a geopolitical alliance that now includes several other nations. The conversation explores the reasons behind the group's expansion and its goals, providing context for why the alliance has generated significant animosity from President Trump's administration. The economist offers insights into the shifting global economic and political landscape, with BRICS positioning itself as an alternative to Western-led institutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This economic analysis argues that the narrative of a resilient Trump economy has been debunked by newly revised labor data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics report showed that job growth over the past quarter was the worst since 2010, outside of the pandemic, revealing that the perceived economic strength that emboldened the administration's tariff policies was a mirage. The article suggests that the weak labor market, combined with rising inflation, is consistent with the stagflationary environment many economists had predicted. The author concludes that the mystery of the strong economy has been solved: it wasn't actually that strong. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon's stock fell 8% despite reporting second-quarter earnings that beat most expectations, as investors focused on weaker-than-expected profit guidance and underwhelming cloud growth. While revenue and advertising sales were strong, Amazon Web Services (AWS) grew 18%, trailing the faster growth rates of rivals Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. The company also announced it could spend upwards of $118 billion on capital expenditures this year, primarily to support AI demand, raising questions about when these massive investments will translate into profit.

          <p>This article provides a detailed comparison of the interest that could be earned on a $10,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) now compared to August of last year. While current CD rates remain high due to the Federal Reserve's paused rate hikes, they have declined from their 2024 peaks. For example, a 3-year CD opened last year would have earned over $500 more than one opened today. Despite the lower returns, the article argues that CDs remain an attractive option for savers, offering fixed, predictable growth that outperforms traditional savings accounts and variable-rate alternatives in a potentially declining rate environment.

          <p>In the fifth Test between England and India, fast bowler Prasidh Krishna revealed that a heated on-field exchange with England's Joe Root was a deliberate tactic to disrupt the star batter. The confrontation occurred early in Root's innings and elicited an unusually animated response from him. Krishna, who took four wickets in the innings, described the incident as competitive banter between two players who are friends off the field. The match remains tense, with India holding a 52-run lead heading into the third day, further fueled by several dropped catches by England late in the day's play.</p>
