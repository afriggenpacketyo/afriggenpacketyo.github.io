          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from ICE detention after a judge ruled her due process and First Amendment rights were likely violated. Ozturk had been detained for six weeks following an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas, leading to the revocation of her student visa. The article highlights concerns over the use of immigration enforcement to suppress free speech, with Ozturk's lawyers arguing that she was detained for expressing her opinion in a news article. Upon her return to Massachusetts, Ozturk thanked her supporters and emphasized the importance of remembering other women still in immigration detention centers.</p>

The technology is still immature, expensive to implement effectively, and raises concerns about data privacy. While AI offers enhanced search capabilities and can assist with certain tasks, it lacks the reliability and decision-making abilities required for core business operations, suggesting that widespread job replacement by AI remains a long way off.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to end the recruitment of care workers from overseas as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration and prioritize domestic workers. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that new rules will require firms to hire British nationals or extend visas of existing overseas workers. The government anticipates a reduction of up to 50,000 lower-skilled visas over the next year and will introduce new training requirements to reintegrate unemployed individuals into the workforce. Critics argue that the plan doesn't properly tackle the crisis in social care.</p>
