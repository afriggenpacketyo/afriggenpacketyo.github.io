          <p>Actor Dwayne Johnson has revealed that his noticeable recent weight loss is in preparation for his role in an upcoming film titled "Lizard Music." He described his character as an eccentric elderly man whose best friend is a chicken, a part he says requires a leaner physique. Johnson explained that this transformation follows another demanding role where he portrayed MMA fighter Mark Kerr, a part that he found particularly challenging and fear-inducing. Fans first noted the actor's slimmer appearance at the Venice Film Festival, sparking widespread discussion on social media about his changed look as he continues the slimming process for the new movie.</p>

The meeting occurs as some UK parliamentarians call for Herzog to be denied entry, citing allegations of war crimes and genocide, which Israel denies. The visit highlights the intense diplomatic and political pressure surrounding the conflict, with UK officials navigating calls for accountability while maintaining diplomatic relations.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced the suspension of all planned restaurant remodels after facing significant public criticism for its recent rebranding efforts. The controversy began when the company introduced a new, modernized logo that removed its iconic "Old Country Store" branding, a move that was quickly reversed after backlash from customers and public figures. The company acknowledged that customer feedback indicated the modern redesigns did not align with the brand's cherished vintage Americana aesthetic. In its statement, Cracker Barrel reassured patrons that it would continue to invest in maintaining its restaurants while preserving the traditional look and feel that customers expect.</p>

          <p>NASA is utilizing the James Webb Space Telescope to study TRAPPIST-1 e, an Earth-sized exoplanet located 40 light-years away that orbits within its star's habitable zone. This positioning makes it theoretically possible for liquid water to exist on its surface, a key ingredient for life. Scientists are using the telescope's spectrograph to analyze starlight passing through the planet's potential atmosphere, searching for chemical signatures that would confirm its existence and composition. While researchers believe any primary hydrogen-helium atmosphere has been stripped away by stellar radiation, they are hopeful that the planet may have developed a heavier, secondary atmosphere, similar to Earth's.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon commented that the U.S. economy is showing clear signs of weakening, a view reinforced by a significant downward revision in national employment data. The Labor Department recently adjusted its nonfarm payrolls figures, revealing that 911,000 fewer jobs were created through March 2025 than initially reported. Dimon noted that while consumer spending remains relatively stable, confidence may be faltering, and it remains uncertain whether the slowdown will lead to a full recession.

          <p>A recent analysis of government labor data reveals that the U.S. manufacturing sector has shed thousands of jobs, with 42,000 positions lost since April. The report from the Center for American Progress attributes this decline to economic uncertainty fueled by the Trump administration's tariff policies and restrictive immigration stances. Companies, including major manufacturers like John Deere, have cited increased costs from tariffs as a reason for scaling back operations and laying off workers. This trend highlights the challenges facing the industry as businesses navigate unpredictable trade policies and their impact on production costs and hiring decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

According to a presentation from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the pool deck's slab-column connections had critically low margins of safety, a problem stemming from original design flaws and misplaced reinforcement. Researchers believe the pool deck began to fail more than seven minutes before the main tower collapsed, triggering a progressive failure that brought down a large portion of the building. The final report on the tragedy that killed 98 people is now expected in 2026.</p>

          <p>A letter attributed to Lord Mandelson, the current UK ambassador to the US, has been released as part of a "birthday book" for Jeffrey Epstein, in which he referred to the convicted sex offender as his "best pal." The message, written for Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003, describes him as an "intelligent, sharp-witted man." A spokesperson for Lord Mandelson stated that he has long expressed regret for ever having been introduced to Epstein. The revelation, part of documents released by a US House committee, has put the high-profile diplomat under renewed scrutiny, though Downing Street has affirmed its continued confidence in him.</p>

          <p>An attack by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a rebel group affiliated with ISIS, has left at least 60 people dead in Eastern Congo. The assailants, armed with machetes and firearms, targeted a group of people attending a funeral in the town of Nyoto, catching them by surprise. This massacre is the latest act of brutal violence by the ADF in a region plagued by numerous armed groups competing for control over valuable mineral resources. The United Nations has condemned the repeated attacks on civilians as intolerable violations of international humanitarian law, yet the violence continues to devastate the local population.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While high earnings do not make an individual ineligible for Medicare, they can significantly increase the monthly premiums for certain parts of the program. Eligibility for Medicare is primarily based on age (65 or older) or disability status, not income. However, higher earners are subject to an Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA), which adds a surcharge to their Part B (medical insurance) and Part D (prescription drug) premiums. These surcharges are calculated based on modified adjusted gross income from two years prior, meaning recent retirees may face higher costs initially. Financial planning strategies, such as managing withdrawals and considering Roth conversions, can help mitigate these additional expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In court documents related to their ongoing divorce, the estranged wife of Miami Dolphins player Tyreek Hill has accused him of multiple instances of domestic violence. The filings allege eight separate incidents of abuse since their marriage in late 2023, including one where Hill allegedly threw her to the floor during a dispute over a postnuptial agreement. Another alleged incident describes a violent attack where he threw her down and ripped her hair out while she was pregnant. Hill's attorney has dismissed the allegations as a "smear campaign" aimed at securing a larger financial settlement, and no criminal charges have been filed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, NHS trusts in England have been ranked in public league tables based on performance metrics such as waiting times, A&E performance, and financial health. Specialist institutions like Moorfields Eye Hospital topped the list, while general hospitals facing structural and financial issues, such as Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, ranked at the bottom. UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting defended the tables as a transparency tool for the public, but critics from health think tanks and trusts argue the metrics are confusing and may not accurately reflect quality of care. They also warn it could lead to managers focusing on improving scores rather than patient outcomes.</p>

          <p>A strike by London Underground workers has entered its third day, causing severe disruption across the city's transport network, with nearly all Tube lines and the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) shut down. The RMT union, which is in a dispute with Transport for London (TfL) over pay and working hours, warned that industrial relations have "totally collapsed." TfL has described the union's demands, including a 32-hour work week, as unaffordable and impractical, stating it has offered a fair 3.4% pay increase. The strike has forced commuters to seek alternative routes, leading to increased usage of buses, the Elizabeth line, and cycle hire services.</p>

          <p>A group of over 40 polar scientists has warned that proposals for climate geoengineering in the Arctic and Antarctic are dangerous, unlikely to be effective, and could distract from the essential goal of reducing fossil fuel emissions. Techniques such as artificially thickening sea ice or releasing reflective particles into the atmosphere are being explored as ways to cool the planet. However, the researchers argue that these interventions carry risks of severe, unforeseen environmental damage and raise complex geopolitical questions about governance. They urge a focus on achieving net zero emissions, which they state is the only proven method to limit global warming.</p>

          <p>A columnist reflects on the state of vaccine misinformation after receiving feedback from readers claiming his own COVID-19 infection proved vaccines are ineffective. He argues that this perspective ignores the scientific purpose of vaccines, which is to reduce the severity of illness and prevent deaths, not to provide absolute immunity from infection. The author connects this public confusion to the anti-vaccine rhetoric promoted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose administration has been criticized for dismantling public health expertise. The article contrasts this political narrative with advice from infectious disease experts who affirm the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.</p>
