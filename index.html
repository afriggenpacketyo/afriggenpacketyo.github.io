          <p>Amazon is investing in automating logistics, including testing AI-powered humanoid robots for package delivery, aiming to reduce costs. Morgan Stanley estimates potential savings of $2 billion to $3 billion annually by 2030 with robotics-enabled warehouses. The company is reportedly testing these AI-powered humanoid robots at a San Francisco "humanoid park" obstacle course. The firm views humanoid delivery robots as a key driver of "more durable market share gains" in Amazon's logistics network, which already holds a 30% share of the U.S. parcel delivery market, surpassing UPS and FedEx. The deployment of humanoids could yield significant financial returns in the next 3-5 years. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported from Maryland, is returning to the United States to face criminal charges related to allegedly transporting undocumented migrants. A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia on two counts for participating in a conspiracy to transport migrants from Texas. The alleged conspiracy involved transporting thousands of non-citizens, including some children and MS-13 members, over a decade. His attorney maintains that Abrego Garcia is fighting for due process and a fair trial after the Trump administration acknowledged the error in his initial deportation. The legal proceedings follow a lawsuit filed by his family after his deportation to El Salvador. </p>
