        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Professional women's rugby teams are increasingly monitoring their players' menstrual cycles to enhance performance and overall health, treating the period as a 'fifth vital sign.' By using apps and daily questionnaires to track cycles, teams can make informed adjustments to training intensity and nutrition to mitigate symptoms like cramps and fatigue. This data-driven approach allows athletes to manage their bodies more effectively throughout demanding tournaments, such as the World Cup, ensuring they can compete at the highest level. The strategy reflects a growing trend in elite sports to tailor coaching and medical support specifically to female physiology.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom is being viewed as a welcome distraction for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whose government is currently facing significant domestic turmoil. Amid cabinet resignations and poor approval ratings, the pomp and ceremony of the visit offer a chance to project stability and highlight the U.S.-UK 'special relationship.' The article suggests that Starmer aims to leverage the event to secure favorable trade discussions and benefit from Trump's apparent personal affinity for the UK. A successful visit could provide a much-needed boost to the prime minister's struggling administration.</p>

          <p>Following the death of British boxer Ricky Hatton at age 46, fans are fondly recalling his remarkable career and the unique connection he shared with his supporters. Known as the 'people's champion,' Hatton's humble, working-class background and exciting fighting style inspired thousands of fans to travel to his major bouts in Las Vegas. These journeys created a powerful sense of community and left followers with indelible memories of the electric atmosphere surrounding his fights against legends like Floyd Mayweather. The article emphasizes that Hatton's legacy is defined as much by this devoted following as by his achievements in the ring.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from King's College London has uncovered a significant discrepancy in the United Kingdom's public health data, revealing that over 13,000 opioid-related deaths were missed in official statistics between 2011 and 2022. This undercount, which makes the true total more than 50% higher than previously known, is blamed on coroners not specifying the exact drugs on death certificates. The flawed data raises serious concerns that government policies, funding decisions, and public health strategies for tackling the opioid crisis have been based on an inaccurate understanding of the problem's true scale.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian journalist Dmytro Khyliuk, recently freed in a rare prisoner swap involving civilians, has shared harrowing details of his three-and-a-half-year detention by Russian forces. Captured in the early days of the full-scale invasion, he was held without charge and subjected to constant cruelty, beatings, and starvation. Since his release, Khyliuk has been contacting the families of other Ukrainian prisoners he met to confirm their relatives are still alive. His story highlights the plight of thousands of Ukrainian civilians who have been illegally detained by Russia, with no legal mechanism for their return.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has declared his intention to sue The New York Times for $15 billion, accusing the newspaper of defamation and libel. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump asserted that the media outlet has been permitted to 'lie, smear, and defame' him for too long and specifically criticized its 2024 election endorsement of Kamala Harris. This legal action follows a pattern of previous, unsuccessful lawsuits filed by Trump against news organizations, including a $100 million suit against the Times that was dismissed by a judge in 2023.</p>

This stable outlook could provide the Reserve Bank of India with the flexibility to continue easing monetary policy to support economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a press briefing, President Donald Trump initially responded that he was 'not familiar' with the case of Melissa Hortman, the Democratic Minnesota House Speaker who was assassinated, when asked why flags were not lowered in her honor as they were for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. After being prompted, Trump said he would have considered the request if the governor had made it. The exchange drew attention to accusations that the administration selectively acknowledges political violence, a claim Trump denied while blaming the 'radical left' for causing problems in the country.</p>

For the governing Labour Party, the rise of a populist rival is a source of deep concern, while the Conservatives face an existential crisis as they continue to lose support from their right flank, according to this political analysis.</p>
