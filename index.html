          <p>A mass stabbing at the Hollow Water First Nation, a remote Indigenous community in Manitoba, Canada, has resulted in one fatality and at least six injuries. The suspect in the attack also died during the incident, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Authorities have described it as a "mass casualty" event and have assured the public there is no ongoing risk, though the investigation is still in its early stages. The community is reportedly shaken by the violence, which tragically occurred on the third anniversary of another major stabbing attack in Saskatchewan.</p>

          <p>Daniel Levy is ending his nearly 25-year tenure as the executive chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, a move understood to have been decided by the club's ownership. Despite overseeing significant infrastructural growth, including a new £1 billion stadium, and achieving a recent Europa League victory, his leadership was often criticized by fans for a lack of consistent on-field success. The club's ownership reportedly believes a change in leadership is necessary to achieve greater sporting success. Peter Charrington will assume the new role of non-executive chairman as the club enters a new era.</p>

          <p>During a congressional hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced sharp questioning from both Republican and Democratic senators regarding his vaccine policies and turmoil at the CDC. Republican senators, including several doctors, pointedly questioned his stance on childhood immunization schedules and later avoided expressing confidence in his leadership when asked by the press. The hearing was contentious, with a request to have Kennedy testify under oath being denied by the committee's chairman. The session highlighted the deep political divisions surrounding public health and vaccination mandates in the United States.</p>

          <p>Shares of Lululemon dropped significantly after the company released a full-year earnings forecast that fell far short of Wall Street's expectations. While second-quarter earnings per share were better than anticipated, the company cited the impact of tariffs and the removal of certain import exemptions as major factors in its reduced guidance. CEO Calvin McDonald also acknowledged that some of the company's product offerings, particularly in its lounge and social categories, have become "stale" and are not resonating with customers. The company plans to introduce more new styles to regain momentum in the U.S. market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Chinese President Xi Jinping's call for a new global order centered on "true multilateralism" is resonating with developing nations, particularly in the Muslim world. As the era of uncontested U.S. global primacy wanes, many countries in the Global South feel disillusioned with Western-led institutions, citing unresolved issues like debt dependency and vaccine inequality. Beijing's vision offers an alternative framework that promises greater inclusivity and appeals to nations seeking to diversify their political and economic alliances away from Washington. The piece suggests this represents a significant paradigm shift in international relations.</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates have been on a downward trend throughout 2025, providing some relief for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. For example, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen by more than half a percentage point since the beginning of the year. This decline is attributed to shifts in the broader economy and Federal Reserve policy, with further small rate cuts anticipated. While rates are not as low as they were at the start of the decade, the consistent downward trajectory offers a reason for cautious optimism in the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The deployment of the D.C. National Guard in Washington has been officially extended until November 30. This mission, initiated last month as part of the Trump administration's federal crime crackdown, aims to enhance security in the nation's capital. The extension order applies only to D.C. Guard members and not those from other states who were also deployed. The decision comes as the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing that the military's involvement in domestic law enforcement is an overreach of federal power and undermines a fundamental tenet of American democracy.</p>

          <p>As a strike by 3,200 workers in its defense unit enters its second month, Boeing has announced it will begin hiring permanent replacement workers for manufacturing roles. The company stated the move is part of its contingency plan to ensure it can continue supporting its customers, who rely on the assembly and maintenance of F-15 fighter jets and missile systems. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) union, which rejected a contract offer in August, criticized the decision, urging Boeing to return to the negotiating table to address the concerns of its skilled workforce.</p>

          <p>President Trump has escalated his legal battle to remove Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commissioner Rebecca Slaughter by asking the Supreme Court to intervene. Lower courts have ruled that Trump's firing of Slaughter was illegal and ordered her reinstatement, holding that FTC commissioners can only be removed for cause, such as neglect or malfeasance. The administration is now requesting that the Supreme Court pause her reinstatement while it appeals the case. The White House maintains that the President acted lawfully and has the authority to remove the heads of executive agencies, citing recent precedents.</p>

          <p>The start of the new academic year is causing heightened anxiety for mixed-status families across the U.S., where undocumented parents have citizen children. Many parents fear that routine activities like dropping off or picking up children from school could lead to encounters with immigration enforcement, following reports of parents being detained near school grounds. While schools are generally considered sensitive locations, and ICE agents require a warrant to enter, the fear of separation has led some families to limit their activities and has previously been linked to increased student absenteeism. This has prompted some school districts to prepare contingency plans.</p>

          <p>Florida has become the first U.S. state to announce a plan to phase out all childhood vaccine mandates for school attendance, a move that public health experts warn could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles and polio. School vaccine requirements have long been credited with maintaining the high vaccination rates necessary for herd immunity, which protects vulnerable individuals. While other states have made it easier to obtain non-medical exemptions, Florida's proposal represents the most significant rollback of such public health regulations. The plan will require both administrative action from the health department and new legislation.</p>

After police raids failed to locate the painting, the family surrendered it to authorities.

          <p>A financial rule of thumb known as the "$1,000 a month rule" helps individuals calculate how much they need to save to generate a specific monthly income in retirement. Based on the widely used 4% withdrawal rule, it suggests that a person needs between $240,000 and $300,000 saved to safely generate $1,000 per month without depleting their principal over a 30-year period. This guideline transforms abstract retirement goals into concrete savings targets, making it easier for people to plan. For example, to generate $4,000 monthly, one would need a nest egg of approximately $960,000 to $1.2 million. (not investment advice)</p>
