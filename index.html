          <p>The Trump administration has deployed the California National Guard to Los Angeles in response to escalating protests against federal immigration enforcement operations. Demonstrations, which began Friday evening, continued through the weekend, disrupting traffic and prompting police to declare unlawful assemblies. President Trump signed a memorandum to deploy 2,000 National Guardsmen to address the perceived lawlessness, while California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory and requested the deployment be rescinded. The governor argued the federal government was attempting to take over the California National Guard, further escalating tensions in the state. Optimism around the situation is relatively low, given the escalation of tensions and potential for further clashes.</p>

          <p>Former Reform UK chairman Zia Yusuf has dismissed the recent controversy over a proposed burka ban as a "storm in a teacup." The row erupted after MP Sarah Pochin questioned Prime Minister Keir Starmer about banning the burka, prompting Yusuf to criticize her on social media. Yusuf, who initially resigned as chairman but later returned in a different role, expressed regret over his post, citing exhaustion as a factor. He clarified that while he personally might consider a ban on face coverings in public, it is not currently party policy, emphasizing the need for deeper thought on the matter.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on ocean bottom trawling across English waters, increasing the protected area from 18,000km2 to 48,000km2. This proposal aims to safeguard rare marine animals and the seabed, and is subject to a 12-week industry consultation. The announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France, where Sir David Attenborough has warned about the destructive impacts of bottom trawling. Pressure is mounting for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty, aiming to protect 30% of international waters by 2030, as President Macron calls for a moratorium on deep sea mining.</p>

Tariffs are primarily paid by American importers, leading to higher prices for goods. While the Congressional Budget Office projects that tariffs could reduce the federal debt, they also acknowledge the potential for higher inflation and slower economic growth. The manufacturing sector has already experienced job losses, and businesses face challenges related to cash flow and uncertainty about future tariff rates (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Law Clerks Describe Toxic Work Culture in Federal Judiciary</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Some law clerks working for federal judges describe a toxic work culture characterized by power imbalances and expectations of constant availability. Clerks report instances of judges throwing objects, attempting to snoop on them, and pressuring them to attend late-night social events. The federal courts are not subject to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, limiting legal recourse for mistreatment. Despite efforts to improve internal human resources processes, skepticism remains about the effectiveness of these measures in addressing misconduct and preventing retaliation against those who report it.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing popularity of continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) among individuals without diabetes has sparked debate about their actual health benefits. While these devices have revolutionized diabetes care, their utility for the general population is less clear. Studies have shown mixed results, with some individuals experiencing significant improvements in weight loss and blood sugar control, while others see little to no benefit. Experts suggest CGMs may be useful for those highly sensitive to carbohydrates, needing extra motivation to eat healthier, or seeking greater dietary awareness, but caution that the data can be confusing and potentially misleading.</p>

          <p>President Trump's frequent invocation of emergency powers is raising concerns among legal experts about the potential for an upending of the constitutional balance of power. Trump has declared multiple national emergencies, including those related to energy and trade, to enact policies without congressional approval. Critics argue that many of these declarations do not constitute genuine emergencies, while the White House defends the president's actions as necessary to address inherited crises. The Supreme Court's potential stance on these challenges could significantly reshape the scope of presidential authority.</p>

Sales increased by 13.9% year-on-year, reaching 1.96 million vehicles, with electric vehicle and hybrid sales rising by 28.2%. However, slower growth among major automakers has highlighted concerns about aggressive price competition, leading authorities and industry leaders to call for an end to the price wars. Meanwhile, exports rebounded, increasing by 13.5% year-on-year, reversing a decline from the previous month.</p>
