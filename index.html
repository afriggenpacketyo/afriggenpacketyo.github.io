          <p>According to the Department of Homeland Security, the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado attack, Mohamed Soliman, is in the United States illegally. Soliman, a 45-year-old, entered the U.S. in August 2022 on a B2 visa and filed for asylum in September 2022. His visa expired in February 2023, and his work permit expired in March, rendering his presence unlawful. Soliman is accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary device against pro-Israel demonstrators, yelling "Free Palestine" during the attack, which resulted in eight hospitalizations.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway surged by 213% in May compared to the previous year, contrasting with a decline in other European markets. The increase is largely attributed to strong sales of the revamped Model Y compact SUV, aligning with Norway's EV-friendly policies and incentives. Despite the sales boost, a recent survey indicates that political factors, particularly CEO Elon Musk's rhetoric and political activities, have negatively impacted Tesla's brand value among some consumers. Norway's robust EV incentives, including VAT exemptions and access to bus lanes, continue to drive EV adoption.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is facing a crisis due to infrastructure problems, air traffic control issues, and understaffing, leading to safety concerns and flight disruptions. Radar and radio systems have experienced outages, leaving air traffic controllers overworked and stressed, as exemplified by a controller taking trauma leave. The situation at Newark is indicative of systemic problems across the U.S. aviation system, including staff retention challenges, cost-of-living increases outpacing wages, and outdated infrastructure. Addressing these issues requires sustained investment and a comprehensive approach to maintain safety and efficiency.</p>

While three conservative justices voted to hear the case, Justice Kavanaugh agreed with the majority in turning down the appeal for now, suggesting the court will address the issue soon. This decision allows existing bans on "assault weapons" and large-capacity magazines to remain in place. The case tested the scope of the 2nd Amendment and its right to bear arms, with gun rights advocates arguing that AR-15s are commonly owned and protected by the amendment.</p>

The bill aims to simplify repayment options by offering only two plans: an updated standard repayment plan and a new income-based Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). Under the RAP, monthly payments would range from 1% to 10% of income, with potential loan forgiveness after 30 years. The bill also introduces new borrowing limits and eliminates deferment and forbearance options for loans disbursed after July 1, 2026 (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Farid Mehralizada, a journalist with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, faces up to 12 years in an Azerbaijani prison for explaining economics in a way that ordinary people can understand. He was abducted in May 2024 and is accused of conspiring to smuggle foreign currency, illegal entrepreneurship, money laundering, tax evasion, and document forgery. His trial has brought back difficult memories for a colleague, Alsu Kurmasheva, who spent nine months in a Russian prison on similar charges. Mehralizada's arrest is part of an escalating crackdown on press and NGOs in Azerbaijan.</p>
