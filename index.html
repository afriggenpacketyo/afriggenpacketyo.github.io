          <p>AI data center provider CoreWeave announced plans to sell $1.5 billion in bonds, with the capital intended for general corporate purposes and debt repayment. The move follows a previous $2 billion debt offering in May that was significantly oversubscribed, highlighting strong investor confidence in the company's expansion. CoreWeave, which serves major clients like Nvidia and Microsoft, has seen its stock price more than triple since its public debut in March. The company is also undertaking major projects, including a new $6 billion AI data center in Pennsylvania, though some investors remain concerned about its high debt levels.

          <p>A coalition of 25 countries, including the U.K., Canada, and Japan, has issued a joint statement demanding an immediate end to the war in Gaza. The statement sharply criticizes Israel for what it calls the "drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians," referencing recent deadly incidents involving aid seekers. The nations also called for the unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas. This international pressure comes as Israel announces an expansion of its ground operations into Deir al-Balah, a central Gaza city, raising further concerns for civilian safety and the fate of remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has confirmed that its highly popular Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL) will return to stores on August 26, marking a significant cultural and business moment for the coffee giant. The fall menu will also feature returning favorites and a new item, the Pecan Cortado, as part of a broader strategy to boost lagging sales and increase store traffic. The annual PSL launch has become a major revenue driver for Starbucks since its introduction in 2003, creating a widespread trend in pumpkin spice-flavored products across the food industry. The company hopes these seasonal offerings will help reverse a recent decline in same-store sales.</p>

          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has updated its IPO prospectus, revealing plans to raise up to $1 billion by selling shares priced between $25 and $28 each. This could result in a fully diluted valuation of up to $16.4 billion, surpassing its previous $12.5 billion valuation from a 2024 tender offer. The move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was scrapped due to regulatory hurdles. Figma's public offering is a notable event in a relatively slow tech IPO market, with the company reporting strong revenue growth and the addition of prominent tech leaders to its board.

          <p>Representative Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican from Florida, has formally referred Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to the Department of Justice for a criminal investigation. The referral accuses Powell of committing perjury during congressional testimony regarding the cost and details of renovations at the Fed's Eccles Building. Luna alleges Powell misrepresented the project's scope, which escalated from $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion and included amenities he publicly denied. This action reflects ongoing pressure on Powell from conservative allies of former President Trump, who have criticized his leadership and monetary policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft has issued a warning about active cyberattacks targeting a significant vulnerability in its on-premises SharePoint collaboration software. Security researchers indicate the breach has likely affected thousands of organizations globally, including businesses and government agencies. The flaw allows attackers to gain unauthenticated access, execute code, and potentially impersonate users even after a patch is applied. Microsoft has released fixes for some versions of the software and is working on a patch for others, while the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has warned of the serious risk posed by the exploit.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines experienced a major IT outage on Sunday, prompting a system-wide ground stop for all its flights for approximately three hours. The airline requested the halt around 8 p.m. Pacific Time and was able to resume operations by 11 p.m. The carrier apologized to customers for the significant disruption and warned of residual delays throughout the evening. On Monday, the airline clarified that the incident was caused by an "unexpected failure" of a critical piece of third-party hardware in its data centers and was not the result of a cybersecurity attack. The safety of flights was reportedly never compromised during the outage.</p>

          <p>Brian Hooker, a leading figure in the anti-vaccine movement, has stated that he contracted measles after visiting a community in Texas experiencing an outbreak and then traveled back to his home in California. He did not appear to seek official medical testing or report his illness to health authorities, raising concerns about the potential for further spread of the highly contagious virus. Public health experts warn that such actions could create a "trail of measles," as undiagnosed cases can lead to wider community transmission, especially in areas with low vaccination rates.

          <p>The All England Club's plans to nearly triple the size of the Wimbledon tennis site can move forward after a High Court judge dismissed a legal challenge from a local campaign group. The proposal includes 38 new courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on the grounds of a former golf club. The group, Save Wimbledon Park, had argued the development was unlawful because the land was protected for public recreation. The judge ruled that the planning authority's decision was a "planning judgment rationally exercised." The expansion will allow Wimbledon to host its qualifying tournament on-site and provide new parkland for public access.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called for a wide-ranging examination of the Federal Reserve, suggesting the review should assess the institution's overall success in achieving its mission, not just the recent controversy over building renovations. His comments come amid heightened tensions between the White House and the central bank, including speculation about President Trump's intentions regarding Fed Chair Jerome Powell's tenure. Bessent also supported the idea that the Fed should be easing its benchmark interest rate, questioning the institution's mindset and its reluctance to cut rates despite moderating inflation.

In a CNBC interview, he stated that allowing high tariff rates to take effect "will put more pressure on those countries to come with better agreements." This perspective suggests the administration is prepared to use the economic leverage of active tariffs to extract more favorable trade terms from partners like the European Union. Bessent emphasized that the quality of the final deals is more important to the administration than meeting a specific deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

The heightened attacks, which have caused casualties and damage in Ukrainian cities, come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls for renewed ceasefire talks.

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who is facing federal human smuggling charges, have asked a judge to delay his potential release from criminal custody for 30 days. The request is a precautionary measure, intended to give his legal team time to address the likelihood that he will be immediately detained by immigration authorities for deportation if released. Abrego Garcia was erroneously deported to El Salvador earlier this year before a federal judge ordered his return to the U.S. to face the criminal indictment. His case involves a complex legal battle across both criminal and civil courts concerning his immigration status and the charges against him.</p>

This article explores the reasons, citing a combination of cultural, historical, and financial factors. Experts point to societal norms that have traditionally discouraged girls from playing football, a lack of investment in infrastructure and professionalization, and the economic challenges faced by clubs after the fall of communism. While UEFA initiatives are starting to show positive results, the region is still playing catch-up to its Western European counterparts in developing the women's game.</p>
