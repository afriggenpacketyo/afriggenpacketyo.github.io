          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta expressed his frustration after his team's 1-1 draw against Everton, specifically disputing the penalty awarded to Everton. Arteta stated he has reviewed the incident multiple times and believes it was not a penalty, adding to his frustration as he felt Arsenal controlled the match. Despite the draw, he acknowledged Everton's strength in set-piece situations, which arose from what he considered unnecessary fouls committed by his team. Everton's manager, David Moyes, admitted he had not yet reviewed the penalty incident.

          <p>A deal to transfer TikTok's US operations to a new American-majority-owned company has been jeopardized by escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The agreement, negotiated by Vice President JD Vance and involving companies like Oracle and Blackstone, was awaiting Chinese government approval. However, after President Trump announced new tariffs, China reportedly halted the deal, linking its approval to trade negotiations. Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok to be sold or banned, signaling that the app's fate is now tied to the broader US-China trade relationship.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appointed Lew Olowski, a national security lawyer with only four years of foreign service experience, to oversee the State Department's Global Talent Management Bureau.

Obama criticized Trump's economic policies, including tariffs, and expressed deeper concern over the federal government's threats to universities over student protests. He urged citizens, colleges, and law firms to resist actions perceived as undermining democratic principles. Obama also questioned deals between corporate law firms and the administration, urging them to uphold their values even if it means facing consequences.</p>

          <p>President Trump's desire to acquire Greenland from Denmark is being taken seriously, despite initial skepticism, with the White House beginning to assess the costs of controlling the territory. This pursuit raises concerns about potential violations of American and international law, undermining stability with an allied nation. Experts suggest that attempting to seize Greenland against the will of its people and the Danish government could lead to a civil-military crisis in the US. Senior military commanders may face a moral obligation to refuse orders to engage in such an operation, given treaty obligations and international law.</p>

          <p>A new hacking technique called "doubleclickjacking" is exploiting the common action of double-clicking on websites to compromise user accounts and device settings. This method involves overlaying malicious elements beneath real buttons, allowing hackers to execute hidden commands with the second click. This can grant access to webcams, microphones, browser settings, and even approve transactions without the user's knowledge. Users can protect themselves by being cautious when double-clicking, keeping browsers updated, using antivirus software, and limiting unnecessary permissions.

          <p>Inactive investors, who adopt a "buy and hold" strategy, often outperform active traders due to lower costs, taxes, and reduced emotional decision-making. Experts say human behavior, particularly selling during panic or buying during excitement, is the biggest threat to investor returns. Data shows that the average stock investor's return lagged the S&P 500 due to poor habits. While investors shouldn't do nothing, basic steps like reviewing asset allocation and rebalancing are recommended.

          <p>While President Trump believes his tariffs will bring manufacturing jobs back to the US, experts are skeptical, citing various challenges. These include uncertainty around the tariffs' longevity, a strong dollar, and the need for workforce development. Some analysts believe the tariffs could prompt negotiations and incentivize companies to invest in US factories, but others warn that businesses will proceed cautiously due to the unpredictable policy environment. There are also concerns about consumer confidence and the need for significant investment in training the American workforce.

However, it faces significant challenges in the House, where there are disagreements over spending cuts and how to pay for the tax cuts.
