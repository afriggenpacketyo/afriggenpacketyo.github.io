        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy showed significant signs of slowing in July, as key indicators like retail sales and industrial output fell short of forecasts. The slowdown is attributed to persistent weak domestic demand, challenges from the external environment, and government efforts to curb excess industrial capacity. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics also highlighted a worsening contraction in property investment and a rise in the urban unemployment rate, prompting calls for new policy support.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet at a military base in Anchorage, Alaska, for a summit focused on ending the war in Ukraine. The hastily arranged meeting comes after previous talks failed to produce a peace agreement, with Trump setting a deadline for Putin to agree to a ceasefire. While the White House has framed the meeting as a "listening exercise," discussions are expected to touch on territorial disputes, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy not in attendance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the growing issue of loneliness and social isolation among young men, citing research showing a sharp decline in close friendships since 1990. It argues that societal pressures and a conception of masculinity rooted in "domination" hinder men's ability to form deep, emotionally supportive connections, which harms society at large. The author calls on men to reject this model, create genuine community in offline spaces, and foster relationships that go beyond superficial banter to combat this widespread problem.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have issued new guidelines for managing high blood pressure, advocating for more aggressive and earlier intervention. The updated recommendations suggest that individuals with systolic blood pressure between 130-139 should first try lifestyle changes, but begin medication if levels don't improve, a shift from the previous 140 threshold. Notably, the guidelines now recommend forgoing alcohol entirely, citing mounting evidence of its negative impact on blood pressure, and also emphasize management to reduce dementia risk.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally requested that Prime Minister Keir Starmer allow him to appoint peers to the House of Lords, arguing the current composition is undemocratic. In a letter, Farage pointed out that his party, despite receiving over 4.1 million votes and controlling ten councils, has no representation in the upper chamber, unlike smaller parties. He highlighted the disparity with the Liberal Democrats, who have 76 peers despite winning fewer votes, calling for the "seismic shifts" in British politics to be reflected.</p>

          <p>Numerous Instagram users are expressing frustration after their accounts were suspended by parent company Meta, often for wrongly violating child sexual exploitation policies, only to be reinstated without clear explanation. The BBC has been contacted by hundreds of users who have lost access to personal photos and business accounts due to what they believe are flawed AI moderation tools. Despite acknowledging a problem with Facebook Groups in June, Meta has not admitted to a wider issue, leaving many users feeling powerless and distressed by the serious accusations.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new high-speed jet drone with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, a breakthrough that could effectively turn any warship into an aircraft carrier. The uncrewed aircraft is designed to launch from the decks of vessels like destroyers and frigates, even in rough seas, and then transition to fast, long-range flight. According to the project's research team, the drone's speed is far superior to other mainstream VTOL drones, representing a significant advancement in China's naval and aerial military technology.</p>

          <p>President Trump expressed indifference to reports of Latin American nations, including Brazil, increasing their coordination with China in response to U.S. tariffs. When asked about this shift, Trump stated that those countries "are not doing very well" and claimed the U.S. economy is "blowing everyone away, including China." His comments came as Brazil is working with Beijing on a multilateral response to the 50% tariff Washington recently imposed on a wide range of Brazilian exports.</p>

          <p>U.S. federal prosecutors have announced they will seek the death penalty against Teresa Youngblut, the 21-year-old woman accused of murdering a Border Patrol agent in Vermont. A grand jury indicted Youngblut on a murder charge for the January shooting of Agent David Maland during a traffic stop. Authorities allege Youngblut and her companion, who was also killed in the ensuing shootout, were linked to a radical cult-like group and were heavily armed at the time of the incident.</p>

          <p>The start of the new school year in Los Angeles is marked by widespread fear among immigrant families due to increased federal immigration enforcement activity in the area. Some undocumented parents are reportedly hesitant to send their children to school, afraid of being separated by raids, such as a recent large-scale operation near MacArthur Park. In response, the LAUSD has implemented "safe zones" around 100 schools and reiterated that agents without a judicial warrant will not be allowed on campus.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by ConsumerAffairs has ranked Oregon as the fourth-worst state to move to in 2025, citing significant challenges in affordability, safety, and the economy. The report noted that Oregon scored poorly on access to healthcare and education, and is highly vulnerable to environmental risks like drought and wildfires. Neighboring Washington fared better, ranking 35th best, outperforming Oregon in multiple categories, though both states face issues with crime and climate risk, according to the consumer-focused study.</p>

          <p>Police in Serbia used tear gas against anti-government protesters in Belgrade and Novi Sad as long-running demonstrations escalated. In Novi Sad, protesters attacked the headquarters of the ruling party, leading to clashes and arrests, with at least five police officers reported injured. The student-led protests, which began in late 2024 over corruption, are now demanding an early election from President Aleksandar Vucic, whose government is accused of growing authoritarianism and repression of dissent.</p>
