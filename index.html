          <p>Thousands of Israelis, including families of hostages held in Gaza, are protesting the government's plan to expand military operations. Demonstrators fear the plan endangers the lives of the remaining hostages and are calling for a deal to secure their release. The protests reflect growing public and even military dissent against Prime Minister Netanyahu's strategy, with polls indicating a majority of Israelis favor a hostage release deal over continued warfare. International condemnation of the plan is also mounting, with several countries criticizing the decision.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is dismissing asylum applications from individuals who entered the U.S. years ago, citing their failure to receive a mandatory "credible fear" interview at the border. This issue stems from a long-standing shortage of asylum officers, which prevented many from getting the required screening. Immigration attorneys argue this policy unfairly penalizes applicants who followed the existing rules, stripping them of work permits and legal status. The move is seen as part of a broader effort to tighten immigration controls and could force many into detention as they attempt to re-initiate their cases.</p>

A peak temperature of 34C is expected in the south Midlands on Tuesday. The UK Health Security Agency has issued yellow heat health alerts for most of England from Monday to Wednesday. This warm spell, caused by high pressure drawing air from the south, marks a significant shift from the recent stormy weather and is also expected to elevate pollen levels across England.</p>

          <p>The Greek island of Lesbos is experiencing a surge in tourism from Turkey, driven by new ferry connections and the island's relative affordability. This influx is strengthening local economic and cultural ties, with restaurateurs and officials welcoming the visitors. This grassroots diplomacy contrasts sharply with ongoing political disputes between Athens and Ankara over maritime borders and airspace. While high-level relations remain tense, the positive interactions through tourism offer a glimmer of hope for improved bilateral understanding between the two nations.</p>

          <p>A research team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed a new set of programmable chromosome engineering (PCE) systems, making large-scale gene editing more efficient and accessible. This breakthrough technology can precisely manipulate large DNA fragments, ranging from thousands to millions of bases, in complex organisms like plants. The innovation is expected to accelerate advancements in crop improvement by altering genetic traits and could also have significant implications for treating genetic diseases. Furthermore, it may advance the development of artificial chromosomes for applications in synthetic biology.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, key European allies have issued a joint statement insisting that Ukraine must be included in any peace negotiations. The leaders of the UK, France, Germany, and others emphasized that Ukraine's borders should not be changed by force and that Kyiv must have control over its own destiny. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that any agreements made without his country's participation would be "dead decisions," reacting strongly to suggestions of territorial concessions.</p>

It notes that Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy, appears undervalued and is overcoming production shortages, suggesting potential for profit growth. Brookfield Infrastructure is presented as a stable investment due to its ownership of essential assets like data centers and energy pipelines, which are crucial for emerging technologies like AI. The company's funds from operations are reported to be strong, supporting its 4.3% dividend yield. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wang Xingxing, the founder of China's Unitree Robotics, predicts that the robotics industry could experience its "ChatGPT moment" within the next one to three years. He defines this breakthrough as the point when a robot can autonomously perform a complex task, like cleaning a room, in an entirely new environment. While acknowledging that hardware is sufficiently advanced, Wang stated that the "AI for embodied intelligence" is the main bottleneck. He expressed skepticism about current models but suggested that generative video or interactive models, like Google's Genie 3, show more promise for achieving sophisticated robot motion control.</p>

          <p>A small, circular piece of a bathroom door lock found under the body of Alexandra Pennig was crucial in convicting Matthew Ecker of her murder. Ecker, a fellow nurse, claimed Pennig had taken his gun, locked herself in the bathroom, and died by suicide. However, detectives suspected foul play, and the discovery of the lock piece under her body suggested the door was forced open before she was shot. This contradicted Ecker's story that he broke the door down after hearing the gunshot, leading investigators to believe he shot her after she locked herself away from him during an argument.</p>

          <p>Officials in Los Angeles are pleading with residents of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills to stop all non-essential water use, including flushing toilets, due to a major service outage. A broken valve disrupted water for about 9,200 households during a heatwave, and a boil water advisory was issued. Efforts to repair the valve and repressurize the system are being hampered by continued water consumption, which is causing pressure drops and delaying the restoration of normal service. The situation was complicated further when a temporary bypass pipe failed, causing a gusher that will likely add hours to the repair timeline.</p>

          <p>A shooting in New York's Times Square early Saturday morning left three people injured, including two innocent bystanders. The incident reportedly began with a fight involving a group of teenagers inside a restaurant, which then spilled outside where a 17-year-old suspect opened fire. The intended target, a 19-year-old man, was shot in the foot, while an 18-year-old woman and a 65-year-old man were also wounded. Police responded quickly, arresting the teenage suspect a block away and recovering a weapon from the scene.</p>
