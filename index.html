          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham commented on the perilous state of American democracy. He argues that political violence historically emerges when the nation grapples with existential questions about identity and inclusion, such as defining who is considered an American. Meacham warns that abandoning peaceful debate for violence signifies a breach of the American covenant. He urges leaders to draw lessons from history to navigate the current climate of extreme division and prevent further erosion of democratic norms.</p>

          <p>Former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III commented on a viral video in which a female fan, dubbed "Phillies Karen," berated a father for giving a home run ball to his son. Griffin stated that since she dropped the ball, she had no claim to it and should have had better hands. The incident, which ended with the father and son meeting the player who hit the home run, sparked widespread discussion. Griffin also shared a personal anecdote about a fan who feigned being in a wheelchair to get an autograph from him during his Heisman Trophy ceremony.</p>

          <p>Following a large "Unite the Kingdom" march in London organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that the national flag will not be surrendered to those who use it as a symbol of division and fear. The demonstration, which drew over 150,000 people, was met by a counter-protest and resulted in injuries to 26 police officers and 24 arrests. Starmer emphasized that the flag represents Britain's tolerance and diversity and that violence against police or intimidation on the streets will not be tolerated.</p>

          <p>France's national women's rugby team staged a dramatic comeback to defeat Ireland 18-13 in the World Cup quarter-finals in Exeter. After trailing 13-0 at halftime, the French team scored 18 unanswered points in the second half to secure their spot in the semi-finals. A pivotal moment was France's incredible defensive stand at the end of the first half, preventing Ireland from extending their lead. The victory continues France's long-standing dominance over Ireland, whom they have not lost to since 2017.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, titled "Gustave Caillebotte: Painting His World," offers a fresh perspective on the lesser-known French Impressionist painter. While Caillebotte's peers focused on landscapes and ballerinas, his work often centered on male figures in domestic settings, which sometimes scandalized the 19th-century art establishment. The exhibition, which features his famous painting "Paris Street; Rainy Day," explores the unique themes and sensuous nature of his art. Curators note that the show encourages various interpretations of his focus on men and his place within the Impressionist movement.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the new "no tax on tips" law championed by President Trump, while providing temporary relief for some workers, further entrenches America's problematic tipping culture instead of promoting living wages. The author criticizes the policy for its temporary nature, income limitations, and a list of eligible professions that includes influencers and event planners but excludes teachers and postal workers. The piece contends that a better long-term solution would be to eliminate tipping altogether, forcing employers to pay fair wages and creating a more equitable system for both workers and consumers.</p>

          <p>As the 2025 WNBA playoffs begin, sports analysts are weighing in on key storylines and potential outcomes. Topics of discussion include whether the postseason is better off without the intense media focus on the Angel Reese-Caitlin Clark rivalry, as both of their teams missed the playoffs. Experts are also identifying high-seeded teams at risk of an early exit and long-shot contenders like the expansion Golden State Valkyries. Many eyes are on the Minnesota Lynx, who are seen as being on a "revenge tour" after a controversial loss in the 2024 finals, with star Napheesa Collier considered a top MVP candidate.</p>

          <p>Top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending three technology stocks—Broadcom, Zscaler, and Oracle—for their long-term growth potential, particularly driven by the artificial intelligence boom. Broadcom is benefiting from accelerating AI demand and a new $10 billion customer, while cybersecurity firm Zscaler shows strong growth in its Zero-Trust portfolio. Oracle's stock has surged due to massive growth in its cloud infrastructure business, with contracted revenue projections indicating significant future expansion.

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has publicly called for a full investigation into Prince Andrew over allegations that he sexually abused her. In an interview, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, stated that everyone, regardless of royal status, should be held accountable under the law. He expressed that Prince Andrew being stripped of titles and publicly shamed is not sufficient justice. The prince has consistently denied the allegations and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 without any admission of liability.</p>

This follows a settlement that ensures Fox News will maintain its conservative direction for decades.

          <p>The fatal shooting of activist Charlie Kirk on a Utah university campus has brought renewed attention to a state law that permits concealed-carry permit holders to have firearms on college campuses. While it is not yet clear if the suspected shooter was legally carrying the weapon, the incident has highlighted Utah's permissive gun laws, which include permitless carry and a lack of red-flag laws. Gun rights advocates in the state argue that armed citizens can deter violence, but critics contend that such policies are inadequate against politically motivated attacks and create significant safety challenges for campus security.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) campaign, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is reportedly adding to the stress and workload of parents trying to provide healthy food for their children. The movement's strict guidelines, which condemn ingredients like seed oils and processed foods, force parents into time-consuming and expensive shopping habits. While the campaign aims to improve children's health, critics argue it offers little practical support for families, especially those with limited budgets, and fails to address systemic issues like food insecurity that impact nutrition.</p>

          <p>Political observers are analyzing the successful mayoral primary campaign of progressive Zohran Mamdani in New York for potential lessons for the UK's struggling Labour Party. Mamdani's success is attributed to his sharp focus on economic issues like affordability, clear policy solutions, and a compelling narrative that picks a side against the establishment. His campaign's savvy use of social media to connect with voters also stands in contrast to the UK government's slower adaptation to new media. While not a direct template, his approach highlights the importance of authenticity and a clear vision in an era of voter disillusionment.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a key victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has stated that Lord Mandelson should never have been appointed as the UK's ambassador to the United States due to his relationship with the disgraced financier.

Giuffre's brother described the initial appointment as evidence of deep corruption. A UK government official admitted that had the full extent of the relationship been known, it is "highly unlikely" Mandelson would have been appointed.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is raising fears that the U.S. may be entering a more dangerous chapter of political violence. The killing is the latest in a growing list of violent acts targeting political figures, with data showing a nearly 40% increase in terrorism and targeted violence in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous year. Experts note that while the current climate is similar to the 1960s, modern factors like social media and the wide availability of lethal weapons make this era potentially more volatile. The response from political leaders is seen as critical in either cooling or inflaming tensions.</p>
