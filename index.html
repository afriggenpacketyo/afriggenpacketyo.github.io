          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new all-time high, exceeding its previous record from January, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Increased liquidity in the crypto market and growing corporate treasury investments have also contributed to the rise. The Senate's move to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins and Coinbase joining the S&P 500 have further boosted investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston ruled that the Trump administration violated a previous order by deporting eight migrants to a third country without adequate notice. The judge, Brian E. Murphy, expressed concern that the men were given insufficient time to object to their removal, potentially leading to criminal contempt penalties for those involved. The flight carrying the deportees landed in Djibouti, with U.S. military personnel standing by, raising questions about the administration's adherence to due process in deportation proceedings. The men deported included citizens of Cuba, Laos, Mexico, South Sudan, Burma and Vietnam, and had been convicted of crimes including murder, sexual assault and robbery.</p>

          <p>Elephants Billy and Tina have been moved from the Los Angeles Zoo to the Tulsa Zoo despite ongoing protests from animal rights advocates. The move was prompted by the deaths of other elephants at the L.A. Zoo, leaving the facility below the minimum number required by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The Tulsa Zoo was chosen due to its larger enclosure and existing herd of Asian elephants. Advocates continue to voice concerns about the elephants' well-being, and legal challenges are ongoing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>News that former President Joseph Biden has advanced prostate cancer has revived long-standing questions about the benefits versus the harms of PSA tests. PSA tests alone leave a lot to be desired as a cancer screening test, as elevated PSA can be a marker for cancer, but also can signal a false positive or an inactive cancer, triggering a painful biopsy, and leading to overtreatment with punishing side effects. A new era in prostate-cancer screening has arrived, and instead of men immediately having their prostates biopsied when they get an elevated PSA test, many specialists recommend first getting an MRI and, when possible, watching and waiting.</p>
