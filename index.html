          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 01:37:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major abuse scandal at Muckamore Abbey Hospital in Northern Ireland was uncovered after CCTV cameras, mistakenly left on for six months, recorded 300,000 hours of footage. The recordings revealed horrific physical and emotional abuse of vulnerable, non-verbal patients by staff, including punching, kicking, and systemic neglect. Despite the discovery eight years ago and the incident being described as the UK's largest systemic abuse case, no trials have concluded, and a public inquiry has faced criticism for not holding managers sufficiently accountable. Families are still awaiting justice and have not been permitted to view the footage of their loved ones.</p>

          <p>A journalist covering the trials of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon details the couple's extraordinary and disruptive courtroom behavior over 18 months. Despite being on trial for the death of their baby, Victoria, they displayed a united, loving front while simultaneously showing contempt for the legal process by sacking numerous lawyers and causing constant delays. The article recounts their conviction for manslaughter by gross negligence, highlighting the chaotic proceedings and the defendants' apparent inability to grasp that their dangerous choices led to their child's death. Their actions were described by the judge as attempts to sabotage and manipulate the trial.</p>

          <p>Rescue operations in Texas are being severely hampered by forecasts of more heavy rain following devastating floods that have killed at least 131 people. The majority of those killed were children at a summer camp, and authorities report that no one has been rescued alive since the initial flooding on July 4. With 101 people still unaccounted for, officials face criticism over the lack of a flash-flood warning system and staffing shortages at the National Weather Service. Governor Abbott has called for a special legislative session to investigate the emergency response to the disaster.</p>

          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, exceeding analysts' forecasts and keeping it on track to meet its annual 5% target. However, this growth represents a slowdown from the first quarter, and underlying data reveals significant weaknesses, including slowing retail sales and a deepening slump in the real estate sector. Despite resilient industrial output, persistent deflationary pressures have prompted calls for increased government stimulus and deeper structural reforms to support household spending and ensure sustainable growth.

The widespread adoption has led to tangible benefits such as cleaner air and quieter cities, demonstrating a successful model for shifting away from internal combustion engines.

The policy reversal, which follows a meeting between Huang and President Trump, is seen as a significant win for Nvidia and a potential easing of tech-related trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.

The U.S. strategy is seen partly as an effort to amplify the 'China threat' to encourage allies to purchase more American weaponry and strengthen military cooperation.

Firefighters arriving at the scene on Sunday night were met with heavy flames and smoke, rescuing dozens of residents, some of whom were hanging from windows. Five firefighters sustained minor injuries during the heroic rescue efforts, which officials say prevented an even greater loss of life. The cause of the fire is under investigation but is not believed to be suspicious, with authorities looking into a possible electrical or mechanical origin.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Discover Animals Can React to Sounds Produced by Stressed Plants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 23:02:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from Tel Aviv University provides the first evidence that animals respond to sounds made by plants, suggesting a previously unknown layer of ecosystem interaction. Scientists found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were making ultrasonic 'screaming' noises, which the plants produce when unhealthy or dehydrated. While the sounds are outside the range of human hearing, they can be perceived by many insects and some mammals. This discovery opens up a new field of study into how these sounds might influence animal behaviors like pollination, feeding, or seeking shelter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A joint report by the WHO and UNICEF has revealed that more than 14 million children globally were completely unvaccinated in 2024, leaving them vulnerable to preventable diseases. The report highlights a concerning trend in Europe, where falling vaccination rates have led to a tripling of whooping cough cases and a doubling of measles infections. Officials attribute the widening coverage gaps to the spread of misinformation and significant cuts in international aid. Over half of the world's unvaccinated children are concentrated in just nine countries, underscoring the urgent need to address these health disparities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered the incineration of nearly 500 metric tons of high-energy biscuits intended for children in Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to government employees. The food, worth about $800,000, is set to expire after requests to ship it were reportedly ignored following an executive order that halted most foreign assistance. This action comes despite other humanitarian crises, such as the famine in Sudan, where the aid could have been redirected. The destruction of the food will cost taxpayers an additional $130,000, a move that veteran aid workers have described as unprecedented.</p>

          <p>A group of major UK landowners, including the Grosvenor Group and charitable foundations, has initiated a High Court challenge against the government's 2024 Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act. They argue that provisions designed to make it cheaper for leaseholders to extend their leases or buy their freeholds violate their human rights to enjoy private property. The claimants contend the law could cost them hundreds of millions and leave them without adequate compensation. Leaseholder advocates fear the legal battle will stall crucial reforms for years, trapping homeowners in properties with unfair terms and making them unsellable.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new plan to send 'top-of-the-line weapons' to Ukraine through NATO allies, who will be reimbursed by the United States. In a significant policy statement, Trump also threatened Russia with severe 100% secondary tariffs on its remaining trade partners if a peace deal with Ukraine is not reached within 50 days. This dual approach marks a tougher stance on the conflict, aiming to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities while applying intense economic pressure on Moscow. The move follows a meeting with the NATO chief and represents the first new pledge of military equipment for Ukraine from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The BBC's annual report on star salaries provides an incomplete picture of its top talent's earnings, as many high-profile presenters are paid through independent production companies, including the BBC's own commercial arm, BBC Studios. This arrangement means stars like Claudia Winkleman, Michael McIntyre, and the hosts of shows like 'The Traitors' and 'Strictly Come Dancing' do not appear on the list, despite being some of the corporation's biggest names. The article explains that this is due to commercial competition rules, but it results in a lack of transparency regarding the full extent of payments to top on-air talent.</p>

The study notes that these pouches, often sold in colorful, flavored packaging attractive to children, were associated with more serious medical outcomes and hospital admissions compared to other nicotine products.

          <p>The Department of Justice has formally urged the U.S. Supreme Court to deny Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal of her conviction for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking scheme. Maxwell is arguing that a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement should have barred her own prosecution in New York. However, the DOJ contends that the agreement was only intended to apply within the Southern District of Florida and that Maxwell was, at most, an incidental third-party beneficiary. Lower courts have already rejected her argument, and the DOJ is asking the high court to uphold those decisions.</p>

A drought declaration triggers formal plans to manage scarce water resources, which can include hosepipe bans. While droughts are natural, experts say climate change and increasing water consumption are raising the risk of shortages, and recent rainfall has not been enough to replenish low reservoir and river levels.</p>
