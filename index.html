          <p>Children in Gaza are reportedly dying while awaiting urgent medical evacuations, with an estimated 15,000 patients needing to leave the war-torn region. The article highlights cases like Amar, paralyzed by an Israeli drone bullet, and Ahmed, suffering from a brain tumor, both requiring specialized surgery unavailable locally. Despite a fragile ceasefire, Israel has kept the Rafah border crossing closed since May 2024, citing Hamas commitments, hindering efforts by the WHO to increase evacuations. Calls are mounting for Israel to reopen routes to West Bank hospitals, which previously provided efficient care for Gazan patients.</p>

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays secured a decisive 11-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1 of the World Series, marking the first Fall Classic game hosted in Canada since 1993. A pivotal nine-run sixth inning propelled Toronto, highlighted by Addison Barger's historic pinch-hit grand slam and Alejandro Kirk's two-run homer, effectively sealing the win. Despite a late two-run homer from Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers' pitching struggled against Toronto's relentless offensive surge. The Blue Jays have drawn first blood in the best-of-seven series, with Game 2 scheduled for Saturday evening, also in Toronto.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump criticized the Ontario provincial government for delaying the pause of a television ad featuring former President Ronald Reagan's anti-tariff remarks until after the World Series games. Trump, who had previously halted trade negotiations with Canada over the ad, called the move "dirty play" and threatened retaliation. Ontario Premier Doug Ford stated the ad achieved its goal of reaching US audiences and would pause on Monday to allow trade talks to resume. The controversy highlights escalating US-Canada trade tensions and a pending Supreme Court case on Trump's tariff authority.</p>

          <p>The upcoming ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, chaired by Malaysia, will address critical regional conflicts, including Thailand-Cambodia border tensions and Myanmar's ongoing civil war. US President Donald Trump is expected to oversee a peace accord signing between Thailand and Cambodia, who recently experienced cross-border combat. Despite diplomatic efforts, a peaceful resolution in Myanmar remains elusive, with the bloc divided on how to approach the military junta's planned elections.

This reversal contradicts Trump's earlier promise to preserve existing infrastructure, sparking outrage among historians and White House alumni. The article explains the East Wing's history, originally built in 1902 and expanded in 1942, serving as the First Lady's office and a visitor entrance. The new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, privately funded by donors, is expected to resemble Mar-a-Lago's and is proceeding without full planning commission approval.</p>

The US claims its actions, including ten airstrikes against suspected drug traffickers, are part of an anti-drug trafficking campaign. However, the article notes that experts and members of Congress suggest the military buildup is an intimidation campaign aimed at destabilizing Maduro's government. Maduro, a long-time foe of Trump, denies US accusations of leading a drug-trafficking organization.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico have petitioned a US appeals court to block a Trump administration order compelling them to dissolve their nearly nine-year-old joint venture. The Department of Transportation mandated the end of the partnership, which coordinates US-Mexico flights, citing competition concerns and alleged anticompetitive effects. Both airlines argue the order is "arbitrary and capricious" and will cause substantial financial losses and severe disruptions to flight operations. They contend their combined market share is competitive, and the order could eliminate up to $800 million in annual consumer benefits.</p>

The article highlights strong bipartisan opposition from coastal state governors and lawmakers, citing environmental and economic risks.
