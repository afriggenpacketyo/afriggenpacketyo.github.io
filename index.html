          <p>Russia initiated a significant overnight drone and missile assault on Ukraine, resulting in at least four deaths and 70 injuries, with Kyiv bearing the brunt of the attack. This marks the first major bombardment since a previous deadly strike last month, occurring shortly after the UN General Assembly where Ukrainian President Zelenskyy sought international support. Polish military forces deployed fighter jets preventatively as Russian targets were struck in western Ukraine, amidst growing international concerns about the conflict's potential spread. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted most projectiles, but civilian areas, including a medical facility and kindergarten, sustained damage.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that a government shutdown is probable unless Democrats compromise on spending, expressing confidence that the public will support his stance on fiscal cuts. He is scheduled to meet with congressional leaders ahead of the October 1st funding deadline, with sources suggesting he privately welcomes a shutdown to utilize executive power for program and salary reductions. Democrats, however, are pushing for extensions of Affordable Care Act subsidies and reject Trump's attempts to link healthcare negotiations to immigration. The political impasse highlights deep divisions over budget priorities and the role of government spending.</p>

          <p>Three individuals were killed and at least five injured in a mass shooting at the American Fish Company, a waterfront bar in Southport, North Carolina, on Saturday night. Authorities quickly arrested Nigel Max Edge, who allegedly opened fire from a boat before fleeing and being detained by the U.S. Coast Guard. The investigation suggests the shooting was "highly premeditated," and Edge faces multiple charges including three counts of first-degree murder.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the deployment of 200 National Guard members to Portland, authorized by the Secretary of Defense. State Attorney General Dan Rayfield argues that President Trump lacks the authority to federalize the National Guard and that the deployment is an unlawful political maneuver rather than a public safety necessity. Governor Tina Kotek and Mayor Keith Wilson also oppose the move, asserting that local officials can manage public safety without federal interference, fearing it will incite further unrest. This article highlights a significant federal-state conflict over authority and civil liberties.</p>

Meanwhile, U.S. markets saw a rally on Friday, breaking a three-day losing streak, driven by crucial inflation data.

          <p>Financial commentator Jim Cramer contends that the current AI boom's massive spending on data center buildouts is fundamentally different from the dot-com bubble of 2000. He argues that today's investments are by well-capitalized tech giants like Meta, Tesla, Google, and Microsoft, not speculative, debt-laden startups. Cramer acknowledges skepticism about AI's immediate tangible benefits but believes its long-term potential, driven by innovations from companies like Nvidia, makes it a necessity rather than a bubble. This article presents an economic analysis distinguishing the current technological investment landscape from past market excesses. (not investment advice)</p>
