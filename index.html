          <p>A national service at St. Paul's Cathedral marked the 20th anniversary of the 7/7 London bombings, honoring the 52 victims who were killed. Survivors, families, royalty, and political leaders attended the ceremony, where the names of the deceased were read aloud as white petals fell from the ceiling. The 2005 attacks, carried out by Islamist extremists, involved four suicide bombs on public transport that also injured over 700 people. The commemorative events across London emphasized unity and resilience in the face of terrorism.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Elon Musk for establishing a new political party, which Musk named the "American Party." Trump described the move as "ridiculous" and claimed the tech billionaire has gone "completely off the rails," suggesting third parties only create disruption and chaos. The conflict stems from disagreements over federal spending and the termination of EV tax credits, souring a previously supportive relationship between the two figures. Musk's announcement followed his criticism of Trump's economic plans.</p>

          <p>A suspect identified as 27-year-old Ryan Louis Mosqueda was killed after opening fire on a U.S. Border Patrol building in McAllen, Texas. Mosqueda, who was from Michigan and had been reported missing, used a rifle but did not breach the building's entrance. Two officers and a Border Patrol employee sustained non-life-threatening injuries during the incident, and flights at the nearby airport were temporarily delayed. Authorities, who found additional weapons in the suspect's vehicle, have not yet determined a motive for the attack.</p>

          <p>Independent analyses indicate that current U.S. fiscal policies are projected to add trillions to the national deficit, raising concerns about long-term stability. The deficit is currently exceeding 6% of GDP, a level historically associated with wars or economic crises, prompting fears of a potential reckoning. Experts warn of three primary areas of fallout: market instability, economic strain from inflation, and diminished international standing as interest payments surpass defense spending.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will implement a 25% blanket tariff on all goods imported from Japan and South Korea, effective August 1. The announcement was made via letters shared on social media, which also indicated that additional sector-specific duties could be applied. The policy includes measures to prevent transshipping, where goods are rerouted through other countries to evade the tariffs. This move marks a significant escalation in the administration's aggressive global trade policy.</p>

          <h2>Trump Threatens Additional 10% Tariff on Countries Aligned with BRICS</h2>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose an extra 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he termed the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." The announcement came via social media as the bloc of developing nations held a summit and issued a statement criticizing unilateral protectionist measures. Trump's threat did not specify which policies he considers "Anti-American" but creates new uncertainty for global trade. The move appears to be a direct response to the BRICS group's pushback against his administration's broader tariff strategies.</p>

          <p>An exhaustive review by the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI has confirmed that financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in 2019 and that no secret "client list" exists among his files. The review, which contradicts widespread conspiracy theories, found no evidence to support new investigations against uncharged third parties. Officials also released video footage showing no one entered Epstein's cell area around the time of his death. The DOJ stated its goal was to provide transparency and combat unfounded theories surrounding the case.</p>

          <p>The tactic of federal immigration agents wearing masks and balaclavas during raids in Los Angeles is causing widespread fear and confusion. Critics, including a former ICE official, warn that the practice is dangerous, as it makes it difficult for the public to distinguish between legitimate officers and criminals. While defenders cite agent safety and the threat of doxing as reasons for masking, opponents argue it erodes accountability and escalates tension. The practice has led to concerns about public safety for all residents, regardless of their immigration status.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flooding in Texas was caused by a storm system that dropped up to 20 inches of rain in some areas over the holiday weekend. The Texas Hill Country's topography, characterized by dry, packed soil, is naturally prone to flash floods as it prevents rainwater from being absorbed quickly. The Guadalupe River's two forks both received extreme rainfall, causing them to converge and swell the river by 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the predawn hours. Forecasters expect more rain, though lighter, to continue in the devastated region.</p>

Amid declining childhood vaccination rates and a more lax federal stance on immunization, the CDC has urged summer camps to verify the vaccination status of attendees.
