          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi addressed the arrests of a current and former judge accused of assisting undocumented immigrants, some allegedly violent criminals, to evade arrest. Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested for allegedly obstructing an immigration arrest, while former New Mexico Judge Joel Cano and his wife were arrested for harboring a Venezuelan national with gang ties. Bondi dismissed accusations of the Trump administration intimidating judges, emphasizing that "no one is above the law." She stated that Dugan helped a criminal defendant evade arrest, depriving victims of their day in court. The mayor of Milwaukee criticized the federal agents and Wisconsin's governor criticized Trump's administration. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a $5,000 "baby bonus" to address the declining U.S. birth rate, which is near a record low. Experts suggest that tackling long-standing economic issues like affordable childcare and paid parental leave might be more effective. Other countries with similar incentives have seen mixed results, and the cost of raising a child in the U.S. is substantial, with one analysis finding parents will spend about $300,000 to raise a child to age 18.

          <p>The U.S. dollar index is on track for its worst performance during the first 100 days of a U.S. presidency since the Nixon era. The dollar has lost about 9% since President Trump's return to the White House, driven by his tariff policies and increased risk of a U.S. recession. This has led investors to pile into assets outside of the U.S., weakening the dollar and lifting other currencies and gold.
