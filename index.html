          <p>Democratic legislators have fled Texas to prevent the Republican-controlled state House from achieving a quorum needed to vote on a new congressional map. The proposed map, which Democrats label a partisan gerrymander, aims to increase the GOP's U.S. House majority and was pushed by former President Trump. In response, Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove the absent lawmakers from office, while the Democrats maintain their actions are necessary to protect the democratic process and prevent the disenfranchisement of voters. This standoff also delays other legislative matters, including disaster relief for recent floods.</p>

          <p>Extreme summer heat is causing a surge in severe contact burn injuries from surfaces like pavement and playground equipment. A burn center in Phoenix, Arizona, has documented a significant rise in such cases, linking the trend directly to increasing temperatures driven by climate change. Experts warn that surfaces can become hot enough to cause serious burns within seconds, particularly endangering children and the elderly. Cities like Phoenix are exploring solutions, such as applying special coatings to streets to reduce surface temperatures and mitigate this growing public health risk.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 10,000 European hotels have joined a class-action initiative against the online travel platform Booking.com, seeking compensation for alleged losses. The complaint, supported by hotel associations across Europe, centers on the platform's historical use of "best-price" clauses, which prevented hotels from offering lower rates on their own websites. This legal action follows a European Court of Justice ruling that deemed such clauses illegal. Booking.com has rejected the claims, stating its partners are free to set their own pricing strategies.</p>

          <p>Tesla has awarded CEO Elon Musk a new interim pay package consisting of 96 million shares, valued at approximately $29 billion. This award is designed to vest over two years, contingent on Musk remaining in a key executive role at the company. The move comes as his previous, much larger $56 billion compensation plan from 2018 remains in legal limbo after being voided by a Delaware court. Tesla stated the new package would be forfeited if the original 2018 deal is ultimately upheld, ensuring he is not compensated twice for the same performance.</p>

          <p>Wyoming's governor has signed an agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), allowing state highway patrol troopers to assist federal agents in immigration enforcement. Under this pact, select troopers in counties along major interstates can help track and detain undocumented immigrants under ICE's supervision.

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has announced plans to use a South Florida facility, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," as a model for new state-run migrant detention centers across the country. This strategy involves establishing facilities near airports to expedite the processing and deportation of unauthorized migrants, with potential sites being considered in Arizona, Nebraska, and Louisiana. The initiative aims to be more cost-effective and efficient than the current system, which relies heavily on contracts with private prison companies. However, the model has faced legal challenges and criticism over detainee conditions and the legality of state-run immigration detention.</p>

          <p>Stock prices for retailer American Eagle Outfitters experienced a significant surge of over 15% after former President Donald Trump praised its new advertising campaign. On social media, Trump complimented the campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, calling it the "hottest ad out there" and noting that the jeans were "flying off the shelves." This endorsement reversed a recent slump in the company's stock, which had faced criticism over the campaign's theme.

The deal aims to restore stability to transatlantic trade, with the U.S. imposing 15% tariffs on most European goods and the EU agreeing to remove its own tariffs on U.S. industrial products. The agreement also includes significant, though non-binding, commitments for EU purchases of U.S. energy and investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study reveals a sharp increase in colorectal cancer cases among younger adults in the U.S., particularly during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic. The American Cancer Society noted a 50% relative increase between 2021 and 2022, a trend that contrasts with diagnoses in older populations. This rise is partly attributed to new screening recommendations that lowered the starting age from 50 to 45, leading to the detection of more asymptomatic cases. Despite the concerning trend, experts hope that earlier screening will lead to more successful treatment outcomes for this devastating disease.</p>

The two women were allegedly killed while searching for discarded food on the farm. The worker has turned state witness in the trial against the farm owner and another employee, who face charges of murder, attempted murder, and obstructing justice. The case has ignited widespread outrage and highlighted ongoing racial and economic tensions in rural South Africa, over 30 years after the end of apartheid.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK consumers who purchased a vehicle using car finance over the last 18 years could be eligible for compensation due to hidden commissions. A recent Supreme Court ruling found that the failure by dealers to properly disclose commission payments from lenders could be deemed unfair and unlawful in certain cases. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is now developing a compensation scheme, with the first payments expected in 2026. The ruling particularly affects those with discretionary commission arrangements, which were banned in 2021 but previously allowed dealers to charge higher interest rates to earn more commission.</p>

Bednarek criticized Lyles for unsportsmanlike conduct and a lack of "good character," referencing a simmering personal rivalry.

          <p>A political battle over congressional representation is escalating between Republican-led Texas and Democratic-led states like California. Texas Republicans are attempting a rare mid-decade redistricting to create more GOP-friendly seats for the 2026 midterms, a move prompted by former President Trump. In response, Democratic governors, notably California's Gavin Newsom, have threatened to redraw their own maps to counteract the Republican advantage, creating a tit-for-tat electoral arms race. This conflict challenges traditional redistricting norms and highlights the intense partisan struggle for control of the U.S. House of Representatives, with Democrats facing more legal and political hurdles to retaliate.</p>

          <p>The San Diego Police Department has adopted a new, aggressive tactic to combat the rise of illegal street takeovers by seizing and publicly destroying the vehicles involved. This move is a significant escalation from previous, less stringent approaches in California and aims to send a strong message that such activities will not be tolerated. The practice has sparked debate, with some enthusiasts lamenting the destruction of rare cars, while others question its effectiveness compared to auctioning the vehicles. Proponents argue the public destruction highlights the seriousness of the crimes, which often involve property damage and risk to public safety.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has called for a de-escalation of nuclear rhetoric following a tense exchange between former U.S. President Donald Trump and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. After Medvedev issued threats on social media, Trump responded by announcing the repositioning of U.S. nuclear submarines, which he described as a reaction to Medvedev's "highly inflammatory statements." A Kremlin spokesperson urged all parties to be cautious, while also downplaying Trump's announcement. The exchange occurs as a U.S. envoy prepares to travel to Moscow to press for a ceasefire in Ukraine amid ongoing threats from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans in the Midwest and Northeast are facing poor air quality as smoke from extensive Canadian wildfires drifts south. Air quality alerts were in effect on Monday for numerous states, including Michigan, New York, and Pennsylvania, with the city of Detroit recording some of the worst air quality in the world. The U.S. federal Air Quality Index showed ratings of "unhealthy" and "unhealthy for sensitive groups" across the Great Lakes region and the Northeast.

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a defamation lawsuit filed by Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media, against NBCUniversal. The lawsuit stemmed from comments made by MSNBC host Rachel Maddow in 2021, where she stated Nunes had refused to turn over a package from a suspected Russian agent to the FBI. The judge ruled that no reasonable jury could find that Maddow acted with "actual malice," the legal standard for defaming a public figure. The court found no evidence that Maddow had a high degree of awareness that her statement was probably false when she made it on air.</p>

Furthermore, Berkshire's massive cash pile remained near a record high as the company continued to be a net seller of stocks and did not repurchase any of its own shares, a move that disappointed some investors hoping for a catalyst.

          <p>Israeli authorities have begun euthanizing a large group of crocodiles that were housed at a neglected farm in a West Bank settlement. The reptiles, originally part of a failed tourist attraction, were suffering from poor conditions, including insufficient food that led to cannibalism, and posed a public safety risk due to repeated escapes. The decision to cull the animals was made after years of debate over their fate, which was complicated by a 2012 law that classified them as a protected species. Officials stated the culling was a necessary measure for both public safety and animal welfare reasons.</p>

          <p>This article argues that recent economic data provides Democrats with a significant opportunity to challenge former President Trump's economic narrative. With inflation and unemployment ticking up, and job growth numbers being revised downward, the positive economic picture has faltered. The author suggests that Trump's immediate reaction—attacking the Federal Reserve chair and firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics—shows vulnerability. The commentary posits that Democrats should seize this moment to highlight how Trump's policies, such as tariffs and tax laws perceived to favor the wealthy, are negatively impacting the economy and average voters.</p>

          <p>China's air force has claimed it has developed a "kill chain" strategy that enables its older fighter jets, like the J-10C, to shoot down more advanced stealth fighters. According to a state media broadcast, this was demonstrated in a recent exercise where a J-10C, with support from airborne warning and control system (AWACS) planes and electronic warfare platforms, successfully targeted a stealth aircraft. This systems-based approach, which relies on a network of assets rather than individual plane capabilities, is similar to tactics reportedly used by Pakistan. The development could represent a significant counter to advanced U.S. air power.</p>
