The winner has 180 days to claim the prize and can choose to remain anonymous. The National Lottery operator, Allwyn, has urged players to check their tickets from the Friday night draw. While a substantial amount, this win does not place the holder among the top ten largest EuroMillions jackpots ever won in the UK.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has called on pro-Palestinian demonstrators to postpone planned weekend protests, stating they would cause "distress" to the grieving British Jewish community following a recent deadly synagogue attack in Manchester. Police leaders have noted that policing the protests would strain resources needed to protect Jewish institutions. Despite these calls from the government and community leaders, protest organizers have stated their intention to proceed, asserting that canceling peaceful demonstrations would be a concession to terrorism.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that President Trump utilized a consistent three-pronged negotiating strategy to achieve a deal with Pfizer to lower drug costs for Americans and to broker a 21-point peace plan for Gaza. The author argues that Trump's approach involves ignoring conventional wisdom, aligning the interests of opposing sides, and tenaciously pursuing long-term goals while remaining flexible. The piece credits these tactics for securing a deal to reduce prescription drug prices and for bringing both Israel and Gulf Arab states to agree on a potential ceasefire framework.</p>

          <p>Certified financial planners recommend using the fourth quarter to conduct a thorough review of personal finances, as actual income and spending data are available, which aids in effective tax strategy. With recent tax law changes, such as a temporary increase in the state and local tax deduction cap, proactive planning is particularly crucial this year. Experts also advise creating a holiday season budget now to avoid starting the new year with financial stress, noting that a significant percentage of Americans incurred debt during the previous holiday season.

          <p>A Russian drone attack on a railway station in Shostka, a city in northern Ukraine, has injured at least 30 people. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strike on the passenger train as an act of terrorism targeting civilians. This incident is part of a broader Russian campaign of near-daily strikes on Ukraine's railway system and energy grid over the past two months. The attacks on infrastructure are seen by Kyiv as an attempt to disrupt military transport and weaponize the upcoming winter by disabling essential services for civilians.</p>

          <p>According to a senior Israeli official, the Israel Defense Forces have paused offensive activities in Gaza to allow Hamas to organize the release of hostages, though this does not constitute an official ceasefire. Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas are scheduled to begin in Egypt, which will test the viability of a peace proposal backed by U.S. President Trump. Meanwhile, the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza reported 66 additional Palestinian fatalities in the last 24 hours, bringing the total death toll to over 67,000 since the war began.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch has announced that the Conservative party will withdraw the United Kingdom from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if it wins the next election. The decision follows a party legal review which concluded that remaining in the ECHR obstructs key government policies on migration and the protection of military veterans. The move marks a significant policy shift aimed at asserting national sovereignty over borders and laws, but has drawn criticism from Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who argue it is a divisive and damaging policy driven by pressure from Reform UK.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics and writers are increasingly positioning speculative and science fiction as a tool for cultural influence and a way to offer alternative future visions to those dominated by Western narratives. At a recent conference, scholars noted that the genre provides a platform to explore "what if" scenarios that critique present-day issues while imagining different societal paths. This contrasts with what some describe as the often pessimistic and dystopian futures projected by Western writers, suggesting China is staking a claim on shaping global conversations about the future through its own distinct literary and cultural perspectives.</p>

The article notes that the administration now hand-picks the reporter pool for Oval Office sessions, frequently including personalities who act as foils for the president rather than objective journalists. This dynamic allows the administration to deflect from difficult questions posed by mainstream media, changing the tenor of press interactions and raising concerns about the erosion of accountability and the spread of propaganda from within the White House press corps.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated $7.6 billion in federal grants designated for hundreds of clean energy projects across 16 states that voted for Kamala Harris in the previous presidential election. The Department of Energy stated the projects were cut after a review, but critics, including Democratic governors and senators, have condemned the move as a vindictive and illegal act of political punishment. The cuts affect major initiatives like California's hydrogen hub, threatening jobs and undermining efforts to advance renewable energy technology, with a White House official explicitly linking the cancellations to fighting the "Left's climate agenda."</p>

          <p>This opinion column refutes conservative criticism of the choice of Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny for the Super Bowl halftime show, labeling the backlash as ignorant of both geography and cultural history. The author points out that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and that non-American acts like The Rolling Stones and U2 have headlined the event in the past without similar controversy. The piece argues that objecting to Bad Bunny performing in Spanish is counterproductive and ignores the long history of non-English language music succeeding in the U.S., framing the performance as an opportunity for cultural growth rather than division.</p>

          <p>The California FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort for homeowners, has requested an average rate increase of 35.8% following an estimated $4 billion in losses from January's wildfires. The proposed hike, which requires approval from the state insurance commissioner, comes as the plan has absorbed hundreds of thousands of new policyholders who are unable to find coverage in the private market. The request is controversial, arriving amidst lawsuits and state investigations into the FAIR Plan's alleged mishandling of smoke damage claims, with consumer advocates calling for the rate review to be halted until these issues are resolved.

While credited for his recent role in shaping a 20-point peace plan, former colleagues and diplomats express skepticism, recalling that his previous efforts yielded limited results like strawberry exports rather than major political breakthroughs. Critics suggest he was unwilling to apply sufficient pressure on Israel and lost credibility with Palestinians, raising concerns about his effectiveness and potential conflicts of interest in any future leadership role in the region.</p>
