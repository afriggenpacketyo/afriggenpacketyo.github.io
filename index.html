          <p>Oklahoma's superintendent of schools, Ryan Walters, and Governor Kevin Stitt are at odds over collecting student immigration status. Walters wants to collect this data and share it with federal authorities to support President Trump's deportation plans, citing an executive order. Stitt disagrees, stating that the Trump administration is not requesting this information and replaced three Oklahoma State Board of Education members.

          <p>Luigi Mangione's lawyers are seeking to dismiss his state murder charges in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, arguing that the case and a parallel federal death penalty prosecution constitute double jeopardy. They also want terrorism charges dropped and evidence collected during Mangione's arrest excluded. The defense alleges that Mangione's constitutional rights were violated during his arrest. Mangione has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his lawyers are pushing for the federal case to take precedence.</p>

Hasbro aims to source 40% of its products outside of China by the end of 2026, shifting manufacturing to countries including the U.S., Turkey, Japan, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia. While China will remain an important sourcing location, Hasbro expects to mitigate potential losses through this diversification strategy. Cocks anticipates prices will increase but believes Hasbro's flexibility will help keep them lower than competitors.</p>
