          <h2>Systemic Flaws and Political Realities Doomed UK's High Speed 2 Rail Project, Insiders Claim</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 19:03:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Insiders and official reports suggest the UK's High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project was destined for its massive budget and schedule overruns from the start. The initial ambition for world-leading speed dramatically increased costs, while a complex parliamentary approval process added further expenses through numerous compromises to gain political support. The article argues that fundamental challenges of building major infrastructure on a small, densely populated, democratic island, combined with a flawed planning system, created a "casebook example of how not to run a major project." These systemic issues raise serious questions about the UK's capacity for future large-scale infrastructure endeavors.</p>

          <p>The UK's Girlguiding organization has unveiled 72 new badges, marking only the second major update in its 116-year history to stay relevant to modern girls. The new awards were developed with input from over 20,000 girls and volunteers and cover contemporary topics like online fandoms, environmentalism, and activism. Younger members can earn badges for activities like "laughter" and "bee rescuer," while older girls can be recognized for interests in folklore, upcycling, and becoming a "booktivist." This initiative aims to build confidence and address current issues while maintaining the organization's core values.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 19:00:38 EDT</div>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed a national inquiry will be held into the violent 1984 clash between police and miners at the Orgreave coking plant, a pivotal event during the year-long miners' strike. The confrontation, known as the "Battle of Orgreave," resulted in over 100 injuries and the arrest of 95 miners, though the subsequent court case collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry will address the "unanswered questions" held by affected communities for 40 years. Campaigners, who have long sought an investigation, expressed cautious optimism that the truth will finally be uncovered.</p>

          <p>Once overshadowed by tequila, artisanal mezcal is experiencing a global surge in popularity, transforming the fortunes of family-owned distilleries in Oaxaca, Mexico. The spirit, made from roasted agave, has evolved from a local tradition into a half-billion-dollar industry featured in high-end bars worldwide. This article highlights the story of the Hernandez brothers, who returned from the U.S. to expand their fourth-generation distillery, and their partnership with an American entrepreneur that helped elevate their brand. Their success reflects a broader trend of preserving traditional, handcrafted production methods while navigating international business, benefiting their local community.</p>

          <p>An off-color joke by ESPN host Elle Duncan during the WNBA All-Star Game broadcast has generated mixed reactions from viewers on social media. Commenting on the game's lack of defensive play at halftime, Duncan made a risqué comparison to a "girls' trip to Cancun," which prompted a quick rebuke from her co-host. While some viewers criticized the comment as unprofessional, others defended it as harmless humor. The incident occurred during a high-scoring game where defense was minimal, a common characteristic of all-star exhibition matches across professional sports.</p>

          <p>A new book reveals a Vatican-supported program from 1950 to 1970 that sent approximately 3,500 Italian children to the United States for adoption under an "orphan visa."

Many mothers believed the placement was temporary and were devastated to learn their children had been sent overseas, with some being falsely told their child had died.

The article details his remarkable run, including winning four major championships in the last four seasons and consistently outperforming his peers, who now view him as "the bar" for excellence. While Scheffler himself dismisses the comparisons as premature, his machine-like consistency and ability to close out tournaments have led many in the golf world to draw parallels.

Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, have condemned the decision, arguing it will cripple the EPA's ability to use the best available science to protect public health and safety.

The friendly notice comes after a viral incident at a previous show where a man and woman, later identified as executives from the same company, were caught on camera in an intimate moment and quickly separated. That incident led to professional consequences for the pair, with the male CEO resigning after an internal investigation was launched.

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships emphasizes that teaching 'self-connection' is the single most important skill for a child's lifelong success. This skill involves the ability to recognize and trust one's own emotions, needs, and inner voice, which builds resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. The article suggests that common parental responses, like dismissing a child's fears or upsets, can inadvertently teach them to distrust their feelings. The author provides practical tips for parents to foster this connection, such as validating emotions, modeling self-awareness, and celebrating a child's inherent qualities, not just their achievements.</p>

Stein expresses concern that discussions have been narrowly focused on tariffs, while American businesses face broader operational challenges in China. He suggests that a U.S. reciprocation to China's recent move to restrict fentanyl precursors could be a pathway toward normalizing the complex trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

The collapse of the plea agreements, which would have taken the death penalty off the table, sends the proceedings back toward potential full military commission trials.

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass described a climate of fear in her city resulting from the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement. In an interview, she stated that ICE raids have made many residents, including legal residents and citizens, afraid to leave their homes, impacting local businesses and community life. Bass criticized the tactics used by federal agents, such as wearing masks and using unmarked cars, which she said resemble kidnappings and sow distrust. While acknowledging the administration's help during recent wildfires, she condemned the immigration crackdown as punitive and the deployment of federal troops as an unnecessary show of force.</p>

Scheffler reiterated that while winning is a great feeling, his ultimate fulfillment comes from his family and faith, not professional accomplishments.

In a social media post, Trump called the story "untruthful" and asserted his own superior understanding of the market, stating, "People don't explain to me, I explain to them!"
