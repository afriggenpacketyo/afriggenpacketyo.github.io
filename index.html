          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government experienced a significant political defeat after being forced into a major U-turn on its welfare reform bill. Facing a large-scale rebellion from his own Labour MPs, Starmer had to abandon key proposals, leaving a substantial hole in the public finances. The chaotic events have weakened the Prime Minister's authority, drawing comparisons to more turbulent periods in recent British politics and raising questions about his control over the party. The climbdown has reportedly led to internal animosity and uncertainty about future fiscal policy.</p>

          <p>Paramount has agreed to a $16 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by President Trump over a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris. The lawsuit, widely seen as an attack on press freedom, claimed that CBS News deceptively edited Harris's response to a question. Under the settlement terms, the money will be allocated to Trump's future presidential library and legal fees, with no direct payment to Trump himself and no apology from the network. Paramount also agreed that "60 Minutes" will release transcripts of future interviews with presidential candidates.</p>

Despite the long odds, Tarvet expresses quiet confidence, viewing the match as a competitive opportunity rather than just an experience.

          <p>The number of current and former UK armed forces aircrew suing the Ministry of Defence over cancer diagnoses has grown to at least 180. The claimants allege their illnesses were caused by prolonged exposure to toxic exhaust fumes in military helicopters like the Sea King and Puma. The MoD has reached out-of-court settlements in some cases without admitting liability but maintains it believes the emissions pose no health risk. Veterans' groups and advocates are calling for a cancer screening program and greater transparency from the government to protect those still serving.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive legislative package central to President Trump's agenda has cleared the House Rules Committee, setting it up for a full House vote. The bill, which encompasses tax cuts, border security, and other key priorities, advanced despite opposition from Democrats and some conservative Republicans who raised concerns about its fiscal impact. Republican leadership is pushing to pass the legislation before the July 4th holiday, framing it as the fulfillment of campaign promises to the American people. The bill's passage through the full chamber remains uncertain due to a narrow Republican majority. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent G7 agreement on global taxation is facing criticism for allegedly undermining a landmark international deal by exempting U.S. multinational corporations from its rules. The original 2021 OECD agreement, known as Pillar Two, aimed to establish a 15% global minimum corporate tax to prevent a "race to the bottom." However, critics argue that by caving to U.S. pressure, the G7 has weakened this framework, allowing American companies to maintain a competitive advantage by using tax havens. This move is seen as a blow to tax justice and multilateralism, potentially costing other nations billions in revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants living in the U.S. this year. The decision prevents the Department of Homeland Security from revoking their legal status and work permits, a move that was planned for September. The judge stated that the administration does not have the authority to prematurely end the designation, which the previous administration had extended until February 2026. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, creating ongoing uncertainty for the affected individuals.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced a halt to some weapons shipments to Ukraine, citing concerns that U.S. military stockpiles have fallen too low. The decision was made after a Department of Defense review and was described as putting "America's interests first." While the specific systems affected were not detailed, the move is understood to include air defense interceptors and precision munitions, representing a significant blow to Kyiv's defense capabilities against Russian attacks.

          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly exploring a significant strategic change for the company's contract manufacturing, or "foundry," business. The potential shift involves no longer marketing its 18A chipmaking processâ€”a technology that was a cornerstone of the previous CEO's strategyâ€”to external customers due to production delays and waning client interest. Instead, the company may focus its resources on the next-generation 14A process, where it believes it can better compete with rival TSMC. This move could result in a multi-billion dollar write-off but is aimed at reviving the struggling chipmaker's fortunes. (not investment advice)</p>

The center, surrounded by swampland, was constructed to support the administration's intensified immigration enforcement and mass deportation efforts. Trump praised the facility and its deterrent qualities, while critics have condemned it as an inhumane camp and raised legal challenges over its constitutionality and environmental impact. The facility can currently house 3,000 people and is part of a broader strategy to establish similar centers in other states.</p>
