          <p>Intense sectarian fighting in Syria's Suweida province has led to Israeli military strikes against Syrian government targets in Damascus and the south. The U.S. has announced an agreement on "specific steps" intended to de-escalate the conflict, which has reportedly killed over 300 people. Syrian forces have begun withdrawing from Suweida as part of a deal, while Israel stated its military operations would continue until hostile forces retreat completely. The situation has created a dire humanitarian crisis, with shortages of water and medical supplies reported in the region.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama have jointly addressed persistent divorce rumors, dismissing them with humor on a recent podcast episode. The speculation arose after Barack Obama attended several high-profile events alone earlier in the year. Michelle Obama explained her absence by stating she now feels free to make her own decisions, as her children are grown and her husband is out of office. She reaffirmed the strength of their marriage, emphasizing that despite challenges, she has never considered leaving her husband.</p>

          <p>A package of bills aimed at regulating the cryptocurrency industry has stalled in the U.S. House of Representatives for a second day due to opposition from a bloc of conservative Republicans. Despite negotiations and an intervention from President Trump, last-minute changes failed to secure enough support to advance the legislation. The stalemate casts doubt on the Republican conference's ability to unify on crypto policy and threatens the industry's hopes for clear regulatory frameworks. The opposition came not just from hardliners but also from lawmakers on key committees who authored the bills. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of online firearms retailer GrabAGun plummeted by over 20% on their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The public debut followed a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and was marked by Donald Trump Jr., a shareholder and advisor, ringing the opening bell. Trump Jr. framed the public listing as a "vindication" against "woke nonsense." The company, which now trades under the ticker PEW, raised $179 million from the merger, representing another instance of Trump family allies backing politically conservative businesses.

          <p>Minnesota Twins outfielder Byron Buxton has voiced strong opposition to the Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) system, which made its MLB All-Star Game debut. The "robot umpire" technology allows teams to challenge ball and strike calls, with a notable instance occurring in the first inning when a call was overturned. Buxton expressed his disapproval to Fox News Digital, stating that the system complicates the game and detracts from its traditional elements.

          <p>Details have emerged about a major 2022 data breach where a UK official accidentally leaked a spreadsheet with personal information of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had sought relocation. To manage the fallout, the government secretly established the Afghanistan Response Route (ARR) to evacuate those at risk, spending £400m so far without informing them of the breach. A super-injunction was used to prevent any public reporting on the matter until it was recently lifted by a High Court. The leak raised severe safety concerns, although a government review later suggested the data might not have spread as widely as feared.</p>

While most Republican officeholders remain loyal, polls show a broad public consensus, including among Republicans, for the release of all government documents.

          <p>The United States has deported five immigrants from various countries to Eswatini, a small African nation with a troubling human rights record. The Department of Homeland Security stated the men had been convicted of serious crimes, including murder and sexual assault, and that their home countries had refused to accept them back. This action is part of the Trump administration's increasing use of "third country" deportations, a practice recently cleared by the Supreme Court. Eswatini, an absolute monarchy, confirmed it accepted the deportees following high-level engagement with the U.S. and is holding them in correctional facilities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is considering the Genius Act, a bill that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation, which has bipartisan support and already passed the Senate, aims to provide consumer protections and clear rules for the $250 billion market. Supporters argue that regulated stablecoins could facilitate faster and cheaper financial transactions, while critics point to risks such as the potential for the digital currency to "depeg" from its underlying asset. The bill is part of a broader push to create clear guidelines for the digital asset industry. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite a late-game scare when England took two quick wickets, India held its nerve to complete its second-highest successful chase in the format.

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic explores how Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) agenda is being implemented more aggressively by individual states than by the federal government. States like Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma have passed laws restricting food additives, banning soda purchases with food stamps, and removing fluoride from water, all key tenets of Kennedy's platform. This state-level approach allows the administration to advance its goals without creating new federal regulations, a strategy that aligns with its broader political philosophy. The article suggests this patchwork of state laws could pressure national food companies to change their products nationwide.</p>

However, the court's jurisdiction is not absolute; it generally requires states to consent to its authority, either through a blanket declaration or on a case-by-case basis.
