          <p>President Trump nominated Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer aligned with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as Surgeon General, igniting debate within the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement. Means, known for her focus on metabolic health and criticism of the healthcare system, has faced scrutiny for her views on vaccines and qualifications for the role. While Kennedy defends Means as the ideal choice to prioritize metabolic health, some anti-vaccine activists question her commitment to MAHA's goals, sparking internal tensions within the movement. Means's nomination reflects Kennedy's broader agenda of reshaping the nation's approach to health and wellness.</p>

Police prepared a file on Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers for prosecutors, but the case was dropped due to insufficient evidence.

          <p>This week's inflation report is expected to provide initial insights into the impact of President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement on U.S. pricing. Economists anticipate a slight cooling in prices, despite initial concerns about inflation due to tariff escalations. However, a rollback of some levies, including temporary tariff cuts on China, may mitigate the impact on inflation. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that sustained tariff increases could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, and the Fed opted to keep interest rates unchanged while monitoring the effects of tariffs.</p>

          <p>Honda Motor reported a 76% plunge in operating profit for the fourth quarter, missing earnings estimates as the company braces for the impact of U.S. tariffs. While motorcycle sales achieved record highs, the automobile business experienced a drop in sales, particularly in China and Southeast Asia. The company downgraded financial metrics for the current fiscal year, projecting a significant fall in operating profit and net profit, citing the impact of tariff policies worldwide. Honda also terminated merger talks with rival Nissan, which would have created the world's third-largest automaker.</p>

The construction, funded by federal and state money, is scheduled to last until May 2026, with a pause this summer.</p>
