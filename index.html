          <p>Sectarian clashes between Bedouin and Druze communities persist in southern Syria's Suweida province, despite an announced ceasefire by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa and deployment of security forces. Over 900 people have reportedly been killed in the past week, with all sides accused of atrocities, including government forces. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the violence, demanding an end to the "sexual assault and slaughter of innocent people" and accountability for perpetrators, including those in their own ranks. Israel has also intervened, supporting the Druze and striking Damascus, underscoring the complex regional involvement in protecting minorities and the ongoing instability.</p>

          <p>Australian boxer Tim Tszyu faced another major setback, losing to Sebastian Fundora in a seventh-round TKO during their highly anticipated world-title rematch in Las Vegas. This defeat marks Tszyu's third in his last four fights, following an impressive 24-bout unbeaten start to his professional career. Fundora, a significantly taller opponent, dominated early, dropping Tszyu in the opening round and causing a severe cut above his right eye in the second. Despite Tszyu's valiant efforts and some effective body shots, he was unable to continue, prompting discussions about his next career move, potentially to a different weight class.</p>

          <h2>New $250 'Visa Integrity Fee' Introduced for U.S. Nonimmigrant Travelers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 23:07:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's new One Big Beautiful Bill Act introduces a mandatory $250 "visa integrity fee" for all nonimmigrant visa holders entering the United States, effective October 1, 2024. This fee is in addition to existing visa charges and a raised Form I-94 fee, potentially increasing costs significantly for business travelers, tourists, and students. While reimbursements are theoretically possible if visa conditions are met, details on payment and refund processes remain largely unclear, causing "significant challenges and unanswered questions" for implementation among U.S. Travel Association officials. Experts advise treating the fee as nonrefundable due to expected difficulties in obtaining refunds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Officials in hard-hit Kerr County, Texas, announced a significant positive development regarding the deadly July 4 floods, with the number of missing persons dropping from nearly 100 to just three. This reduction is attributed to extensive follow-up work by over 1,000 local, state, and federal authorities who tirelessly verified the safety of many initially unaccounted for individuals. While the overall death toll from the floods across Texas stands at 134, including 107 in Kerr County, this news brings considerable relief. Three people remain missing in Travis County and one in Burnet County.</p>

          <p>Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, is facing an unprecedented water crisis, with a recent Mercy Corps report warning it could become the first modern capital to run completely dry. This dire situation stems from decades of rapid population growth, climate change, and relentless over-extraction, which have severely depleted groundwater levels and dried up nearly half of the city's boreholes. Families are forced to spend up to 30% of their income on often contaminated water, leading to widespread health issues and impacting children's ability to attend school. The crisis is further compounded by political instability and a significant freeze in foreign aid.</p>

This widespread profitability underscores Bitcoin's remarkable ability to generate wealth for investors across various time horizons, validating its long-term thesis. The current surge is largely driven by increasing institutional adoption and consistent inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, indicating a fundamentally different market structure compared to previous cycles. However, historically, extreme profitability readings like this can signal either the beginning of a sustained breakout phase or a temporary market peak before a period of consolidation.

The proposal follows incidents like the Southport attack, where a perpetrator murdered three girls without a clear ideological link, limiting early intervention powers.

          <p>Drivers at Edinburgh Airport are increasingly resorting to parking in lay-bys and side streets near the terminal to circumvent the "kiss-and-fly" drop-off fees, which can cost £6 for a mere 10-minute stay. An RAC survey indicates that over half of the UK's busiest airports have increased these charges in the last year. Many drivers now wait for passenger arrival messages before executing quick pick-ups, often risking fines for parking illegally. While the airport provides a free drop-off zone about half a mile away, its distance creates significant difficulties for passengers with mobility issues, fueling widespread frustration among motorists who view the charges as excessive.</p>

          <p>In occupied areas of eastern Ukraine, Russia is implementing an extensive and systematic campaign to indoctrinate children with pro-Russian sentiments, aiming to erase their Ukrainian national identity. This comprehensive effort includes nursery school children participating in parades with Russian military symbols and learning the Russian anthem. State-sponsored organizations like Yunarmia, affiliated with the Russian defense ministry, provide military and patriotic training to children as young as eight. Schools use Russian curricula and textbooks that justify the war, while Russian soldiers conduct "bravery lessons." Disturbingly, thousands of Ukrainian children have also been forcibly deported to Russia, a clear violation of international humanitarian law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant debate is intensifying in the UK regarding the optimal length of summer school holidays, with proponents advocating for shorter breaks to potentially benefit pupils' learning and alleviate childcare challenges for working parents. While England, Wales, and Scotland traditionally have six-week summer breaks, some academies have already adopted a five-week model with extended half-terms. Supporters argue this could reduce "holiday hunger" and narrow the learning gap, especially for disadvantaged children. However, teachers' unions express concerns about burnout, and some parents worry about increased holiday costs due to compressed demand, highlighting complex social, economic, and educational considerations in this ongoing discussion.</p>

          <p>The escalating global demand for lithium, a critical component for green technologies like electric car batteries and solar energy storage, is paradoxically exacerbating an environmental crisis in Chile's Atacama Desert. Lithium extraction, predominantly through pumping brine, consumes immense quantities of water in this already drought-prone region, severely impacting local ecosystems and indigenous communities. Residents report alarming changes, including shrinking lagoons, a decline in flamingo reproduction, and the death of native trees. While mining companies are piloting new, less water-intensive technologies, local communities remain skeptical, fearing their ancestral lands are being exploited as a "natural laboratory" in the race for decarbonization.</p>

          <p>The UK Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is advocating for a significant shift in savings habits, encouraging people to move from low-interest cash ISAs to stocks and shares ISAs, asserting that current risk warnings obscure potential financial rewards. She proposes targeted messages from banks and has not ruled out cutting the annual tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to incentivize this change. However, financial experts caution against forcing this shift, particularly in volatile markets, and emphasize the critical need for improved financial understanding and tailored approaches, especially to encourage more women to invest. This debate reflects a broader governmental push to stimulate long-term investment in the UK economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's burgeoning economy is fostering a new generation of wealthy individuals, leading to the emergence of modern, members-only clubs that cater to their distinct needs, a departure from traditional Raj-era gymkhanas. International chains like Soho House are expanding rapidly, recognizing a strong demand for exclusive spaces where "new wealth" entrepreneurs and creators can network and access diverse communities. Unlike older clubs, these new establishments prioritize personal accomplishment and future potential over family legacy, attracting a self-made elite. While offering unique opportunities and a more democratic ethos, these clubs remain highly exclusive due to prohibitive membership costs, largely inaccessible to the average middle-class Indian.</p>

Snopes identified numerous signs of AI manipulation within the photograph, including deformed hands, distorted background faces, and unnatural body parts, confirming its inauthenticity. While some genuine photographs of Trump and Epstein together do exist from past interactions, this specific image is a fabrication.
