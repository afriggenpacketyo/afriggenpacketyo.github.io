          <p>Shares of Novo Nordisk experienced a surge following the company's announcement that sales of its weight loss drug, Wegovy, are expected to improve as competition from copycat compounded drugs diminishes. The Danish pharmaceutical giant had previously reported lower-than-expected first-quarter sales due to these alternative versions impacting their U.S. market share. However, the FDA's decision to end a drug shortage ruling will allow Novo Nordisk to regain business growth, with CEO Lars Fruergaard JÃ¸rgensen emphasizing the company's commitment to pursuing unlawful distributors of copycat drugs. The company is also launching a direct-to-consumer online pharmacy to provide a safe alternative to compounded drugs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter results revealed earnings per share that exceeded analysts' expectations, although revenue growth did not meet anticipated levels, leading to a share price decrease. The ride-sharing company reported a 14% increase in revenue compared to the previous year, along with a net income of $1.78 billion. Uber's key business segments, including ride-hailing and food delivery, experienced year-over-year growth in bookings.

          <p>The UK government has lowered the minimum age to become a train driver from 20 to 18 years old in an effort to address driver shortages that frequently disrupt rail services. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander announced the change as a measure to improve train services and create job opportunities. Union Aslef supports the move, stating it will open opportunities for school leavers, while the Rail Safety and Standards Board assures that research indicates 18-year-olds can safely become train drivers. The Department for Transport hopes this change will alleviate cancellations caused by driver shortages, as the average age of train drivers is 48, with a significant portion nearing retirement.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a gene in upland rice roots linked to drought resistance, potentially transforming irrigated rice into drought-tolerant varieties. The research identified the HMGB1 gene, which obstructs the development of deeper, thicker roots crucial for drought resistance. By removing this gene, irrigated rice developed longer roots and greater drought tolerance, similar to upland rice. This discovery could enable rice to thrive in water-scarce environments, enhancing food security in regions facing drought conditions, as the researchers emphasize the importance of the HMGB1 gene as a key factor in facilitating root elongation and thickening in upland rice.</p>

A report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) reveals that 31% of revenue agents, responsible for performing audits, have left the agency in the first three months of 2025. Experts warn that losing a large share of auditors could impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue, particularly from wealthy taxpayers and corporations.

          <p>Xi Jinping began his state visit to Russia by thanking Moscow for supporting Taiwan's reunification with mainland China. He framed China's stance on Taiwan as part of the post-war international order, emphasizing that the China-Russia relationship would not be influenced by any third party. This visit coincides with preparations for the first face-to-face trade talks between Beijing and Washington since the announcement of US President Donald Trump's tariffs. Beijing confirmed that Vice-Premier He Lifeng would meet his US counterparts in Switzerland to discuss tariffs, as China unveiled policy package to guard against US tariffs ahead of trade talks in Switzerland.</p>

          <p>China is seeking to portray itself as responsible by agreeing to meet with American officials to discuss trade, while warning Washington against using the engagement to increase pressure. Despite initial reluctance, Beijing indicated its top trade official would meet with the Treasury Secretary in Switzerland, maintaining a tough stance against coercion. The move comes as economic data reveals the impact of trade brinkmanship on both countries, with Chinese factories experiencing a slowdown and the American economy shrinking. While both countries seem interested in reducing tariffs, neither side has wanted to make the initial concession.</p>

The U.S. diplomatic mission in Pakistan issued a security alert, advising U.S. nationals to depart conflict areas or shelter in place.

The experiences division, including parks and cruise lines, also saw revenue increase, driven by domestic theme park attendance and cruise ship bookings.

          <p>Right-wing intellectuals, often feeling marginalized in liberal-dominated fields like journalism and academia, are contributing to an idea of America detached from reality. This disconnect is exacerbated by homogeneous conservative spaces where they reinforce their sense of cultural threat from the left. Figures like Patrick Deneen and Michael Anton promote the idea that American culture is hostile to conservatives, justifying Trumpian authoritarianism as a defensive response. This perspective, though not reflective of America's reality, influences policy in areas like immigration, education, and foreign policy, with figures like JD Vance and Chris Rufo shaping the Trump administration's approach.</p>

The judge granted Tamura a suspended sentence due to her limited involvement, as her actions were confined to allowing the head to be hidden after it had already been brought home.

The deal, which will make it easier for UK firms to export goods like whisky and cars to India, is expected to boost trade by Â£25.5bn a year by 2040. Lowering tariffs on items like clothing and jewellery could lead to cheaper prices for consumers, while the Scotch Whisky Association anticipates significant export growth and job creation.</p>

          <p>Container bookings from China to the United States have plummeted by 27% year-on-year, reaching their lowest level since February, as the impact of increased US tariffs becomes evident. Seen as an indicator of export activity, container bookings dropped to 52,073 20-foot equivalent units (TEU) after a sharp weekly decline. This decrease signals a disruption in supply chains and a shift in sourcing strategies, as shippers pull back sharply in response to new tariff policies. Uncertainty over future tariff levels is causing supply chain teams to rethink timing, inventory levels, and sourcing strategies, leading to continued volatility in bookings.</p>

Critics argue that ending the research protects Musk's business interests, as the research could lead to new regulations for the commercial space industry.
