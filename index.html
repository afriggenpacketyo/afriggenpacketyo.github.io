          <h2>Chinese Exports Slump to the US Amidst Trade War, Southeast Asia Trade Jumps</h2>

          <p>New York Times article: Chinese exports experienced a significant decline in shipments to the United States in April due to President Trump's high tariffs. However, overall exports from China saw an increase, driven by a surge in trade with Southeast Asian countries. This shift indicates a redirection of trade as Chinese factories are increasingly leveraging their presence in countries like Vietnam and Thailand to fulfill orders destined for the United States, with Chinese exports to the United States plunging by 21 percent. The April data provides temporary relief for Beijing policymakers amidst concerns about the trade war's economic impact, but economists caution about potential unemployment spikes if factory orders continue to decline.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a deal to reduce or remove tariffs on certain goods traded between the countries, including cars, steel, and aluminum. While this is not a comprehensive trade deal, it reverses some of President Trump's tariffs on specific goods. Car tariffs have been cut to 10% for a limited number of UK exports, and tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US have been scrapped, though quotas may apply. The agreement also addresses pharmaceuticals, with both countries intending to negotiate preferential treatment outcomes, but leaves the UK's digital services tax unchanged.</p>

While revenue increased by about 28% year-on-year, and profit surged 162%, both figures fell short of expectations. The company attributed the miss to "production fluctuations" which sent blended average selling prices falling. However, SMIC's wafer shipments increased, driven by changes in geopolitics and increased demand from government policies, with capacity utilization reaching 89.6%.</p>

          <p>Some of Asia's wealthiest families are reducing their exposure to U.S. assets due to President Trump's tariffs, citing increased unpredictability in the U.S. economy. Family offices are shifting investments to Asia and Europe, with some exiting U.S. holdings entirely. This pullback marks a shift from earlier optimism following Trump's election. Hong Kong and mainland China are among the markets benefiting from this trend, as wealthy investors seek safer and more predictable investment environments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's tariffs on imported aluminum have reshaped global trade flows and increased costs for American consumers, but they have failed to revive domestic aluminum production. Rising electricity prices in the U.S. relative to global competitors are leading to smelter closures rather than restarts. High energy costs plague the U.S. aluminum industry, forcing cutbacks and closures, while smelters in Canada, Norway, and the Middle East secure long-term energy contracts. The artificial intelligence boom and the proliferation of data centers are also competing for power, further exacerbating the issue.</p>
