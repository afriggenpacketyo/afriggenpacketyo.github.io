          <p>The annual Budapest Pride march is expected to draw large crowds, including international supporters and European Union officials, despite a police ban enacted under a controversial "child-protection" law. The event has become a symbol of resistance against the nationalist government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban and its increasing repression of civil liberties. While over 30 embassies have voiced support for the march, the Hungarian government has warned that attendees risk being accused of a misdemeanor, highlighting the growing tension between the government and civil society groups.</p>

          <p>At least 11 people, including four children and three women, have been killed by severe flash floods and landslides in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The flooding, which occurred in the Swat Valley and Malakand district, also damaged dozens of houses and left six others injured, with rescue operations ongoing.

          <p>A significant rift has emerged within Germany's ruling coalition regarding the country's energy future, particularly on the role of nuclear power. The dispute became public after the Economy Minister attended a meeting of pro-nuclear EU states, drawing criticism from the Environment Minister, who reaffirmed Germany's commitment to its nuclear phase-out. This internal disagreement is compounded by controversial plans to build 20 new gas-fired power plants, a move that climate experts warn could jeopardize Germany's goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2045.</p>

          <p>According to a chief economist at China International Capital Corporation, China's established third-party payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay give the nation a significant comparative advantage in the global race to develop stablecoins.

This existing infrastructure, backed by central bank money, positions China favorably as digital currencies become increasingly central to the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study from the Japan Institute for Health Security suggests that consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet is associated with a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age adults. The research focused on diets that regularly include rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, cooked vegetables, mushrooms, seaweed, and green tea. These findings indicate that this dietary pattern, characterized by a variety of nutrient-rich components, may provide significant benefits for mental health and well-being.</p>

Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the reform, part of a new 10-year strategy, aims to simplify the system and focus resources on frontline care, or "doers" rather than "checkers," though critics worry about the loss of vital functions.</p>

          <p>This opinion article examines the impending eviction of all residents from the village of Littlebredy in Dorset, England, after the Bridehead Estate was sold to an anonymous client of a private equity firm. The author argues this situation exemplifies a broader issue in rural England, where the immense power of concentrated, non-transparent wealth is the true source of conflict, not a supposed cultural divide between urban and rural populations. Citing polling data, the article contends that both groups largely agree on key issues, suggesting the "culture war" narrative is a distraction from the real problems of land ownership and control.</p>

          <p>United States federal prosecutors have indicted 11 individuals for their alleged involvement in a massive, Russia-based scheme that attempted to defraud the Medicare program of $10.6 billion. The indictment claims the transnational criminal group stole the personal data of over a million Medicare beneficiaries to submit fraudulent claims for expensive medical equipment that was never actually provided. The organization successfully obtained approximately $41 million from Medicare and an estimated $900 million from supplemental insurers before the fraud was uncovered.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4 to take sole possession of the best record in Major League Baseball, despite a performance their manager described as far from perfect. The victory was hard-fought, marked by early defensive errors and an inconsistent offense, but key plays like Shohei Ohtani's 29th home run and a go-ahead single from Mookie Betts proved decisive. The game concluded with a dramatic bases-loaded double play, showcasing the team's resilience and ability to win even when not playing at its best.</p>

          <p>In a significant 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that parents have a right to opt their children out of public school lessons that feature LGBTQ-themed storybooks if the material offends their religious beliefs. The case originated from a lawsuit by parents in Montgomery County, Maryland, who objected to a curriculum that included nine specific picture books, such as "Prince and Knight."

While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself, the decision clears a path for the administration to begin implementing it in states not protected by narrower, plaintiff-specific court orders. This development sets the stage for protracted legal battles and creates profound uncertainty around a right long considered guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.</p>

This ground subsidence is occurring faster than sea levels are rising, which could significantly degrade the city's ability to withstand storm surges and increase flood risk. The research, which used satellite radar data, identified sinking hotspots around industrial sites and new developments, highlighting an urgent need for ongoing monitoring and maintenance of the post-Katrina defenses.</p>
