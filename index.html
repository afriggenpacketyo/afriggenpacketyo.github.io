          <p>Prosecutors have revealed key evidence against Bryan Kohberger, who pleaded guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. The case was built on extensive surveillance footage, cell phone tracking, and crucial DNA evidence from a knife sheath left at the scene. A major breakthrough came when investigators matched this DNA to Kohberger through a Q-tip retrieved from his family's trash, linking him directly to the crime. While the evidence explains how the crime was solved, Kohberger’s plea deal, which spares him the death penalty, leaves the motive and victim selection a mystery.</p>

          <p>An American novelist, Eleonor "Gay" Courter, and her husband are facing a potential trial in France for their alleged role in selling stolen gold bars. The bullion was plundered decades ago from the 18th-century French shipwreck, Le Prince de Conty. French investigators tracked the gold after it appeared on a U.S. auction site, leading them to the couple who claim they were unknowingly helping a French friend sell the items. The case highlights a complex international investigation into looted historical artifacts, with the couple maintaining their innocence and claiming they did not profit from the sales.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tax bill is set to deliver significant benefits to the wealthiest Americans, extending many of the 2017 tax cuts and introducing new breaks. Key provisions include raising the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 for those earning under $500,000 and expanding benefits for investors in qualified small businesses. The legislation also makes the increased estate tax exemption permanent, a major advantage for ultra-wealthy families planning their estates. While these changes are projected to boost after-tax income for millionaires, they also include some limitations on itemized deductions for top earners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence & Analysis (I&A) is planning to cut its workforce by nearly 75%, reducing staff from around 1,000 to 275.

I&A is the only U.S. intelligence agency mandated to share threat information with state and local partners.

          <p>In a lengthy speech on the House floor, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries strongly condemned the Republican-backed spending bill, delaying a final vote for several hours. Jeffries criticized the legislation as an "immoral document," focusing on its projected negative impact on healthcare, particularly Medicaid, and other social programs like SNAP. He argued that the cuts would cause millions of Americans to lose health insurance and that the bill prioritizes benefits for the wealthy at the expense of children, seniors, and everyday Americans. His speech highlighted the deep partisan divide over the bill's fiscal and social priorities.</p>

          <p>A recent pause in U.S. military aid to Ukraine, including Patriot missiles, is reportedly linked to a broader strategic review championed by Pentagon policy chief Elbridge Colby. Colby has long advocated for conserving American military resources for a potential conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific, prioritizing Asia over commitments in Europe. While the Pentagon initially cited concerns about U.S. munitions stockpiles, the move aligns with Colby's "America First" agenda, which aims to refocus defense priorities.

Despite these successes, challenges like youth unemployment and migration persist, with about 6% of young people leaving the country between 2009 and 2021.

This stronger euro, combined with a 10% baseline U.S. tariff on EU goods, is making European products more expensive and less competitive in the American market, creating a "painful" situation for exporters. Key sectors like pharmaceuticals and automotive manufacturing are particularly vulnerable as a July 9 deadline looms to avoid even higher tariffs.

Bove faced allegations of abusive behavior as a prosecutor and involvement in politically charged actions at the Department of Justice.

          <p>J. Michael Luttig, a respected conservative former federal judge, has publicly expressed his disappointment with Chief Justice John Roberts for his "unforgivable reticence" in confronting Donald Trump's attacks on the judiciary. Luttig argues that Roberts has failed to speak out directly and forcefully against the former president's rhetoric, which Luttig believes undermines the rule of law and endangers judges. While Roberts has occasionally issued broad defenses of the judiciary, Luttig contends these statements are insufficient and that the Chief Justice has a profound obligation to condemn the specific threats posed by a political leader.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is poised to pass President Trump's major spending package after an overnight session where Republican leaders, with Trump's help, secured the votes of party holdouts. The "big beautiful bill" extends the 2017 tax cuts, which primarily benefit corporations and the wealthy, while also cutting social safety net programs and altering renewable energy tax credits. Democrats have united in opposition, criticizing the legislation for increasing the national debt and harming millions who rely on programs like Medicaid. The bill's passage represents a significant legislative victory for the Trump administration's second-term agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shoplifting in Germany has increased, with a recent retail industry study estimating that losses from theft rose by 3% in 2024 to nearly €5 billion.

While some criminologists question the study's methodology, they note that most shoplifting cases are "poverty crimes" committed by people with little money.

However, the article notes that high-yield savings rates are variable and likely to fall if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates as anticipated. Therefore, locking in a slightly lower but guaranteed CD rate now could prove to be the more profitable long-term strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents of west Altadena, where a majority of the Eaton fire's 18 deaths occurred, are reluctant to sue Los Angeles County despite anger over delayed evacuation alerts. Many fear that a lawsuit against the county could complicate their existing legal cases against Southern California Edison, the utility they allege started the fire. While residents want accountability for the hours-long delay in alerts, which they believe was a key factor in the fatalities, the legal hurdles and potential to jeopardize a settlement from the utility have led many to abandon the idea, leaving them in a state of limbo.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland resident who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, was subjected to "torture" and "severe beatings" by guards in the country's notorious CECOT mega-prison, according to new court filings. His lawyers allege the abuse began within a day of his arrival and led to significant weight loss and physical injuries. Initially accused by the Trump administration of being a gang member, Ábrego García was later extradited back to the U.S. to face unrelated human trafficking charges. The allegations detail horrific conditions, including being forced to kneel for hours in an overcrowded, brightly lit cell.</p>

          <p>Following the release of a strong June jobs report, CNBC's Jim Cramer suggested the data validates Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's cautious approach to interest rates. Cramer argued that the better-than-expected job growth and low unemployment rate show there is no immediate need for the rate cuts that President Trump has been demanding. With the stock market reaching new highs, Cramer also discussed potential portfolio trimming strategies in an overbought market. He highlighted stocks like Broadcom and certain banks as candidates for taking profits, advising against greed in the current climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Essay Explores the Perils and Pitfalls of Writing About Young Adulthood</h2>

          <p>This essay reflects on the long-standing journalistic tradition of writing about "the youths," often with a condescending or worried tone. The author examines historical examples from The Atlantic, where writers have scrutinized younger generations for everything from their dancing and dress to their perceived lack of emotion or ambition. While acknowledging that generational shifts are real and worth documenting, the piece questions where the line is between empathetic observation and hollow stereotyping. The author concludes that the best writing approaches young adults with humility and nuance, recognizing them as individuals navigating the unique challenges of their time.</p>
