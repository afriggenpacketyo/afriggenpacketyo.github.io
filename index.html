          <p>Former German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has been elected as the president of the UN General Assembly, securing 167 votes in a secret ballot held in New York. Baerbock, who was the sole candidate, expressed her desire to serve as an "honest broker" for the General Assembly. Her inauguration is scheduled for September 9, just before the General Assembly's annual meeting, where she will assume the largely ceremonial role. The election highlights Germany's continued involvement in international diplomacy and the UN's ongoing efforts to address global challenges. The new president is expected to bring a fresh perspective to the General Assembly's proceedings. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are anticipated to speak in the coming days, according to a senior White House official. This discussion follows recent tensions between Washington and Beijing that threaten to disrupt a tentative trade agreement reached weeks earlier.

The expected conversation aims to address ongoing trade disputes and reaffirm commitments to the previously established agreement.

          <p>The Supreme Court has announced it will consider a challenge to an Illinois law that allows mail-in ballots to be received and counted up to 14 days after Election Day. The case, involving GOP Rep. Michael Bost, raises questions about the legal standing to challenge state regulations concerning federal elections. Bost argues that counting late-arriving ballots dilutes the value of votes and infringes on constitutional rights. The court's decision, expected by June 2026, could impact similar laws in at least 17 other states. </p>

Ukraine claimed to have damaged or destroyed 41 Russian bomber aircraft in the attacks, while Russia's defense ministry said its forces had struck Ukrainian drone production, launch, and storage sites. During negotiations in Istanbul, Ukraine's representatives presented a plan demanding a full and unconditional ceasefire, the return of Ukrainian children and civilian hostages, and the non-recognition of territorial gains made by Russia since 2014.

The tariff increase, from 25% to 50%, is slated to take effect on June 4, raising concerns about potential price hikes for consumers on products like cars and appliances.

          <p>Analysts suggest that President Donald Trump's attempts to pressure China into making trade concessions through export controls are unlikely to succeed.

However, Beijing has responded with strong criticism, rejecting accusations that China violated the trade deal agreed upon in Geneva last month.

The increase was primarily driven by sales of the revamped Model Y compact SUV, with 2,600 units sold last month. While Tesla's European sales have recently suffered due to reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's rhetoric and political activities, Norway's EV incentives and the Model Y's popularity have fueled the rebound.

          <p>The Supreme Court has turned down a challenge to bans on semiautomatic rifles in Maryland, California, and eight other states. This decision leaves in place existing state laws that restrict the sale or possession of "assault weapons" and large-capacity magazines. The case was seen as an opportunity to apply the court's history-based test for assessing the constitutionality of gun control laws. Three conservative justices voted to hear the challenge, but Justice Brett Kavanaugh declined for now, suggesting the court will address the issue in the near future. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Aviation safety writer Darryl Campbell discusses the systemic issues plaguing American air travel, using Newark Liberty International Airport as a prime example. Newark is experiencing radar and radio system failures, leading to overworked air traffic controllers managing a frenetic system with little margin for error. Campbell argues that Newark's problems are a preview of what other airports will face in the next 5-10 years if drastic changes aren't made to air traffic control maintenance. The issues include staff retention, training, cost-of-living increases, and an outdated air traffic control system. </p>

The bill would also set borrowing caps for undergraduates, graduates, and parents, while eliminating subsidized loans. The proposal aims to simplify the repayment process and control the rising cost of student loans. (not investment advice)</p>
