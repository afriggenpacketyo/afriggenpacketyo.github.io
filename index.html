          <p>An Air India Boeing 787 crashed in Ahmedabad, India, killing at least 270 people, marking one of the country's worst aviation disasters. The London-bound flight struck a medical college hostel shortly after takeoff, resulting in numerous fatalities both on board and on the ground. Recovery teams worked to identify victims, while relatives expressed frustration with the slow DNA matching process. The Indian government has initiated inspections of Air India's Boeing 787 fleet and formed a committee to investigate the crash and formulate preventative measures for future aircraft emergencies. The article notes that the plane's digital flight data recorder has been recovered and is expected to provide crucial information about the cause of the accident. </p>

Sarkozy was found guilty of illegally attempting to obtain favors from a judge. This action makes him the second French head of state to lose the award, following Philippe Petain.

Despite TikTok's ban on searching for the term "skinnytok," the woman, Eve Jones, said harmful messaging is still easily accessible on the app using disguised hashtags. Jones expressed concern about the impact of such content on younger people and noted the trend has seen a resurfacing of diet culture. Eating disorder charity Beat reported that 91% of respondents with eating disorders encountered harmful content online, emphasizing the need for social media platforms to monitor content more closely.</p>

          <p>Germany is set to celebrate its first official Veterans Day on June 15, honoring members of the German military with a large civic celebration and events nationwide. This marks a shift in German society, which has historically lacked a strong tradition of honoring veterans due to the legacy of Nazi Germany. The decision to establish Veterans Day follows increasing deployments of German soldiers abroad and growing recognition of the sacrifices made by veterans. However, the event has also sparked protests from left-wing groups criticizing the "glorification of the Bundeswehr."</p>

She also suggested a possible future spin-off of Openreach, the company's network infrastructure business, if its value is not reflected in BT's share price.
