        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to deploy National Guard troops onto the streets of Chicago, a measure aimed at addressing ongoing protests at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. While the court upheld a lower ruling denying the deployment, it also issued an administrative stay, allowing the federal government to retain control over the National Guard units. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul praised the decision, asserting it as a victory for state and local autonomy in managing public order and protecting protest rights. This legal battle highlights a significant constitutional debate over federal intervention in local matters, echoing similar disputes previously observed in Portland, Oregon, regarding the use of federal forces during demonstrations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to utilize available funds to ensure military service members receive their paychecks by October 15, amidst the ongoing government shutdown. Trump vehemently criticized Democrats, particularly Senator Chuck Schumer, for the impasse, accusing them of jeopardizing national security and holding the military hostage. He asserted that identified funds within the Defense Department would cover the payments, aiming to reassure troops and their families. This executive action underscores the deep political divisions surrounding the budget, as both parties continue to blame each other for the shutdown's disruptive impact on federal employees and essential services.</p>

          <p>British heavyweight boxer David Allen, known as 'White Rhino', suffered a unanimous points defeat to Russian opponent Arslanbek Makhmudov in a highly anticipated headline bout at Sheffield Arena. Despite the judges scoring the fight decisively for Makhmudov, Allen expressed profound appreciation for the fervent support of the 9,000-strong home crowd, calling the atmosphere unprecedented. The 33-year-old, who had previously retired from boxing for five years, remains resolute in his commitment to the sport, having rebuilt his career after numerous challenges. This event, his first as a headliner at the venue, highlights his enduring passion and the unique connection he shares with his fanbase.</p>

          <p>The UK will revert to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on Sunday, October 26, 2025, as clocks go back one hour at 02:00 BST, marking the end of British Summer Time. This traditional shift, easily recalled by "spring forward, fall back," offers an extra hour for most but extends night shifts for some. While the change brings earlier sunsets, ongoing discussions persist about the potential advantages of adopting year-round BST, including economic benefits and a possible reduction in evening road accidents. Conversely, critics highlight that permanent BST would result in much gloomier winter mornings, especially in northern regions like Scotland, raising concerns about safety for commuters and students.</p>

          <h2>Five Hospitalized After Helicopter Crash in Huntington Beach</h2>

          <p>A helicopter crashed in a busy oceanfront area of Huntington Beach, Southern California, on Saturday afternoon, leading to the hospitalization of five individuals. Both occupants of the helicopter were safely pulled from the wreckage, alongside three pedestrians injured in the incident near Pacific Coast Highway. Dramatic video circulating on social media showed the aircraft spinning multiple times before colliding with palm trees and an outdoor pedestrian bridge staircase, scattering debris widely. The tail section of the helicopter broke off, with the main body wedged in the structure. The cause of the crash remains under investigation, prompting authorities to close a significant portion of PCH.</p>

          <p>Marineland, a Canadian aquatic park with a documented history of animal mistreatment and current financial difficulties, is threatening to euthanize 30 beluga whales after its permit to sell them to a Chinese theme park was denied. The park claims it can no longer afford to care for the animals and has requested government funding. Fisheries Minister Joanne Thompson rejected the export, citing concerns about substandard treatment at the proposed Chinese facility. Animal welfare organizations and former employees are urgently seeking solutions, with some advocating for the provincial government to seize the whales, though many believe the euthanasia threat is a negotiation tactic rather than a genuine intention.</p>

          <p>Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado, an exiled Venezuelan opposition leader, has condemned her country's current state as "profound, total chaos" under President Nicolás Maduro's authoritarian regime. In an interview, Machado asserted that Maduro's third term is illegitimate, citing widespread evidence of electoral manipulation in 2024. She called for Maduro's removal, stating that regime change was already mandated by the Venezuelan people. Machado also praised Donald Trump as a valuable ally for recognizing the threat Maduro poses, especially given accusations of Maduro operating a drug cartel and destabilizing the region, including the US.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will attend an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, on Monday, where a Gaza peace plan is set to be signed, marking a potential turning point after two years of conflict. Starmer is anticipated to acknowledge US President Donald Trump's crucial role in brokering the initial ceasefire and hostage release agreement. The summit's objective is to finalize a comprehensive accord following the successful implementation of the truce's first phase, which involves the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners and increased humanitarian aid to Gaza. Subsequent negotiations on critical issues like Gaza's future governance and Israeli troop withdrawal are expected to be challenging.</p>

This strategic convergence of investment and supply chain demands between Nvidia and the US government, along with significant financial stakes in semiconductor companies, poses a formidable challenge to China's near-term data center industry leadership.

This health update comes after questions about his well-being during his presidency and his decision not to seek re-election.
