          <p>Republican leaders in North Carolina held a press conference condemning what they describe as "soft on crime" policies from Democrats, linking them to the recent murder of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska in Charlotte. They highlighted the suspect's previous 14 arrests and criticized the local justice system and city leadership for failing to protect residents. The event reflects a broader national political debate, with figures like Donald Trump and JD Vance also blaming Democratic policies for rising crime rates and calling for stricter measures.</p>

          <p>The leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, Eddie Dempsey, has called for a summit with London Mayor Sadiq Khan to resolve the ongoing Tube strike that has severely disrupted the city's transport. The union's primary demand is a 32-hour work week, which Transport for London (TfL) has deemed "impractical and unaffordable," countering with a 3.4% pay offer. While the mayor's office states TfL is ready for talks, the strike continues, causing widespread travel chaos and prompting calls from all sides for negotiations to resume.</p>

This brief reunion occurred while Harry was in the UK for charity events, though there were no indications of a meeting with his brother, Prince William.</p>

The deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, values Potbelly shares at $17.12 each, a significant premium that caused the company's stock to surge over 30%. This acquisition aligns with Potbelly's goal of expanding its franchise-led growth, with RaceTrac's backing expected to fortify its expansion plans from its current 445 stores toward a target of 2,000 locations.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her upcoming book "107 Days," former Vice President Kamala Harris describes President Joe Biden's decision to run for reelection as "recklessness" that should not have been "left to an individual’s ego.” Harris also claims that Biden's inner circle undermined her during her vice presidency, fueling negative press narratives and refusing to defend her against attacks, believing her success would dim his. While she defends Biden's capability to serve, she asserts her loyalty to the country is greater than her loyalty to him, revealing deep tensions within the former administration.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive survey of nearly 70,000 U.S. college students reveals that a majority now oppose allowing speakers with controversial viewpoints, regardless of political leaning, on their campuses. The annual report from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) highlights a growing intolerance for opposing ideas and an increased acceptance of disruptive tactics, including violence, to silence speech. The Israel-Palestine conflict was identified as the most difficult topic to discuss openly, reflecting a broader trend of self-censorship and hostility toward free expression in higher education.</p>

While the team has a strong defensive record in qualifiers, questions remain about their vulnerability against teams that can maintain sustained possession.

          <p>This article analyzes the argument that Democrats should threaten a government shutdown to force Republicans to curb President Trump's authoritarian actions. While acknowledging the potential political benefits of showing fight to the Democratic base, the author argues the strategy has virtually no chance of achieving its stated policy goals, as Republicans are unlikely to defy Trump. A more viable, albeit politically complex, strategy might be to force a shutdown over a more tangible and popular issue, such as extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, to highlight policy differences ahead of the 2026 elections.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors in Germany have charged eight men with being members of a far-right extremist group called the "Saxony Separatists." The group allegedly planned to violently take over territory in the state of Saxony following an anticipated collapse of the German government, which they referred to as "day X." According to prosecutors, their goal was to establish an independent state based on Nazi ideology, which included plans for "ethnic cleansing." The suspects were arrested in 2024 after investigations revealed they were conducting paramilitary training and stockpiling weapons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that recent Supreme Court rulings allowing broader immigration raids, ostensibly targeting Latinos, represent a danger to all non-white communities in the U.S. The author contends that the legal standard of "reasonable suspicion" has effectively been broadened to equate brown skin with illegality, regardless of national origin. Citing detention data that includes thousands from India, China, and African nations, the column calls for solidarity among all targeted groups, asserting that the policies are fundamentally about promoting white supremacy rather than simply enforcing immigration law.</p>

          <p>President Trump made a rare visit to a Washington D.C. restaurant to publicly declare his 30-day federal crime crackdown a success, claiming the city is now "virtually crime free." The visit, which occurred just before his direct control over the city's police force expired, was met with a mix of cheers from supporters and chants from protesters inside the restaurant. While the president claimed D.C. restaurants are now "booming," data from the period shows a more mixed picture, with some residents feeling safer while others have avoided dining out due to the heavy law enforcement presence.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that meat from endangered and critically endangered shark species, such as the great hammerhead, is being sold in U.S. grocery stores and online under vague or incorrect labels. Researchers used DNA barcoding on 29 shark products and found that 93% were ambiguously labeled simply as "shark," while 31% of the samples were from species at risk of extinction. The authors warn that this practice not only harms endangered populations but also poses potential health risks to consumers, as some of these species contain high levels of mercury and other toxins.</p>

Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi sought a retrial, and the court has now ruled that her actions constituted justifiable self-defense against an unjust infringement on her bodily integrity and sexual self-determination.</p>

The tame report has fueled market expectations for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming meeting. This data point precedes the more closely watched consumer price index (CPI) report, which will provide a clearer picture of the nation's inflation landscape. (not investment advice)</p>
