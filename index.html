          <p>A car ramming attack at the annual Lapu Lapu festival in Vancouver has left the Filipino community in shock and mourning, with 11 people dead and dozens wounded. The suspect, a 30-year-old with a history of mental health issues, is in custody, though the motive remains unclear. The Filipino BC organization head, RJ Aquino, expressed the community's grief and confusion, noting the chaos and panic as residents checked on loved ones. Acting Vancouver police chief Steve Rai called it the "darkest day" in the city's history, indicating the death toll may rise and that the incident was not considered an act of terrorism.</p>

          <p>Chinese manufacturers are halting production and exploring new markets as U.S. tariffs take effect, leading to job losses and business disruptions.
