          <p>The People's Liberation Army (PLA) revealed that Chinese helicopters had 11 close encounters with an unidentified foreign navy over ten days in the East China Sea, with aircraft coming within 10 meters of each other. According to state broadcaster CCTV, the PLA Eastern Theatre Command was responding to provocations by a foreign force approaching China's coastline, though the identity of the foreign force was not disclosed. This disclosure comes amidst heightened tensions in the region's airspace and sea, where close encounters between PLA aircraft, naval warships, and foreign aircraft and vessels have become increasingly frequent, raising concerns about potential miscalculations and escalations.</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent concurred that the current dollar-yen exchange rate reflects underlying economic fundamentals during discussions on bilateral tariff negotiations. This acknowledgment suggests that the yen's recent weakness against the dollar is no longer a point of contention in trade talks, despite President Trump's previous concerns about Japan's trade surplus. The two officials reaffirmed their belief that exchange rates should be market-determined and avoided discussing desired foreign exchange levels, while Kato voiced concerns over the global economic impact of the Trump administration's tariffs.</p>

          <p>Diane Bahlawan, a 34-year-old California woman, was arrested at San Francisco International Airport for allegedly attempting to smuggle 151 pounds of cannabis onto a United Airlines flight to Frankfurt, Germany. Airport security discovered 131 vacuum-sealed bags of cannabis in her four roller bags, along with her cellphone, boarding pass, and $960 in cash. Bahlawan was charged with burglary and unlawful transport of marijuana and subsequently released on bail with her arraignment scheduled for June 2. The San Mateo County District Attorney noted the unusual scale of the case, given the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office typically handles larger marijuana transportation cases.</p>

          <p>Figures from the Office for National Statistics are expected to show a fall in net migration to the UK, however immigration remains a central issue in UK politics. The article explores how attitudes toward immigration and race have shaped British politics since the 1960s, highlighting key events such as the 1968 Race Relations Act and Enoch Powell's "Rivers of Blood" speech. Despite efforts by successive prime ministers to address public concerns, worries about immigration persist, particularly regarding its impact on public services and competition for jobs. The current Labour government, elected on a promise to reduce migration, faces the challenge of finding a balance between controlling borders and maintaining a diverse and inclusive society.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced its withdrawal from a federal oversight plan for the Minneapolis Police Department just before the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death, sparking dismay among officials and residents. The oversight aimed to address a pattern of violent, racist, and unconstitutional practices within the department. Justice Department officials claimed such agreements are ineffective and costly, while Minneapolis officials vowed to continue implementing the changes outlined in the agreement. The Minneapolis police union welcomed the decision, stating that additional oversight was unnecessary.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with conservative holdouts to garner support for a massive budget package, as House GOP leaders negotiated concessions to appease fiscal conservatives and blue-state Republicans. House Speaker Mike Johnson aimed to hold a floor vote on the bill, but faced opposition from the House Freedom Caucus seeking deeper spending cuts and blue-state Republicans concerned about the state and local tax deduction (SALT). A manager's amendment was introduced to address some concerns, including moving up Medicaid work requirements and increasing the SALT deduction cap. The bill's passage remains uncertain due to the slim Republican majority and expected Democratic opposition.</p>

Republicans argue that the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, which set stricter emissions standards than federal regulations. The contested waivers include rules to reduce tailpipe emissions and phase out gas-powered cars by 2035.

          <p>Alejandro Oliveros Acosta, a Santa Ana man charged with animal cruelty in the killing and maiming of as many as 20 cats, failed to appear for his arraignment hearing, leading to the issuance of an arrest warrant. Acosta faces felony and misdemeanor charges, including cruelty to animals and grand theft of a companion animal. Authorities believe Acosta was behind the deaths of several neighborhood cats, with evidence including carcasses found at his home and reports of injured cats near his residence. The case has drawn public outcry and prompted a vigil that turned violent.</p>

          <p>Sea temperatures around the UK and Ireland have surged, with some areas 4Â°C warmer than normal, potentially impacting marine life and swimming conditions. This marine heatwave, driven by a warm spring and weak winds, has persisted for over two months, surprising scientists. The heatwave may disrupt species' breeding patterns, increase jellyfish blooms, and cause harmful algae growth. While the full effects on marine life are still uncertain, scientists expect these heatwaves to increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change, posing new challenges for the UK's marine ecosystems.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration welcomes Afrikaners as refugees, citing violence and discrimination, some Afrikaners dispute claims of a "white genocide" in South Africa. While violent attacks on farmers do occur, racial motives are not generally a factor, and Whites remain economically the strongest group in the country. The South African government's stance against Israel and relations with China may have influenced Trump's decision to offer refuge, as claims of white genocide are often circulated by right-wing groups. While acknowledging challenges, some Afrikaners emphasize the need for land to be shared by both Black and White.</p>
