          <p>The US Department of Justice has released transcripts of a July interview with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. In the interview, Maxwell stated she never witnessed Donald Trump acting inappropriately and praised him as a "gentleman in all respects." She also dismissed long-standing conspiracy theories about a "client list" of Jeffrey Epstein's associates, calling its existence a fabrication. The interview covered her relationships with Epstein, Prince Andrew, and other high-profile figures, with Maxwell providing her perspective on various events and allegations central to the case.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Utility bills are rising across the United States, with electricity costs up 5.5% and natural gas up 13.8% over the past year. Experts attribute the surge primarily to a massive increase in energy demand driven by AI data centers, electrification, and post-pandemic economic activity. While the Trump administration blames renewable energy, analysts point to a shortage of transmission infrastructure to connect new power sources to the grid. Policy decisions impacting clean energy projects and extending the life of coal plants are also expected to contribute to higher costs for consumers.</p>

          <p>Following his release from a Tennessee jail, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has notified lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia of a potential deportation to Uganda. This development comes after the U.S. and Uganda reached a deal to accept third-party deportations. Abrego Garcia, previously deported to El Salvador as a suspected MS-13 member and later returned to the U.S. on human smuggling charges, has been placed in his brother's custody with electronic monitoring. His case has drawn national attention and criticism from Trump administration officials who oppose his release.</p>

          <p>Japan is actively broadening its defense collaborations with nations like the United Kingdom and Australia, a move analysts attribute to perceived inconsistencies in U.S. policy and growing concerns over China's military posture. Recent multinational exercises, such as British and U.S. F-35B jets operating from the Japanese carrier JS Kaga, underscore this trend toward deeper tactical integration with a wider array of partners. These joint military activities in the Indo-Pacific are seen as a strategic effort by Japan to build a more robust and diversified security network. This enhances its defensive capabilities in a complex geopolitical environment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Applications for the T visa, a form of relief for immigrant survivors of human trafficking, are sharply rising, but processing times have significantly increased and applicants face greater risks. The visa allows survivors to remain in the U.S. if they assist law enforcement, but median wait times have jumped from six months in 2014 to nearly 20 months. A policy change allowing for deportation proceedings upon denial has heightened fear among applicants, even as a new determination process grants some earlier access to benefits.

          <p>Emergency room physicians are warning that the full health impact of extreme heat is often underestimated, extending far beyond obvious cases of heat stroke and exhaustion. Doctors argue that heat acts as a "threat multiplier," worsening pre-existing conditions like heart disease, kidney problems, and respiratory illnesses, which may not be immediately linked to the high temperatures. They advocate for broader climate-related training for medical professionals to recognize these connections and for policies that protect vulnerable populations. The health issues disproportionately affect low-income communities and highlight significant health equity and racial justice concerns.</p>

          <p>In the wake of major fires in Los Angeles, residents are taking soil cleanup into their own hands due to concerns about contamination from burned structures.

These methods use natural tools like specific plants, biochar, and fungi to trap or break down heavy metals and other toxins like lead. This grassroots movement provides residents with a sense of empowerment and an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional topsoil removal, addressing a problem exacerbated by the area's older housing stock.</p>

          <p>The 27th season of "South Park" is being praised for its effective and biting satire of the second Trump administration, a feat many other comedy shows have struggled with. The show avoids simple impersonations, instead using its unique, often crude, style to caricature figures like Donald Trump, JD Vance, and Kristi Noem in a way that feels both mean and gratifying. By using their established comedic language, such as depicting Trump with the same animation and voice as Saddam Hussein from their 1999 movie, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have found a way to land punches that feel fresh and cathartic.</p>

The $1.9 million project, funded by private donations, was justified by Trump as a practical measure to prevent guests' high heels from sinking into wet grass. The new design, featuring paving stones and drainage grates with a patriotic motif, bears a resemblance to the patio at his Mar-a-Lago resort.

          <p>Early projections suggest that the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 could be around 2.7%, slightly higher than 2025's 2.5% increase. While a larger COLA may seem beneficial for retirees, it is a direct reflection of rising inflation, meaning any gains in benefits are likely to be offset by higher living costs. The article cautions that Social Security COLAs often fail to keep pace with the actual expenses seniors face, particularly as broad inflation has already outpaced the 2025 raise. This highlights the importance of personal savings for retirees to supplement their fixed incomes (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The market for high-end Puer tea, long considered a valuable "drinkable antique" and an investment vehicle in China, has collapsed amid the country's broader economic slowdown. Prices for premium Puer products have plummeted to their lowest levels since 2019, with some popular series dropping by over 75% from their peak values. Analysts attribute the slump to weakening investor appetite, thinning corporate profit margins, and a sharp decline in business gift-giving due to fiscal belt-tightening and anti-corruption campaigns. The bursting of the tea bubble mirrors strains seen in other Chinese investment markets like real estate.</p>

          <p>A significant political debate is unfolding in Germany regarding the possibility of sending German soldiers as part of an international peacekeeping force to Ukraine if a peace agreement is reached. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has suggested Germany has a responsibility to participate, but the idea faces considerable opposition, including from his coalition partners and the public. A recent poll shows 51% of Germans oppose such a mission. Critics raise concerns about overstretching the German military and the historical sensitivities of deploying German troops in a region with a complex past involving Russia.</p>

          <p>A new YouGov survey reveals that one in three German workers is concerned that artificial intelligence will eventually take their job. The poll indicates that anxiety is highest among urban workers and those with lower levels of education. This sentiment aligns with a separate survey from the Ifo Institute, which found that over a quarter of German companies anticipate job losses due to AI within the next five years. The findings highlight growing public apprehension about the economic and social impact of rapidly advancing AI technologies on the German labor market.</p>

          <p>A tourist bus carrying 52 passengers crashed on a motorway in western New York, resulting in five fatalities. The bus, returning from a trip to Niagara Falls, reportedly lost control and overturned, ejecting some passengers and trapping others. Most of those on board were tourists from India, China, and the Philippines, and authorities believe many were not wearing seat belts. The cause of the crash is under investigation, though mechanical failure and driver impairment have been ruled out as initial factors.</p>

          <p>Advisors to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are considering new regulations to curb food waste, specifically targeting the large all-you-can-eat buffets popular in the country's tourist hotels. A presidential council is drafting proposals after a report found that 8.7 million tons of food are discarded annually in Turkey, with a significant portion coming from the hospitality sector. Proposed changes include moving toward à la carte dining and allowing guests more flexibility in breakfast packages to reduce the amount of uneaten food. The move has sparked debate, with some tour operators questioning the motives and feasibility of such regulations.</p>

          <p>Train operator CrossCountry is warning of significant travel disruption over the bank holiday weekend due to a strike by the RMT union. The industrial action will result in a reduced timetable, with no services running on Saturday and a very limited service on Monday. The RMT union states the strike is over CrossCountry's failure to honor agreements on staffing, safety, and pay. While the operator says it is committed to talks, the strike is expected to impact major routes, prompting coach operator National Express to add 9,000 extra seats to accommodate stranded travelers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explains the escalating political conflict over congressional redistricting, centered on actions by Texas and California. In an unusual mid-decade move, Texas's Republican-led legislature passed a new map to create five more GOP-favoring seats, an effort backed by President Trump to secure the House majority in 2026. In direct response, California's Democratic lawmakers have advanced a plan to redraw their own maps to add five Democratic seats, effectively neutralizing Texas's move. This partisan "arms race" over gerrymandering highlights the high stakes of controlling the U.S. House and could spread to other states.</p>

Guo advocates for a relentless work ethic, stating that new founders must work 90-hour weeks to get their companies off the ground and that China's "996" work culture still allows for a work-life balance. Her perspective embodies a Silicon Valley mantra of constant productivity, though it contrasts with other founders who argue such an approach is outdated and leads to burnout rather than smart work.</p>

          <p>Chinese defense researchers have developed a new military data link system designed for large-scale hypersonic combat, potentially giving them a significant advantage over existing NATO communications. The system achieves time synchronization accuracy within five nanoseconds, which is crucial for coordinating strikes between platforms moving at extreme speeds. This technological leap enables real-time, secure communication between hypersonic missiles, aircraft, command centers, and satellites. Experts suggest this innovation could shift the strategic balance by creating a fully networked strike ecosystem that Western militaries may be unable to counter effectively.</p>

Drawing from his own experience with an FBI raid in 2018, Cohen stated that Bolton needs to secure legal representation immediately. The raid is reportedly connected to a resumed investigation into whether Bolton's 2020 memoir contained classified information. Cohen predicted that Bolton will undoubtedly be indicted, suggesting the raid is part of Trump's effort to target his political enemies, a claim dismissed by Vice President JD Vance.</p>
