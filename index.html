          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) has announced that personal customer data, potentially including telephone numbers, addresses, and order histories, was stolen in a recent cyberattack. While the stolen data does not include payment or password information, the hackers may attempt to sell the data, posing a risk of identity fraud. M&S is urging customers to reset their passwords and be wary of phishing attempts, and they are working with cybersecurity experts to restore normal operations. The cyberattack began over Easter weekend, disrupting online orders, which remain suspended as M&S works to resolve the issue.</p>

However, some officials urge caution, noting al-Sharaa's authoritarian background and the government's limited control within Syria.

          <p>Amidst President Trump's changing tariff policies, consumers can save money by looking for sales, checking product origins, and purchasing domestic goods. Sales events like Memorial Day, Father's Day, and Amazon Prime Day offer opportunities for discounts. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) exempts many goods traded between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada from tariffs if they meet origin requirements. Electronics and toys are expected to be most affected by tariffs, so consumers should consider purchasing these items sooner rather than later, without panicking.</p>

          <p>Stadium concerts, while popular, often fall short of providing an ideal experience for fans due to high costs, poor acoustics, and logistical challenges. Gen Z's fear of missing out drives attendance, but issues like obstructed views and chaotic VIP sections detract from the enjoyment. Stadium tours benefit artists financially and assert their status, but the venues are primarily designed for sports, not music, leading to sonic and visual compromises. The author questions whether the communal experience justifies the expense and effort, suggesting that large-scale concerts may prioritize profit over fan satisfaction.</p>
