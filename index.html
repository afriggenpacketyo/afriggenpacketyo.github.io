The 27-year-old, who signed a five-year contract, was a top scorer in Portugal, netting 54 goals in 52 games last season. Gyokeres stated that his decision was influenced by Arsenal's impressive performance when he played against them in the Champions League, and he now brings a much-needed clinical edge to the Premier League club's attack.</p>

          <p>Australia's coach, Joe Schmidt, has criticized a crucial refereeing decision that allowed the British and Irish Lions to score a match-winning try and clinch the Test series. Schmidt argued that a clearout by the Lions' Jac Morgan on Carlo Tizzano in the final ruck was illegal and went against the sport's push for player safety. Despite Australia's protests, the Television Match Official upheld the on-field decision to award the try, securing a dramatic 29-26 victory for the tourists.</p>

          <p>Clothing brand American Eagle has experienced a significant rise in its stock price after launching a new advertising campaign starring actress Sydney Sweeney. The ads feature Sweeney in a traditionally alluring style, a departure from the message-driven marketing common today, leading investors to predict a sales surge. The article suggests this move signals a potential shift on Wall Street back towards product-focused advertising over politically motivated campaigns, using Sweeney's willingness to embrace a traditionally feminine image as a catalyst.
