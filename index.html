          <p>Amid protests in Los Angeles, U.S. officials have stated that the Marines and National Guard personnel are operating under specific rules of force, tasked with protecting federal buildings and personnel without patrolling streets or detaining protesters unless necessary. Troops are carrying weapons, but guns will not have ammunition loaded in the chamber, except for self-defense situations, and they will not use rubber bullets or pepper spray. Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell emphasized the need for clear communication between agencies to ensure a coordinated and lawful response. Retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Thomas Edmonds raised concerns about the use of deadly force and the distinction between protecting federal officers and enforcing the law. The situation could change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act. The author's tone is one of concern and stability given that the National Guard and Marines are there to keep the peace and the collateral damage is low.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has authorized the deployment of an additional 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, prompting criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has also sued Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the initial deployment. Newsom described the move as reckless and disrespectful to the troops, while the ACLU condemned Trump's mobilization of the Marines. The lawsuit argues that Trump's federalization of California's National Guard is unlawful and exceeds his authority. Trump also stated he would support arresting Newsom for obstructing federal immigration enforcement actions. The author's tone is one of concern and stability given the context of the story.</p>

          <p>The girlfriend of Derrick Groves, one of the inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail last month, has been arrested for allegedly aiding in his escape, according to officials. Darriana Burton, a former correctional employee, is accused of relaying escape-related information and coordinating communications between Groves and people outside the jail. Burton and Groves had video calls where they discussed the escape plan with an unknown man, who advised against it. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill stated that authorities will continue to pursue anyone who aided the escapees and will eventually return Groves and another inmate, Antoine Massey, to prison. The reward for the arrest of Groves and Massey has increased to $50,000. The author's tone is one of stability given the context of the story.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has strongly criticized President Donald Trump after Trump suggested Newsom should be arrested for purportedly obstructing federal immigration enforcement actions. This escalation follows Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to California without Newsom's consent and the subsequent deployment of Marines to Los Angeles. Newsom responded by calling Trump's actions dictatorial and stated that the state is suing the administration over the National Guard deployment.

          <p>A cross-party group of MPs has released a report stating that the UK's statutory parental leave system is inadequate and reinforces outdated gender stereotypes. The report suggests increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and extending paternity leave to six weeks, highlighting that the UK's current system lags behind other developed countries. The report also found that shared parental leave is underutilized due to its complexity, with many families unaware of its availability. The findings have been released on the eve of a dad strike, where fathers are expected to protest for an overhaul of parental leave policies.

          <p>New government guidance in England allows teachers to use artificial intelligence (AI) to speed up marking and write letters home to parents, with the aim of automating routine tasks and freeing up time for face-to-face teaching. The Department for Education (DfE) advises teachers to be transparent about their use of AI and to always check its results, emphasizing that AI should only be used for low-stakes marking.
