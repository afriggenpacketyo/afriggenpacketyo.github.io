          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly rejected any peace deal that involves ceding territory to Russia. His statement comes ahead of a planned summit in Alaska between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and warned that any agreement reached without Kyiv's participation would be a "dead solution" against peace. This declaration underscores Ukraine's anxieties about being sidelined in crucial negotiations to end the war.</p>

          <p>The article explores the adverse psychological effects of hook-up apps like Grindr, featuring personal accounts from users who describe feeling objectified and experiencing damaged self-esteem. One user, Lewis, explains how the app's loop of seeking validation through casual encounters fueled his anxiety and depression. Similarly, singer Jacob Alon discusses how his experiences on the app inspired a song about feeling empty and degraded. These narratives highlight a growing concern that the culture of instant gratification on such platforms can be toxic and emotionally damaging.</p>

          <p>Europe is experiencing a notable surge in tourism from China, with a 13% year-on-year increase recorded in the first half of 2025. According to the European Travel Commission (ETC), this trend is expected to continue, as 72% of Chinese tourists have expressed a willingness to travel long-haul to the continent. This figure is significantly higher than the global average and surpasses interest from traditionally strong markets like the US and Japan. The influx provides a welcome boost to Europe's tourism sector.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The term 'grifter' has become a ubiquitous insult in modern political discourse, used to cast suspicion on the motives and methods of opponents. Its usage has more than doubled since 2017, deployed against figures from Nigel Farage to Zarah Sultana and even Donald Trump. The article suggests this trend reflects a broader societal paranoia fueled by online influencer culture, political scandals like crony Covid contracts, and the popularity of "true scam" media. In an atmosphere of ambient distrust, accusing someone of being a 'grifter' has become a potent shorthand for questioning their integrity.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government has firmly rejected the idea of allowing U.S. military intervention on its territory to combat drug cartels. President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that while the two countries cooperate on security, a U.S. military "invasion" is "absolutely ruled out." This response follows reports that President Donald Trump secretly directed the Pentagon to prepare for potential military force against cartels on foreign soil. The directive appears linked to an earlier executive order designating several Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the celebrated astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission and safely guided its crew back to Earth, has died at the age of 97. Lovell was a key figure in America's space race, becoming the first person to fly to the Moon twice, though he never landed on its surface. He is famously remembered for his calm demeanor during the 1970 Apollo 13 crisis, when an explosion crippled the spacecraft, turning a near-catastrophe into what NASA called its "finest hour."
