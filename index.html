          <p>Ferrari's stock suffered its worst trading day in history after the luxury automaker issued new financial guidance that fell short of analyst expectations. The company also scaled back its electric vehicle ambitions, revising its 2030 sales target for fully electric cars from 40% down to 20%. This adjustment reflects a broader trend among global carmakers who are reassessing their EV strategies due to changing market conditions and slower-than-expected consumer adoption.

          <p>President Trump articulated a conflicting trade stance toward China, suggesting the U.S. might have to stop importing Chinese goods to exert economic leverage. Simultaneously, he emphasized the importance of ensuring China continues to purchase U.S. soybeans, a key American export. This highlights the complex and often contradictory nature of the U.S.-China trade relationship. The president indicated these topics would be central to any future discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Democratic-led cities is facing significant legal tests in federal courts in Portland and Chicago. Local leaders have filed lawsuits arguing that the use of military troops for domestic law enforcement against their will is unconstitutional. The White House defends the action as a necessary measure to protect federal property and personnel amid protests, creating a high-stakes conflict over executive power and states' rights.</p>

          <p>A 48-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of homicide and kidnapping following a violent incident in Montclair, California. Authorities allege the suspect got into an argument, then chased and shot at a vehicle as it drove away, eventually ramming it into a tree. One occupant of the crashed vehicle was killed, another was kidnapped but later escaped, and a third fled the scene. Police believe the individuals knew each other and the attack was not random.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire plan, which is expected to begin within 24 hours of approval by the Israeli Cabinet. The initial stage involves an Israeli troop pullback, the release of 20 living hostages by Hamas within 72 hours, and the freeing of approximately 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. This phase will also allow for a significant increase in humanitarian aid entering Gaza, setting the stage for more complex negotiations on the region's long-term future.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education is sending notices to student loan borrowers confirming their eligibility for debt cancellation under the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, despite the ongoing government shutdown. This action follows a temporary pause on IBR forgiveness that had caused concern among borrowers who had completed their required 20 or 25 years of payments. The resumption of these discharges provides relief to thousands who were stuck in limbo.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of the federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 death has revealed significant procedural failures, according to forensic experts. The probe was marked by a failure to properly preserve the scene, a lack of basic forensic testing for DNA or fingerprints, and interviews with key witnesses being delayed by nearly two years. These oversights have fueled continued public skepticism and suspicion surrounding the official ruling that Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell.</p>

          <p>This article details how the recent Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal was achieved after months of deadlock, crediting a pivotal move by President Trump. When Hamas provided a conditional acceptance of his peace plan, Trump publicly framed it as a definitive "yes," creating momentum that neither side could easily reverse.
