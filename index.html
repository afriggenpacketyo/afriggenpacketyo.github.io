          <p>All-rounder Jacob Bethell, aged 21, is set to become the youngest man to ever captain England in international cricket. He will lead a T20 side on a tour of Ireland in September, as regular captain Harry Brook and other senior players are being rested. This appointment is a significant show of faith from England's selectors, despite Bethell's limited playing time this summer and lack of senior-level captaincy experience. The squad for the Ireland tour, as well as a preceding series against South Africa, also includes a first call-up for Hampshire bowler Sonny Baker, while fast bowler Mark Wood remains absent due to injury.</p>

          <p>Environmental organizations have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy. The suit alleges that a new climate report, used to justify revoking the 2009 Endangerment Finding, was secretly produced by a panel of "known climate contrarians" in violation of federal transparency laws. Critics and independent scientists argue the report is inaccurate, cherry-picks data, and misrepresents peer-reviewed research to downplay the economic and environmental impacts of climate change. The lawsuit seeks to block the government's use of this report, which it claims is a politically motivated attempt to rewrite established science.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are meeting at a military base in Anchorage, Alaska, for a high-stakes summit focused on ending the war in Ukraine. The hastily arranged meeting excludes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, though Trump has suggested a future trilateral meeting could occur. Discussions are expected to be lengthy, with the White House framing it as a "listening exercise" while acknowledging the low probability of an immediate breakthrough. The choice of Alaska, a former Russian territory, adds historical resonance to the talks, which aim to address territorial disputes and potential ceasefire terms.</p>

          <p>Solomon Peña, a former Republican candidate for the New Mexico state legislature, has been sentenced to 80 years in federal prison for orchestrating a series of drive-by shootings. The attacks targeted the homes of four Democratic officials in Albuquerque following his significant election loss in 2022. Prosecutors stated that Peña, who believed the election was "rigged," resorted to violence to intimidate political opponents, though no one was injured in the shootings. Peña maintains his innocence and plans to appeal, while two accomplices who cooperated with prosecutors have already received prison sentences for their involvement.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas Aces star Kelsey Plum has walked back her controversial comments regarding Caitlin Clark's All-Star team, stating that her remarks were intended as a "bad joke." Following the WNBA All-Star game, Plum had noted that no members of Team Clark attended a meeting about a player-led protest, which involved wearing t-shirts demanding better pay. The comment drew backlash, especially since Clark herself wore the shirt. Speaking on a podcast, Plum expressed regret, admitting she misjudged the seriousness of the moment and was trying to lighten the mood in a press conference focused on contentious CBA negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Buyback program, which allows public service employees to retroactively make payments for periods of forbearance to qualify for debt cancellation sooner, is experiencing significant delays. According to a recent court filing, the backlog of pending applications has grown to over 72,730, leaving many borrowers waiting months for a response from the Department of Education. The program gained popularity after the SAVE repayment plan was blocked by courts, pushing more borrowers to seek this alternative path to forgiveness. Advocates advise applicants to be patient but also to explore other repayment options simultaneously. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has lifted a lower court's injunction, potentially allowing the Trump administration to proceed with its plan to fire 1,500 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). In a split decision, two Trump-appointed judges ruled that the lower court lacked jurisdiction to block the mass layoffs at the top consumer watchdog agency. The ruling will not take immediate effect, allowing time for an appeal. The move is part of a broader effort by the administration to reshape the agency, which has returned over $21 billion to American consumers since its inception.</p>

Jota, 28, and his brother, 25, died in a car crash in July. Before the match at Anfield, fans in the Kop created a mosaic reading "DJ20," and the stadium joined in a rendition of "You'll Never Walk Alone" followed by a period of silence. The club has retired Jota's number 20 shirt for the season, and players will wear a "Forever 20" emblem on their kits as a season-long tribute.</p>

          <p>The cost of packing a school lunch is rising, with a new report from Deloitte indicating the average price has increased to $6.15, up nearly 3% from last year. This increase is attributed to general grocery inflation, with staples like milk and bananas seeing significant price hikes. While some items like white bread and tomatoes have become cheaper, the overall trend is upward. In response, many parents plan to switch to store brands and cut other household expenses. The report also notes that the cost of cafeteria lunches is rising, prompting the USDA to increase funding for school meal programs.</p>

          <p>A parenting book titled "Your Child, His Family, and Friends" has been returned to the San Antonio Public Library nearly 82 years after it was checked out in July 1943. The book was discovered among the possessions of a deceased man by his child, who mailed it back from Oregon with an explanatory letter. The letter writer suspects their grandmother, who moved to Mexico City for an embassy job in 1943, was the original borrower. Fortunately for the family, the library stopped charging late fees in 2021, avoiding what would have been an estimated $900 fine.</p>

The union issued a 72-hour strike notice this week, and if a deal is not reached, a work stoppage could begin on Saturday, grounding the country's largest airline and impacting about 130,000 travelers daily. The airline has begun a gradual "wind down" of operations to ensure an orderly process. Key disagreements in contract negotiations revolve around wages and unpaid labor, with the union rejecting the airline's proposal to enter binding arbitration.</p>

The basic Slate Truck is a spare, two-seat vehicle that owners can customize with over 100 planned accessories, or even third-party additions. The company's main selling point is its low price, which it says will remain compelling even after federal EV tax credits expire. However, with the base price potentially landing near $28,000, it will face competition from other established models, raising questions about its ability to compete on features beyond its unique, customizable platform.</p>

The PBS board also approved a $35 million reduction in dues paid by its 350 local member stations.

Starboard was instrumental in a successful 2022-2023 campaign that pressured Salesforce to improve its profitability and efficiency, leading to a significant stock rally. The renewed interest comes as Salesforce stock has struggled in 2025 amid concerns about its growth strategy and the impact of AI on its business model. (not investment advice)</p>

The DeKalb County judge ruled that the state violated Marsicano's constitutional right to a speedy trial by failing to issue an indictment more than two years after the arrest. The defendant's attorney argued the state was purposefully delaying the case, a tactic described as "the process is the punishment." This marks a significant victory for opponents of the training center, who have faced sweeping charges from the state.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that about one in ten children on Medicaid who visit an emergency department for a mental health crisis end up "boarding" there for three days or longer while waiting for an inpatient bed. The research, published in JAMA Health Forum, identifies depressive disorders and suicidal ideation as the most common reasons for these extended stays. Experts attribute the problem to a nationwide shortage of pediatric psychiatric inpatient beds and inadequate outpatient mental health services, which could prevent crises from occurring. This lack of resources means children often receive no therapeutic care during their wait, potentially worsening their condition.</p>
