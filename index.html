          <p>President Trump signed executive orders adjusting tariffs for carmakers, aiming to alleviate the financial strain caused by levies on imported cars and parts. The changes provide some tariff relief by phasing out certain taxes over two years and exempting carmakers from tariffs on steel and aluminum if they pay a 25% tariff on auto imports. While automakers welcomed the flexibility, they noted that the remaining tariffs would still increase car prices and threaten their profitability. The Trump administration defends the changes as a way to encourage domestic manufacturing, while analysts warn of rising car prices and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A high-speed incident near the University of Delaware campus resulted in one death and multiple injuries after suspects fleeing in an unreturned U-Haul van struck pedestrians and a police vehicle. Newark police officers attempted to apprehend two suspects in the van, which had been reported as an unauthorized use vehicle, but the suspects fled, hitting two pedestrians and several parked cars. One pedestrian was pronounced dead at the scene, while another sustained serious injuries, and the driver was also hospitalized with serious injuries.

The battalion addressed a backlog of approximately 17 million pieces of mail in three months and served in France, but did not receive recognition for their service until recently. The award comes after years of campaigning for the overlooked battalion, and a 2024 Tyler Perry-directed Netflix film about the unit was nominated for an Oscar. The honor marks the latest development in the unit's overdue recognition, with a monument erected in their honor in 2018 and the Meritorious Unit Commendation given by the U.S. Army in 2019.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom expressed support for legislation that would increase the punishment for soliciting a 16- or 17-year-old for sex to a felony, a move that puts him at odds with some members of his own party. Democrats in the state Assembly had initially watered down the bill, prompting Newsom to assert that all sex predators who solicit minors should be treated the same under the law. The governor's stance comes after Democrats refused to hear the proposal in a public safety committee unless the felony charge for soliciting older minors was removed.</p>

          <p>President Trump marked his 100th day in office with a campaign-style speech in Michigan, highlighting his administration's achievements and criticizing political opponents. Trump touted progress on immigration, noting a significant decrease in illegal border crossings, but acknowledged the economy as a political vulnerability amid an ongoing trade war. He also softened his stance on auto tariffs after warnings from U.S. carmakers. Despite opinion polls indicating a dip in his approval rating, Trump dismissed them as "fake," while the Democratic National Committee criticized his first 100 days as a "colossal failure."</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported first-quarter operating profit and revenue that surpassed analysts' estimates, driven by strong sales of its Galaxy S25 smartphones and memory chips. The company posted record quarterly revenue, up 10% from a year earlier, while its first-quarter operating profit climbed 1.5%. Samsung flagged macroeconomic uncertainties due to trade tensions and a slowdown in global growth, but expects performance to improve in the second half of the year, assuming that the uncertainties are diminished.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order softening some automotive tariffs, aiming to prevent automakers from being hit twice by levies on imported vehicles, steel, and aluminum. The order maintains a 25% tariff on imported vehicles but offers reimbursements for tariffs paid on auto parts used in U.S. assembly. Automakers can qualify for partial reimbursements on parts-related levies for two years, providing some relief from the additional costs. General Motors postponed its first-quarter conference call to assess the potential impact of the tariff changes.</p>
