            <p>Saturday Night Live addressed economic anxieties stemming from President Trump's tariffs through multiple sketches. The cold open reimagined Jesus's cleansing of the temple with Trump commenting on egg prices and stock market chaos. A pre-taped sketch, "The White Potus," parodied "The White Lotus," depicting Trump spiraling over the country's financial losses. Another sketch, "Check to Check Business News," humorously explained the impact of tariffs on everyday grocery items, making the economic story relatable and terrifyingly real to average Americans.</p>

            <p>Amidst stock market panic and treasury bond yield surges, investors seek strategies for stable income. Bond ladders, involving investments across various maturities held until maturity, offer potential stability.

Ultrashort fixed-income bond ETFs are also popular, but bond ladders can offer broader protection against liabilities and are seen as a psychological tool. (not investment advice)</p>
