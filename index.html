          <p>A recent military parade in Beijing, marking the 80th anniversary of WWII's end, served as a powerful display of China's growing global influence. The article analyzes this event in the context of President Trump's "America First" trade policies, suggesting they may be inadvertently fostering new alliances between nations like China, Russia, and India. While Trump views tariffs as essential for protecting American industry, the spectacle in Tiananmen Square and concurrent economic summits underscore the potential diplomatic and geopolitical costs of this strategy. The piece also notes the legal challenges Trump's tariffs face within the US, adding another layer of uncertainty to his ambitious approach.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region saw gains on Thursday, mirroring a rally on Wall Street led by the technology sector that boosted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Japan's Nikkei 225, Australia's S&P/ASX 200, and South Korea's Kospi all traded higher in early sessions. The positive movement came despite underlying fears about the broader economy, with global bond markets remaining a key area of focus for investors. A recent U.S. court ruling against Trump-era tariffs has raised questions about future revenues, causing the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield to briefly rise above 5%. (not investment advice)</p>

The campaign with Sweeney, which sparked public debate, and a clothing series with Kelce, launched around his engagement to Taylor Swift, have successfully boosted brand awareness.

Despite these positive results, the company's stock fell in extended trading after it issued disappointing revenue guidance for the upcoming third quarter. The article notes that Salesforce has struggled with slower growth and has not benefited from the AI boom as much as its tech peers. In response to challenges, the company announced a $20 billion increase to its share buyback program and continues to promote its Agentforce AI software. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants, ruling that the current situation does not constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion." The administration had invoked the obscure wartime law to expel hundreds of individuals accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The Fifth Circuit court's decision marks a significant legal setback for the White House's strategy, with judges rejecting the argument that mass illegal migration is equivalent to an armed incursion.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida is set to become the first U.S. state to eliminate all vaccine mandates, including long-standing requirements for diseases like polio and measles for public school attendance. State Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced the plan, framing it as a matter of individual liberty, a move that has drawn sharp criticism from medical experts and health organizations. Critics, including the CDC's former chief medical officer, warn that this policy is reckless and could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases, posing a significant public health risk. The decision contrasts with actions in other states and highlights a growing political divide over public health guidance.</p>

This policy is part of a broader strategy to boost consumer spending in key sectors like catering, housing, and retail.

          <p>Some members of Gen Z are reportedly creating a false impression of a luxurious travel lifestyle on social media, often by going into debt or using deceptive photo tactics. The article details instances where young adults book day passes at exclusive resorts or split the cost of a high-end rental for one night simply to capture photos that suggest a prolonged, lavish vacation. This trend is driven by the desire to build an online persona that can attract brand partnerships and generate income. Financial data indicates that Gen Z spends more on travel than other generations, with a significant percentage planning to use debt to fund their trips.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it froze over $2.2 billion in research funding for Harvard University. The funds were withheld in response to allegations of antisemitism on campus, but Judge Allison D. Burroughs stated the administration used the issue as a "smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault." The ruling noted that the freeze was implemented without considering the steps Harvard had already taken to address the problem. The suspended funds supported over 900 critical research projects, including studies on Alzheimer's, cancer, and heart disease, and the White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>In Montana's Blackfoot Valley, ranchers are adopting innovative strategies to combat the economic and environmental threats facing their industry. The Mannix family, who has worked their land for 143 years, co-founded the Old Salt Co-op to process livestock locally and sell beef directly to consumers, bypassing large industrial meatpackers. This model aims to improve profit margins for producers and enhance food security. The cooperative is also committed to regenerative ranching, a practice that involves rotating cattle and allowing land to rest for extended periods to improve soil health and resilience against extreme weather like droughts.</p>

TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak suggested taxes on online gaming, bank windfall profits, and equalizing capital gains tax with income tax. He argued that financial institutions, which have seen record profits, should be asked to pay a fairer share to support the economy. While the Treasury has emphasized economic growth as its top priority, the TUC warns that without visible, progressive changes, the government risks disillusioning voters who may turn to divisive political alternatives.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire, named the 6-5 Fire, has burned homes in Chinese Camp, a historic California town settled by Chinese miners during the Gold Rush around 1850. The blaze, caused by lightning, rapidly grew to over 10 square miles and prompted evacuations in the area. At least five homes were reported to be burning in the small rural community, which has a population of about 60 people. The town was originally established after Chinese miners were driven out of a nearby camp and faced persecution during the Gold Rush era. The fire is part of a larger complex of lightning-caused fires burning in the region.</p>

The warning came after Israel's far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, proposed annexing approximately 80% of the West Bank. The UAE, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020, stated that a key condition of the accords was the suspension of previous annexation plans, reinforcing its continued support for an independent Palestinian state.</p>

It is crucial to call 999 if anyone is injured, if the other driver leaves the scene, or if the road is blocked.

The new agreement, which still requires court approval, will allow these voters to provide the necessary information via a provisional ballot at the polling place.

          <p>Parents in the UK are raising alarms about a lack of adequate healthcare services for children suffering from chronic constipation, a condition affecting an estimated 1.5 million children nationwide. One mother described her son's severe case, which led to 25 hospital admissions in six months, as a crisis that was not taken seriously by medical professionals until it became life-threatening. NHS data shows a 10-year high in hospital admissions for children with constipation, and experts say many are being failed by a "postcode lottery" of specialized services. Charities report a spike in calls from concerned parents, highlighting a widespread and often overlooked health issue.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 270,000 Venezuelan migrants, whose legal protections are now set to expire within 60 days. This decision affects a group of Venezuelans granted TPS in 2021 who have been in the U.S. for a longer period. The Department of Homeland Security argued that maintaining the program acts as a magnet for illegal immigration and undermines border security efforts. Officials are urging those who lose their status to self-deport using a government app. This move is the latest in a series of actions by the administration to revoke humanitarian protections for migrants.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that Americans continue to hold a negative view of the U.S. economy, with most describing its current state as "uncertain" and "struggling." Economic ratings have dipped slightly over the past month, with perceptions of rising prices remaining the primary driver of pessimism. Two-thirds of respondents reported that prices are still increasing and expect them to continue to do so. While personal financial ratings vary by income level, the overall outlook remains gloomy, with a majority believing the economy is getting worse and about a quarter expecting a recession.

          <p>The public affairs network C-SPAN has reached agreements to be carried on major streaming platforms YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, expanding its reach to millions of new viewers. The deals come two months after C-SPAN made a public appeal for wider distribution, citing financial strain from the decline of traditional cable and satellite television subscriptions. The U.S. Senate had also passed a resolution urging streaming services to carry the nonprofit, privately funded network. The addition of C-SPAN's three channels to these platforms is seen as a crucial step in securing its future and continuing its mission of providing unfiltered coverage of the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>The UK government has acknowledged that more than 30,000 homes were fitted with substandard insulation under its ECO4 and Great British Insulation Scheme programs since 2022, placing them at risk of damp and mould. An energy minister described the situation as a "systemic failure" and stated the government is working to ensure the faulty installations are fixed at no cost to consumers. The admission follows a government-ordered audit and reports from homeowners who experienced severe mould and damp after the work was completed. Ministers plan to overhaul the consumer protection system to restore public trust in the energy-saving initiatives.</p>

          <p>An article from The Atlantic critiques Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s recent op-ed in which he claimed his leadership led to a swift and effective CDC response to a measles outbreak in Texas. The analysis argues that Kennedy's account is misleading, pointing out that the outbreak lasted from January to August and became the worst in the U.S. since 1992. The article also highlights that Kennedy initially downplayed the outbreak's severity and promoted unproven alternative remedies like vitamin A, undermining the CDC's vaccination efforts. This comes as Kennedy continues to reshape the CDC by appointing fringe figures to its key vaccine advisory panel.</p>

While the enterprise software company beat Wall Street's estimates for second-quarter earnings and revenue, its outlook for the next quarter disappointed investors, causing shares to fall over 5%. Benioff highlighted the success of the company's AI products and noted that AI agents have allowed Salesforce to reduce its own service and support staff. He also pointed to a significant contract win with the U.S. Army as evidence of the company's competitive strength and value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge's ruling in a major antitrust case spared Google from being forced to sell its Chrome web browser, causing parent company Alphabet's stock to surge 9%. While the judge had previously deemed Google a "monopolist" in online search, the remedies imposed were less severe than feared. The decision rejected the divestiture of Chrome as "incredibly messy and highly risky" but did place other limits on the tech giant, including requiring it to share some search data with rivals to foster competition. The ruling comes as the rise of AI chatbots presents a new competitive challenge to Google's long-standing dominance in the search market.</p>
