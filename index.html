          <p>A 21-year-old Austrian man opened fire at a secondary school in Graz, Austria, killing nine students and one teacher before taking his own life. Twelve others were injured in the deadliest mass shooting in Austria's recent history, prompting a three-day national mourning period. Police investigations revealed the shooter was a former student who did not graduate, and they found a "farewell letter," "farewell video," and a non-functional pipe bomb at his home. The shooter legally owned the pistol and shotgun used in the attack, and authorities are still investigating a possible motive.</p>

Experts advise investors to stay calm during market fluctuations, emphasizing that volatility does not necessarily indicate direction. Historical data shows that while some presidential terms have yielded higher returns, others have fared worse, highlighting the importance of long-term investment strategies.

          <p>General Motors plans to invest $4 billion in three U.S. assembly plants, shifting or expanding production of vehicles currently made in Mexico to American facilities. This decision comes amid President Trump's implementation of tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts from Mexico. The investment will include assembling the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox in the U.S., and converting an idled Michigan plant to produce gas-powered SUVs and trucks by 2027. This move is expected to increase GM's U.S. production capacity to over two million vehicles annually and is seen as a win for Trump's trade policies.</p>

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that weakness in energy and services prices offset some increases, and key items expected to show tariff-related increases, such as vehicles and apparel, actually declined.

The conflict was sparked by Musk's opposition to the Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which Musk claimed would undermine DOGE's work and increase the U.S. budget deficit.

          <p>Approximately 150 people attended a public meeting in Bordesley calling for an end to the ongoing bin strike in Birmingham. The strike, which began 13 weeks ago, is a dispute over pay between the union Unite and Birmingham City Council. Residents are calling for council tax reimbursement and an independent panel to take over negotiations. Birmingham City Council stated it has made a "fair and reasonable offer" and remains committed to resolving the dispute, but Unite maintains that members seek an "acceptable" deal.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts along the border with North Korea as part of efforts to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The broadcasts, which had resumed in June of the previous year under a hardline stance, were halted in response to the North's launch of waste-carrying balloons into the South. The South Korean military said the suspension aims to help "restore trust in inter-Korean relations and achieving peace on the Korean Peninsula," reflecting President Lee Jae Myung's emphasis on pragmatism.</p>

Applications to refinance rose 16% for the week, while applications for a mortgage to purchase a home climbed 10%. The increase in demand may be attributed to loosening housing inventory in certain markets, with supply up 31% compared to the same time last year.</p>

Trump's agenda, which includes concentrating power, replacing civil servants with loyalists, and altering the racial hierarchy, is encountering legal challenges and pushback. The administration's efforts to undermine institutions and ethical checks are being questioned by courts and even some Republicans. As a result, Trump is choosing radicalization and polarization, seeking to provoke violence to advance his agenda, including the deployment of military forces against protesters in Los Angeles.</p>

The conversation highlights the role of nostalgia and the influence of millennials aging out of being cool.
