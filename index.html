          <p>A new ETF, VistaShares Target 15 Berkshire Select Income ETF (OMAH), allows investors to mirror Warren Buffett's top stock picks while generating income. The ETF holds the top 20 most heavily weighted stocks in Berkshire Hathaway and aims to produce 15% annual income by selling call options and distributing monthly payments. This strategy addresses some Berkshire shareholders' desire for income, as Berkshire Hathaway famously doesn't pay a dividend. The ETF offers a way to invest like Buffett with an added income stream, appealing to investors seeking both quality exposure and income opportunities in a volatile market.

          <p>A massive explosion and fire at the Shahid Rajaee port in southern Iran killed five people and injured over 700. The blast occurred as Iran and the United States were engaged in nuclear talks in Oman.

The port, a key strategic location on the Strait of Hormuz, has been a target in the past, including a 2020 cyberattack attributed to Israel.</p>

He predicts backlash against Apple in China due to U.S. tariffs, impacting iPhone sales, and has cut his Apple price target, citing macro-economic concerns.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring, died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia at the age of 41. Giuffre had accused Prince Andrew and other powerful figures of sexual assault when she was a teenager. Giuffre was a central figure in exposing Epstein's crimes, bringing attention to the trafficking and sexual exploitation of young women. Giuffre wrote in an Instagram post in March that she was days away from dying of renal failure after being injured in an automobile crash with a school bus.</p>

          <p>China has expanded an initiative to create a new academic discipline aimed at eliminating Western bias in ethnic studies.

The initiative reflects Beijing's efforts to consolidate its narrative on a unified national identity and counter Western influence in academic discourse.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a conscious parenting coach, telling children "You're okay" when they are upset can cause long-term emotional damage. This phrase invalidates their feelings, short-circuits emotional processing, and teaches them to doubt their own emotions. It can also rewire a child’s stress response, making it harder to trust and regulate emotions. Instead of offering premature reassurance, parents should validate their children's feelings and provide support.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reveals the 10 worst-paying college majors five years after graduation. Education, social work, and arts graduates tend to earn the lowest median incomes. Early-career pay in these fields falls below the U.S. median wage. While engineering majors can make upward of $80,000 early in their careers, many liberal arts and education majors earn closer to $40,000.</p>
