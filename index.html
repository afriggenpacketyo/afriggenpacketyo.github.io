          <p>A U.S. federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump overstepped his authority by imposing global tariffs, a significant setback to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade stated that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country, as the U.S. Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The court vacated the tariffs and permanently enjoined their operation, although the Trump administration has the option to appeal the ruling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced to parliament that Hamas leader Mohammed Sinwar had been killed, though he provided no further details. The Israeli military has not issued any statement to confirm the death. Sinwar's reported death comes after nearly 20 months of war between Israel and Hamas, which began after Hamas-led militants launched an attack on southern Israel in October 2023. The conflict has resulted in a high death toll in Gaza, and negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release are ongoing, with U.S. involvement.</p>

          <p>The cost of insuring exposure to U.S. government debt using credit default swaps (CDS) has been rising, nearing a two-year high, indicating investor nervousness about the U.S. government's ability to meet its debt obligations. While some analysts attribute the surge in CDS demand to concerns about the unresolved debt ceiling and political dysfunction, others emphasize it's a hedge against political risk rather than an expectation of imminent insolvency. The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a major tax cut package that could raise the debt ceiling, but Senate approval is pending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) will invest over Â£1 billion to develop battlefield technology, including a new Digital Targeting Web to connect soldiers with information from satellites, aircraft, and drones. This investment aims to speed up decision-making on the battlefield by harnessing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and software. The MoD also announced the creation of a new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command to oversee military cyber operations and electronic warfare. The extra investment is enabled by the government's commitment to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer discussed the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on future employment, noting that AI could be a major force shaping the workforce. He referenced concerns that AI could increase unemployment and wipe out entry-level white-collar jobs, while acknowledging that AI could also eliminate undesirable or dangerous jobs. Cramer suggested that CEOs may be more interested in using AI to reduce costs by firing employees rather than to increase productivity, and it is important to see what the future holds with the rise of AI.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has suspended some sales of critical U.S. technologies, including those related to jet engines, semiconductors, and certain chemicals, to China.

The new limits are escalating tensions between the world's largest economies, potentially impacting companies that rely on foreign technologies.

          <p>President Trump's aggressive actions against Harvard University, including the suffocation of its federal funding, illustrate his view that opposition is the fault of those who push back against him. Trump framed his actions as necessary because Harvard was "fighting back" and treating the country with disrespect. He wants to make an example of institutions that push back, sending a message that no dissent will be tolerated. This approach is consistent with Trump's worldview that he cannot win without someone else losing.</p>
