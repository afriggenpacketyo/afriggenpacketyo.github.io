          <p>Zijin Gold International's initial public offering, Hong Kong's second-largest of the year, is likely to be delayed due to Super Typhoon Ragasa. The Hong Kong Observatory issued a No. 8 warning signal, with the typhoon expected to bring hurricane-force winds, prompting the potential postponement of the IPO's book close. This development introduces uncertainty for what was anticipated to be a significant financial event, with the company aiming to raise US$3.2 billion. The situation highlights the vulnerability of financial markets to unpredictable natural events.</p>

          <p>A senior official from China's top economic planning agency has indicated that Beijing may introduce stronger policies to support the country's private sector. In an article published in the People's Daily, the official acknowledged room for improvement in the business environment, calling for better property rights protection and more transparent law enforcement for enterprises. This signals a potential policy shift aimed at stabilizing market sentiment and boosting investor confidence after a period of regulatory tightening. The move could provide a needed lift to non-state firms.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has uncovered and dismantled a massive, illicit telecommunications network in the New York tri-state area that posed a significant threat to the city's infrastructure and the U.N. General Assembly. The operation, the largest of its kind, seized 300 SIM servers with over 100,000 SIM cards capable of disabling cell towers and blocking emergency services. Investigators believe the well-funded network was used for encrypted communications between foreign governments, organized crime gangs, and other illicit groups. While no arrests have been made, the immediate threat has been neutralized.</p>

          <p>A federal trial has commenced in Seattle between Amazon and the Federal Trade Commission, which alleges the company deceived millions of customers into signing up for its Prime subscription service and intentionally complicated the cancellation process. The FTC lawsuit, filed in 2023, claims Amazon used "dark patterns"—deceptive design tactics—to boost its 200 million-plus member program. Amazon denies the allegations, arguing its sign-up and cancellation processes are clear and simple.

          <p>Germany's Finance Minister, Lars Klingbeil, has defended the government's proposed 2026 budget against criticism from opposition parties. He asserted that the government plans to invest €126.7 billion in critical areas like infrastructure, schools, and hospitals, using special funds to boost growth and secure jobs rather than finance "pet projects." Opposition parties have accused the ruling coalition of accumulating debt for tax breaks and pensions instead of making genuine investments. Klingbeil countered that the spending is necessary to rehabilitate sectors that have been neglected for years and to enhance Germany's competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A political analyst suggests that recent actions by the Trump administration, such as pressuring ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's show, indicate a more serious effort to consolidate power and could be pushing the U.S. toward "competitive authoritarianism." This form of government perverts laws to incrementally undermine the opposition's ability to compete fairly, targeting civil society, media, and financial supporters of political rivals. While the U.S. is not yet a competitive authoritarian state, the article argues that recent moves to control media and harass critics represent a dangerous trend. It calls for collective defiance across society to resist these "salami slicing" tactics against democracy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications is expected to severely impact U.S. startups, according to founders and venture capitalists.

This policy could stifle entrepreneurship, reduce venture capital investment in U.S. firms, and potentially reverse the "brain drain" by encouraging skilled talent to seek opportunities in other countries like the U.K. and Canada.

While some studies have suggested a potential association between acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders, others, including a large-scale Swedish study, found no causal link.

The suspension, which followed threats from the FCC chairman, ignited a nationwide debate over free speech, with many critics and celebrities decrying the move as censorship. Disney stated the show was suspended because the comments were "ill-timed and thus insensitive," but decided to reinstate it after "thoughtful conversations" with Kimmel. However, Sinclair, a major ABC affiliate group, announced it would not air the show's return, replacing it with news programming.</p>

This reliance makes being single particularly isolating. Furthermore, a failure to develop emotional intimacy skills can make dating more difficult, sometimes leading to frustration and blame that fuels misogynistic online communities.

          <h2>Survey Data Suggests Los Angeles Residents Widely Support More Housing in Their Own Neighborhoods</h2>

          <p>Contrary to the common "Not In My Backyard" (NIMBY) narrative, a recent UCLA survey indicates that a majority of Los Angeles residents support the construction of new apartment buildings, even in their own neighborhoods and on streets with single-family homes. The author argues that this widespread pro-housing sentiment, found in 14 of 15 City Council districts, provides a clear mandate for city leaders to pursue more aggressive housing policies. The piece criticizes Mayor Karen Bass for watering down an affordable housing directive, suggesting she is listening to a vocal minority rather than the data-backed silent majority. It calls for leaders to embrace this consensus to address the city's urgent housing crisis.</p>

          <p>An archaeological mission searching for the lost tomb of Queen Cleopatra has discovered evidence of a submerged ancient port connected to the Taposiris Magna Temple, about 30 miles west of Alexandria, Egypt. Using advanced sonar technology, the Egyptian-Dominican team mapped a former shoreline and harbor that would have served the temple complex during the Ptolemaic period over 2,000 years ago. The lead archaeologist, Dr. Kathleen Martinez, believes this site, not the traditional location in Alexandria, is the true resting place of Cleopatra. The discovery of the port adds a new chapter to the history of the site and fuels the ongoing quest for the famous queen's tomb.</p>

          <p>Alfredo Juarez Zeferino, a prominent farm worker activist, claims his arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was retaliation for his successful labor organizing in Washington state. After being detained for over three months in what he described as poor conditions, he agreed to voluntarily leave the U.S. for Mexico. Supporters believe the Trump administration targeted Juarez Zeferino, who helped unionize farm workers and win statewide heat protections, as part of a broader effort to suppress labor activism among undocumented workers. From Mexico, he continues to organize remotely, pushing for better conditions for both farm laborers and immigration detainees.</p>

          <p>A media critic argues that ESPN is undergoing a significant shift, moving away from its tradition of adversarial sports journalism toward a model focused on influencer partnerships and cozy relationships with sports leagues. The hiring of social media personalities and the NFL's acquisition of an equity stake in the network are cited as evidence of this change. The article contends that this new direction prioritizes access, highlights, and viral content over critical reporting, effectively turning the network into a public relations arm for the sports world. This trend reflects a broader crisis in sports media, where journalistic scrutiny is being sacrificed for commercial partnerships.</p>

          <p>Grant Harrold, who served as a butler to King Charles for seven years, has stated that his memories of the royal family dynamic are very different from those described in Prince Harry's memoir, "Spare." In his own book, Harrold recalls a "happy family," noting that he never witnessed the unhappiness or friction Harry described, particularly concerning his relationship with Queen Camilla. He points to photographs from the King's wedding showing a seemingly happy Harry, suggesting the public portrayal at the time does not align with the prince's later recollections. Harrold acknowledges that Harry could have been hiding his feelings but maintains that something "doesn't add up."</p>

He warns that tactics like targeting media, scrutinizing non-profits, and pressuring businesses to align with the administration echo the "salami slicing" of democracy he witnessed in Russia. McFaul notes how Russian oligarchs initially accepted Putin's autocratic moves in exchange for economic benefits, only to regret their passivity later. He argues that a constitution is merely paper without people and institutions willing to defend it, urging a broad, non-partisan resistance to protect democratic norms in America.</p>

          <p>The trend of giving children alternatively spelled names, such as "Oaklynn" or "Sadilynn," has sparked intense online debate and mockery, as seen in forums like the "tragedeigh" subreddit. The article explores the motivations behind this phenomenon, which include a desire for uniqueness, the influence of social media, and a way to feminize traditionally masculine names. Baby name experts suggest the backlash is often rooted in classism and a resistance to breaking from tradition. While these names are still relatively rare, the strong reactions they provoke highlight broader societal anxieties about identity, status, and the perceived "correctness" of cultural norms.</p>

          <p>A novel and environmentally friendly method of mining called "phytomining" is being developed, using hyperaccumulating plants that naturally absorb high concentrations of metals from the soil. In Albania, a startup is harvesting mustard plants to extract nickel, a metal in high demand for electric vehicle batteries. After the plants are harvested and incinerated, the resulting "bio-ore" is processed into nickel sulfate. Proponents say this method is a low-carbon alternative to conventional mining, which can be highly destructive and polluting, and it can be used on land unsuitable for traditional agriculture. While it cannot replace industrial mining, phytomining offers a supplementary, greener source for valuable metals.</p>
