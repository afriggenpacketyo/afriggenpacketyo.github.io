          <p>The White House has withdrawn Jared Isaacman's nomination to lead NASA, just days before a scheduled Senate confirmation vote. President Trump cited a "thorough review of prior associations" as the reason for the withdrawal, promising to announce a new nominee aligned with his "America First" agenda. Isaacman, a veteran private astronaut with ties to SpaceX, expressed gratitude for the experience and appreciation for government complexities. Elon Musk responded to the news by calling Isaacman "competent and good-hearted," as the selection process continues for NASA's next administrator.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has cautioned that the government faces "unavoidable" tough choices in the upcoming Spending Review as it finalizes budget plans. The level of funding allocated to the NHS will significantly impact potential cuts to other "unprotected" areas like schools and the criminal justice system. The IFS noted that the government front-loaded spending in the early years of the parliament term, leading to a slowdown in future funding increases. The review will scrutinize every pound spent, with potential impacts on plans such as increasing police numbers and capping bus fares.</p>

          <p>Germany's national police chief, Dieter Romann, has given a positive initial assessment of the country's tightened border controls. He dismissed concerns from the police union about overburdened personnel, asserting that the Federal Police should be able to manage the situation effectively. Since the reintroduction of temporary border checks in September 2024, nearly 1,200 additional officers have been deployed, bringing the total to between 13,000 and 14,000. Romann rejected the idea that personnel would be withdrawn from other operational areas, such as train stations, to reinforce border controls.</p>

          <p>Dermatologists advise wearing sunscreen on airplanes, especially when seated by a window, due to the risk of UVA ray exposure. Airplane windows block most UVB rays, which cause sunburn, but not all UVA rays, which contribute to premature aging and skin cancer. A 2015 study indicated that pilots and cabin crew have a higher incidence of melanoma compared to the general population. Experts recommend using broad-spectrum sunscreen and other protective measures like hats and sunglasses during flights.</p>

The proposal limits federal student loans for professional programs like medical school to $150,000 and eliminates a federal graduate loan program. Medical students rely heavily on federal loans, and advocates fear the changes could deter low-income students from pursuing medicine.
