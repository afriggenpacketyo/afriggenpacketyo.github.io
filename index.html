          <p>The United States and China have reached a temporary agreement to reduce tariffs imposed on each other's goods for a 90-day period, signaling a potential de-escalation in the ongoing trade war between the two economic superpowers. This decision follows high-level trade negotiations in Switzerland, where both countries expressed a mutual interest in a sustainable and mutually beneficial economic relationship. The agreement entails the U.S. lowering tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will decrease tariffs on American goods from 125% to 10%, with both sides continuing discussions on economic and trade policy.</p>

          <p>A group of 49 white Afrikaners from South Africa arrived in the United States after being granted refugee status by the Trump administration, citing alleged unfair treatment in their home country. The resettlement effort follows an executive order claiming minority Afrikaners are being unfairly treated in South Africa, leading to aid cuts and criticism of South Africa's DEI policies. While the South African government disputes these claims, calling them disinformation, the Afrikaners will now have a pathway to U.S. citizenship and access to government benefits, sparking debate and incredulity among many South Africans, both Black and white.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has revealed Labour's proposals to modify immigration levels into the UK, aiming for a system that is "controlled, selective, and fair." The plans include tightening skilled worker visa requirements by raising qualification standards, while also expanding eligibility for the "high potential individual" visa. Immigrants will generally need to live in the UK for 10 years before they can apply for permanent residency. Additionally, a dedicated visa for social care providers will be abolished, and overseas graduates will have a shorter period to stay in the UK after their studies.</p>

          <p>A new rule in the U.S. mandates that hotels and short-term lodging companies must disclose all mandatory fees upfront, targeting charges like "resort fees" that are often hidden until check-in. While the rule aims to increase transparency, it does not eliminate these fees, but rather ensures that travelers are aware of them before booking. However, some experts express concern that recent actions by the Trump administration, including staff cuts at enforcement agencies, may hinder the rule's effectiveness in protecting consumers from deceptive practices.</p>

          <p>A new dental office in Beverly Hills challenges the traditional sterile environment with a plush, pink, and magical design. The design firm of Charlap Hyman & Herrero created a space that prioritizes patient experience with lush carpets, wooden walls, Italian chairs, and monochromatic color schemes. The office features a circular design that guides patients through a private journey from the lobby to the operating room and back, ensuring they never cross paths with other patients.</p>

While Mexico has rejected direct military intervention, it may explore options for enhanced cooperation with the U.S., including training, technology, and armaments. The response would likely be shaped by the severity of any U.S. action and potential loss of life, and any U.S. military action would likely trigger a formal protest and curtail bilateral cooperation on immigration and security.</p>
