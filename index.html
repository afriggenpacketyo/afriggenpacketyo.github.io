          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its full-year financial outlook, buoyed by increasing sales to home improvement professionals, which compensated for a slowdown in demand from do-it-yourself consumers. The company's first-quarter earnings slightly missed sales expectations but exceeded earnings estimates, leading to a rise in Lowe's stock during premarket trading. CEO Marvin Ellison credited the company's investments in stores, technology, and customer service for navigating the current challenges in the housing market. The article notes that both Lowe's and its competitor, Home Depot, are focusing on attracting professional clients to offset weaker sales from individual consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Chicago Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher has expressed his views on the inclusion of transgender athletes in women's sports, stating that it is unfair due to inherent physical differences between men and women. Urlacher referenced a controversy in Minnesota involving a transgender softball pitcher and praised President Trump's executive order on the matter. His comments come amid heated debate in Illinois, where a biological male competed in a seventh-grade track meet against biological females, prompting a civil rights complaint alleging a violation of Title IX.

          <p>Despite Donald Trump's reputation for disregarding public opinion, there are instances where public sentiment appears to influence his administration's actions. The article analyzes Trump's handling of issues like birthright citizenship, deportations, and tariffs, noting cases where he has defied public outcry and others where he has seemingly responded to it. Examples include his administration's compliance with court rulings and his scaling back of tariffs after widespread opposition. The analysis suggests that while Trump's policies are often polarizing, public anger can still sway his administration's priorities, particularly on issues with lasting political implications.</p>

The article explains that resistance from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) slowed the process during the Biden administration, leading to legal challenges. The Trump administration has shown no signs of pursuing looser cannabis regulations, nominating a critic of cannabis legalization to lead the DEA. Experts suggest that the window of opportunity for cannabis rescheduling has narrowed considerably, with the process potentially rigged to fail.</p>

This decision is likely to reignite the debate over public access to land in England, where Dartmoor National Park is a rare exception to the general lack of wild camping rights.

          <p>Robert Reich argues that the recent downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody's is a direct result of rising debt levels exacerbated by the Trump tax cuts. He proposes that the solution is to reverse these tax cuts, which primarily benefit the wealthy and corporations, and instead raise taxes on them. The article asserts that the super-rich are increasingly financing the government through lending rather than taxation, leading to a growing portion of taxes from the rest of the population being used to pay interest to the wealthy.</p>
