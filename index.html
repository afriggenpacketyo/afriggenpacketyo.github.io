          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court election saw a significant Democratic victory, with Judge Susan Crawford defeating the conservative candidate, Brad Schimel.  Elon Musk's substantial financial backing of Schimel proved ineffective, highlighting the limitations of large-scale campaign spending. The outcome maintains liberal control of the court, impacting future rulings on key issues such as abortion and collective bargaining rights.</p>
