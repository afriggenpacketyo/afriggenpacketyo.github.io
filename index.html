          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 20:35:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which includes a 15% tariff on Japanese exports. President Trump stated that Japan will also invest $550 billion into the United States and open its markets to American goods like cars, trucks, and agricultural products. Japanese officials confirmed the agreement, noting it could bolster Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's political standing following recent election setbacks. The deal, which lowers auto tariffs from 25% to 15%, comes as a relief to some economists who had anticipated even higher rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump accused former President Barack Obama of "treason," alleging a plot to sabotage his 2016 election victory by linking him to Russian interference. The claim stems from a recently declassified intelligence report, which Democrats have dismissed as false. In a rare response, Obama's spokesperson called the allegations "bizarre" and a "weak attempt at distraction" from other issues. The controversy revisits the long-standing debate over Russian influence in the 2016 election, with intelligence communities having previously concluded that Russia did attempt to interfere.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced new trade agreements with both the Philippines and Indonesia, establishing a 19% tariff rate on goods imported from both nations. According to President Trump, the Philippines will eliminate its tariffs on U.S. goods, a detail not yet confirmed by the Philippine government. The deal with Indonesia will see it drop tariffs to zero for 99% of its trade with the U.S., opening its market to American industrial, tech, and agricultural products. These agreements were finalized ahead of an August 1 deadline for countries to reach trade deals or face higher tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marie Vega, the mother of a U.S. Marine veteran, delivered emotional testimony to a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee regarding her son's murder in 2014. She recounted how two undocumented immigrants with prior criminal records ambushed her family during a barbecue on their South Texas property, fatally shooting her son, Javier Vega Jr. In her testimony, Vega criticized the Obama administration's border policies, stating that if immigration laws had been enforced, her son would still be alive. She described the lasting trauma on her family and urged lawmakers to work together to ensure proper vetting of immigrants.</p>

          <p>The head of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City reported that 21 children have died from malnutrition and starvation across the territory in the last 72 hours. This follows warnings from the United Nations about collapsing lifelines and growing signs of severe hunger among the population. The U.N. human rights office attributes the suffering to Israel's interference with humanitarian aid, noting that over 1,000 Palestinians have been killed while trying to get food since late May. Despite a controversial new aid distribution system, the amount of food entering Gaza remains critically insufficient for its two million inhabitants.</p>

          <p>A powerful 1975 photograph taken by Stanley Forman captured the moment a fire escape collapsed during an apartment building fire in Boston, causing the death of a 19-year-old woman. The haunting image, which won a Pulitzer Prize, showed Diana Bryant and her 2-year-old goddaughter, Tiare Jones, falling from the fifth story. While Bryant was killed, the young girl survived by landing on her. The photo's widespread publication served as a major catalyst for change, prompting Boston to implement new city codes requiring fire escapes to be certified as safe every five years, a regulation that had a ripple effect on fire safety nationwide.</p>

          <p>Nineteen-year-old Michelle Agyemang has become a key player for England at Euro 2025, scoring crucial late goals in both the quarter-final and semi-final matches to keep the team's championship hopes alive. Her journey is remarkable, as she served as a ball girl for the senior team just four years ago, watching her current teammates from the sidelines. Now, the quiet and unassuming teenager, who is also a university student and musician, is making a major impact on the pitch. Her manager and teammates have praised her ability to "create havoc" and change the game when she comes on as a substitute.</p>

          <p>A Boston court was forced to dismiss more than 120 criminal cases, including some involving assault, because the defendants could not be assigned an attorney. The dismissals are the result of a monthslong work stoppage by public defenders, who are protesting for higher pay and argue they are the lowest paid in New England. A legal protocol requires cases to be dropped if a defendant lacks legal representation for 45 days. Prosecutors expressed frustration, calling the situation a threat to public safety and vowing to re-prosecute the cases, while the governor urged a resolution to the pay dispute.</p>

          <p>Following England's 2-1 ODI series defeat to India, former star bowler Katherine Sciver-Brunt has questioned the current team's mindset. Sciver-Brunt, England's all-time leading wicket-taker, suggested that some players appear "lazy" and lack the outward passion and fight she was known for during her career. She pointed to fielding errors and a timid attitude as potential issues, speculating that some players may be "scared to fail." In response, current captain Nat Sciver-Brunt and coach Charlotte Edwards defended the team's commitment and professionalism, stating that outward appearances don't always reflect a player's internal drive.</p>
