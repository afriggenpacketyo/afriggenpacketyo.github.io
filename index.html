          <h2>Trump Publicly Mulls Tax Increase on Wealthy Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 13:17:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump took to Truth Social to consider raising taxes on wealthy Americans, a move that would deviate from traditional Republican tax policy. He acknowledged the political challenges, referencing George H.W. Bush's broken "Read my lips" promise. Trump expressed openness to the idea to benefit lower and middle-income workers, but also cautioned against potential backlash from Democrats. The post puts pressure on GOP leaders already struggling to balance tax cuts with fiscal responsibility.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced a 90-second air traffic control outage early Friday morning, marking the second such incident in recent weeks. The FAA reported that controllers lost radar and communication with aircraft, similar to an outage in April that caused significant travel disruptions. The FAA also noted that several controllers had taken leave due to stress from the previous incident, exacerbating existing staffing shortages. Airlines and labor groups have been advocating for increased funding to modernize the U.S. air traffic control system, citing outdated equipment and staffing issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated a willingness to reduce tariffs on China from 145% to 80% ahead of trade negotiations, but analysts suggest this may not significantly ease price increases for consumers. While it could prevent a complete trade standstill, an 80% tariff would still be a substantial tax on imports. Companies like Mattel have warned of potential price increases and supply chain shifts due to the tariffs.

          <p>The US-UK trade deal on steel tariffs includes conditions on the ownership of British steel plants to prevent Chinese-owned plants from circumventing US tariffs. The agreement aims to ensure that the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe is not used as a backdoor for Chinese steel. The deal is expected to reduce car tariffs to 10% and steel tariffs to zero if certain requirements are met, potentially saving jobs in the car and steel industries. The US is focusing on the security of supply chains and the nature of ownership in defining the quota of steel allowed to be exported tariff-free.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that it will take several months to fully resolve air traffic control problems at Newark Liberty International Airport, with normal operations expected by summer. The plan involves new software, updated equipment, and new ATC centers to address outdated systems. Duffy noted that communication line failures and controller stress contributed to the disruptions. He emphasized that safety is the priority, potentially causing delays or cancellations. The modernization initiative will require significant funding from Congress.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is holding a bail hearing for Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate detained by ICE after her student visa was revoked. Ozturk's lawyers argue that her detainment violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights, claiming she was targeted for criticizing Israel and participating in pro-Palestinian protests. Tufts president Sunil Kumar defended Ozturk, stating the university has no information to support the allegations against her. Ozturk alleges she has suffered multiple asthma attacks in ICE detention and has received limited medical attention.</p>

          <p>The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), the primary commuter rail system in the San Francisco Bay Area, was forced to shut down for several hours Friday morning due to a computer networking problem. The outage affected all 50 stations and caused major delays, forcing commuters to find alternative transportation. While service resumed later in the morning, significant disruptions were expected. The outage comes as BART struggles to attract riders after the COVID-19 pandemic, with passenger traffic remaining below pre-pandemic levels.</p>
