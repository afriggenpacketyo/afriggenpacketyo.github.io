          <p>Salesforce shares dropped over 5% after the company issued a weak revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter, deepening its year-to-date losses to 27%. While its fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed analyst expectations, the guidance for the third quarter fell short of Wall Street's projections. Despite CEO Marc Benioff's optimistic statements about the company's AI investments, there are growing concerns among investors that AI could disrupt the traditional software-as-a-service model. The company is also facing challenges in its marketing and commerce product sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a contentious Senate hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. reiterated false claims about vaccines and clashed with Democratic senators over access to COVID-19 shots. He expressed agreement with a newly appointed vaccine panel member's statement that mRNA vaccines pose a dangerous risk, a claim widely refuted by scientific studies. Kennedy also defended his administration's decision to limit the new COVID-19 booster to specific high-risk groups, arguing he was not taking vaccines away from people. His testimony follows a major leadership shakeup at the CDC and accusations that he is politicizing public health agencies.</p>

          <p>Florida's State Surgeon General, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, announced plans to abolish all vaccine mandates in the state, including long-standing requirements for schoolchildren for diseases like measles and polio. Ladapo described the current requirements as "immoral" and a violation of personal freedom, stating the goal is to eliminate "every last one of them." The move has drawn sharp criticism from medical professionals and Democratic politicians, who warn it could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases and create a public health disaster. This policy aligns with the national agenda of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic.</p>

          <p>Court documents released Thursday revealed the list of items seized by the FBI during a raid on the home of former National Security Advisor John Bolton. Agents took multiple computers, cell phones, USB drives, and a hard drive from his Maryland residence. Also seized were a binder and typed documents contained in folders labeled "Trump I-IV," as well as boxes of "printed daily activities." The raid is reportedly connected to an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents, echoing a previous probe into his 2020 memoir. President Trump reacted to the raid by calling Bolton a "real lowlife."</p>

          <p>A mass stabbing in the Hollow Water First Nation community in Manitoba, Canada, has resulted in one death and at least six injuries. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) later confirmed that the suspect in the attack has also died. The incident, which occurred about 200 kilometers northeast of Winnipeg, was described by authorities as a "mass casualty" event. The RCMP's major crimes unit is leading the investigation, and police have assured the community that there is no ongoing risk to public safety. The attack tragically occurred on the third anniversary of another mass stabbing in Saskatchewan that killed 11 people.</p>

          <p>Northwestern University President Michael Schill has announced his resignation after a challenging three-year tenure. His leadership was marked by significant campus protests over the war in Gaza and financial pressure from Trump administration funding cuts that led to a hiring freeze and layoffs. Schill faced congressional scrutiny for negotiating with pro-Palestinian student protesters to dismantle an encampment, a decision he defended as a peaceful resolution. The university has also been under a federal investigation for alleged antisemitism on campus, which was a precursor to the administration freezing $790 million in federal grants, further intensifying the pressures that led to his departure.</p>

This powerful imagery was interpreted as a clear statement of intent to challenge the current U.S.-led global order and forge a new alignment of autocratic powers. While observers note that the relationship is more of a strategic alignment than a formal axis, it presents new opportunities for China as the U.S. faces internal divisions and strains relationships with its traditional allies.</p>

The chosen wing, Camp J, was previously used for solitary confinement but has been closed for years due to disrepair.

          <p>Deciding when to claim Social Security benefits is a critical financial choice that can significantly impact retirement income, with options ranging from age 62 to 70. Claiming at 62 provides immediate funds but results in a permanently reduced monthly payment, roughly 30% lower than at full retirement age. Waiting until full retirement age (66-67) secures the standard benefit, while delaying until age 70 maximizes payments, increasing them by about 8% for each year of delay. Financial experts suggest creating alternative income streams, such as from annuities or part-time work, to bridge the gap and allow benefits to grow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Aid organizations are warning that an escalating Israeli military offensive in Gaza City and new restrictions on aid groups are creating a catastrophic famine. Israel has ordered residents to evacuate south but agencies report there is no food, water, or shelter in the designated areas. A U.N.-backed panel has already declared famine conditions in northern Gaza, which are expected to spread. Israel is halting all aid to Gaza City and will require NGOs to re-register under new rules by September 9, a move many groups have rejected over fears their staff could be targeted, potentially shutting down most humanitarian operations.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed a lawsuit against Southern California Edison, alleging the utility's negligence and faulty power infrastructure caused the deadly Eaton and Fairview fires. The 2022 Fairview fire and the more recent Eaton fire collectively burned tens of thousands of acres of national forest, killed 21 people, and destroyed thousands of structures. The government is seeking to recover over $77 million in damages, including tens of millions in fire-suppression costs incurred by the U.S. Forest Service. Prosecutors stated the lawsuits allege a "troubling pattern of negligence" and hope to prompt a change in the company's safety culture.</p>

          <p>Ford reported a 53.7% year-over-year increase in August sales for its redesigned, three-row Expedition SUV, marking the model's best sales month in 21 years. This explosive growth for the large, gas-powered vehicle comes even as the auto industry sees a rush for electric vehicles ahead of an expiring federal tax credit. The strong performance of the Expedition, a key profit driver for Ford, signals sustained consumer interest in traditional internal combustion engines. Ford's leadership has noted the company is prioritizing hybrid models and is not as fully committed to an all-electric transition as some rivals, a strategy currently paying dividends.</p>

          <p>The city of Washington, D.C., has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the deployment of National Guard troops for domestic law enforcement violates the Constitution. D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb contends that President Trump's move to place the city's police under federal control and deploy thousands of troops has caused irreparable harm. The lawsuit seeks a permanent injunction to block the deployment. The White House defended the action as within the president's lawful authority to protect federal assets and stop violent crime, dismissing the lawsuit as a political maneuver intended to undermine public safety operations.</p>

His tenure was marked by significant commercial success, including the construction of a new £1 billion stadium, but also by frequent fan protests over a perceived lack of on-field success, with only one major trophy won during his time. Levy's departure follows a difficult league campaign and comes amid a broader leadership transition at the club, with Peter Charrington taking on the new role of non-executive chairman.

The project, a joint venture between Ørsted and Skyborn Renewables, was 80% complete and expected to power over 350,000 homes. The states' attorneys general argue the stop-work order is illegal and reckless, while the energy companies have filed a separate lawsuit calling the move unlawful and lacking any evidentiary basis.

Amid a resurgence of interest in conjure in popular culture, the book highlights the often-overlooked contributions of Black women as healers, spiritual guides, and cultural innovators throughout American history, from the antebellum period to the present day.</p>
