          <p>Japanese police arrested three Chinese nationals for allegedly operating an illegal poker gambling operation in Tokyo. Authorities suspect the trio earned over 60 million yen (approximately $413,000) within a year by collecting fees from players. The suspects, including 42-year-old Wang Yi, are accused of running the operation in a condominium, charging a 5% fee on winnings, and hosting around a dozen players daily. While one suspect admitted to the charges, the others claimed they were simply playing poker with friends.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China convened in Geneva for a second day of critical trade negotiations aimed at de-escalating tensions arising from the trade war initiated by President Trump.

While Mr. Trump hailed the initial talks as a success, economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a swift agreement.

Dr. Ross also critiques the tendency in psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems, urging society to cut mothers some slack and recognize that being "good enough" is sufficient.</p>

          <p>The Rubber Duck Museum in Point Roberts, Washington, is moving to Canada due to the impact of President Trump's tariffs on Canadian tourism and Chinese goods. The museum, located in a U.S. town accessible only through Canada, relies heavily on Canadian visitors. With tariffs increasing costs and strained relations deterring Canadian tourists, owners Neil and Krystal King are relocating the museum across the border to stay afloat. The move will allow them to avoid tariffs on ducks made in China and escape the uncertainty of international trade policies.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being released on bail following her detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Ozturk, who was detained for six weeks, spoke at a news conference alongside Sen. Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, expressing her faith in the American justice system. A federal judge ordered her release, citing concerns that her detention violated her due process and First Amendment rights.

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared a “total reset” in US-China trade relations following initial talks in Geneva, aimed at resolving the ongoing trade war. The two countries have imposed tariffs well above 100% on each other's goods, effectively creating a trade embargo. While Trump hailed the progress, neither side has released specific details or indicated a reduction in tariffs. The meetings are seen as a positive step toward de-escalation, but analysts remain cautious about the prospects of a breakthrough.</p>
