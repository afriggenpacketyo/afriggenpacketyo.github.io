            <p>Border Czar Tom Homan defended the Trump administration's deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, alleged to be an MS-13 gang member, citing the Alien Enemies Act. Senator Chris Van Hollen criticized the move, emphasizing Abrego Garcia's right to due process and claiming the administration is lying about the case. Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador despite a protective court order, which ICE has acknowledged as an "administrative error," and the Supreme Court has ordered the administration to facilitate his return. Van Hollen met with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, asserting his focus is on protecting constitutional rights, while Homan maintains the administration followed the law. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Tom Homan defended the Trump administration's policy of deporting alleged gang members to El Salvador's CECOT prison, citing his decades of experience with border security and the need to protect American citizens. He argued that those he deems the "worst of the worst" should be sent to such facilities, even without a criminal record. The policy has faced criticism, with some Democrats accusing the administration of "kidnapping" people for deportation. Homan referenced his experiences with gang-related violence to justify the policy, stating that protecting American citizens is paramount.</p>

            <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s views on autism are causing alarm, particularly his insistence that it's an "epidemic" caused by "environmental toxins" and his past comments about autistic individuals being unable to contribute to society. These statements reflect a broader war on science and knowledge, replacing them with conspiracy theories. Kennedy's views contradict scientific consensus and raise concerns about the future of autism policy and support.</p>

            <p>The article discusses the unreliability of various economic indicators used to predict recessions, including consumer sentiment, unemployment, and bond yields. It argues that relying on government data and trade association reports can be misleading. Instead, the author suggests focusing on actual data from retailers, banks, and payroll companies to gauge the health of the economy. Recent reports from these sectors indicate a fundamentally healthy economy, despite uncertainty and downbeat consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Germany is seeking to deport an American and three EU citizens over alleged actions at pro-Palestinian protests against Israel's war in Gaza. The deportation orders are connected to a protest at Berlin's Free University in October 2024, where masked individuals allegedly caused property damage. The protesters, who have not been charged with any crimes, are appealing the deportation orders, arguing they clash with EU law on freedom of movement. The cases have drawn comparisons to the Trump administration's handling of pro-Palestinian student protesters in the U.S.</p>
