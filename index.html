In an emotional monologue, Kimmel stated it was never his intention to make light of the tragedy or blame any specific group for the actions of a disturbed individual. He expressed gratitude for the support he received and underscored the importance of free speech, which allows for shows like his to exist in the United States. The host's return was met with a warm reception and standing ovations from the studio audience.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region experienced a downturn, mirroring declines on Wall Street after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell commented that equity prices are currently "fairly highly valued." Powell also indicated uncertainty regarding future interest rate cuts, describing the central bank's position as a "challenging situation." Major indices in Australia, Japan, and South Korea saw losses, though South Korean defense stocks gained following U.S. commitments to supply NATO. The market sentiment reflects caution among investors in response to the central bank's assessment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democrat Adelita Grijalva won a special election in Arizona's 7th Congressional District, succeeding her late father, Raul Grijalva, and reducing the Republican majority in the House of Representatives. Her victory over Republican Daniel Butierez in the heavily Democratic, Hispanic-majority district was widely anticipated. With this result, the Republican control of the House now stands at 219-214, with two other seats remaining vacant. Grijalva campaigned on a platform opposing President Trump's agenda and becomes Arizona's first Latina member of Congress, vowing to fight for progressive policies.</p>

          <p>A United Nations spokesperson stated that an escalator carrying President Trump and the First Lady stopped due to a built-in safety mechanism, likely triggered by a videographer from the U.S. delegation. This explanation came after the White House suggested the incident might have been intentional, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling for an investigation. The incident, along with a malfunctioning teleprompter during his speech, was used by Trump to criticize the UN's perceived incompetence. The Secret Service is reportedly looking into the matter, though UN officials maintain the technical issues were not deliberate.</p>

It also refutes the claim that children receive 80 "horse-sized" vaccine shots, noting the actual number is around 30 doses by age 18.

The parade is presented as a collective declaration of resilience and unity, intended to help citizens transcend personal anxieties by connecting with a larger national narrative.

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has dismantled a massive, illegal telecommunications network in the New York area that posed a significant threat to the city's infrastructure and the UN General Assembly. Investigators seized over 100,000 SIM cards and 300 servers from multiple locations, which were capable of sending 30 million texts per minute and could have disabled cell towers. The network was reportedly used for encrypted communications by foreign governments, organized crime gangs, and drug cartels. The investigation began after telephonic threats were made to senior U.S. officials, and while no arrests have been made, the immediate threat has been neutralized.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical analysis of China's five-year plans, which have been a central pillar of its macroeconomic policy since 1953, despite the country's shift away from a command economy. These plans have guided China's transformation from a nation with limited industrial capacity into the "world's factory." The article traces the trajectory of these foundational documents, highlighting key milestones from the first plan's focus on heavy industry to the current ambition of becoming a global innovation hub. The upcoming 15th five-year plan is expected to be crucial in advancing China's position in cutting-edge technological sectors.</p>

          <p>Nexstar Media Group announced it will continue to preempt "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC-affiliated stations, following a similar decision by Sinclair Broadcast Group. Both major television station owners had pulled the show last week after host Jimmy Kimmel's controversial comments regarding the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. This collective action means the late-night program will not air in dozens of markets across the U.S. despite ABC lifting its nationwide suspension. Nexstar stated it will monitor the show's content while focusing on local programming, pending assurances of respectful dialogue.</p>

          <p>Health agencies and experts from around the world are pushing back against the Trump administration's assertion of a link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy and autism. Major regulatory bodies in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Australia have all issued statements confirming there is no new scientific evidence to support the claim, reiterating that the medication remains a safe option for pain and fever during pregnancy. The World Health Organization also stated the evidence remains inconsistent. This international consensus directly contradicts the announcement made by President Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F.

          <p>A jury in Florida has found Ryan Routh guilty on all five charges related to the attempted assassination of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump at a golf course in September 2024. Routh, who represented himself, was apprehended after a Secret Service agent spotted him with a rifle before he could fire a shot. Following the verdict, Routh attempted to stab himself in the neck with a pen before being subdued by U.S. marshals. He now faces a potential life sentence for the attack, which was the second assassination attempt against Trump that year.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent address at the United Nations General Assembly highlights a dramatic shift in his relationship with the global community since he was last laughed at on the same stage. This analytical article posits that Trump has actively worked to upend the post-WWII global order, antagonizing allies while aligning with authoritarians. His speech prioritized national sovereignty and a transactional foreign policy, dismissing climate change and multilateralism. This unapologetically "America First" approach has forced allies to recalibrate their strategies, as the U.S. increasingly acts as a lone power rather than a global leader.</p>

          <p>The phone spyware scandal in Greece, dubbed "Greece's Watergate," is advancing as four individuals face misdemeanor charges in court related to the marketing of Predator spyware. The software was used to target government ministers, military officers, and journalists, with simultaneous surveillance conducted by Greece's National Intelligence Service (EYP). Despite the prime minister placing the EYP under his direct control and subsequent resignations, no government officials have been charged, leading to accusations of a cover-up. Critics, including a European Parliament committee, argue the government has actively worked to conceal the truth and stifle scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults in the UK are unable to afford to move out of their parents' homes due to the rising cost of living, not just high rent or property prices. A report suggests that for nine out of ten young adults living at home, the costs of running a household—including utilities, council tax, and insurance—would consume nearly half of their income. The article highlights the story of a 21-year-old who had to move back in with her parents after her savings were depleted by these expenses. This trend reflects a significant financial barrier to independence for a generation facing high costs on lower wages.</p>

George's journey is highlighted as unusual for a Chelsea youth player, as he has broken into the first team without a loan spell, a result of intense personal training from a young age.

The discovery was made after investigators located a grave marked "Unknown Woman 1946" at a local cemetery. The remains will now undergo advanced forensic testing, offering hope that after nearly 80 years, the victim's identity can finally be restored.</p>
