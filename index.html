          <h2>Scientific Community Challenges Trump's Claim Linking Tylenol to Autism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 04:09:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump recently asserted that Tylenol use during pregnancy causes autism, a claim he announced alongside Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who also has a history of promoting debunked theories. This assertion is strongly refuted by the scientific community, which points to extensive studies showing no causal link, only a minimal increase in risk. Experts emphasize that autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder likely influenced by polygenetic risks and environmental factors, not a single medication ingredient. The medical consensus highlights that current diagnostic increases are due to evolving definitions and awareness, not a new cause, with advocates criticizing the statements as anti-science and unhelpful for autistic individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union and Indonesia have concluded a free trade pact after over nine years of negotiations, a process notably expedited by former US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff policies. The Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) and an Investment Protection Agreement were signed in Bali, aiming to eliminate most tariffs on EU exports, including car parts, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals, while opening investment in sectors like electric vehicles. This landmark deal is expected to boost jobs and growth, securing critical raw materials for Europe's clean tech industries, and is considered a significant milestone to mitigate global tariff war risks. It represents the EU's third such agreement with a Southeast Asian nation.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has extended its production suspension until at least October 1st, following a cyber attack in late August that forced a shutdown of its IT networks. Business and industry ministers are visiting JLR to address the crisis and support the beleaguered carmaker's supply chain, where fears are growing that suppliers could face bankruptcy without assistance. The company acknowledges the difficult time for all stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, and employees, as the disruption continues to impact operations across its UK facilities. Government officials are acutely aware of the financial hit to suppliers and staff, emphasizing that their priorities are to get JLR back online and ensure the long-term health of the supply chain.</p>

A significant challenge for the UN is its ongoing financial crisis, with a $2.4 billion shortfall in regular budget dues, impacting its credibility and ability to provide essential services and aid, particularly in war-torn areas. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is also among the many heads of government scheduled to address the summit, highlighting diverse global issues and the organization's fight for relevance.</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish renewables company Orsted surged after a U.S. judge granted a preliminary injunction, allowing the firm to resume construction of its nearly completed Revolution Wind project off the coasts of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Trump administration had halted the offshore wind farm, reflecting the President's hardline stance against the wind power industry and his championship of America's oil and gas industries. This court victory provides a significant reprieve for Orsted, whose stock had recently hit a record low, enabling the continuation of a key renewable energy initiative. The company announced it would restart work on the project as soon as possible, marking a positive development for clean energy.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England has launched "Jess's Rule," an initiative urging GPs to "think again" if a sick patient presents with worsening symptoms or no diagnosis after three appointments. Named after Jessica Brady, who died of advanced cancer at 27 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid due to her age, the rule aims to improve patient safety. Health Secretary Wes Streeting described her death as a "preventable tragedy," emphasizing that this guidance encourages doctors to consider further tests, second opinions, or specialist referrals to catch potentially deadly illnesses earlier. The Royal College of General Practitioners supports this best practice to avoid similar oversights.</p>

          <p>Copenhagen and Oslo airports were temporarily closed due to drone sightings, impacting around 20,000 passengers in Denmark and causing significant flight delays and cancellations. Danish police, activating armed forces, described the drones as likely flown by a "capable operator" without confirmed intent to cause harm, and chose not to shoot them down due to safety risks. While Ukrainian President Zelenskyy referenced "Russia's violation" of NATO airspace in Copenhagen, Danish police stated no immediate link between the incidents in Norway and Denmark could be confirmed. The closures highlight ongoing security concerns in Northern Europe regarding unidentified aerial activity, prompting investigations into the origin and purpose of the drone flights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Mike Freelander, a paediatrician with nearly 40 years of experience, strongly refutes claims linking paracetamol (Tylenol) use during pregnancy to autism, calling President Trump's recent comments "very worrying." He emphasizes that while autism is complex and increasing diagnoses reflect better detection, no scientific evidence supports a causal link, with the largest recent studies disproving it. Freelander stresses that paracetamol remains a safe and crucial medication for pregnant women, and alternative medications are less safe for the fetus. He urges trust in regulatory frameworks like Australia's TGA, which base advice on rigorous scientific evidence, warning against unscientific health policy.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed an industrial-scale black market for Premier League tickets, where unauthorized resale websites exploit fans with exorbitant prices or non-functional tickets. James, a South Korean fan, traveled 5,500 miles to Brighton only to be turned away after paying £900 for a deactivated ticket. Brighton Football Club is actively combating this illegal practice using new technologies and a dedicated tickets investigation officer, blocking hundreds of touted tickets per match. The Premier League is also introducing encrypted barcodes for digital ticketing to make touting more difficult, aiming to protect genuine supporters from fraud.</p>

He highlighted the increased risk of misunderstanding capabilities due to rapid advancements in AI and cyberspace. Smith stressed the importance of starting conversations about nuclear weapons to avoid accidental conflict, despite Beijing often downplaying its nuclear strength.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding to UCLA, ruling that the government likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The administration had frozen $584 million in grants over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action, but provided only generalized explanations for the cuts. This ruling follows a previous order that restored $81 million in National Science Foundation grants to UCLA, with the judge finding the funding freeze amounted to illegal retaliation. The decision ensures the continuation of hundreds of critical medical research grants, including studies into Parkinson's disease treatment, cancer recovery, and cell regeneration.</p>

          <p>Modern football is increasingly adopting tactics championed by former manager Sam Allardyce, challenging the recent emphasis on possession-based play. Allardyce, known as "Big Sam," observes a return to direct football, utilizing big strikers for flick-ons and prioritizing forward passes, a style for which his Bolton Wanderers side was heavily criticized years ago. Coaches like PSG's Luis Enrique are even watching from the stands, a practice Allardyce pioneered for a better overview. The article highlights a shift away from playing out from the back due to "damaging stats" and a renewed focus on set-pieces, an area where Allardyce's Sunderland famously excelled.</p>

The deals are a fresh blow to US farmers, who have missed billions in sales to China due to ongoing trade tensions and low prices, with China yet to purchase any US soybean cargoes from its autumn harvest.
