          <p>Insurance giant Allianz has confirmed a significant cyberattack targeting its North American life insurance division, Allianz Life. The breach occurred when hackers used social engineering to access a third-party cloud system, compromising the personally identifiable information of a majority of the company's 1.4 million customers, as well as financial professionals and some employees. The company stated it took immediate action to contain the incident, notified the FBI, and is contacting affected individuals. Allianz assured that its main network and policy administration systems were not accessed during the attack.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant political event, Taiwanese voters have rejected an attempt to recall 24 lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party. The result is seen as a setback for President Lai Ching-te's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to regain a parliamentary majority. The recall was initiated by civic groups following legislative moves by the KMT and its allies to expand parliamentary powers, which critics argued were overly pro-China. The KMT framed the outcome as a public desire for stability over political infighting.</p>

          <p>Intense fighting between Thailand and Cambodia has entered its third day, resulting in at least 33 deaths and the displacement of over 168,000 people. Both nations are trading accusations over who initiated the fresh artillery and gunfire exchanges near several border villages. The conflict, stemming from a long-disputed border, has prompted international calls for a ceasefire, with the UN Security Council urging the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to mediate. Human Rights Watch has also raised concerns over the use of cluster munitions and the impact on civilians.</p>

The article profiles several of these teenagers, who describe their moral objections to the conflict and the personal costs of their activism.

          <p>As the White House moves to release grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein, legal experts caution that the documents may not contain the explosive revelations many expect. Grand jury transcripts are often focused on establishing probable cause for specific charges and may not detail a wider network of potential co-conspirators or clients. Attorneys who have represented Epstein's victims argue that more significant information likely exists in unreleased FBI interview summaries and internal Justice Department memos. The push for transparency comes as the Trump administration faces intense political pressure over its handling of the case.</p>

          <h2>New Legislation Encourages More Employers to Offer Student Loan Repayment Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 09:59:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A provision in the recent "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" that makes employer contributions to student loan repayments permanently tax-free is encouraging more companies to offer this benefit. The act allows employers to contribute up to $5,250 annually toward an employee's student loans without it being taxed, a measure that was previously temporary. As federal loan repayment options narrow, workplace benefits are becoming a more critical lifeline for workers burdened by debt. This development is seen as a key tool for companies to attract and retain talent. (not investment advice)</p>

Krynina records interviews with prisoners, delivers parcels, and aims to show Russians the reality of the war.

          <p>China has released a global action plan for artificial intelligence, advocating for international cooperation on development and regulation, just days after the U.S. announced its own AI strategy. Speaking at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference, Premier Li Qiang proposed a global AI cooperation organization and emphasized China's willingness to assist other nations, particularly in the Global South. The move signals an intensifying tech race, with analysts suggesting two distinct camps are forming: a U.S.-led bloc of allies and a China-led multilateral approach, potentially involving its Belt and Road partners.</p>

          <p>The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) recently avoided a $400 million funding rescission, but its long-term future remains uncertain under the Trump administration. The program, which has saved an estimated 26 million lives since 2003, has seen its HIV prevention work and support for AIDS orphans significantly curtailed. While its funding for the current fiscal year is safe, its congressional authorization has expired, and the administration has proposed major cuts for next year. Experts worry about the program's ability to function effectively amid these disruptions and a shifting foreign aid landscape.</p>

          <p>Brazil is ramping up a novel public health initiative by releasing millions of mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria to fight the spread of dengue and other viruses. The bacteria, harmless to humans, prevent the dengue virus from replicating inside the Aedes aegypti mosquito, effectively stopping its transmission. A successful pilot program in the city of Niterói saw dengue cases plummet by 90%, prompting the government to build a massive new factory capable of producing 5 billion of these "Wolbitos" annually. The goal is to protect 140 million Brazilians over the next decade.</p>

The plan also includes efforts to evacuate critically ill children for medical treatment in the UK. This initiative comes as Israel agrees to allow such air deliveries amidst a dire humanitarian crisis, though aid groups warn airdrops are insufficient. The move coincides with growing domestic and international pressure on the UK government, including from over 220 MPs, to formally recognize a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>A Farsi-language social media account, widely believed to be linked to Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, has made inflammatory claims about Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The post alleged that Khamenei "spends most of his days either sleeping or half high on substances" while the country suffers from utility shortages. While the Mossad has not officially confirmed its connection to the account, the profile has been actively engaged in psychological warfare and information dissemination targeting the Iranian public. This includes recently claiming to know the identity of a secretively appointed Iranian military commander.</p>
