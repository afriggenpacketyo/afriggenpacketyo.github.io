          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 50% tariff on all copper imports, scheduled to take effect on August 1. This decision follows a national security assessment which highlighted copper's critical role in manufacturing defense systems, semiconductors, and other essential technologies. The United States imports nearly half of the copper it consumes, with Chile being the largest supplier. This move aims to bolster domestic production and aligns with previous tariffs placed on steel and aluminum to protect American industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that corporations should cease business activities that profit from what the author, citing a UN expert's report, describes as Israel's "economy of genocide." The piece argues that a historical precedent exists for businesses profiting from major human rights crises and names specific entities, like defense contractor Lockheed Martin, as being complicit. The author calls for corporate accountability, stating that providing weapons and technology contributes directly to the destruction occurring in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Lulu Simon, daughter of musician Paul Simon, has publicly criticized actor Richard Gere for selling her childhood home in Connecticut to developers. She claims Gere purchased the property with a promise to preserve the land but instead sold it to be demolished for nine new housing plots. In a series of social media posts, Simon expressed her anger over the broken promise and the destruction of the home where her family's pets were buried.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six agents for their conduct related to the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Pennsylvania in July 2024. The disciplinary action follows an independent Department of Homeland Security review which found the agency had become "complacent and static" and identified numerous law enforcement failures. The shooting incident resulted in the death of a firefighter, and the suspensions, ranging from 10 to 42 days, affect both supervisory and line agents.</p>

          <p>European officials have expressed a sense of "whiplash" and confusion over the Trump administration's fluctuating policy toward Ukraine. A surprise halt of military aid shipments was followed days later by President Trump's pledge of more weapons and harsh words for Putin, creating unpredictability. This lack of clear communication and consistent strategy from Washington has left key NATO allies feeling uncertain about the future of US support for Ukraine and American force posture in Europe.</p>

The author argues that the story of a Latino boy who feels alienated on Earth and finds acceptance among extraterrestrials reflects the current experiences of many Latinos in the United States. The article connects the film's themes of belonging and migration to the real-world anxieties caused by aggressive immigration enforcement and anti-immigrant rhetoric.</p>
