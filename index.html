          <p>The European Commission reported that an aircraft carrying its president, Ursula von der Leyen, experienced deliberate GPS jamming while traveling to Bulgaria. The European Union has formally accused Moscow of being responsible for the interference, which disrupts navigation systems. This incident adds to a series of similar electronic warfare accusations against Russia, raising concerns about the safety and security of air travel for high-level officials in the region. The event is currently under investigation, with further details expected to be released as they become available.</p>

          <p>Seven months into his second term, President Trump claims his policies are uplifting American workers, but many labor leaders strongly disagree, citing a hostile environment for labor. While economic indicators like wage growth and low unemployment appear positive on the surface, there is significant underlying tension. Critics point to new immigration policies that have displaced workers, uncertainty surrounding infrastructure projects, and a mass exodus of federal employees as sources of instability. The administration's actions, such as halting a major wind farm project, have fueled concerns that campaign promises to blue-collar workers are not being fulfilled.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is set to announce tighter regulations for family members of individuals granted asylum, including more stringent English language requirements and proof of sufficient funds. The government aims to overhaul what it calls a "broken" asylum system and reduce the reliance on housing migrants in hotels. These reforms also include changes to the asylum appeals process and a review of how the European Convention on Human Rights applies to immigration cases. The move comes amid criticism from the Conservative opposition, which deems the changes insufficient to address the ongoing migrant crossings in the English Channel.</p>

          <p>South Korea's defense ministry has announced the suspension of "Voice of Freedom," a military-operated radio program that broadcast propaganda and outside information into North Korea. This action is the latest in a series of measures by President Lee Jae Myung's administration aimed at de-escalating military tensions with Pyongyang. The program, which included news and K-pop music, has been on and off the air since 1962, reflecting the volatile state of inter-Korean relations. Despite these gestures from Seoul, which also include dismantling propaganda loudspeakers, North Korea has so far shown little interest in improving ties.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border, causing catastrophic damage and resulting in at least 812 deaths and over 2,500 injuries. The majority of the casualties occurred in Kunar Province, where entire villages have reportedly been destroyed, leaving many feared trapped under the rubble. The United Nations and other international agencies are coordinating immediate relief efforts, though reaching remote areas is proving difficult due to communication outages.

          <p>During a visit to Taipei, U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, referred to Taiwan as a "free country" with the "right to remain free," signaling strong congressional support. Wicker and fellow Republican Senator Deb Fischer met with Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te to discuss the island's needs and reiterate America's commitment to its security. The visit and Wicker's remarks drew a sharp rebuke from China, which considers Taiwan part of its territory and opposes any official exchanges between the U.S. and the self-governing island. The trip highlights ongoing tensions in the region and the delicate diplomatic balance the U.S. maintains.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has agreed to a £55 million deal to acquire forward Yoane Wissa from Brentford, following the player's public statement urging his club to allow the move. The deal, which includes an initial £50 million fee plus £5 million in add-ons, comes as Newcastle seeks to bolster its attack, especially after agreeing to sell striker Alexander Isak to Liverpool for a British record fee. Wissa, who turns 29 this week, accused Brentford of unfairly blocking his transfer despite receiving fair offers. The move marks a significant step for Newcastle in the final hours of the transfer window.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has withdrawn its subpoena for former special counsel Robert Mueller to testify, according to a committee spokesperson. The decision was made after learning that Mueller is battling Parkinson's disease, a condition that his family confirmed to The New York Times, which precludes him from appearing before Congress. Committee Chairman James Comer had sought Mueller's testimony as part of an investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein files, focusing on the period when Mueller served as FBI director from 2001 to 2013. The committee believed he possessed information relevant to its inquiry into the FBI's handling of the Epstein case.</p>

The scheme now offers 30 hours of funded childcare per week for children from nine months old, a move the government says will save families thousands. However, the rollout is facing challenges, including long waiting lists and staff shortages at nurseries, which limit the availability of places. Campaign groups also highlight that the term "free" is misleading, as many parents face extra charges for consumables, creating a "tussle between parents and providers."</p>

          <p>A former chief detective from the Chicago Police Department has criticized no-cash bail policies, arguing they allow criminals to terrorize communities without constraints. This comes after President Trump signed an executive order to ban the practice, specifically citing Chicago as a city negatively impacted by such reforms. The police veteran, Eugene Roy, contends that laws like Illinois' SAFE-T Act are exploited by "professional" criminals and have a demoralizing effect on law enforcement officers. The article highlights several cases where individuals released without cash bail allegedly went on to commit further violent crimes, fueling the debate over criminal justice reform.</p>

It cites the deployment of military vehicles in Washington, threats to withhold funding from universities, politicized FBI actions, and investigations into media outlets as examples that deviate from democratic norms. Political scientists interviewed suggest that while the U.S. may not be a full dictatorship, it is exhibiting signs of collapsing into some form of authoritarianism. The analysis notes that Trump's performative use of military force and claims that people might want a dictator are classic tactics used by autocratic leaders.</p>

          <p>This article challenges the common characterization of President Trump as an isolationist, arguing that his actions reveal a desire to be a central global leader who solves other countries' problems. Despite "America First" rhetoric and cuts to traditional diplomatic institutions, Trump has actively engaged in negotiating peace deals and mediating international crises. His foreign policy is described as a form of "globalism stripped of any semblance of liberalism," focused on transactional deals, demonstrative military force, and meddling in other nations' politics for his own interests. The analysis concludes that he is not withdrawing from the world stage but is instead reshaping America's role.</p>

The disappointing results highlight ongoing challenges for the theater industry, including declining attendance and an overreliance on franchises that are showing signs of fatigue.

          <p>Researchers are urging health organizations to recognize Chagas disease as endemic in the United States, as the parasite that causes it is now established in California and 29 other states. The illness, transmitted by "kissing bugs," can lie dormant for years before causing life-threatening heart or digestive problems. While historically associated with Latin America, local transmission is occurring, and the parasite has been found in wildlife in areas like Los Angeles' Griffith Park. Experts argue that a lack of awareness and standardized reporting leads to significant underdiagnosis, preventing patients from receiving timely treatment that could cure the disease or halt its progression.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's threats to punish Russia over the war in Ukraine, his administration has refrained from imposing the most severe economic sanctions. Analysts suggest this hesitation is driven by two key factors: Trump's desire to be seen as a peacemaker and a strategic concern about pushing Russia further into an alliance with China. Washington fears that completely isolating Moscow would give Beijing nearly unlimited access to Russian energy, military technology, and Arctic territories, thereby strengthening China's global position. This complex geopolitical calculation appears to be tempering the U.S. response, even as Russia continues its military campaign in Ukraine without engaging in peace talks.</p>

          <p>The annual rate of house price growth in the United Kingdom slowed to 2.1% in August, matching the lowest level seen this year, according to data from lender Nationwide. This sluggishness comes as the government is reportedly considering a major overhaul of property taxes, such as stamp duty and council tax, ahead of the Autumn budget. While housing remains unaffordable for many due to high prices relative to incomes, experts suggest that further interest rate cuts could ease mortgage burdens. The potential tax reforms are viewed as a way to boost the housing market and improve mobility for homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite being strong favorites to dominate the group, the team is grappling with a significant injury crisis, with key players like Jamal Musiala and Kai Havertz unavailable. This situation provides an opportunity for younger players to join the squad under coach Julian Nagelsmann, who aims to build momentum and restore the optimism seen during Euro 2024.

          <p>ScotRail, the government-owned train operator in Scotland, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, meaning passengers will no longer pay higher prices for travel during weekday rush hours. The move is expected to result in significant savings, such as an almost 50% reduction on the Edinburgh to Glasgow route, and aims to encourage more commuters to switch from cars to trains. A previous pilot of the scheme was ended after being deemed not financially self-sustaining, but First Minister John Swinney has reintroduced it as an investment in the rail network. The annual cost, estimated at £40-£45 million, will be covered by the ScotRail budget.</p>

This breakthrough in thermoelectric conversion could lead to self-charging wearable devices, such as smartwatches, eliminating the need for bulky batteries or frequent charging. The material harnesses the temperature difference between the human body (around 37°C) and the surrounding air to generate a constant power supply. Unlike previous flexible thermoelectric materials, this new creation is also highly elastic, making it ideal for integration into wearable technology and other applications.</p>

In Texas, a new statewide ban is expected to create a more equitable and engaging classroom environment. Studies and teacher surveys from pilot programs indicate that these bans lead to increased student participation and reduced anxiety, as students are less fearful of being filmed. While many educators are supportive, the policies face challenges, including enforcement consistency, costs for solutions like locked pouches, and pushback from some students and parents concerned about communication.</p>
