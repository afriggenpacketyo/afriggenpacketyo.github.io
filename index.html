            <p>Jackson Jobe, a highly-regarded pitching prospect for the Detroit Tigers and the son of professional golfer Brandt Jobe, celebrated his inaugural major league win against the Minnesota Twins. Jobe pitched six scoreless innings, allowing only two hits and recording two strikeouts in his third start of the season. He emphasized focusing on throwing his curveball for strikes, a key adjustment that contributed to his success. The victory occurred during Masters weekend, adding a special significance as Jobe reminisced about caddying for his father at the Par 3 Contest in 2006, while the Tigers lead the American League Central division with a 9-5 record.</p>

            <p>Wera Hobhouse, a Liberal Democrat MP from Bath, was denied entry to Hong Kong and believes it was a deliberate attempt to silence her critical views on China's human rights record. Hobhouse, a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac), was detained, questioned, and deported upon arrival despite having a valid reason to visit her son and newborn grandson. She expressed disappointment and concern that China might use this incident to intimidate her and other parliamentarians from speaking out about human rights and democracy. Foreign Secretary David Lammy has pledged to address the issue with authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing, emphasizing that an MP should not be denied entry for expressing their views.</p>

            <p>In an interview, Dr. Peter Marks, former head of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, addressed the ongoing measles outbreak and the importance of vaccination. He clarified that individuals vaccinated in the early 1960s might need revaccination due to the vaccine's lower potency at the time. Dr. Marks expressed frustration with HHS Secretary Kennedy's approach to vaccines, emphasizing that the MMR vaccine is safe and effective, and that failing to clearly endorse it endangers people. He urged parents to vaccinate their children, comparing it to the responsibility of securing them in car seats, and highlighted the dangers of measles, especially for unvaccinated children.</p>

Dalio advocates for a "win-win" trade agreement with China, including yuan appreciation and addressing debt issues in both countries. He suggests Congress should reduce the federal deficit to 3% of GDP to avoid a supply-demand problem for debt, warning that a breakdown in the bond market could have severe consequences.
