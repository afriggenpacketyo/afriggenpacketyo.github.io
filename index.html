          <h2>US Crypto Regulation Bills Stall in Congress Amid Republican Disagreement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 18:30:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three major cryptocurrency regulation bills, including the Senate-passed GENIUS Act, have been stalled in the House of Representatives for a second day. Opposition from a bloc of conservative Republicans has prevented the legislation from moving forward, despite last-minute negotiations and an intervention from President Trump. The stalemate raises doubts about the Republican conference's ability to unify on crypto policy and has disappointed industry advocates who anticipated progress during the so-called "Crypto Week." The legislative deadlock highlights internal party divisions on how to approach digital asset regulation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama have jointly addressed and dismissed persistent rumors about their marriage being in trouble. Appearing on a podcast hosted by Michelle Obama and her brother, Craig Robinson, the couple used humor to counter the speculation. Michelle Obama explained that her recent absence from some public events stems from a newfound freedom to make her own choices, not marital discord. She reaffirmed her commitment to their long-standing marriage, emphasizing that they have overcome challenges together and she has become a better person through their partnership.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 18:26:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's fundraising for his future presidential library is drawing scrutiny due to the lack of transparency and regulation governing such donations. Critics, including Senate Democrats, are proposing legislation to cap contributions and require public disclosure, arguing the current system allows for potential influence peddling from special interests. The library fund has reportedly received millions from large legal settlements and is set to receive a $400 million jet from Qatar. This situation highlights a long-standing issue where presidential library fundraising operates with significantly fewer rules than political campaign financing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A powerful 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of southern Alaska, initially prompting a tsunami warning that was later downgraded to an advisory. The quake occurred about 50 miles south of Sand Point, with its shallow depth of approximately 12 miles leading to palpable shaking throughout the region. Officials confirmed a tsunami was generated but stated that large, widespread inundation was not expected, as the event occurred in shallow water. The incident serves as a reminder of the area's location along the seismically active Pacific "Ring of Fire," which experienced North America's strongest recorded earthquake in 1964.</p>

          <p>President Trump's renewed suggestion that he might fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has prompted analysts to warn of significant market instability. A research note from Wolfe Research outlines several chaotic scenarios, including potential court battles that could reach the Supreme Court to determine if the president has the authority for such a dismissal. Although Trump later downplayed the likelihood of firing Powell, his history of public criticism over interest rate policy maintains a high level of uncertainty. Experts emphasize that an independent central bank is crucial for economic stability, contrasting the U.S. with nations where political interference has led to severe inflation.

The tariff rates have been inconsistent, particularly with China, but have generally remained high on most imported goods. While many economists have predicted that these tariffs will ultimately be paid by consumers in the form of higher prices, the timeline for this impact is still unclear.

          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic explores how President Trump, after years of fueling conspiracy theories, is now struggling to control the narrative surrounding Jeffrey Epstein. By dismissing the matter as a "hoax" and disavowing supporters who pursue it, Trump is contradicting the anti-establishment persona that forms the core of his political appeal. The Epstein saga has a unique hold on the public consciousness because it combines real, horrifying crimes with a central mystery about a potential "client list" that the administration previously teased. This creates an unstable situation where Trump's attempts to shut down the story only fuel more suspicion, potentially creating a lasting rift with his base.</p>

          <h2>Landmark Study Shows 'Three-Parent' DNA Technique Prevents Inherited Disease</h2>

          <p>A groundbreaking UK study has demonstrated that creating embryos with DNA from three people can successfully prevent the transmission of devastating mitochondrial disorders. Researchers used the technique, known as mitochondrial donation, to help families have eight healthy children who are now free from the rare but often fatal genetic conditions that plagued their families for generations. The process involves transferring the nuclear DNA from the parents' fertilized egg into a donor egg with healthy mitochondria. While the results are hailed as a major advance, some critics raise ethical concerns about the long-term safety and the potential for genetic manipulation.</p>

          <h2>Trump Denounces Supporters Focusing on Epstein Case, Calling it a 'Hoax'</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump has lashed out at members of his own party and his supporters for their focus on the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, labeling the controversy a "hoax" created by Democrats. In social media posts and Oval Office remarks, Trump disavowed his "PAST supporters" who have "bought into" the story, stating he no longer wants their support. His administration has declined to release all files from the probe, with the Justice Department saying no "client list" was found. This stance has created a rare rift with some of his staunchest allies on Capitol Hill, who are continuing to push for greater transparency.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he believes China is making significant progress in its efforts to control the flow of fentanyl into the United States. Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump's positive assessment marks a shift in tone from his previous statements, where he has often used the fentanyl crisis as a justification for imposing tariffs on Chinese goods. The comments come as high-level trade negotiations continue between the two countries. The president made the remarks before signing the HALT Fentanyl Act, a bill that permanently classifies fentanyl-related substances as highly controlled drugs under U.S. law.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is considering the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. Proponents describe stablecoins as "digital dollars" that could enable faster, lower-cost transactions outside of traditional banking hours. The proposed legislation would create consumer protections and clear rules for issuers like banks and fintech companies. While designed to be less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins still carry risks, such as becoming "depegged" from their underlying asset, which has happened during past market stress.

          <p>The ex-wife of a UC Berkeley marketing professor, Przemyslaw Jeziorski, has been arrested in connection with his murder in Athens, Greece. Jeziorski was fatally shot five times on July 4 while walking to his ex-wife's home to see their children, with whom he was in a difficult custody dispute. Greek authorities also arrested three other suspects—two Albanian nationals and a Bulgarian man—who allegedly assisted the ex-wife's companion in carrying out the shooting. Jeziorski was a tenured professor at the Haas School of Business for 13 years and was considered a leading expert in quantitative marketing and digital economics.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported a group of men from five different countries to the southern African nation of Eswatini. A Department of Homeland Security official described the men as "uniquely barbaric," with convictions for serious crimes including murder and child sexual assault, and stated their home countries refused to accept them. This action represents an expansion of the controversial U.S. policy of deporting non-citizens to third countries that are not their own. The government of Eswatini, a monarchy with a poor human rights record, confirmed it has taken the men into custody and will work to repatriate them.</p>
