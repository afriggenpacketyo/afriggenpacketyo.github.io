          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has officially endorsed Representative Chip Roy for Texas Attorney General in the 2026 election, praising Roy's conservative values and extensive service. Roy, who previously served as Cruz's chief of staff, announced his candidacy to replace Ken Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate. Cruz highlighted Roy's commitment to the Constitution and his record of fighting for Texas, expressing full confidence in his ability to lead the Attorney General's Office. Roy aims to defend Texas from perceived threats like open-border politicians and radical leftists.</p>

          <p>China’s top envoy in Washington, Xie Feng, has dismissed claims that Chinese ownership of US farmland poses a national security threat as "completely unfounded." Speaking at a soybean industry event, Xie stated that Chinese investors own less than 0.03% of total US farmland. He argued that restricting such ownership is a political manipulation tactic aimed at disrupting China-US agricultural cooperation. The ambassador emphasized that these claims are baseless and serve individual agendas rather than genuine security concerns.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker criticized President Donald Trump's plan to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago, calling it an abuse of power and an attempt to manufacture a crisis. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson also expressed "grave concerns," stating such a deployment would be uncoordinated, uncalled for, and could escalate tensions. This move follows similar deployments in Washington D.C., where troops were recently armed, as part of Trump's broader crackdown on crime in Democrat-controlled cities. Critics argue the intervention is unpopular and unnecessary, given local crime reduction efforts.</p>

          <p>Pierce Brosnan, starring as Ron in the Netflix adaptation of Richard Osman's "Thursday Murder Club" series, expressed significant nerves about fan reception due to the books' immense popularity. Brosnan, alongside Helen Mirren, Celia Imrie, and Ben Kingsley, portrays one of the amateur sleuths in the film. Despite initial doubts about his casting, Brosnan and his co-stars enjoyed the set, with critics offering mixed reviews, some praising its charm while others found it flimsy. The film will have a limited cinematic release before streaming.</p>

          <p>On Ukraine's Independence Day, Russian officials reported a fire extinguished at the Kursk nuclear power plant after a Ukrainian drone attack damaged a transformer, with radiation levels remaining normal. The UN's IAEA has urged restraint around nuclear facilities amidst the ongoing conflict. The UK affirmed its support for Ukraine, extending military training until 2026. This incident occurs as diplomatic efforts, including a recent Trump-Putin summit, have failed to secure a peace deal, with both sides blaming each other for stalled negotiations.</p>

          <p>An Oklahoma couple, Dustin and Cherie Walker, face felony child neglect charges after their 11-year-old daughter gave birth to a full-term baby at home without medical assistance.

The district attorney anticipates further charges, awaiting paternity test results.

          <p>The UK's parliamentary e-petitions system, celebrating its 10th anniversary, continues to attract public engagement, with 57% of people signing petitions annually. While some campaigns, like "Finn's Law" for police dogs, have led to legislative change, many serious and humorous petitions often receive standard government responses without direct action. Critics argue the system provides an "illusion of a feedback loop," but supporters, including Committee Chair Jamie Stone, maintain it's a vital "bridge between the public and Parliament" for setting agendas and applying pressure.</p>

          <p>Sydney Brown began receiving "preventative botox" at 23, with her plastic surgeon mother administering injections to address a frown line and boost confidence. This trend among younger adults aims to prevent wrinkles before they deepen, though experts like Nora Nugent of BAAPS advise against starting too early, calling it a waste of money. Concerns also exist about peer pressure, mental health impacts, and potential long-term complications or tolerance buildup from early, unregulated cosmetic treatments. Daily sunscreen and accredited practitioners are recommended for skin health and safety.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced he would swiftly sign a contentious GOP redistricting bill into law after its passage by the state Senate. The Republican-backed plan aims to redraw Texas's congressional map, creating five new GOP-leaning districts to secure a Republican majority in the 2026 midterm elections, a move endorsed by former President Trump. Democrats vow to challenge the map in court, arguing it dilutes minority voting power and undermines fair representation. This follows a two-week walkout by Texas House Democrats to block the bill.</p>

          <p>Israeli strikes and shootings in Gaza killed at least 33 people, including those sheltering in tents or seeking food, as a famine declaration for Gaza City by the IPC intensified global pressure for a ceasefire.

Ceasefire efforts are stalled as mediators await Israel's response to Hamas's proposal.

          <p>Lt. General Jeffrey Kruse has been ousted as Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) director, with no official reason provided, leading to concerns about politicization within the intelligence community. This firing follows the DIA's preliminary assessment that military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities only set back its program by months, contradicting President Trump's public claims of "total obliteration" and "decades" of setback. Two other senior military officials were also removed from their posts without consultation from top military leaders, further fueling anxieties about loyalty tests over national security.</p>

          <p>The US immigrant population has declined by over a million people since President Donald Trump took office in January, marking the first such drop in 50 years, according to a Pew Research Center study. The number fell from a record 53.3 million to 51.9 million by June, with 750,000 immigrant workers leaving the labor force. This decline is attributed to Trump's 181 executive actions targeting immigration and border restrictions, though declining survey response rates among immigrants may also be a factor. Mexico remains the largest origin country, but its share of the US immigrant population has decreased.</p>

          <p>At Marineland Antibes, a closed French marine zoo, a male orca named Keijo is being sexually stimulated by trainers to prevent inbreeding with his mother, Wikie. This unusual practice arises from an impasse over rehoming the orcas following a French law banning marine zoo shows by December. Activists question the necessity and ethics, with some suggesting semen collection for breeding in countries with less strict laws, a claim Marineland denies. The situation highlights ongoing animal welfare concerns and the difficulties of rehoming large marine animals.</p>

As one of the first Russian visitors, she described almost-empty, immaculate beaches, but also strict rules, constant surveillance by guards, and limited interaction with locals. The resort, built near a missile testing site, is part of Kim Jong Un's efforts to boost tourism, though access is primarily restricted to Russians. This controlled environment aims to prevent North Koreans from comparing their lives to wealthier foreigners.</p>
