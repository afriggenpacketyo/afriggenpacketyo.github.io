          <p>Meta is aggressively pursuing AI talent, reportedly attempting to acquire Ilya Sutskever's Safe Superintelligence and later targeting its CEO, Daniel Gross, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman after the acquisition failed. Meta will also get a stake in NFDG, Gross and Friedman's venture capital firm, as part of the deal, with both men joining Meta to work on AI products. This move is part of a broader AI talent war among major tech companies like Meta, Google, and OpenAI, all vying to develop advanced large language models and achieve artificial general intelligence. The competition includes offering substantial signing bonuses and compensation packages to lure top AI engineers and researchers. (not investment advice) Optimism in the industry remains relatively high as companies continue to invest in AI research and development, suggesting that technological advancement is still possible.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick, which made landfall in Mexico's Oaxaca state as a Category 3 hurricane, has weakened to a tropical storm, leaving flooded streets and damaged infrastructure. Although wind speeds have decreased, officials are still cautioning about the risk of life-threatening flooding and mudslides, particularly in areas with steep terrain. While there have been no immediate reports of deaths, two hospitals have been damaged, and over 123,000 users in Oaxaca experienced power outages, some of whom have had service restored. The storm underscores the importance of disaster preparedness and infrastructure resilience in coastal regions prone to extreme weather events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Maternity services at two Leeds hospitals have been downgraded to "inadequate" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) due to significant risks to women and babies. Concerns from staff and patients about the quality of care and staffing levels were substantiated during unannounced inspections at Leeds Teaching Hospitals (LTH) NHS Trust. The CQC found breaches related to risk management, safety, and infection control, with staff reluctant to raise concerns due to a perceived blame culture. Families who experienced inadequate care, including those whose babies suffered avoidable injury or death, have expressed their concerns; in response, LTH stated it is committed to improving its maternity and neonatal services, but families have been urging the Health Secretary to hold a national inquiry into maternity safety. This situation underscores the importance of continuous improvement and oversight in healthcare settings.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate reached 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, increasing pressure on the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to raise interest rates. The figure exceeded economists' expectations and is above the BOJ's 2% target, marking the 38th consecutive month of inflation exceeding this benchmark. Despite the rising inflation, the BOJ has maintained its interest rates at 0.5%, while Governor Kazuo Ueda has indicated that the central bank will continue to raise rates once underlying inflation is convincingly near 2%. (not investment advice) These economic indicators suggest that Japan's central bank may face increasing pressure to adjust its monetary policy in the near future.</p>

          <p>The UK's potential involvement in the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel is being examined, particularly if the US decides to take military action against Iran's nuclear program. Despite calling for de-escalation, the UK's role is limited, but it still has diplomatic and military assets in the Middle East. The UK's strategic assets, such as the Diego Garcia island base and RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, could play a role in supporting US operations. The UK government has been advised that any military involvement must be defensive to comply with the law, highlighting the delicate balance between international alliances and legal constraints.</p>

          <p>The White House stated that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in "a couple of weeks" once given the go-ahead from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

While the US intelligence community has assessed that Iran is not currently building a nuclear bomb, the White House emphasizes the potential for rapid weaponization if the supreme leader makes that decision.
