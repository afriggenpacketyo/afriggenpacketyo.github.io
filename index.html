        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent strikes on Iranian nuclear sites have ignited debate in Congress regarding war powers. While some Republicans, like Speaker Mike Johnson, argue the strikes are justified under the president's commander-in-chief authority, Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, criticize Trump for bypassing congressional approval. Jeffries also expressed concern that the administration is withholding information from Congress regarding the rationale behind the strikes and the imminent threat posed by Iran. Several war powers resolutions have been introduced to reassert Congress's constitutional role in authorizing military action, though their passage remains uncertain given the current political climate. Optimism is low given the divided reactions and the lack of transparency surrounding the strikes.</p>

          <p>Following a week of escalating aerial attacks, President Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran. The agreement includes two 12-hour ceasefire periods before the war is over. This announcement came after Iran launched a missile attack on the United Statesâ€™ Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which was a response to the U.S. strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran. The U.S. military used B-2 bombers to drop 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs on Iranian nuclear sites, causing monumental damage according to Trump, though a full battle damage assessment is still pending.</p>

          <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has contacted Tesla following reports and social media videos of its robotaxis operating erratically in Austin, Texas. These incidents include vehicles traveling the wrong way and braking abruptly in traffic. Tesla recently launched its autonomous trips in Austin, limiting the service to invited riders only as part of an early access program. The agency is gathering additional information and will investigate potential safety defects, as it does not pre-approve new technologies but holds automakers responsible for meeting federal safety standards. The launch has been met with mixed reactions, with some praising Tesla's innovation while others point out that Musk's earlier promises of full autonomy have not been fulfilled.</p>

          <p>Florida's Operation Dragon Eye, a collaborative effort involving 20 agencies, has rescued dozens of critically missing children from child sexual assault operations. The operation, spearheaded by the U.S. Marshals Office and supported by the state Attorney General's Office, focused on locating 60 at-risk children and apprehending suspects involved in trafficking, drugs, and child endangerment. The rescued children, ranging in age from 9 to 17, received immediate medical and psychological support, with long-term care protocols implemented. Authorities arrested eight individuals on various charges, including human trafficking and drug-related offenses, with the investigation ongoing and additional charges possible. The operation underscores Florida's commitment to combating sex trafficking, which remains a significant problem in the state.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries they are not from, including conflict-ridden areas. This decision pauses a lower court ruling that required immigrants to have a meaningful opportunity to challenge their deportation to these third-party countries. Justice Sotomayor dissented, accusing the court of rewarding lawlessness and disregarding the due process rights of the immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security hailed the decision as a victory, while immigrant rights groups condemned it as stripping away critical protections against torture and death. The case highlights the ongoing legal battles over Trump-era immigration policies and the rights of migrants facing deportation.</p>

          <p>RBN Energy executive Rusty Braziel believes Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial oil shipping passage, despite recent tensions with the U.S. He argues that closing the strait would harm Iran's own exports, as the country ships 1.7 million barrels a day through it. Braziel notes that the market appears to agree, as oil prices dropped on Monday. He also warned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China could damage the U.S.'s reputation as a trustworthy energy supplier, potentially impacting future trade relations. This comes after the U.S. attack on Iran's key nuclear sites, raising concerns about potential disruptions to oil supplies.</p>

          <p>Florida will receive federal funding to construct immigration detention centers, including a controversial proposed site in the Everglades dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that FEMA will largely fund the project.

This initiative reflects a broader effort by Republican-led states to support the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign.

          <p>Vets and animal charities report an increase in pet owners euthanizing their animals or delaying necessary treatments due to escalating veterinary bills. Many blame corporate acquisitions of practices for the price hikes, leaving some owners unable to afford care. Animal welfare charities are experiencing a surge in applications for financial assistance, and some pet owners are giving up their animals or foregoing future pet ownership altogether. The British Veterinary Association acknowledges rising costs but emphasizes that fees reflect the prices businesses need to charge to remain viable. The Competition and Markets Authority is investigating whether a lack of competition in the veterinary sector is contributing to the issue.</p>

Diplomatic sources suggest that the counterattack was expected and calibrated, with U.S. and Qatari officials preparing in advance. This echoes Iran's 2020 strikes on a U.S. military base in Iraq, where advance notice was also given.

          <h2>Trump's High-Risk Iran Strikes May Pay Off If Retaliation Ends</h2>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran retaliated with missile attacks on a U.S. base in Qatar. President Trump downplayed the response as weak and claimed a ceasefire had been agreed upon, but neither Iran nor Israel have commented on the ceasefire. He expressed hope that Iran would now pursue peace in the region. This scenario suggests that Trump's risky maneuver might yield positive outcomes if further escalation is avoided and negotiations become possible. The situation echoes a similar event in 2020, where the U.S. chose not to escalate after Iran retaliated for the killing of Qasem Soleimani.</p>

          <p>The US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and Dr Mehmet Oz announced a voluntary agreement with insurance companies to reform prior authorization practices, where private health insurers require patients to seek permission before receiving medical treatment. The agreement aims to standardize the approval process, deliver decisions faster, reduce the number of procedures and drugs subject to prior authorization, and increase transparency. However, similar pledges have been made in the past without significant improvements. The announcement comes as Republicans push a bill expected to result in millions losing health insurance. Skepticism remains about the effectiveness of voluntary measures without legislative backing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military strikes in Iran are raising questions about the impact on supplies of oil and gas, including whether the widening conflict could result in higher energy prices for Americans. Although Wall Street experts predict that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, they note that ongoing tensions in the region could disrupt the energy market and send prices soaring. Analysts suggest that a closure of the Strait of Hormuz could lead to a significant spike in oil prices, potentially reaching $130 per barrel. American drivers are likely to see higher gas prices at the pump over the next week, with prices jumping between 10 cents and 15 cents a gallon. (not investment advice)</p>

The move comes after the U.S. joined Israeli military strikes against Iran. Experts warn about the potential consequences of regime change, citing past failures in other countries.

          <p>President Trump's decision to launch strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities without consulting Congress has sparked debate about the legal authority of the president to initiate military action. Article I of the Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war, while Article II designates the president as Commander in Chief. Some legal experts argue that Article II gives the president the authority to use military force in certain circumstances, such as to repel attacks or advance national interests. However, others argue that Trump should have consulted Congress first, as there was no sudden attack to repel. Previous presidents have also authorized military actions without congressional approval, leading to ongoing debate about the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches.</p>

          <p>Pixar's latest film, "Elio," experienced the lowest opening weekend in the studio's history, grossing $21 million in the U.S. and Canada. Analysts attribute the disappointing performance to the challenges faced by original animated films in attracting audiences, competition from other family-friendly movies, and potentially ineffective marketing. Despite positive reviews, "Elio" struggled to stand out in a crowded summer movie season. Disney remains hopeful that the film will find an audience through word-of-mouth and its eventual release on Disney+.

Instead, China's approach would likely involve quiet negotiations and prioritizing its own interests.
