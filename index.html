Ford has announced some vehicle price increases, specifically on those imported from Mexico, which they attribute to a combination of seasonal adjustments and tariff impacts.

          <p>The National Weather Service is facing severe staffing shortages as the Atlantic hurricane season begins, raising concerns among meteorologists about the accuracy and reliability of forecasts. Due to federal spending cuts, the agency has lost a significant portion of its workforce, impacting local forecast offices and the National Hurricane Center. While NOAA plans to fill some critical vacancies, many offices remain understaffed, potentially hindering their ability to provide timely warnings and support during severe weather events. The situation is described as "uncharted territory," with fears of increased errors and oversights due to employee fatigue.</p>

          <p>Susan Choi's new novel, *Flashlight*, follows a family's migrations and explores the theme of mobility, handling anger in a different way than her previous work. In contrast to *Trust Exercise*, where anger was a dominant mood, *Flashlight* presents it as a tunnel characters travel through. Choi's protagonists find that anger is impermanent and that letting it go allows other emotions, such as love and hope, to emerge. The novel examines how individuals cope with and move beyond anger in the face of difficult circumstances.</p>
