          <p>India's central bank exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022, marking the third consecutive rate cut since February. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and slower growth amidst global uncertainty as reasons for the move. The decision followed a better-than-expected 7.4% GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, though the RBI maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. Despite the rate cut, the RBI shifted its monetary policy stance to neutral due to limited room for further support, carefully assessing incoming data to balance growth and inflation.

          <p>Four individuals, including an official from the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) cricket team, were arrested in Bengaluru following a deadly stampede during a victory celebration. The RCB offered free tickets to a trophy event at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, attracting an unexpectedly large crowd of 200,000-300,000 people, far exceeding the stadium's 35,000 capacity. The resulting crush led to 11 deaths and 47 injuries, prompting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to describe the incident as "heartrending". State officials have taken legal action against RCB representatives, event organizers, and the state cricket association, with the accused facing charges of culpable homicide, raising questions about fan safety at Indian Premier League events.</p>

          <p>The government has implemented new regulations banning six water companies from awarding bonuses to senior executives due to failures in meeting environmental and consumer standards. The ban applies to Anglian Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, United Utilities, Wessex Water, and Yorkshire Water, backdated to April 2024. This action empowers Ofwat to reclaim bonuses already paid or impose enforcement measures, covering both cash and share awards. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized that profiting from pollution is over, while acknowledging the need for water firms to rebuild trust with customers, closely monitoring any attempts to circumvent the ban through base salary increases.</p>

However, tensions arose over Trump's spending bill, which Musk criticized for increasing the national debt, leading to a public exchange of insults and Musk's departure from the White House. The feud escalated with Musk suggesting Trump's involvement in unreleased Jeffrey Epstein files, highlighting a bitter conclusion to their alliance.</p>

          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is causing producer prices to remain in deflationary territory, leading to a potential "China shock" as the country floods global markets with cheap exports. While this is raising concerns in Asia about local industries being squeezed, economists suggest that it could offer a silver lining for inflation-hit economies by lowering consumer costs. This influx of low-cost Chinese goods may provide central banks some relief as they work to balance reducing living costs with reviving growth amidst rising trade tensions. Nomura predicts that this situation may lead to more rate cuts across Asia, as central banks decouple from the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

The 5,000-ton warship, intended to be a symbol of North Korea's naval modernization, suffered a launch malfunction that caused the stern to slide prematurely into the water. Leader Kim Jong Un deemed the incident a "criminal act" and ordered swift repairs before the upcoming plenary session of the ruling Workers’ Party. Analysts were surprised by the quick action to refloat the ship, which apparently involved using aerostatic balloons attached to the hull.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces conducted airstrikes in southern Beirut on the eve of Eid Al Adha, targeting what they claimed was a Hezbollah unit producing drones underground. The attack occurred despite a ceasefire that had been in effect for the past six months. The IDF stated the unit was funded by "Iranian terrorists," prompting evacuation warnings for several buildings in the area. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned the strikes as a "flagrant violation of an international accord," generating renewed panic and fear on the eve of the religious holiday.</p>

          <p>Japanese startup ispace Inc. failed in its second attempt to become the first private firm in Asia to achieve a controlled lunar landing. The Resilience lander, after beginning its descent from lunar orbit, likely crashed on the moon's surface due to its inability to decelerate to the required speed. CEO Takeshi Hakamada apologized for the outcome and stated the company will analyze the cause of the failure and attempt another landing in 2027. The mission was intended to transport a rover and equipment for experiments to the moon's northern hemisphere.</p>
