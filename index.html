          <p>The Hundred, a 100-ball cricket tournament, is set for a major transformation as private investors, including several Indian Premier League team owners, have purchased stakes in most of its teams. While the 2025 season will proceed as usual, changes are expected from 2026, potentially including team renaming, increased player salaries, and a shift from the draft system to an auction. The England and Wales Cricket Board will retain ownership of the competition but will face decisions on its format and structure as new partners exert their influence.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has refrained from setting a numerical target for a new pilot scheme to return some migrants to France, which begins today. The agreement involves the UK sending back certain small boat arrivals in exchange for accepting vetted asylum seekers directly from the continent. While the government touts the plan as a result of diplomatic efforts to control border crossings, which have risen sharply this year, critics and experts question its potential deterrent effect, suggesting the initial return numbers will be too low to make a significant impact.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Tennessee have arrested three individuals for allegedly assisting Austin Robert Drummond, the primary suspect in the murders of four relatives of an infant who was found abandoned but alive. Dearrah Sanders, Tanaka Brown, and Giovonte Thomas face charges of being an accessory after the fact to first-degree murder. The manhunt for the 28-year-old Drummond, who is considered armed and dangerous, is ongoing with a substantial reward offered for information leading to his capture. The motive is believed to be a targeted attack, as Drummond had a relationship with the family.</p>

          <p>India has responded to threats of increased U.S. tariffs by defending its purchase of Russian oil, stating it was a necessary step taken after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe. The Indian foreign ministry pointed out the irony of the U.S. and EU criticizing New Delhi while continuing their own significant trade with Russia. Citing record bilateral trade, India argues its oil imports, which it claims were encouraged by the U.S. to stabilize global energy markets, are vital for its energy security.

The zoo states this practice aims to replicate the natural food chain, ensuring the well-being and natural behavior of its lions, tigers, and other carnivores. Officials from the zoo noted that this is a common and accepted practice in Denmark, adding that the donated animals are euthanized humanely by trained staff before being fed to the predators.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes England's prospects for the upcoming Ashes cricket series in Australia, concluding that any chance of victory rests heavily on captain Ben Stokes. The team is seen as overly reliant on their all-rounder, who provides crucial balance, tactical leadership, and a competitive edge that is otherwise lacking. With a squad largely inexperienced in Australian conditions, Stokes's recovery from injury and ability to perform at his peak are deemed essential to overcome a powerful Australian bowling attack and the hostile environment, making a potential series win his "greatest miracle."</p>

          <p>Pitcher Brock Stewart, recently reacquired by the Los Angeles Dodgers at the trade deadline, had a difficult first appearance in a 3-2 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. Stewart, who was brought in to bolster a struggling bullpen, entered a tie game in the ninth inning but surrendered the go-ahead run on three hits. The loss spoiled a strong seven-inning start by Tyler Glasnow, highlighting the ongoing challenges for the Dodgers' relief corps as they navigate a competitive season.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is launching a 12-month pilot program that will require some business and leisure travelers to post a bond of $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000 to enter the country. The temporary rule targets visitors from countries with high rates of visa overstays and is intended to test the feasibility of the bond system and encourage compliance with visa terms. The State Department estimates that around 2,000 people will be affected during the pilot, which is the latest in a series of moves by the administration to tighten U.S. immigration laws.</p>

          <p>Thirty years after "Operation Storm," which effectively ended Croatia's war of independence, Croatia and Serbia maintain vastly different interpretations of the event. Croatia celebrates it as a heroic military victory that reunified its territory, holding a large military parade to mark the occasion. In contrast, Serbia views it as a "pogrom" that led to the expulsion of approximately 200,000 Serbs and numerous war crimes, for which few have been held accountable. The divergent narratives highlight the deep-seated, unresolved tensions that persist in the region three decades later.</p>

          <p>Countries are gathering in Geneva for a critical UN conference aimed at finalizing a legally binding global treaty to address the plastic pollution crisis. After two years of negotiations, no agreement has been reached on key issues, including potential caps on virgin plastic production, bans on harmful chemicals, and universal design standards to improve recycling. While a coalition of nearly 100 countries supports an ambitious treaty with production limits, they face strong opposition from oil-producing nations that favor focusing on recycling rather than reduction.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Poland's liberal democratic government, which came to power in 2023, is losing ground, with recent election results and polls suggesting a return to populism is likely. The author posits that the government of Donald Tusk has failed by adopting some of its populist predecessors' rhetoric and policies, particularly on migration and social issues, while lacking a compelling, forward-looking vision. This serves as a cautionary tale for other democracies fighting populism, which requires more than just ousting incumbents to succeed.</p>

          <p>China is developing a new, advanced airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, designated the KJ-3000. Based on a modified Y-20B transport plane, the aircraft's most notable feature is a large rotodome on its fuselage, which houses a sophisticated radar array. Recent footage of a prototype suggests Beijing remains committed to this type of surveillance platform, even as some other militaries have moved away from the design. The KJ-3000 represents the next generation of China's long-range aerial surveillance and command capabilities.</p>

          <p>In response to falling domestic beef prices and strong competition from imports, the Chinese government has announced a new plan to support its cattle industry. The policy aims to increase domestic beef production and promote consumption by implementing a quality-grading system for local products. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to strengthen key agricultural sectors and enhance the appeal of domestic farm goods, addressing an imbalance in the population's diet and tapping into potential for growth.
