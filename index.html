          <p>China has inaugurated a new-generation radio telescope in Chiang Mai, Thailand, developed in collaboration with the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand. This 13-meter radio antenna is part of a broader network designed to monitor deep space signals and track subtle shifts in the Earth‚Äôs rotation and tectonic plates. A second telescope is under construction in southern Thailand to further enhance deep-space tracking and high-precision Earth monitoring, contributing to more accurate GPS, climate research, and earthquake forecasting. The project, initiated in 2017, marks a significant milestone in scientific cooperation between China and Thailand, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries. The telescope captured its first signal in August of last year and has since completed a full 24-hour observation session, meeting expected precision benchmarks. </p>

          <p>Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) has dismissed allegations that she directed staffers to create "burner" accounts to boost her online image, labeling the claims as the product of "bitter exes" lacking real proof. Mace, who chairs the House Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation, responded to a recent Wired magazine article citing anonymous former aides and consultants who alleged she used burner accounts and automated bots to amplify her political messaging. Mace asserts that she doesn't need burner accounts to tell the truth and posts everything from her real account with her name on it, emphasizing accountability. She also highlighted her background as a self-taught computer coder, stating it gives her an edge in crafting meaningful policy focused on protecting data, cracking down on cyber threats, and pushing back against Big Tech censorship.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a "blockbuster agreement" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, claiming it will keep the steelmaker in Pittsburgh and invest billions in facilities across several states. Trump stated that Nippon would invest $14 billion in the company, including $2.2 billion to increase steel production in Pittsburgh's Mon Valley area and $7 billion to modernize steel mills and expand facilities in other states. He also announced plans to double the current 25% tariff on steel imports to 50% and promised a $5,000 bonus for every U.S. steelworker. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh and that the company would still be "controlled by the USA," although he did not specify the ownership structure.

His story is now being celebrated in a stage musical at Liverpool's Royal Court theatre. Cullen first pulled on the Speedos to swim the English Channel in 2014, despite never having had a formal swimming lesson until he booked the support boat. The musical will explore why he wanted to take on such life-affirming tasks and at what cost, highlighting his struggles with addiction and mental health. The show's writer, John Fay, describes Speedo Mick as an inspirational and charismatic man who makes people smile, while also acknowledging his human fragility.</p>

The announcement came a day after a federal appeals court allowed his tariffs to remain in effect, staying a decision by a US trade court that blocked the president from imposing the duties.

The hiker, who remained conscious, was harnessed to a 150-foot rope and lifted out by the helicopter. The rescue team determined that a helicopter extraction was necessary due to the severity of the injuries and the remote location, which would have made a timely ambulance arrival impossible.

The asset test would evaluate a person's bank accounts, cash, and other assets, including the value of their primary home, vehicle, or retirement fund.

          <p>Japan's consumer affairs center is warning consumers to beware of websites claiming to sell rice at heavily discounted prices, as complaints related to such scams have spiked since March. The National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan reports that some consumers have paid for rice but never received it, while others have received unrelated items instead. The warning comes as the average price of rice at supermarkets has risen steadily, partly due to a poor harvest, reaching a record high in mid-May. The government is attempting to curb prices by releasing rice stockpiles and selling through direct contracts.</p>

          <p>Approximately 250 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying more than 70,000 pounds of pollinator hives overturned in northern Washington state. The commercial truck hauling the honeybees overturned at about 4 a.m. in Whatcom County, Washington, which borders Canada's British Columbia. Authorities advised the public to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away, particularly those allergic to bee stings. More than two dozen beekeepers assisted with the rescue, aiming to save as many bees as possible, with efforts focused on helping the bees re-hive and find their queen bee.</p>

The article contrasts the lack of probing questions with Musk's immense power and influence over federal government, including slashing thousands of jobs and forcing the closure of entire departments. The article highlights the absence of accountability and the missed opportunity to question Musk about his alleged drug use, which was attributed to a New York Times report.</p>

The lawsuit accuses the administration of unlawfully interfering in the operations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and committing multiple violations of the First Amendment, including viewpoint discrimination and illegal retaliation. The suit alleges the administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The executive order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to "cease direct funding to NPR and PBS," claiming the two news organizations "have fueled partisanship and left-wing propaganda with taxpayer dollars."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the US will double its current tariff rate on steel and aluminium imports from 25% to 50%, starting on Wednesday. Speaking at a rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Trump said the move would help boost the local steel industry and national supply, while decreasing reliance on China. He also mentioned that $14bn would be invested into the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel. The announcement is the latest turn in Trump's rollercoaster approach to tariffs since re-entering office in January. (not investment advice)</p>

Delgado dismisses these concerns, asserting that she was simply doing her job as a lawyer and that her past should not delegitimize her candidacy. The judicial reform, which involves electing all judges in Mexico, has faced criticism for potentially politicizing the country's justice system.</p>

The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, added that the lack of rugby league knighthoods "cannot be right" when other sports have had such honors. A cross-party group of MPs suggested that the lack of top honors for stars of the sport was linked to snobbery and class prejudice.</p>
