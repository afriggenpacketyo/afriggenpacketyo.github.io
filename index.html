            <p>U.S. crude oil prices initially fell sharply after China announced retaliatory tariffs of 84% on U.S. goods. However, prices recovered, jumping over 2%, after President Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause for some countries. The market had been concerned about a potential recession triggered by a full-blown trade war, which would negatively impact crude oil demand. Talks between the U.S. and Iran regarding the latter's nuclear program could further influence the oil market. (not investment advice)</p>
