          <p>Elon Musk has intensified his criticism of President Trump's spending bill through numerous posts on X, urging followers to contact Congress and reject the bill due to its impact on the national deficit. Musk expressed frustration with the bill's spending levels and specific provisions like the cut to the electric vehicle tax credit, which Tesla opposes. Sources indicate a growing rift between Musk and the Trump administration, also stemming from AI deals with competitors like OpenAI and the withdrawal of Jared Isaacman's NASA administrator nomination. Musk's public criticism underscores his concerns about the bill's fiscal responsibility and its potential impact on American energy independence. Optimism surrounding the event is low due to the increased tension between Musk and Trump.</p>

          <p>The German government, under its new conservative-led coalition, is pursuing a simplified process for designating countries as safe origins to reduce asylum seeker numbers. Chancellor Merz's cabinet approved a draft policy that would allow a country to be declared safe through a simple statutory order, removing the need for Bundesrat consent. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt framed the move as part of a broader strategy to implement an "asylum turnaround." Critics from the Green party and immigration NGOs argue the draft contradicts German law and could lead to deportations without sufficient legal protection. The announcement follows a court ruling against the government's tightened border security measures. The German government is attempting to streamline the asylum process in order to more effectively process asylum seekers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is facing scrutiny as critics argue it includes significant rollbacks of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), potentially causing millions to lose Medicaid coverage and making health plans more expensive. While Republicans avoid explicitly calling it an ACA repeal, the bill aims to reduce "waste, fraud, and abuse" in government health programs. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the bill could leave 11 million more people without health insurance by 2034, a number that rises to 16 million with additional proposed changes. The bill also introduces new paperwork hurdles and ends automatic reenrollment, which could lead to people dropping coverage. The GOP argues that ACA subsidies are a separate issue and that the bill primarily affects unauthorized immigrants and "able-bodied workers," while Democrats frame it as an assault on healthcare.</p>

          <p>Sen. Ron Johnson has voiced strong opposition to President Trump's spending bill, citing concerns about its impact on the national debt. Johnson stated he cannot support the bill, which the CBO estimates would add $2.4 trillion to the deficit, calling it "immoral" to mortgage future generations. Instead of a single large bill, Johnson proposes splitting it into smaller pieces to address border security, defense, and tax laws separately, followed by a careful review of government spending. Despite potential political fallout, Johnson remains firm in his stance, prioritizing fiscal responsibility over party loyalty. The bill also faces criticism for its potential impact on healthcare coverage. The senator is clearly standing his ground on fiscal responsibility.</p>

          <p>President Trump spoke with Russian President Putin on Wednesday, describing their conversation as "good" but acknowledging it would not lead to immediate peace in Ukraine. They discussed Ukraine's drone operation targeting Russian military airfields, with Putin warning he would have to respond. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is pressuring Trump to increase sanctions on Moscow, while Trump has threatened both Ukraine and Russia with consequences if peace efforts fail. The call comes as U.S.-brokered peace talks remain stalled. The two sides appear to be far apart on their demands for peace.</p>

          <p>President Trump has privately expressed frustration with his Supreme Court appointees, especially Justice Amy Coney Barrett, believing they should more actively support his agenda.

Despite private complaints, Trump has not publicly attacked Barrett and previously defended her after she sided with liberal justices in a ruling. The situation reflects ongoing tensions between Trump and some of his judicial appointees. Trump is not pleased with his Supreme Court appointees.</p>

Top Trump officials, including Vice President JD Vance, have reportedly encouraged Greenland to separate from Denmark and come under U.S. security. President Trump has expressed interest in acquiring Greenland, citing its strategic importance and rare earth minerals. The vast majority of Greenlanders, however, do not wish to join the U.S.</p>
