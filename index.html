          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the June 1st Boulder attack during a "Run For Their Lives" event, has been indicted on 12 federal hate crime charges.  The indictment alleges Soliman used Molotov cocktails, injuring 15 people and a dog, motivated by anti-Zionist sentiments expressed in a handwritten document found in his car. The charges include causing injury based on perceived race, religion, or national origin, and using fire or explosives to commit a felony. This federal indictment follows previous state charges, including attempted murder.</p>

Mars maintains the acquisition would offer consumers more choice and innovation, and is cooperating with the investigation. A decision is expected by October 31st.</p>
