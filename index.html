        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea, an economic powerhouse, faces a severe demographic crisis as its birth rate remains critically low at 0.748, far below the 2.1 replacement rate. This trend is projected to lead to a prolonged economic downturn by the 2040s, with potential contraction as early as 2041. Despite significant government spending on incentives, efforts to boost childbirth have had minimal impact. A shrinking workforce also strains the pension system and military recruitment, though some analysts suggest the economy could adapt through innovation and immigration.</p>

          <p>The US State Department has revoked the visa of Colombian President Gustavo Petro, citing his "reckless and incendiary actions" during a pro-Palestinian protest in New York. Petro had urged US soldiers to disobey orders and called for an army "larger than that of the United States." This incident follows his strong criticism of the Trump administration at the UN General Assembly, where he rebuked US strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats. The move further strains relations between the historically allied nations, which have soured under Petro's leftist leadership.</p>

          <p>The Drug Enforcement Administration's Atlanta Field Division has opened a new in-house lab, significantly improving its efficiency in processing federal drug seizures in Georgia. Previously, chemists from other cities were required, causing delays of days, but now testing can be completed within minutes. This enhancement is crucial for federal prosecutors determining charges and is already aiding operations against the violent Cartel Jalisco New Generation (CJNG). A recent operation seized over 1,000 pounds of meth, with five Mexican nationals linked to CJNG arrested, highlighting the lab's immediate impact on combating drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>Hungary's political landscape is marked by increasingly aggressive public discourse, characterized by hate speech and government-funded propaganda, as highlighted by a recent anti-war protest in Budapest. The suicide of a police chief, following personal attacks in a pro-government newspaper, underscores the acrimonious environment. Critics accuse Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party of dehumanizing opponents and dominating traditional and digital media, spending millions on political ads. A new peace movement is gaining momentum, advocating for negotiations in conflicts and opposing arms deliveries, amidst concerns over the erosion of free media and democratic norms.</p>

          <p>Sweeping UN economic and military sanctions are poised to be reimposed on Iran after the UK, France, and Germany accused Tehran of failing to uphold its nuclear commitments. This move, stemming from Iran's increased banned nuclear activity since the US exited the 2016 deal, was condemned by Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian as "unfair, unjust, and illegal." A last-minute resolution to delay the sanctions failed in the UN Security Council. The sanctions, which include an arms embargo and bans on uranium enrichment, add significant strain to an already fraught international situation, despite Iran's insistence on peaceful nuclear intentions.</p>

          <p>Michele Beckwith, the acting US attorney in Sacramento, claims she was fired after informing the Border Patrol chief that his agents were prohibited from making indiscriminate arrests in California's Central Valley due to a court injunction. Beckwith, a career prosecutor, emphasized the need for compliance with court orders and the Constitution. Her termination occurred shortly after this warning, followed by Border Patrol raids in Sacramento, which the agency maintained were targeted. This incident is one of several where top prosecutors have left or been fired under the Trump administration amid pressures to aggressively pursue its policies.</p>

          <p>A California man, Varun Suresh, faces a murder charge after allegedly conducting a targeted, vigilante-style killing of a registered sexual offender in the San Francisco Bay Area. Police found 71-year-old David Brimmer fatally stabbed after Suresh admitted to researching and deliberately targeting him due to his criminal record. Brimmer had been convicted in 1995 of lewd and lascivious acts with a child. Suresh reportedly told police he used the Megan's Law website to find Brimmer's address and posed as a CPA to lure him out, expressing satisfaction with the act.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to continue its freeze of over $4 billion in foreign aid, which was previously approved by Congress. The conservative-majority court stated that the potential harm to Trump's foreign affairs conduct outweighed the harm to aid recipients. Liberal justices dissented, arguing the decision conflicts with the constitutional separation of powers, which grants Congress authority over spending. The Trump administration has drastically downsized foreign aid, merging USAID programs with the State Department, a move that humanitarian groups warn could lead to millions of additional global deaths and health crises.</p>

Huawei showcased its latest Ascend chip series, designed to deliver world-class computing power without Nvidia processors, its first detailed chip roadmap since being blacklisted by the US in 2019. These developments underscore how US trade restrictions have inadvertently spurred innovation within China's domestic AI industry, intensifying the tech rivalry with Washington.</p>

The judge found 51 specific instances where Lindell falsely stated Smartmatic interfered with results in Los Angeles County. While the court deferred on whether Lindell acted with "actual malice," Smartmatic's attorney plans to seek "nine-figure damages." Lindell, a prominent proponent of election fraud claims, maintains his belief in the truthfulness of his statements and vows to continue his fight against voting machines.</p>

This article highlights the severe human cost, particularly for tribal communities in central and eastern India, who are caught between rebels and government forces. While officials report increased rebel killings and the establishment of new security camps, rights activists worry about blurred lines between combatants and civilians. Locals allege wrongful deaths and question the use of local recruits in security units, reminiscent of a disbanded force, despite police denials of wrongdoing.</p>

Acquired at the trade deadline, Stewart's injury is a significant blow to the team's bullpen depth, which has struggled. Despite completing a minor-league rehab stint, Stewart continued to experience soreness, leading to the decision for a debridement procedure. While the Dodgers secured a 3-2 win against the Mariners, the loss of Stewart leaves a notable hole in their postseason relief corps, with other pitchers now stepping up.</p>
