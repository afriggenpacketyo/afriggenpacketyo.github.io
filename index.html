          <p>The U.S. State Department has started assisted departure flights from Tel Aviv to Athens for U.S. citizens, immediate family members, and lawful permanent residents, according to Ambassador Mike Huckabee. This action follows earlier confusion regarding government assistance for evacuations. The State Department has also issued a Level 4 travel advisory for Israel, urging Americans not to travel there due to ongoing conflict, terrorism, and civil unrest. Meanwhile, tensions between Israel and Iran have escalated, with missile strikes causing casualties and President Trump considering potential U.S. military intervention. The U.S. government is trying to get Americans to safety amidst the turmoil.</p>

          <p>NPR's roving correspondent Frank Langfitt covered both a military parade and a "No Kings" protest against the politicization of the armed forces, offering a unique lens on America's political and cultural divisions. Langfitt notes the events served as a Rorschach test, highlighting stark differences within the nation. By attending both events, he gained a different perspective, similar to how he examines other countries. The article suggests that these events expose underlying tensions and varying viewpoints present in American society, illustrating a nation grappling with its identity and direction. The ability to understand these varying viewpoints is a vital aspect of a healthy republic, even though these different viewpoints may be at odds. Optimism can be found in the fact that there are peaceful demonstrations of differing opinions.</p>

          <p>This article examines the challenges faced by receptionists at a GP practice during the "8am scramble" for appointments, highlighting patient frustrations and verbal abuse. The Tudor House Medical Practice in Nottingham experiences manic phone lines and increasing demand, leading to receptionists bearing the brunt of patient upset. The practice has implemented upgrades like a call-back option, but high demand means some patients inevitably miss out. A new government contract aims to alleviate the pressure by allowing online appointment booking and triaging patients based on medical need, potentially easing the burden on receptionists and improving patient access to care.</p>

Ten statues were made and displayed around the world, but their fates vary widely.

Another statue ended up at an abandoned nightclub in Austria, while one has been seen at a fairground in Switzerland, and another in a miniature town in South Africa.

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has stated that Kneecap's scheduled performance at Glastonbury Festival is "not appropriate" following a terror offence charge against band member Liam Ã“g Ã“ hAnnaidh. The charge relates to allegedly displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah at a gig last year. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch also suggested the BBC should not broadcast Kneecap's performance, prompting a response from the BBC emphasizing its commitment to editorial guidelines. Kneecap responded to Starmer's comments with an expletive-laden accusation of arming a genocide.</p>
