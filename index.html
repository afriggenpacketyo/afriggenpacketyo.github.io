          <p>A 20-year-old man has been formally charged with murder and possession of a knife in a public place following the fatal stabbing of a 16-year-old boy in Huddersfield. Emergency services responded to the incident on Ramsden Street, where they found the victim with severe neck injuries; he later died in the hospital. Two additional individuals, initially arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, have been released on police bail as the investigation continues to unfold, according to West Yorkshire Police.</p>

          <p>The Senate Republicans successfully pushed through changes to the House's budget resolution following a series of amendment votes that extended late into the night. The approved framework includes raising the debt ceiling by up to $5 trillion and making President Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent by utilizing a current policy baseline. Budget reconciliation lowers the vote threshold in the Senate from 60 to 51, which lets Republicans approve certain priorities with no Democrat support. The budget also addresses border funding for the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump's imposition of tariffs on US trading partners marks a significant shift away from globalization, reminiscent of Brexit, and has triggered concerns among businesses, economists, and politicians. Trump has consistently advocated for tariffs for decades, believing they will revitalize American industry and generate substantial revenue. However, critics warn that these tariffs could lead to increased costs for American consumers, potentially negating any positive economic effects. The tariffs range from 10% to 50% on various trading partners, sparking widespread debate about their potential impact on the US economy.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a novel vaccine booster that significantly amplifies immune responses against cancer and viral infections. The system, called SABER (STING Agonist-Based ER-Targeting Molecules), acts as a molecular 'elevator' to transport antigens directly to the endoplasmic reticulum, enhancing the effectiveness of treatments for malignancies and improving vaccine efficacy against rapidly mutating coronaviruses. This advance involves delivering vaccine antigens to CD8+ T cells, requiring cytoplasmic entry into antigen-presenting cells (APCs), APC activation and endoplasmic reticulum targeting. The research was jointly conducted by researchers from Guangzhouâ€™s Sun Yat-sen University, Fudan University and Liaoning University, and published in the journal Nature on March 27.</p>

          <p>President Trump's unilateral 10% tariff on imports from numerous countries has commenced, with higher levies on goods from major trading partners scheduled to follow. This action signifies a rejection of the post-World War II system of mutually agreed tariff rates and has triggered significant market volatility. Exemptions have been granted for over 1,000 product categories, including crude oil, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors. The tariffs are expected to evolve over time as countries seek to negotiate lower rates, potentially leading to a seismic shift in global trade dynamics.</p>

          <p>The Japanese Grand Prix's final practice session was temporarily halted due to trackside grass fires, a recurring issue that has raised concerns about safety. Lando Norris led the session, followed closely by Oscar Piastri, both driving for McLaren. Despite mitigation efforts implemented after similar incidents during Friday's practice, the fires persisted, prompting the FIA to focus on further dampening the grass before the qualifying session. The fires are believed to be caused by sparks from the cars igniting the dry grass.</p>

          <p>Social anxiety is increasingly prevalent, particularly among young people, with over half of Brits and nearly three-quarters of 16-24 year olds affected.

Experts emphasize the importance of building resilience, developing healthy coping strategies, and differentiating between natural nerves and Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD).

          <p>President Trump has granted TikTok a second extension to comply with a law requiring the app to either sell its US operations or face a ban. The extension aims to allow more time to broker a deal for American ownership of the platform, amid concerns about its current Chinese ownership. Negotiations are ongoing, but key matters remain unresolved, and any agreement is subject to approval under Chinese law. A previous deal reportedly fell apart after Trump announced sweeping global tariffs, including on China.</p>
