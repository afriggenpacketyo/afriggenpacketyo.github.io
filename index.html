          <p>China has imposed sanctions on Seki Hei, a Japanese lawmaker, for allegedly spreading falsehoods about Taiwan, Xinjiang, and Hong Kong, thereby undermining Chinese sovereignty. The Chinese foreign ministry stated that Seki's actions seriously interfered in China's internal affairs. The sanctions include freezing any assets held by Seki within China and prohibiting Chinese organizations and individuals from engaging in transactions or working with him. Additionally, visas will be denied to Seki and his immediate family members, including entry to Hong Kong and Macau. This is a rare move by Beijing against a Japanese politician. </p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop of 33% in August, contributing to an overall slowdown in export growth to a six-month low, as President Trump's trade policies and scrutiny of transshipments impacted trade. Imports from the U.S. also declined by 16%. China's total exports grew by 4.4%, falling short of expectations, while imports rose by 1.3%. The country has been diversifying its markets, focusing on Southeast Asia, the EU, Africa, and Latin America, though the U.S. remains its largest single-country trading partner.

Allen threw for 394 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for two more, spoiling a strong performance by Lamar Jackson. Derrick Henry rushed for 169 yards and two touchdowns for Baltimore but also contributed to the loss by fumbling with 3:06 left.

          <p>The family of Raish Ahmed, who was murdered by his neighbor in Canning Town, criticizes authorities for failing to protect him. Ahmed was stabbed outside his flat in a dispute over a communal door being left open. The family and neighbors had complained about the aggressive behavior of the murderer, Daniel Whybrow, for months. The family says they were let down by the police and the council, with the wife saying her husband was failed by London, which lets racism and violence fester in the open.</p>

          <p>Chicago churches are urging calm resistance to an expected federal intervention, with the Rev. Marshall Hatch advising congregants to carry identification and stay connected to family. As Chicago prepares for a potential National Guard deployment and immigration enforcement, churches are working to quell fears and address the possibility of increased law enforcement. President Trump has threatened federal intervention in Democratic strongholds, citing the need to fight crime and step up deportations. The city's Black and Latino communities are particularly concerned about the potential for increased tensions.</p>

The match was dedicated to a man who died of a brain tumor, and the couple named their son Henry James in his memory.</p>

          <p>The City of Los Angeles has purchased the historic Griffith Park carousel, a spot where Walt Disney conceived the idea for Disneyland, for $1 million. The carousel, a "crown jewel" of the park, is expected to reopen in time for its 2026 centennial. The city plans to restore the carousel and the surrounding area in preparation for the 2028 Olympic Games. The carousel, one of the oldest wooden merry-go-rounds in California, has been closed since 2022 and requires significant repairs before reopening.</p>

          <p>Global investors are shifting away from US equities for the first time in a decade, drawn by Asia's AI boom and expectations of looser Federal Reserve policy, according to Bank of America. US equities attracted $1.2 trillion from global investors from 2020 to 2024, but investments have slowed this year. Investors are diversifying into Asia, where they see opportunities in the tech space and more attractive valuations. The global AI market is expected to quadruple by 2030, with a significant portion deployed in Asia-Pacific. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stargazers across Asia, Europe, and Africa were treated to a "blood moon" during a total lunar eclipse.

This gives the moon its red color, and the event has astounded humans for millennia.</p>
