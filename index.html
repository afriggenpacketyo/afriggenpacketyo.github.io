          <p>President Donald Trump stated he has "no intention" of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before Powell's term concludes next year, marking a significant shift from Trump's recent criticisms and threats. Trump had previously pressured Powell to cut interest rates to stimulate economic growth and even suggested he could remove Powell if desired. White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett had also indicated the administration was exploring options for Powell's dismissal. Powell's term as Fed chair extends until May 2026, and he has asserted that the president lacks the legal authority to remove him. (not investment advice)</p>

They also contend that the DOJ is using privilege claims to avoid providing information about Abrego Garcia's detention before April 2. Senator Chris Van Hollen reported that Abrego Garcia was moved to a lower-security facility on April 9, contradicting earlier reports from multiple Trump administration officials. </p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., along with the FDA, announced plans to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year, aiming to reduce children's exposure to synthetic chemicals. The agencies will collaborate with food companies to remove dyes from products like cereal, ice cream, and snacks. The FDA is looking to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and working to eliminate six remaining dyes, citing studies linking these dyes to health conditions like ADHD, obesity, and cancer. The initiative follows a previous move to ban Red No. 3, and the FDA is also taking steps to authorize four new natural color additives.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts the Bank of England could implement three more interest rate cuts this year, despite anticipating higher-than-expected inflation in the UK. The IMF forecasts UK inflation to be the highest among advanced economies at 3.1% due to increased bills, particularly for energy and water. The organization also downgraded its UK economic growth forecast for 2025 to 1.1% due to the global impact of U.S. trade tariffs. Chancellor Rachel Reeves responded by emphasizing that the IMF still projects stronger economic growth in the UK compared to other major European countries. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit stemmed from an editorial about gun control that incorrectly linked Palin's political action committee to the 2011 shooting of U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords. The Times issued a correction less than 14 hours after publication, and former editorial page editor James Bennet apologized to Palin during the trial.

          <p>Canada has seen a record early voter turnout, with 7.3 million ballots cast ahead of the upcoming election. This represents a 25% increase from the previous election in 2021. The election takes place amidst an ongoing trade war with the U.S. and concerns about President Donald Trump's stance on Canada. Liberal leader Mark Carney has positioned his party as the best option to address Trump's tariffs, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre held a rally in Toronto. The tariffs have already led to temporary layoffs in Canada's auto sector.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is implementing a password-sharing crackdown for its Max streaming service, similar to Netflix's approach. The company launched a new feature called Extra Member Add-On, allowing users to add one extra person outside their household to their subscription for a monthly fee. The add-on costs $7.99 per month, providing the additional member with their own stand-alone account under the same subscription. This move aims to boost revenue from direct-to-consumer platforms and sustain profitability, following similar strategies adopted by Netflix and Disney+.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves is in Washington to urge the Trump administration to sign a proposed US-UK trade agreement. The agreement is reportedly ready for signing but could be jeopardized if the U.S. imposes tariffs on pharmaceuticals. Reeves will meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to lobby for reducing tariffs on UK steel, cars, and aluminum. The UK government is prepared to react quickly if Trump implements tariffs on pharmaceutical products. The IMF recently downgraded the UK's growth forecast for this year, citing domestic factors such as government borrowing costs and higher energy costs.</p>

Harvard argues the actions violate the First Amendment and lack legal basis.

Garber, argues the funding freeze jeopardizes critical research, including studies on child cancer survivors and infectious diseases.

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested that revenue from tariffs could potentially replace the federal income tax, an idea he previously floated during his presidential campaign. Economists, however, are skeptical of the proposal's feasibility. Alex Durante of the Tax Foundation called it "not a realistic proposal." The universal tariff rate on goods imported into the U.S. from most countries is 10%, with tariffs on imports from China reaching as high as 145%. Tariff negotiations are ongoing amid a temporary pause on sweeping tariffs enacted by the Trump administration.</p>
