          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist, arrived in New Jersey following his release from ICE detention in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered his release. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained for over 100 days as the Trump administration sought his deportation due to his pro-Palestinian activism, which they deemed detrimental to foreign policy interests. Upon arrival, Khalil asserted his commitment to advocating for Palestinian rights, while New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned his detainment as a violation of his First Amendment rights. Judge Michael Fabiarz stated that Khalil was neither a threat nor a flight risk, criticizing the government's actions as an attempt to punish him for his anti-Israel speech.</p>

          <p>At least three people died in North Dakota after severe weather, including a derecho with wind gusts up to 106 mph and nine reported tornadoes, swept across the region. The Cass County Sheriff's Office reported extensive damage in rural Enderlin, where storm chasers located two deceased individuals, and a third was found shortly after. Law enforcement and first responders continue to search the area and conduct well-being checks on residents amidst the ongoing dangers posed by the storm.

          <p>Vance Boelter, the suspect in the fatal shootings of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband, was identified as a doomsday "prepper" by the FBI. Boelter's wife told investigators that the family was part of a group preparing for catastrophic incidents, and that her husband had given her a "bailout plan" including cash, passports, and guns. Boelter is charged with killing Democratic House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and seriously wounding Democratic State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. Police found a list of about 70 targets, including prominent Democratic politicians, in Boelter's possession.</p>

          <p>Over five million borrowers have defaulted on their student loans, with data indicating that number could double soon. The end of the federal student loan payment pause and the resumption of reporting past-due accounts to credit bureaus have contributed to the surge in defaults. Borrowers now face wage garnishments, withheld tax refunds, and reduced Social Security benefits if they continue to default on their loans. President Biden's attempts at student loan forgiveness were largely rejected by the courts, leaving many borrowers struggling with the cost of living and unsure how to manage their payments.

Firefighters have responded to a significant increase in wildfires, and the public is urged to be cautious.

          <p>Steve Bannon, despite holding no official government position, has played a significant role in President Trump's decision-making process regarding Iran. Bannon reportedly advised Trump against military action, citing concerns about Israeli intelligence and the effectiveness of bunker-buster bombs. Other influential conservatives, like Senator Lindsey Graham, advocate for supporting Israel in eliminating Iran's nuclear threat. Trump has delayed making a decision on striking Iran for two weeks, while U.S. military assets are being moved to the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The suspect in the recent shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses was a doomsday “prepper” who instructed his family to “prepare for war” as he tried to evade capture, according to new court filings. Vance Boelter, 57, faces multiple federal and state murder charges after allegedly shooting dead the Democratic Minnesota state house speaker emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in the early hours of 14 June. Boelter is also accused of shooting and seriously wounding the Democratic state senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, about 90 minutes earlier.</p>

The Fed kept its benchmark lending rate unchanged, following lackluster updates on the consumer and housing market. The Fed's decision to keep interest rates steady makes sense, considering the dueling dynamics and the uncertainty around tariff impacts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that global population data may be underrepresenting rural areas by a significant margin. Researchers from Aalto University in Finland analyzed data from rural dam projects and found discrepancies compared to other population datasets. The study estimates that rural populations may have been underestimated by 53 percent to 84 percent between 1975 and 2010. While such underreporting could impact resource allocation, other experts remain skeptical of the study's findings.</p>
