          <h2>Assassination of Former Parliamentary Leader Sparks Security Concerns in Ukraine</h2>

          <p>The assassination of former Ukrainian parliamentary leader Andriy Parubiy in Lviv has triggered a national debate on the security of public figures amid Russia's ongoing hybrid warfare. Authorities arrested a suspect who confessed, claiming personal motives, but they also allege a "Russian connection," suggesting he was manipulated by Russian intelligence services. Experts believe this killing is part of a broader Kremlin strategy to destabilize and demoralize Ukrainian society by targeting prominent politicians and activists. The incident has prompted calls for enhanced security measures and raised serious questions about the Ukrainian intelligence services' ability to counter such threats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A clinical trial conducted by researchers at Saarland University in Germany has found that an over-the-counter nasal spray may significantly reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. The study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, showed that participants using an azelastine nasal spray three times daily had a 2.2% infection rate, compared to 6.7% in the placebo group. Researchers noted the spray, commonly used for hay fever, was associated with a lower rate of symptomatic infections and even rhinovirus infections. The findings suggest azelastine could serve as an accessible prophylactic measure, though larger trials are needed to confirm its effectiveness against various respiratory pathogens.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has repeatedly declined to state whether he would dismiss Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner if an investigation finds she broke the ministerial code. Rayner admitted to underpaying stamp duty on a flat purchase and referred herself to the prime minister's standards adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, attributing the error to incorrect legal advice. While Starmer assured he would act on the adviser's forthcoming report, he resisted making a commitment on Rayner's fate, drawing criticism from opposition parties. The controversy centers on whether Rayner will face consequences for the tax error, a situation for which she and Starmer had previously criticized political opponents.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 26 Western allies have formally agreed to deploy troops to Ukraine immediately following a potential ceasefire agreement with Russia. This "reassurance force" would operate by land, sea, or air to enforce security guarantees for Kyiv once hostilities cease. The announcement followed a summit of 35 nations, though prospects for a ceasefire remain uncertain amid ongoing conflict and stalled negotiations between the warring countries. The United States is expected to finalize its support for the mission in the coming days, which President Trump has suggested could involve air support rather than ground troops.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stephen Miran, President Donald Trump's nominee for a vacant seat on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, has stated he will take an unpaid leave of absence from his White House job as chair of the Council of Economic Advisors rather than resigning. During his Senate confirmation hearing, Miran explained this decision was due to the short four-and-a-half-month term he would be filling, which expires in January 2026. This arrangement has fueled concerns about the central bank's independence, as it comes amid speculation that the administration seeks to exert greater influence over monetary policy. Miran pledged to uphold the Fed's independence and said he would resign if confirmed for a longer term.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deciding when to claim Social Security benefits is a critical financial decision for retirees, with significant implications for their monthly income. While benefits can be claimed as early as age 62, doing so results in a permanent reduction of about 30% compared to waiting until full retirement age, which is between 66 and 67. Conversely, delaying claims past full retirement age increases benefits by approximately 8% annually until age 70, maximizing the monthly payout. The optimal choice depends on individual circumstances, including immediate financial needs, health, and other retirement income sources, with financial experts suggesting strategies like creating income bridges to delay claiming.

          <p>A powerful magnitude-6.0 earthquake, followed by significant aftershocks, has devastated Afghanistan's mountainous Kunar province, resulting in over 2,200 deaths and nearly 4,000 injuries.

          <p>Danish renewable energy company Orsted has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block an order halting construction of its Revolution Wind farm off the coast of New England. The Interior Department issued an abrupt stop-work order for the nearly completed project, citing national security concerns, a justification Orsted claims is a pretext for President Trump's well-known hostility towards wind power. The project, which is 80% complete, has already passed extensive environmental and safety reviews and is designed to power over 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Stewart traces how elements like eating black-eyed peas for New Year's luck and carrying good-luck charms originated in conjure rituals. Amid a resurgence of interest in these practices in popular culture, the book highlights the often-overlooked contributions of Black women to American history, framing their spiritual traditions as a source of healing, protection, and defiance.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic accident involving one of Lisbon's historic funiculars has left 16 people dead and more than 20 injured after the streetcar derailed and crashed into a building. The Elevador da Gloria, a popular tourist attraction that has operated for over a century, careened down a steep hill in the city center. About half of the injured were identified as foreign visitors, reflecting the tram's popularity. The Portuguese government has declared a national day of mourning, and an investigation into the cause of the disaster is underway, with initial speculation pointing towards a potential rupture of the main operating cable.</p>

DraftKings CEO Jason Robins and BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt both reported strong pre-season numbers and expressed high optimism, with the American Gaming Association estimating legal betting will grow by 8.5% to $30 billion this season. The industry appears resilient against broader economic concerns, with executives noting no slowdown in consumer spending or engagement.

          <p>Restaurant chain Texas Roadhouse received a stock rating downgrade from Evercore ISI due to concerns that rising beef prices could impact its financial performance next year. Despite the downgrade, CNBC's Jim Cramer suggested that the company should absorb the commodity costs rather than raising menu prices to maintain its value proposition. He indicated a specific price point below which he would consider the stock an attractive purchase, should it continue to fall.

The case involves a bizarre series of events where Todd escaped their burning home only to be run over by a van driven by Linda. Prosecutors argued she intentionally set the fire and then ran him over, while Linda maintained it was a tragic accident as she tried to flee to get help. A federal judge overturned her conviction in 2018, citing prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective counsel, a decision upheld on appeal, leading the state to refile murder charges against her.</p>

          <p>Texas is poised to enact a new law that empowers private citizens to sue out-of-state manufacturers and distributors of abortion medication who supply pills to Texas residents. Under the legislation, successful plaintiffs, including the pregnant woman's relatives, can be awarded at least $100,000 in damages. The law is designed to circumvent legal protections, known as "shield laws," in other states that protect abortion providers. Opponents argue this is an intimidation tactic that will further isolate pregnant Texans in a state that already has a near-total ban on abortion, while the bill is expected to face immediate and significant legal challenges.</p>

Born at home in Georgia during the segregation era, she never received the document, which became a significant issue with the implementation of the federal Real ID law. Her family undertook a lengthy legal process to prove her existence, which was reportedly expedited by local media coverage. With her new birth certificate, Lovette was able to immediately secure a Real ID and now plans to get a passport for international travel.</p>

          <p>A complex of lightning-sparked wildfires has caused significant damage in Chinese Camp, a historic Gold Rush town in northern California. The TCU September Lightning Complex fire spread rapidly through the rural foothills, destroying multiple structures and leveling buildings in the registered landmark community. Footage from the scene showed smoldering rubble where historic buildings once stood, though it was not immediately clear if key 19th-century structures like the post office and a church had survived. The blaze is one of over a dozen burning across the state, prompting the governor to secure federal assistance for fire-suppression efforts amid challenging, windy conditions.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has confirmed that the UK government is considering a new digital ID program as a potential tool to tackle illegal immigration and employment. He suggested such a system could play an "important part" in reducing the incentive for people to enter the country without permission by making it harder to work illegally. Acknowledging past privacy concerns that led to the scrapping of a previous ID card scheme, Starmer stated that the public debate has "moved on" with the widespread use of digital identity in daily life.
