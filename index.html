          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced declines, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index falling over 2% and mainland China's CSI 300 dropping nearly 3%, following heightened trade restrictions and accusations between China and the U.S. President Trump's threat of 100% retaliatory tariffs on Chinese imports, coupled with China's new export controls on rare earth minerals, reignited fears of a trade war. Goldman Sachs suggests China's recent policies may aim for greater concessions from the U.S., impacting global market stability. The offshore Chinese yuan strengthened slightly, while U.S. markets also saw significant declines on Friday.</p>

          <p>More than 150 unvaccinated students from two Spartanburg County schools in South Carolina are under a 21-day quarantine after measles exposures. This local outbreak has contributed to at least eight cases in the state this year, part of a national surge reaching over 1,563 cases, the highest since 1992. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data highlight a concerning decline in MMR vaccination rates, now at 92.5% for kindergarteners, leaving hundreds of thousands unprotected. This situation underscores a growing public health challenge related to vaccine hesitancy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 to deploy troops domestically amid rising urban crime, a possibility confirmed by Vice-President JD Vance. Concurrently, President Trump announced that the war in Gaza was 'over' as he departed for Jerusalem to speak at the Knesset and meet with hostage families. He claimed to have brokered a major peace deal that would normalize Middle East relations. These developments signal a dual focus on domestic security and international diplomacy, with the President asserting a significant role in both.</p>

Manager Dave Roberts stated Yoshinobu Yamamoto will pitch Game 2 instead of Ohtani, allowing Yamamoto to maintain his regular five-day rest schedule for a potential Game 6. This adjustment means Ohtani will likely make only one pitching start in the NLCS, potentially allowing him to focus on improving his hitting performance after a challenging NLDS.

          <p>Retired four-star General Tim Haugh, former head of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command, spoke out for the first time since his firing by the Trump administration in April. Haugh, appointed by President Biden, was dismissed after a far-right activist accused him of disloyalty. He vehemently denied the accusation, stating his unwavering commitment to national security until his last day of service. His termination, which Senator Mike Rounds called "a loss for our nation," comes amidst warnings about China's growing cyber capabilities, raising concerns about the future of America's cyber defenses.</p>

          <h2>Strategies for Maintaining Adult Friendships and Combating 'Ghosting'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 19:28:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Maintaining adult friendships often becomes a challenge amidst busy lives, leading to a phenomenon known as 'ghosting' where connections fade. Research indicates individuals lose about half their friends every seven years due to shifting life stages like marriage, career focus, or starting families. Experts emphasize honest communication, vulnerability, and creative approaches to spending time together, even through mundane activities. Psychologist Dr. Marisa Franco highlights 'relational loneliness' and the importance of in-person interactions, suggesting reframing social connection as a muscle that strengthens with use. Trusting that friends are more liked than perceived is crucial for rekindling bonds.</p>

          <h2>Thermal Cameras Detect Stress by Measuring Nose Temperature Changes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists at the University of Sussex are utilizing thermal cameras to study stress, revealing that a drop in nose temperature can serve as an objective measure of stress levels. During an experimental stress test involving impromptu speeches and mental arithmetic, participants' noses consistently showed a temperature decrease of three to six degrees, including a two-degree drop for a BBC correspondent. This physiological response, where blood flow is redirected from the nose to eyes and ears to detect danger, offers a non-invasive method for monitoring stress. Researchers believe this technique could be a "game changer" for managing harmful stress and assessing well-being in humans and non-human apes.</p>

          <p>A landmark lawsuit against five major carmakers—Mercedes, Ford, Peugeot/Citroën, Renault, and Nissan—is commencing at the High Court, accusing them of cheating on emissions tests. This trial is the latest development in the "dieselgate" scandal, potentially impacting 1.6 million car owners who allege they were misled about their vehicles' environmental performance. The companies deny using "defeat devices" to reduce harmful nitrogen oxide emissions during testing. If the court rules against the carmakers, a subsequent trial will determine compensation levels, highlighting significant corporate accountability and public health implications from vehicle pollution.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has advised UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves to avoid "directionless tinkering and half-baked fixes" in the upcoming Budget, despite pressure to increase tax revenue. The IFS, a leading economic think tank, warns that some potential tax rises could be "especially economically harmful." They urge for wider reform to the tax system, suggesting property tax and capital gains tax as "good places to start" for fairer, growth-friendly changes. The Treasury maintains the Budget will balance public service funding with economic growth and investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute declares coral reefs as the first environmental system on Earth to pass a climate "tipping point," marking an "unprecedented crisis." Researchers confirm that global warming, exceeding 1.2 degrees Celsius, has already led to widespread coral dieback, with 70-90% expected to die at 1.5 degrees. The report highlights the most extensive mass bleaching event ever recorded, impacting 84% of the world's reefs. While acknowledging progress in renewable energy, scientists urge immediate, unprecedented action to prevent further devastating tipping points in other critical ecosystems like ice sheets and the Amazon rainforest.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice-President JD Vance has warned that further "painful" workforce cuts are imminent if the government shutdown persists, adding to the thousands of federal jobs already eliminated. As the shutdown approaches its third week, hundreds of thousands of federal employees are on unpaid leave, while essential workers continue without pay. Vance blamed Democrats for the impasse, citing their demand for health insurance subsidies in the spending bill. The Trump administration initiated layoffs across several agencies, though some CDC notices were sent in error. The military, however, will receive paychecks using unobligated funds.</p>
