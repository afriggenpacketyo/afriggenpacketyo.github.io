          <p>Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller faced vocal heckling from protesters during a photo opportunity at Union Station in Washington D.C., where they were publicly thanking National Guard troops. Protesters chanted "Free D.C.," largely overshadowing the officials' attempts to address reporters, with Vance and Miller dismissing the demonstrators as "crazy" and "communists." Vance justified the troops' presence by claiming the station was "overrun with homeless people" and that visitors felt unsafe. This incident highlights the significant public contention surrounding the federal deployment aimed at combating D.C. crime, alongside the administration's stance on urban security and social issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Adult Swim has launched "Women Wearing Shoulder Pads," its first Spanish-language animated show, created by Gonzalo Cordova. The stop-motion series, deeply influenced by Pedro Almodóvar's 1980s films and Ecuadorian culture, centers on a melodramatic feud between a Spanish businesswoman trying to change the local perception of guinea pigs as pets, and a local seller. Cordova, who grew up in Ecuador and South Florida, aimed to blend his childhood memories with his love for TV and marionette theater. The show is also notable for its queer themes and all-female speaking cast, deliberately exaggerating the secondary role of male characters in melodramas.</p>

          <p>Californians are bracing for the year's most significant heatwave, with temperatures expected to exceed 110F in desert areas and 100F in Southern California from Wednesday through the weekend. This extreme weather event, fueled by climate change, brings compounding dangers including heightened wildfire risks due to parched hillsides and potential thunderstorms. Nighttime temperatures are also projected to remain high, offering little relief and complicating fire containment efforts. Governor Gavin Newsom has pre-deployed extensive resources, including fire engines and helicopters, to high-risk areas as the state prepares for potential rapid fire growth and extreme behavior.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has unveiled "ODNI 2.0," a significant restructuring initiative that will reduce her office's workforce by nearly 50% and consolidate several intelligence centers. This ambitious overhaul, described as the largest reform since the ODNI's establishment after the September 11 attacks, is projected to save taxpayers more than $700 million annually. The primary goal is to refocus the office on its core mission of integrating and overseeing the broader intelligence community, signaling a strategic shift in how national intelligence resources are managed and deployed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite mortgage rates recently falling to a 10-month low, many prospective homebuyers, particularly millennials, are still hesitant to enter the market due to persistently high home prices. In New York City, for instance, median listing prices exceed $829,000, up 3.8% year-over-year. An undersupply of homes and uncertainty about future rate movements are major deterrents, with a Bank of America study showing 60% of potential buyers are unsure if now is the right time to purchase. Many are waiting for further price and interest rate drops, even though mortgage rates are primarily tied to the 10-year Treasury, not just Fed decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South African authorities have detained John Hume, an 83-year-old high-profile animal breeder, and five others on charges of operating an illegal rhino horn smuggling network. Hume, who once owned one of the world's largest rhino herds, is accused of involvement in exporting over 900 rhino horns valued at $14.1 million. Investigators allege fraud involving government officials who issued domestic permits for horns that were then illegally shipped to Southeast Asian markets, where they are sought after for status symbols and supposed aphrodisiac properties, despite international bans on overseas sales.</p>

          <p>Deputies from the El Dorado County Sheriff’s Office encountered an unexpected sight at an ice cream shop in South Lake Tahoe's Camp Richardson: a bear behind the counter. The officers, "barely believing their eyes," managed to snap photos of the animal, which appeared particularly interested in the strawberry ice cream. After some encouragement, the bear eventually left the premises. The incident resulted in minimal property damage and required very little cleanup, offering a humorous and memorable interaction with local wildlife for the responding officers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has demanded the resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, following allegations of mortgage fraud made by Bill Pulte, his appointee to the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency. Pulte claims Cook falsified bank and property records to secure more favorable loan terms by designating two homes as primary residences. Trump's call, made on Truth Social, comes amidst his ongoing pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates. Cook's potential removal and the confirmation of Trump's nominee, Stephen Miran, could slightly alter the Federal Open Market Committee's composition, though Wall Street anticipates a rate cut regardless.

          <p>State and local governments are bracing for significant changes in federal disaster relief as the Trump administration reshapes FEMA, with President Trump stating less money will be given out directly from his office. Critics argue FEMA is already slow to disburse funds and coordinate programs, leaving communities to navigate complex bureaucratic processes. With FEMA managing over 600 open disaster declarations, some dating back decades, cuts in federal funding would place a greater financial burden on local entities. This shift raises concerns for areas like North Carolina, still recovering from Hurricane Helene with limited federal aid.</p>

With an estimated wingspan similar to the U.S. B-2 Spirit bomber, the aircraft suggests China's rapidly accelerating next-generation air combat programs. Its appearance could be a deliberate leak ahead of an upcoming military parade, indicating significant advancements in China's uncrewed aircraft development.</p>
