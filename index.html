          <p>Federal transportation safety officials are investigating after an Army Black Hawk helicopter entered restricted airspace around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, causing two commercial flights to abort landings. The incident, which occurred months after a fatal collision between a military helicopter and a commercial jet, prompted outrage from officials, including Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who criticized the disregard for established helicopter restrictions. Senator Ted Cruz called for legislation to improve civilian air safety, while Senator Maria Cantwell emphasized the need for airspace security. The Army stated that the helicopter was following approved flight procedures and that the incident is under investigation.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has made significant gains in the 2025 local elections across England, taking control of several councils and winning a parliamentary by-election. Both Labour and the Conservatives suffered major defeats, with the Liberal Democrats also picking up seats. Reform UK's success was particularly notable in former Conservative-controlled areas. The BBC's projected national share estimates show a decline in support for both Labour and the Conservatives, indicating a potential shift in voter allegiances. The elections also included mayoral races, with Reform winning two newly-created positions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has criticized Germany's decision to designate the far-right AfD party as a "right-wing extremist" group. US Vice President JD Vance accused Germany of rebuilding a "Berlin Wall," while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the designation "tyranny in disguise." The German Foreign Ministry defended the decision, stating that it was the result of a thorough and independent investigation to protect the constitution and that right-wing extremism needs to be stopped. The AfD, founded in 2013, has gained popularity by capitalizing on fears over migration.</p>

          <p>Water supplies ran dry during the Pacific Palisades fire due to the shutdown of the Santa Ynez Reservoir for repairs. The city had attempted to revive the retired Pacific Palisades Reservoir as an alternative but failed to complete the project in time due to safety concerns. Emails reveal that despite preparations, the city could not rectify the supply shortage before the fire. The inability to bring either reservoir online undermined the potential water supply, leading to depleted tanks and dry hydrants during the blaze. The article discusses the city's attempts to find alternative water sources, and the legal claims surrounding the fire.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional, calling it an attack on the American legal system. Judge Beryl Howell's ruling permanently blocks the order, which imposed punitive measures on the firm for representing clients or causes disliked by Trump. The judge framed the targeting of Perkins Coie as an attack on the independence of the legal profession. Perkins Coie welcomed the ruling, affirming core constitutional freedoms.</p>

          <p>Miriam Haley, the first accuser to testify against Harvey Weinstein at his Manhattan retrial, completed two days of cross-examination, defending her account of sexual assault.

Haley testified that Weinstein forced himself on her in his SoHo apartment in 2006. The retrial was ordered after New York's highest court overturned Weinstein's 2020 conviction.</p>
