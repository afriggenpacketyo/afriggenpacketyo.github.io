          <p>Israel announced it will mobilize thousands of reserve soldiers to escalate its military operations against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, signaling a potential shift in strategy. This decision follows a period of resumed attacks after a two-month cease-fire ended, exacerbating fears among Gaza residents already suffering from prolonged conflict and restricted aid. The move has also heightened concerns among families of hostages held by Hamas, who fear the increased fighting could endanger their loved ones. Despite over a year of conflict, Israel has not fully achieved its goals of destroying Hamas or securing the release of all hostages.</p>

          <p>Federal officials cleared a large homeless encampment in Oregon's Deschutes National Forest, displacing 100 to 200 people who sought refuge in the woods. Many of the displaced individuals moved to a different forest nearby, highlighting the lack of long-term solutions for homelessness in the area. The eviction, described as the largest in recent history, has been criticized by advocates as simply moving the problem elsewhere, with shelters at capacity and housing costs out of reach for many. The action underscores the ongoing challenges of addressing homelessness in the face of rising housing costs and limited resources.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's recent loss to Bournemouth has highlighted vulnerabilities in defending set-pieces, with a significant percentage of goals conceded this season originating from such situations. The team's inability to maintain leads in recent Premier League games and a lack of confidence in scoring goals are also concerns. Former West Ham goalkeeper Rob Green noted the team's reliance on Declan Rice and a lack of ideas on how to score goals. To beat PSG, Arsenal must improve their defense and rediscover their attacking edge.</p>
