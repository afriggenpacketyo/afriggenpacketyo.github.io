          <p>During a Pirates-Cubs game at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, a fan fell from the right-field bleachers, landing on the warning track, prompting immediate medical response and a 10-minute game delay as players offered prayers. The article reports that the fan was carted off to a local hospital, and the Pirates organization released a statement expressing concern and support for the injured individual and their family, however the man's condition was not immediately known. The incident occurred shortly after an RBI double by the Pirates' Andrew McCutchen, adding to the tension of the situation. The Pirates ultimately won the game 4-3.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized an agreement for the joint exploitation of Ukraine's energy and mineral resources, establishing a reconstruction investment fund to bolster Ukraine's economic recovery amid its conflict with Russia. The article details that the deal, a prerequisite for future US security guarantees to Kyiv, grants the US access to Ukraine's vast reserves of critical minerals like graphite, titanium, and lithium. These minerals are highly sought after for their use in renewable energy, military applications, and industrial infrastructure, especially given the US's trade war with China, which controls 90% of the world's rare-earth stocks. The agreement emphasizes solidarity with Ukraine, stating that no entity supporting Russia's war efforts will benefit from Ukraine's reconstruction.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Apple must loosen its control over the App Store and cease collecting commissions on certain app sales, marking a significant victory for Epic Games in a long-standing antitrust case. The article reports that Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers criticized Apple for defying a previous ruling and accused company executives, including Tim Cook, of lying to the court. Apple had created a system that forced apps with external sales to pay a 27% commission, a move the judge deemed anticompetitive. The ruling could reshape the app economy by increasing developer revenue and reducing fees paid to Apple, but Apple is likely to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>A court has found Apple in contempt for willfully violating a 2021 injunction related to the Epic Games case, with Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers accusing Apple Vice President of Finance Alex Roman of lying under oath. According to the article, the judge also alleges that Apple withheld documentation and abused attorney-client privilege to conceal its decision-making process, particularly regarding commissions on purchases made through web links inside iPhone apps. The court has ordered Apple to immediately cease imposing commissions on these purchases and to pay Epic Games' attorney fees, with Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney hailing the decision as a victory for developers that forces Apple to compete.</p>

Trump stated that while shelves might be less stocked, children might have fewer dolls, and the goal is to achieve a fair trade deal after being "ripped off" by China.</p>
