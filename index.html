          <p>The deadly Texas floods, which killed over 100 people, resulted from a confluence of factors including the region's flood-prone geography and a massive, slow-moving weather system. The deluge struck suddenly in the early morning, causing the Guadalupe River to rise dramatically and catching residents and summer camps by surprise. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timing and effectiveness of emergency warnings as recovery efforts continue amid the widespread devastation.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' summer camp devastated by the recent Texas floods, has a history dating back to 1926. Located in Hunt, Texas, along the Guadalupe River, it has been operated by the same family for three generations since 1939. The camp's co-owner, Dick Eastland, was among the more than 100 fatalities in the disaster, reportedly dying while trying to save campers from the catastrophic floodwaters.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil has signaled that its second-quarter earnings could be reduced by approximately $1.5 billion compared to the first quarter, primarily due to lower oil and gas prices. In a regulatory filing, the energy giant pointed to an 11% decline in benchmark Brent crude prices during the period. This forecast from the largest U.S. oil producer is often seen as an indicator for the financial performance of the broader energy sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. publicly endorsed Mom's Meals, a company providing taxpayer-funded meals to Medicaid and Medicare patients, praising them as a solution for a healthier America. However, an Associated Press review of the company's menu reveals that many of the meals are ultraprocessed, containing chemical additives and high levels of sodium. This promotion appears to contradict Kennedy's frequent public criticism of ultraprocessed foods and their negative impact on public health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After five consecutive weeks of decline, mortgage rates for a 30-year loan now average 6.75%, providing some relief for potential homebuyers. This trend has occurred while the Federal Reserve has kept its key interest rate steady, indicating other factors are influencing the market. Future rate movements in July will likely depend on the upcoming inflation report and signals from the Fed, but lenders may begin adjusting their offers in anticipation of any future cuts.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI have officially concluded their investigation into theories surrounding Jeffrey Epstein, finding no evidence of a "client list" or of him blackmailing prominent individuals. In a memo, investigators also reaffirmed that Epstein's 2019 death in prison was a suicide, directly contradicting widespread conspiracy theories that he was murdered. This announcement addresses a promise by President Trump to release files on the case, though it has been met with disbelief by some supporters.</p>
