          <p>England is set to face France in a crucial Women's Six Nations match, with France posing a significant threat due to their attacking prowess and tactical kicking game. England's coach, Mitchell, emphasizes the need for accurate kicking to control territory and neutralize France's dangerous backs, particularly scrum-half Pauline Bourdon Sansus. Fly-half Zoe Harrison's tactical kicking is expected to play a key role in finding space behind the French defense. Former England fly-half Katy Daley-Mclean highlights the importance of a strong kicking game to pressure France and prevent them from dominating in England's 22. </p>

          <p>Former President Trump has pardoned Paul Walczak, a Florida health care executive, shortly after his sentencing for tax crimes. Walczak's mother, Elizabeth Fago, a Republican donor, was involved in attempts to publicize Ashley Biden's diary during the 2020 election. The pardon raises questions about potential political motivations, given Fago's role in efforts to undermine Joseph R. Biden Jr. during the campaign. The diary contained sensitive information about Ashley Biden's recovery from addiction.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Louisiana has voiced concerns over the deportation of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras by the Trump administration, potentially against the wishes of the child's father. Judge Terry A. Doughty questioned the legality and constitutionality of deporting a U.S. citizen, even with the mother's consent. He has scheduled a hearing to investigate the matter, asserting that the government may have deported the child without due process.
