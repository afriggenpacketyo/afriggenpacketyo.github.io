          <p>Google is embedding its Gemini artificial intelligence assistant directly into the Chrome browser for all users on Mac, Windows, and mobile devices in the United States. This move aims to counter growing competition from AI-native startups like OpenAI and Perplexity by allowing users to interact with Gemini to understand webpages, manage tabs, and access integrated Google apps like Calendar and Maps without leaving their current page. The integration represents a strategic evolution of the browser into a more powerful, AI-driven tool for information access and task management, reflecting the shifting landscape of online search and user interaction. The new features also include upcoming 'agentic' capabilities that can perform complex tasks like booking appointments or ordering groceries.</p>

          <p>The individual suspected of killing three police officers and wounding two others in York County, Pennsylvania, has been identified as Matthew James Ruth, 24. According to reports, Ruth was being sought on charges of stalking, trespassing, and loitering from a domestic-related investigation that began the previous day. The violent confrontation occurred at a rural farm, where the suspect opened fire on officers before being killed by police in the ensuing shootout. The two injured officers are reported to be in critical but stable condition, and a multi-agency investigation involving the FBI and ATF is currently underway to determine the full circumstances of the tragic event.</p>

          <p>During a joint press conference with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, U.S. President Donald Trump expressed disappointment with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating that Putin had "let me down" regarding the war in Ukraine. Trump suggested he had hoped to broker a peace deal but Putin's actions made it impossible, a shift in tone that was welcomed by British officials. Throughout the press conference concluding his two-day state visit, Trump lauded the UK and the royal family, while also offering advice on using the military to handle irregular migration. The two leaders publicly acknowledged their disagreement on the UK's decision to recognize Palestinian statehood but otherwise presented a united front.</p>

          <p>Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet has accused Thailand's military of forcibly evicting Cambodian civilians from their homes in a disputed border region, escalating tensions between the two nations. In a formal letter to the UN, Manet stated that Thai forces have blocked 25 families from their lands and erected barricades, widening the conflict zone. The accusation follows a recent clash where Thai police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Cambodian protesters, injuring 23 people. Thailand's army maintains that the evicted residents were illegally occupying Thai territory and that force was used in response to provocation from protesters, further straining a fragile ceasefire established in July after deadly clashes.</p>

While some experts draw parallels to the Arab Spring, they note that these decentralized movements are charting their own unique paths post-protest, with outcomes ranging from restored stability in Sri Lanka to ongoing uncertainty in Bangladesh. The trend suggests a significant generational shift in political engagement, powered by digital connectivity and a demand for greater accountability.</p>

In a letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, the representatives cited multiple instances where 'Dreamers' with valid status were arrested and held in harsh conditions. The lawmakers are demanding to know the legal authority being used for these actions and the total number of DACA recipients who have been detained or deported. They argue these enforcement actions disregard legal protections, disrupt families, and inflict unnecessary harm on communities.</p>

These riders, known as escaramuzas, perform synchronized routines on horseback while riding sidesaddle and wearing elaborate 'adelitas' dresses, which honor the women of the Mexican Revolution. The sport demands a deep connection between horse and rider, as well as exceptional balance and precision to execute the elegant, dance-like maneuvers set to mariachi music.

          <p>Following the killing of a conservative activist, President Trump has vowed to designate Antifa, short for anti-fascist, as a "major terrorist organisation." Antifa is not a formal group but a decentralized, leaderless movement of far-left activists who oppose fascism and far-right ideologies, sometimes through violent confrontation. Legal experts question the feasibility of such a designation, as U.S. law primarily allows for labeling foreign organizations as terrorist groups, and there is no established legal mechanism for a domestic equivalent, which could also face First Amendment challenges. While some Antifa-identifying activists have engaged in violence, studies on U.S. political violence have historically indicated that far-right extremism is more prevalent.</p>

The base was vacated during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 under the Biden administration, a move Trump has frequently criticized. The Taliban, which currently controls the base, has previously denied claims that China is occupying the airfield, and Trump did not provide details on any negotiations.</p>

The outcome of this hearing represents a major test of presidential executive power in setting economic policy. A defeat for the administration could force the U.S. to roll back tariffs and potentially repay billions of dollars collected from importers. (not investment advice)</p>

The Solicitor General contends that the president's judgment in such matters should not be subject to judicial review and that Cook is not entitled to due process as a presidential appointee.

Mortgage rates have already declined in anticipation of the cut, offering some relief to prospective homebuyers, though the impact on credit card debt will be minimal due to high existing APRs.

          <p>Magee Capsouto, who was just 11 years old and lived five blocks from the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, shares her story of providing solace through music in the tragedy's aftermath. After witnessing the attack and being displaced from her home, her family opened their nearby restaurant to feed first responders and community members for free. One evening, at a neighbor's suggestion, Capsouto stood on a table and played her violin for the exhausted and grieving crowd, an act she describes as deeply powerful. This experience helped shape her future, leading her to become a professional violinist with the Philly Pops and an advocate for equity in classical music.</p>

She uses weaving to create pieces inspired by medical equipment like tubing and stents, as well as the emotional toll of her work, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ruggiero found that her art became a form of salvation, helping her process the chaos and heartbreak of treating critically ill patients. Her recent work has shifted to focus on the struggles of Philadelphia families affected by gun violence and drug addiction, demonstrating how her creative practice and nursing career are deeply intertwined.</p>

          <p>In her upcoming campaign memoir, "107 Days," Kamala Harris reveals her mortification as her running mate, Tim Walz, "fumbled" a crucial answer during the 2024 vice-presidential debate against JD Vance. Harris writes that Walz fell for Vance's strategy of feigned bipartisanship and failed to effectively counter questions about a past misstatement, instead pivoting to talk about biking in Nebraska. The book also discloses that her first choice for a running mate was then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, but she concluded that selecting a gay man for the ticket, in addition to her own identity as a Black woman, would have been "too big of a risk."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new paper in the journal Nature Food argues that some of the most intense and widespread animal suffering can be prevented for just a few cents per hour. Researchers at the Welfare Footprint Institute calculated that the average factory-farmed chicken, bred for rapid growth, endures approximately 700 hours of pain during its 45-day life. The study proposes that switching to slower-growing chicken breeds, a key tenet of the Better Chicken Commitment, could eliminate about 33 hours of the most severe pain. This welfare improvement would cost producers an estimated 45 cents per pound, translating to a cost of just half a cent to three cents to avert one hour of disabling pain.</p>

          <p>In Long Beach, Minnesota, the state's smallest town with that name, a tiny chapel and an adjacent garden have become a cherished local landmark. The Morning Glory Gardens were established in the 1960s to beautify a swampy area on the shore of Lake Minnewaska, and the small chapel, which seats about 12 people comfortably, was moved to the site in 1981. Maintained by a dedicated caretaker and over 30 volunteers, the site hosts four to eight weddings each year. The tranquil spot offers a place for reflection and has become a point of pride for the small community, drawing visitors from across the country to its serene, colorful setting.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut has a nuanced impact on reverse mortgages, a financial tool used by retirees to access home equity. Unlike traditional mortgages, reverse mortgage rates are not directly tied to the Fed's benchmark and are influenced by a wider range of factors, including lender margins. However, a lower rate environment can still be beneficial, as it can increase the total amount of equity a homeowner is eligible to borrow under FHA formulas. Retirees considering this option should compare offers from multiple lenders and carefully choose between fixed-rate products for predictability and adjustable-rate products to potentially capture further rate declines.

The most significant short-term existential threat to the market, according to the article, is a potential Chinese land invasion of Taiwan.

          <p>Property taxes are a growing financial strain for U.S. homeowners, having increased by over 27% since 2019, according to CoreLogic data. A map based on 2023 Tax Foundation data reveals significant state-by-state disparities, with New Jersey having the highest median annual bill at $9,163 and Alabama the lowest at $786. States without an income tax, such as Texas and New Hampshire, often rely more heavily on property taxes to fund local services, resulting in higher bills. Experts advise prospective homebuyers to budget for potential tax increases by reviewing a property's tax history and anticipating future reassessments to avoid unexpected costs.

The move comes amid ongoing legal challenges against the policy, with the government appealing a High Court decision that temporarily blocked another deportation on modern slavery grounds.
