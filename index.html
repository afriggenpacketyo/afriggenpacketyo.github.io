          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting its benchmark interest rate, financial advisors are recommending investors adjust their portfolios to balance risk and potential earnings. Unlike previous rate-cutting cycles during major economic crises, the current cuts are occurring in a relatively strong economy, creating a unique environment. Advisors suggest strategies such as locking in intermediate-range U.S. Treasury bonds and maintaining a well-diversified equity portfolio without chasing high-flying sectors. The key is to remain disciplined and prepared for shifts in market performance as economic conditions evolve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has publicly refuted claims by David Sacks, President Trump's AI czar, that the company promotes a "woke" agenda. Amodei stated that Anthropic's policy goals, such as establishing a uniform federal approach to AI regulation, align with the Trump administration's objectives. The dispute arose after Sacks criticized the company for what he termed "fear-mongering" to achieve regulatory capture, particularly concerning state-level AI laws in places like California. Amodei emphasized the company's commitment to ensuring AI benefits all Americans and maintaining the nation's leadership in the field.</p>

          <p>Following the theft of eight priceless pieces of jewelry from the Louvre, both the museum and French Culture Minister Rachida Dati have denied that security systems failed. Dati asserted that the security measures functioned as intended, although questions remain about the timeliness of the alarm system's alert. The museum also defended its display cases, stating they were a significant upgrade from previous equipment. The heist, which involved thieves using a ladder to access the Apollo Gallery, has intensified scrutiny on the security of French cultural institutions.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released a white paper detailing significant changes to higher and vocational education, raising questions from students and educators. University tuition fees and maintenance loans are set to increase with inflation annually starting in 2026. For post-GCSE students, new "V-level" qualifications will be introduced from 2027 to streamline and replace the current landscape of vocational courses like many BTecs. The government aims to improve the quality and perception of vocational training, though concerns remain about university finances and the impact on students from lower-income backgrounds.</p>

          <p>Japan has elected Sanae Takaichi as its first-ever female prime minister, a significant milestone for the nation. Takaichi, 64, is known as an ultraconservative member of the Liberal Democratic Party, drawing comparisons to Margaret Thatcher and holding hawkish views on China and immigration. Despite her socially conservative stances, which include advocating for traditional gender roles, her rise from a non-political family is notable in Japanese politics. Her leadership is expected to continue the conservative legacy of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and she has already indicated a friendly posture toward U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis indicates that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are contributing to inflation, with notable price increases in categories like furniture, electronics, and auto parts. The research suggests that importers are passing a significant portion of these tariff costs—estimated at around 35%—directly to consumers. While some businesses are absorbing costs to remain competitive, other studies predict this pass-through rate could increase. These levies are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices, accounting for a noticeable share of recent inflation figures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The French Ministry of Culture has confirmed that the priceless crown jewels stolen from the Louvre were not covered by private insurance. According to French law, collections in national museums are considered state property and are self-insured by the state, meaning they are not insured unless being loaned to another institution. Consequently, neither the museum nor the government will receive any insurance payout to cover the immense value of the stolen items. This revelation adds a significant financial dimension to the loss and further highlights concerns about security vulnerabilities at the world-famous museum.</p>

          <p>A new documentary from filmmaker Raoul Peck, titled "Orwell: 2+2=5," explores the enduring relevance of George Orwell's dystopian novel, "1984." Using archival material from the Orwell estate, the film argues that while generations have recognized the book's prescient warnings about authoritarianism and propaganda, this awareness has led to complacency rather than action. Peck traces how tactics like suppressing truth and twisting language, as described by Orwell, are visible in contemporary politics. The documentary suggests that simply acknowledging Orwellian concepts is insufficient to resist the patterns of authoritarianism that continue to emerge globally.</p>

          <p>U.S. cattle ranchers are expressing concern over President Trump's suggestion to import beef from Argentina, arguing it fails to address fundamental threats to the domestic supply chain. The industry is already contending with the lowest cattle herd inventory since 1951 and a potential comeback of the parasitic screwworm from Mexico. Rancher organizations, like the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, argue that importing beef would create market chaos and harm rural producers without lowering grocery prices. They are urging the government to focus on biosecurity and supporting domestic ranchers rather than intervening in the market.</p>

With no reported deaths and fewer injuries this year, there is cautious optimism about the whales' future. However, conservation groups stress that the species remains dangerously close to extinction and urge the government to strengthen protections against vessel strikes and fishing gear entanglement.</p>

The ruling comes after students and families, represented by the ACLU, filed a lawsuit claiming their First Amendment rights were violated when nearly 600 books were removed. The removals followed executive orders from President Trump and memoranda from the Secretary of Defense prohibiting materials promoting "gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology." The judge determined the removals were based on "improper partisan motivation" rather than pedagogical concerns.</p>

A currency swap would create a financial safety net, providing liquidity during potential crises.
