          <p>Supporters of LGBTQ+ rights are expected to participate in the Budapest Pride march, defying a police ban enacted under new legislation restricting the exposure of non-heterosexual lifestyles to minors. The event has become a symbol of resistance against the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, drawing support from over 30 embassies and European Union officials. Despite the risk of legal penalties, including fines and potential jail time for organizers, the march highlights the growing pressure on civil liberties in Hungary ahead of next year's elections.</p>

          <p>A disagreement has emerged within Germany's coalition government regarding the role of nuclear energy, exposing a rift between the Economy and Environment ministries. Economy Minister Katherina Reiche attended a meeting of pro-nuclear EU states, despite Germany's official phase-out of nuclear power, angering her Social Democratic colleague who oversees nuclear safety. The dispute reflects a broader debate on how to achieve climate neutrality, with some advocating for an "all technologies" approach while others insist on prioritizing renewable energy. This tension is further complicated by plans for new gas-fired power plants, which climate experts warn could jeopardize Germany's 2045 climate goals.</p>

          <p>Peng Wensheng, chief economist at China International Capital Corporation, argues that China possesses a significant advantage in the global race to develop stablecoins due to its mature third-party payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay. He notes that these platforms already function similarly to stablecoins, acting as an extension of legal tender with a 1:1 peg to fiat currency. According to Peng, the existing regulatory framework and safeguards, which back customer funds with central bank money, provide a stable foundation. This perspective comes as Chinese state media encourages policymakers to remain proactive in the evolving landscape of digital finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard University and the University of Toronto have created a joint program to allow international Harvard graduate students to study in Canada if they are barred from the United States due to potential visa restrictions. This contingency plan was developed in response to the Trump administration's efforts to terminate Harvard's ability to enroll international students, a move currently blocked by a federal judge. The program, available to second-year students at Harvard's Kennedy School, would allow them to take courses at Toronto's Munk School if they cannot enter the U.S. The move aims to provide stability for students amid ongoing legal and political uncertainty surrounding U.S. visa policies.</p>

The move, part of Labour's new 10-year health strategy, aims to simplify a system that Health Secretary Wes Streeting described as overly complex, prioritizing "more doers and fewer checkers." Among the bodies to be abolished are Healthwatch England, a patient advocacy group, and the National Guardian's Office, which supports whistleblowers.

The situation highlights the significant power of private, often anonymous, land ownership in rural England and the vulnerability of tenant communities. The article frames the event as a conflict between concentrated wealth and ordinary people, rather than the urban-rural divide often portrayed in cultural debates.</p>

The new decentralized setup, which featured players interacting with team management via a virtual "Draft House," was described as awkward and slow-paced.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-4 victory over the Kansas City Royals, extending their winning streak despite what their manager described as an incomplete performance. The game featured a shaky start from pitcher Dustin May and defensive errors, but the team's offense provided just enough support to win. Shohei Ohtani contributed a leadoff home run and a game-tying RBI triple, while Max Muncy added a two-run homer. The win, sealed by a game-ending double play, pushed the Dodgers into sole possession of the best record in Major League Baseball, showcasing their ability to win even when not at their best.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled 6-3 that parents have a right to be notified and opt their children out of elementary school lessons that use storybooks featuring LGBTQ+ themes, if those lessons conflict with their religious beliefs. The case originated from a lawsuit by parents in Montgomery County, Maryland, who objected to a new curriculum that included nine specific picture books aimed at representing diverse families. The majority opinion stated that the books convey moral messages that can undermine parents' ability to instill their religious principles. The dissenting justices argued that the ruling fails to account for the reality that LGBTQ+ people exist in every community.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores the long-term consequences of a U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East allegedly aimed at ensuring Israel's regional military superiority. The author recounts an anecdote where a U.S. senator purportedly stated the goal regarding Iraq was not regime change, but to reduce its military and technological capacity to a "pre-industrial society." The article suggests this neoconservative-driven agenda became official U.S. policy after the September 11 attacks. It frames the ongoing cycle of violence in the region as a direct fallout from this strategic quest for dominance, which has extended from Iraq to Iran.</p>

          <p>The Chinese solar panel industry is facing a severe downturn, grappling with a domestic supply glut, a fierce price war, and restrictive U.S. tariffs. Prices across the solar supply chain have plummeted by up to 80% since 2023, leading to billions of dollars in losses and pushing dozens of listed producers into the red. The mood at a recent major industry conference in Shanghai was described as weary, with many companies struggling with tight budgets. This double whammy of internal overcapacity and external trade barriers is creating significant uncertainty and financial distress for what was once hailed as a key new economic driver for China.

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh has been added to a class-action lawsuit against the University of Michigan concerning a former assistant coach, Matt Weiss. Weiss is criminally charged with identity theft for allegedly hacking into the accounts of over 2,000 college athletes to find private photos. The updated lawsuit claims Harbaugh and other university officials knew Weiss was viewing private information in December 2022 but allowed him to coach in a playoff game before he was fired weeks later. The plaintiffs argue that this delay demonstrates that student welfare was not prioritized over the high-stakes game.</p>

          <p>Canadian businesses are facing significant challenges and uncertainty due to shifting U.S. trade tariffs, which have disrupted planning and created financial strain. The tit-for-tat tariff war, particularly on metals and autos, has slowed Canada's economy, which is heavily reliant on trade with the United States. Business owners and industry groups are calling for a stable agreement to provide a clear set of rules, as the unpredictable nature of the levies has made long-term investment difficult. President Trump recently terminated trade discussions over Canada's digital services tax, further deepening the uncertainty for companies on both sides of the border. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision has limited the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a ruling that directly impacts legal challenges against President Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself, the decision allows the administration to begin implementing the policy in states not covered by narrower, plaintiff-specific injunctions. This could lead to a significant, albeit potentially temporary, shift in a long-standing legal right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. Many practical questions about implementation remain, and further legal battles over the policy's merits are expected to continue.</p>

          <p>A new study from Tulane University reveals that parts of New Orleans' concrete flood wall system, reinforced after Hurricane Katrina, are sinking at an alarming rate, in some areas up to nearly two inches per year. This subsidence is happening faster than sea-level rise, reducing the effectiveness of the $15 billion flood protection system and increasing flood risk in certain neighborhoods. The research, which used satellite radar data, identified hotspots of sinking land around industrial sites and new developments. Researchers called the findings a "wake-up call" for ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure the city's defenses remain effective against storm surges.</p>
