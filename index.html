The DA argues that the court should possess the most current risk assessments before making any resentencing decisions, citing the brothers' alleged lack of full responsibility for their crimes. Erik and Lyle Menendez were sentenced to life in prison for the 1989 killings of their parents.</p>

This opposition stems from BP's decision to reduce its emissions targets and increase investment in its core hydrocarbon business.
