          <p>The government of Congo and the M23 rebel group, which is backed by Rwanda, have signed a declaration of principles in Qatar aimed at ending their long-running conflict. This agreement commits both sides to a permanent ceasefire and outlines a plan to sign a comprehensive peace deal by mid-August. The conflict in eastern Congo has led to one of the world's most severe humanitarian crises, displacing seven million people. Key unresolved issues include the withdrawal of rebels from seized cities and the cessation of Rwandan support for the M23 group.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 06:11:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for thunderstorms and heavy rain across much of the United Kingdom following a recent heatwave. The alerts, which cover most of England and parts of Scotland, warn of potential travel disruptions, power outages, and flash flooding. The recent dry, baked ground is less able to absorb heavy rainfall, increasing the risk of severe surface water runoff. While a more severe amber warning for London has ended, the threat of localized torrential downpours remains significant for the weekend.</p>

          <p>Syria's presidency has declared an immediate ceasefire in the southern city of Suweida, aiming to halt a week of violent sectarian clashes between local Bedouin tribes and the Druze community. The violence has resulted in hundreds of deaths, with graphic footage showing bodies in the streets. Interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa called for unity and announced that internal security forces would be deployed to enforce the truce. The UN has reported widespread human rights abuses, including summary executions, by all factions involved in the fighting.</p>

          <p>Two leading end-of-life charities in the UK, Marie Curie and Hospice UK, are calling for local councils to exempt people with a terminal diagnosis of less than 12 months from paying council tax. This campaign follows a pioneering move by Manchester City Council, which recently became the first authority to implement such a policy. Proponents argue that a terminal diagnosis often brings a significant income shock while increasing costs, such as for energy to run medical devices. Exempting households from this major bill would provide crucial financial and emotional relief during an incredibly difficult time.</p>

          <p>This opinion article discusses proposals in France and Denmark to eliminate national holidays to boost economic productivity, framing it against President Trump's comments about there being too many holidays, made on Juneteenth. The author argues that while Trump's motivation seems political, the idea of re-evaluating holidays is worth considering. The piece contends that Juneteenth, celebrating the end of slavery, is economically and historically significant and should be protected. If a US holiday were to be cut, the author suggests Thanksgiving, due to its problematic historical origins and commercialization, would be a more appropriate choice.</p>

          <p>Conservationists have successfully confirmed the breeding of the California red-legged frog in Southern California for the first time in 25 years, thanks to the use of artificial intelligence. After reintroducing frog eggs from Mexico's Baja Peninsula, scientists used a custom AI model to analyze thousands of hours of audio recordings from the relocation sites. The AI detected the distinct mating calls of mature male frogs, which had been pushed out of the state decades ago due to habitat loss and other pressures. This technological breakthrough marks a significant milestone in the effort to restore the threatened species.</p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive tariff strategy is creating economic uncertainty, with rising consumer prices challenging his administration's claims of low inflation. The average effective tariff rate is projected to reach its highest level since 1910, a cost that is ultimately passed on to US businesses and consumers. This has put the Federal Reserve in a difficult position, holding interest rates steady to gauge the full impact of the tariffs on inflation. The situation has led to Trump publicly criticizing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, raising concerns about the central bank's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To help people avoid impulsive or emotionally-driven purchases, financial therapists suggest asking a series of self-reflective questions before buying something. Key considerations include whether the purchase fits within your budget without drawing from essential funds and whether it's an attempt to fill an emotional need, such as hunger, anger, or loneliness. Consumers are also encouraged to research products to ensure quality and value, rather than assuming price equals performance. By being more intentional and aware of the motivations behind spending, individuals can make more mindful financial decisions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is facing a federal lawsuit and criticism from Democratic senators over its unprecedented demand for states to hand over the personal data of millions of food assistance recipients. The USDA has required states to submit identifying information, including names and Social Security numbers, for all SNAP applicants and recipients since 2020. A coalition of SNAP recipients and privacy advocates is suing to block the data collection, arguing it violates federal privacy laws and could turn a vital food program into a tool for mass surveillance and immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Texas has enacted a new law, the Life of the Mother Act, intended to clarify when doctors can perform abortions in medical emergencies under the state's restrictive ban. The law specifies that a pregnant woman's death does not need to be "imminent" for the exception to apply and confirms doctors can discuss abortion as a treatment option. However, the law does not add exceptions for sexual assault, incest, or fatal fetal anomalies. While supporters, including some medical groups, see it as a step in the right direction, critics and patients affected by the ban argue it does not go far enough to ensure safety.</p>

Despite facing Islamophobic attacks, Mamdani's rise is seen as a hopeful moment in a city with a history of post-9/11 surveillance of Muslim communities.
