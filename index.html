          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has affirmed the club's adherence to proper procedures concerning former midfielder Thomas Partey, who faces multiple charges of sexual assault. Partey, whose contract ended June 30, was charged four days later with five counts of sexual assault and one count of sexual assault relating to incidents in 2021 and 2022 involving three women. Arteta stated the club was "100%" confident in its handling of the complex legal matters, despite significant public scrutiny and fan questions about the process. Partey denies the allegations and his lawyer indicates he welcomes the opportunity to finally clear his name, with a court appearance scheduled for August.</p>

          <p>Auto giant Stellantis, owner of brands like Jeep and Fiat, projects a net loss of 2.3 billion euros ($2.68 billion) for the first half of the year. This anticipated loss is attributed to substantial pre-tax charges, rising industrial costs, foreign exchange rate shifts, and the early effects of U.S. tariffs. The company also reported a 6% year-on-year drop in second-quarter vehicle shipments, particularly in North America where tariff-impacted imported vehicles saw a 25% decline. Milan-listed shares of Stellantis fell 3% following the preliminary figures, which come after the company suspended its financial guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines and its subsidiary Horizon Air temporarily grounded their entire fleet due to an IT outage on Sunday night, leading to widespread disruptions. The system-wide halt, which began around 8 p.m. Pacific, lasted for approximately three hours before operations resumed by 11 p.m. Pacific. While the immediate ground stop was lifted, the airline anticipates residual impacts to flights as it works to reposition aircraft and crews. The company apologized for the inconvenience and advised passengers to check their flight status, with the cause of the computer issues remaining undisclosed.</p>

          <p>A national inquiry will be held into the 1984 Battle of Orgreave, one of the most violent confrontations during the year-long miners' strike in Britain. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the inquiry, stating it aims to address "unanswered questions for over 40 years" regarding the clash between police and striking miners. Chaired by the Bishop of Sheffield, the inquiry will investigate the day's events, the aftermath, and the collapse of criminal prosecutions against 95 miners due to allegations of falsified evidence. Campaigners, who have sought this inquiry for 13 years, expressed cautious elation, hoping for truth and justice for affected mining communities.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors are increasingly investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track bonds, driving assets under management to over $50 billion by the end of June, a significant rise from $10 billion early last year. This surge is fueled by investors seeking lower costs, diversified exposure, and hedging against China's uncertain economic outlook, including persistent deflation and trade frictions. Bond ETFs offer better liquidity and lower default risks compared to direct corporate debt, with some even usable as collateral. While the central bank warns against excessive bond rallies, these ETFs provide access to higher-yielding corporate notes, attracting private funds and brokerages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Europe's petrochemical industry is undergoing significant contraction, marked by widespread plant closures due to years of losses and intense global competition, particularly from China. High production costs and aging infrastructure are rendering European producers uncompetitive, increasing the region's reliance on imported primary chemicals. Industry leaders warn of "industrial decline," despite the European Commission's pledge to support domestic production and expand state aid. Companies like Eni and Dow are shutting down key units, with up to 40% of the EU's ethylene capacity at risk of closure, raising concerns about job losses and a growing dependency on foreign suppliers.</p>

          <p>Hegang, a Chinese rust-belt city grappling with industrial decline and a shrinking population, is investing significantly in a new airport and bolstering trade with Russia to revitalize its economy. Construction on Luobei Airport, backed by a 1.2 billion yuan investment, is slated to begin soon and open by 2027, aiming to accommodate 450,000 passengers and 1,600 tonnes of cargo annually. This initiative is part of a broader national effort to boost infrastructure in smaller cities and address regional inequality. The city hopes improved air links will attract investment and reverse its economic downturn.</p>

          <p>Fierce price wars are sweeping across Chinese industries, from automobiles to food delivery and solar panels, squeezing profits and exacerbating the country's deflationary trend. While consumers initially benefit from ultra-cheap deals, there are hidden costs, including potential compromises on product safety and quality, as companies cut corners. Beijing is increasingly concerned that this "irrational" competition harms businesses, wages, and tax revenues, urging a shift towards competition based on technology and quality rather than just price. This phenomenon is also impacting global markets, prompting discussions on tariffs and localization of supply chains for Chinese products abroad.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, has lost its majority in the country's upper house, a significant defeat following last year's loss in the more powerful lower house. Despite the "harsh result," Ishiba has stated he has no plans to resign, prioritizing ongoing trade negotiations. The Liberal Democratic Party and its partner Komeito secured only 47 of the needed 50 seats. This outcome underscores widespread voter frustration with rising prices, a cost-of-living crisis, and political scandals, further destabilizing Japan's government at a critical juncture for its economy and international relations.</p>

While not yet FDA-approved for PCOS, the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce weight appears to indirectly alleviate symptoms. Researchers are conducting further trials, but challenges like insurance coverage and the need for more extensive research on long-term effects remain, despite promising anecdotal evidence and early study results.</p>
