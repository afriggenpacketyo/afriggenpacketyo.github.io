        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of nearly 100 pro-life organizations is urging the U.S. Congress to incorporate Hyde Amendment-style protections into any extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies. The groups, led by Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, argue that without explicit restrictions, federal tax dollars could indirectly fund elective abortions through premium tax credits. They contend that the original ACA legislation was structured to bypass long-standing prohibitions on public funding for abortions. Pro-choice advocates counter that these efforts are an attempt to further limit abortion access, which they argue is already restricted under the ACA.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida's Surgeon General, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, confirmed that the state's decision to begin rolling back school vaccine requirements was not based on data analysis of potential disease outbreaks. In a recent interview, Ladapo stated that modeling was unnecessary because the core issue is one of parental rights and bodily autonomy. The policy change begins with dropping requirements for hepatitis B and chickenpox vaccines, with a goal to eventually remove mandates for measles and polio as well. Public health experts and legal scholars have criticized the move, citing over a century of legal precedent supporting vaccine mandates for public safety.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has obtained a collection of documents from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein, including a "birthday book" compiled for his 50th birthday. This book reportedly contains a controversial note allegedly written by Donald Trump, which Democrats on the committee have since publicized. Trump has vehemently denied writing the letter, calling it fake and filing a defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for its initial reporting on the matter. The document release is part of the committee's broader investigation into Epstein's network and finances, following a subpoena issued to the estate's executors.</p>

The incident occurred at a crossing that appeared to lack warning gates or signals, with video showing the bus moving slowly across the tracks into the path of the train. This crash highlights a rising trend of accidents at grade-level crossings in Mexico, as noted by the country's Rail Transportation Regulating Agency. Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the tragic collision, and the train line, Canadian Pacific Kansas City of Mexico, is cooperating.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior trade union leaders in the UK are publicly pressuring the government to pass its proposed Employment Rights Bill without dilution. Speaking at the Trades Union Congress (TUC) conference, General Secretary Paul Nowak expressed concerns that the legislation, which promises to ban zero-hours contracts and enhance protections against unfair dismissal, might be weakened. These fears have been amplified by recent cabinet shuffles and a perceived pro-business shift. Some union leaders have warned that failing to deliver on these pro-worker promises could alienate their base and lead to a re-evaluation of their financial support for the Labour Party.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has initiated a new immigration enforcement operation in Chicago, named "Operation Midway Blitz." The department stated the operation will target "criminal illegal aliens" who it claims were drawn to the city by its sanctuary policies. The announcement has drawn sharp criticism from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who accused the Trump administration of using fear tactics instead of coordinating with local officials on public safety. This move represents an escalation in the ongoing conflict between the federal government and sanctuary cities over immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer has issued a three-game suspension to Inter Miami striker Luis Suárez for his actions during a post-game brawl at the Leagues Cup final. The disciplinary action stems from an incident where Suárez was seen putting an opponent in a headlock and subsequently spitting on a Seattle Sounders security director. The Leagues Cup, which has a separate disciplinary process, issued an even stricter six-game ban. The MLS suspension will sideline Suárez for crucial upcoming matches as Inter Miami competes for a better playoff position, highlighting the league's stance on unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>

This financial milestone comes just two months after Cognition acquired Windsurf, another AI company, following the departure of Windsurf's founders to Google. The funding round was led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and signals strong investor confidence in Cognition's technology. The company reports that its annual recurring revenue has more than doubled since the acquisition, as it integrates Windsurf's capabilities with its own AI development platform.</p>

          <p>A program at Johns Hopkins University's School of Nursing is providing free doula services to expectant mothers in the Baltimore area, aiming to create a more supportive birth experience. The 'Birth Companions' program, now in its 27th year, trains nursing students to offer emotional, informational, and physical support during labor and delivery. These student doulas advocate for patients and act as a bridge to medical staff, but do not replace them. The initiative has gained relevance with a new Maryland law requiring hospitals to facilitate the presence of certified doulas, making these valuable services more accessible.</p>

          <p>A business-led referendum to repeal a new $30 per hour minimum wage for Los Angeles hotel and airport workers has failed to qualify for the ballot. The campaign did not gather enough valid signatures, according to the city clerk's office, meaning the wage ordinance approved by the City Council will proceed. The law mandates phased-in wage increases, reaching $30 an hour by 2028. Labor unions celebrated the outcome as a major victory for working people against corporate interests, while opponents argued the wage hike will jeopardize jobs and harm the city's tourism industry ahead of the 2028 Olympics.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Nature Climate Change finds that rising temperatures are correlated with higher consumption of products with added sugar, such as sodas and ice cream. Researchers analyzed U.S. household food purchase data from 2004 to 2019 and discovered a significant increase in sugar intake when temperatures rose above 68 degrees Fahrenheit. The trend was most pronounced for sweetened beverages and was more significant among lower-income and less-educated groups. The findings suggest a physiological and psychological demand for chilled, hydrating items in warmer weather, which could have public health implications as global temperatures continue to rise.</p>

          <p>The family of a 38-year-old man who died from a pulmonary embolism has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center in California. The lawsuit alleges that Andrew Gabor died after a critical CT scan of his chest, ordered as "STAT" or urgent, was delayed for over 12 hours. Gabor had complained of severe chest pain and symptoms resembling a heart attack while recovering from spinal surgery. The family's suspicions were confirmed by a state investigation which noted the extreme delay for a test that physicians expected to be completed within an hour, leading to the negligence and abuse claims.</p>

          <p>As Americans face over $1.21 trillion in collective credit card debt with high interest rates, this article outlines personalized ways to seek help. One option is to consult a non-profit credit counseling agency, which can create a comprehensive debt management plan and negotiate lower rates with creditors. Another approach is working with a debt relief company that actively negotiates to reduce the total amount owed, though this can impact credit scores. Finally, individuals can proactively contact their credit card issuers directly to inquire about hardship programs or temporary interest rate reductions, which are often available but not widely advertised.

The walkout, organized by the RMT union over pay and a demand for a shorter working week, has shut down most Tube services and is set to continue until Friday morning. Transport for London (TfL) has described the union's demand to reduce the work week from 35 to 32 hours as unaffordable, costing hundreds of millions.

          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected Donald Trump's attempt to overturn an $83.3 million judgment for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The court affirmed the jury's verdict, which followed Carroll's accusation that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s and then defamed her by denying it. The judges dismissed Trump's arguments that the damages were excessive and that a recent Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity should apply to this case. This ruling marks a significant legal setback for the former president in the long-running dispute with Carroll.</p>

The process requires the president and Congress to agree on and pass new budget legislation to fund government operations for the next fiscal year. However, with only three weeks remaining and significant political divisions, prediction markets are placing the odds of a shutdown at approximately 50%. This recurring fiscal cliffhanger highlights the persistent challenges and partisan gridlock that characterize the federal budget process in the United States.</p>
