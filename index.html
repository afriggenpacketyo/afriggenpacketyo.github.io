          <p>President Trump signed an executive order establishing "Gold Card" visas, offering an expedited path to permanent residency for non-Americans who donate at least $1 million to the Commerce Department, or $2 million for corporate sponsorship. Approximately 80,000 such visas will be available, replacing existing EB-1 and EB-2 programs. Additionally, a new $100,000 fee was imposed on H-1B visas, a move criticized by some as a crackdown on foreign workers but defended by the administration as a way to prioritize American jobs. A potential "Platinum Card" for extended tax-free stays is also under consideration, requiring congressional approval.</p>

          <p>The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, warned that the decision to drop charges against two men accused of spying for China could leave parliament exposed to foreign espionage. Christopher Berry and Christopher Cash, who denied the allegations, were charged under the Official Secrets Act but the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) halted proceedings due to insufficient evidence. This move has drawn criticism from the Home Office and the Speaker, who is considering private action and believes the decision sets a dangerous precedent for national security.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, resigned after President Trump publicly stated he wanted him removed. Sources indicate Siebert faced pressure to prosecute New York Attorney General Letitia James for alleged mortgage fraud, but his office found insufficient evidence. Trump cited Siebert's support from Democratic senators as a reason for wanting him out. James, who previously won a civil fraud suit against Trump, dismissed the allegations as a "revenge tour," while her lawyer condemned the incident as an attack on the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz strongly criticized Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr, likening his threats against ABC over Jimmy Kimmel's suspension to "mafioso" tactics. Kimmel was indefinitely suspended after comments about the Charlie Kirk murder suspect. While Cruz expressed satisfaction with Kimmel's suspension, he warned that government regulation of media content, as implied by Carr's remarks, is "dangerous as hell" and could ultimately harm conservatives. President Trump, however, publicly disagreed with Cruz, defending Carr as a "patriot" and suggesting networks providing "bad publicity" might be using airwaves "illegally."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A prominent Japanese defense researcher warned that the United States' declining interest in regional relations and its weakening partnership with India are eroding American-led alliances in Asia, creating opportunities for China. Specifically, the researcher cited President Trump's loss of interest in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) and the deteriorating US-India partnership as significant concerns.

          <p>President Trump announced that he ordered a third lethal kinetic strike against a vessel in international Caribbean waters, claiming it was trafficking illicit narcotics and affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization. This marks the second such strike this week, resulting in the deaths of three individuals labeled "narcoterrorists." The administration has categorized drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, justifying military force. Critics question the legal basis for these strikes, which depart from traditional Coast Guard law enforcement methods, raising concerns about potential war crimes.</p>

The process for revoking a license is complex and subject to legal challenges, typically involving issues like obscenity or children's programming, not political content.

          <p>Supermodel David Gandy, reflecting on his nearly 25-year career, expressed significant concern about artificial intelligence (AI) posing an "existential threat" to the fashion industry. He highlighted the increasing use of AI-generated models in campaigns, which he fears could render human models, photographers, and other creative professionals redundant. Gandy, along with over 2,000 other models, is advocating for government regulation to protect individuals' rights against AI "scraping" of imagery. He also voiced worries about the potential mental health impact of AI-generated imagery on young people, urging for careful management of this evolving technology.</p>

          <p>Kenyan long-distance runner Evans Kibet, now a prisoner-of-war in Ukraine, alleges he was duped into joining the Russian army after being offered a trip to Russia for races. Kibet claims he unknowingly signed military papers, had his passport confiscated, and was threatened into service, receiving only a week of basic training before escaping. Ukrainian officials confirmed foreign recruits are held, often deceived or joining voluntarily. Kibet's family in Kenya is traumatized but relieved he is safe with Ukrainian forces, appealing to Kenyan authorities for his repatriation, as many African states show little interest in returning such citizens.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia has revived the Soviet-era "Intervision Song Contest," a brainchild of Vladimir Putin, aiming to foster international cultural cooperation and provide an alternative to Eurovision, from which Russia was banned. The contest features 23 countries, reflecting Russia's political and economic alliances across Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America, including the United States. While Russia frames it as a cultural event, Ukraine's foreign ministry condemns it as "hostile propaganda" to divert attention from the war. The event emphasizes traditional values and state promotion of arts, with no public vote, highlighting its geopolitical rather than purely artistic focus.</p>

          <p>Major US tech companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google, have announced significant investments in the UK, particularly in AI infrastructure and research. This influx of capital, exemplified by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's declaration of the UK as an "AI superpower," comes amidst a perceived "bromance" between the US administration and UK government on tech policy. While some critics, like former Deputy PM Sir Nick Clegg, warn of the UK becoming dependent on "crumbs from Silicon Valley," proponents believe this investment could redefine the UK economy for decades, fostering growth and innovation, though questions remain about job displacement and equitable distribution of benefits.

          <p>Actor Cillian Murphy stated he is vastly different from his "Peaky Blinders" character, Tommy Shelby, emphasizing he is not a "psychopathic gangster." Murphy described playing Shelby for a quarter of his life as a "gift and a privilege," noting the show's unexpected impact and longevity. While a "Peaky Blinders" film is in the works with a secretive plot, Murphy is also promoting his new film, "Steve," where he portrays a headteacher battling personal demons and the challenges of a 1990s reform school. He highlighted the film as a "love letter to teachers."</p>

          <p>Federal law enforcement agents used teargas and pepper balls to disperse approximately 100 protesters, including congressional candidates, outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Chicago. Demonstrators attempted to block government vehicles during "Operation Midway Blitz," a crackdown on immigration. At least three arrests were made amidst clashes where masked agents fired projectiles from a rooftop. The Department of Homeland Security defended the actions, stating those impeding ICE operations side with "vicious cartels." Critics, including Illinois's Lieutenant Governor, condemned the use of force against peaceful demonstrators as a "violent abuse of power."</p>

          <p>UCLA has enacted new campus protest rules, some aligning with Trump administration demands, while others expand free speech zones. The guidelines, which formalize interim policies, ban unauthorized overnight encampments and mask use when violating policy, particularly in Royce Quad, a site cited by the Trump administration for pulling $584 million in research funding due to alleged antisemitism. UCLA states the rules are content-neutral and reflect best practices, not a direct response to federal demands, despite pressure on universities regarding sensitive comments and immigration enforcement. The policies aim to balance free speech with campus safety and adherence to law.</p>

A Secret Service agent testified to foiling Routh's alleged attempt to shoot Trump, while an FBI agent detailed Routh's month-long surveillance of Trump's movements using multiple cell phones and surveillance video. Evidence presented included Routh's purchase of a rifle and his inquiries about more powerful weapons. Routh, representing himself, plans to call a firearms expert and character witnesses when his defense case begins, despite setbacks in subpoenaing witnesses.</p>
