          <p>President Donald Trump commuted the federal prison sentence of Larry Hoover, the founder of the Gangster Disciples. Hoover, 74, was serving six life sentences for conspiracy, extortion, drug, and other criminal charges. Hoover's lawyer Justin Moore posted online that Hoover was released from federal prison, and that Illinois must send him home for good. While in prison, Hoover has publicly disavowed gang life and advocated for criminal justice reform, though authorities have alleged that he continued to promote Gangster Disciples members while incarcerated.</p>

          <p>A large mass of rock and ice from a glacier crashed down a Swiss mountainside, causing a landslide that buried most of the village of Blatten. Authorities had evacuated the village earlier this month as a precaution, but one 64-year-old man remains missing. The regional government said a large chunk of the Birch Glacier above the village had broken off, causing the landslide, which also buried the nearby Lonza River bed, raising the possibility of dammed water flows. Swiss glaciologists have expressed concerns about a thaw in recent years, attributed in large part to global warming, that has accelerated the retreat of glaciers in Switzerland.</p>

Nvidia has been seen by investors as a bellwether for the broader semiconductor industry and artificial intelligence-related stocks, with its latest strong numbers sparking a rally among global semiconductor names.

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that while President Trump's approach to the war in Ukraine has been flawed, he is correct about the need to end the conflict. The board suggests that an American withdrawal would embolden Putin, while other European powers would continue to support Ukraine. Instead, Trump should increase pressure on both sides to reach a deal, leveraging potential economic sanctions on Russia. A likely deal would involve Russia retaining control of territory in eastern and southern Ukraine, while Ukraine receives security guarantees and closer integration into the European economy.</p>

          <p>Ibram X. Kendi argues that the Trump administration is systematically attacking Black history by purging content, removing books, and cutting funding to historical institutions. He draws a parallel to the Atlanta Race Massacre of 1906, where false accusations fueled violence against Black Atlantans. Kendi asserts that the administration's framing of Black history as ‚ÄúD.E.I.‚Äù harming white Americans is a tactic to justify attacks on Black history, similar to the justifications used by the Ku Klux Klan. He concludes that President Trump's actions undermine the opportunity for all Americans to understand the enduring impact of racial inequity.</p>

          <p>Reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, known for "Chrisley Knows Best," were pardoned by President Donald Trump after serving two and a half years in prison for bank fraud and tax evasion.

Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, claimed that prosecutors had her father's head "on a dart board" before his prison sentence.

          <p>The NBA is exploring a partnership with FIBA to create a new professional basketball league in Europe, raising questions about the future of EuroLeague and the impact on European basketball culture. The proposed league could cost $500 million to enter a team, and may include existing clubs and newly formed franchises in major European cities. While the NBA's marketing power could benefit European basketball, concerns remain about diluting the level of play, commercializing the game, and disrupting the traditions and fan loyalty that define European basketball. A key challenge is balancing the NBA's entertainment-focused model with Europe's deep-rooted basketball culture.</p>

          <p>Hungary, under Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n, inspires U.S. conservatives despite critics labeling his rule an "electoral autocracy." Orb√°n has been accused of remaking the courts, stifling independent press, and passing laws to consolidate power. The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) has convened in Budapest for four consecutive years, symbolizing the cross-cultural cooperation. Orb√°n's unapologetic style on issues like immigration and minority rights has influenced American conservatives. Analysts warn that Orb√°n's playbook could be replicated in the U.S., pointing to Project 2025 as a blueprint.</p>

          <p>Experts are worried about the safety of the food supply due to massive cuts by the Trump administration to the FDA, USDA, and CDC. These agencies coordinate the food safety surveillance system, while state and local regulators conduct inspections. Concerns include the loss of expertise from job cuts and policy moves like the rollback of USDA food-safety rules. The CDC said its work continues, but many state and local food-safety programs historically funded by the CDC are at risk, potentially delaying warnings and affecting national data.</p>

The court found the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize the use of tariffs. The White House immediately appealed and it was unclear if Trump would abide by the ruling in the interim. The future for the S&P 500 was up 1.5% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2%. The ruling also pushed the dollar sharply higher against the Japanese yen.

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping reaffirmed plans for manufacturing-led growth, a strategy criticized by the U.S. and major trade partners for deepening global trade imbalances. Xi told workers at a state-owned ball-bearing factory that self-reliance in advanced manufacturing is "the right path" for China and the "backbone" of its economy. However, there is "little scope" for China to budge and scale back its manufacturing-led strategy, which is closely tied to Beijing's drive for self-reliance, said Allan von Mehren, China economist at Danske Bank. The "Made in China 2025" ten-year plan aimed to transform China into a leading high-end manufacturer.</p>

          <p>Complaints about substandard living conditions in social housing in England are more than five times higher than five years ago, according to the housing watchdog. The Housing Ombudsman Richard Blakeway told the BBC an "imbalance of power" in the tenant-landlord relationship was leading to "simmering anger" among those living in social housing. He warned without change England risked the "managed decline" of social housing. The ombudsman's report found that an estimated 1.5 million children in England live in a non-decent home in 2023, and 19% of those live in social housing.</p>

The UK's military cyber operations will be overseen by a new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command.

          <p>The Women's US Open is coming at a crucial moment for the game, and the ebullient Whan, better than most golf executives, understands such dynamics. There was an early setback when players failed to turn up for an important sponsor dinner they were expected to attend. A proposed merger with the Ladies European Tour looked certain to be completed but came to nothing. The new commissioner has to reconnect with players and sponsors and "get the tour back to where it was when Mike Whan left it".</p>
