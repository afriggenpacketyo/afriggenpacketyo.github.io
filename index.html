        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moody's Ratings has lowered the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns over the increasing federal government debt and the rising costs of financing the budget deficit amid high interest rates. The agency highlighted the failure of successive administrations to address the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. This downgrade aligns Moody's with other major rating agencies like Standard & Poor's and Fitch, which had previously lowered the U.S. rating. The decision is expected to marginally increase yields on U.S. Treasury debt and could negatively impact investor sentiment towards U.S. assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court has upheld an injunction temporarily blocking the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act, remanding the case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to determine the time afforded to detainees to contest removals. The majority stated that the government did not provide adequate time or information for migrants to challenge their cases, emphasizing the weighty interests at stake for the detainees. President Trump criticized the ruling, while the ACLU praised the court's decision. The court's order prevents removals under the Alien Enemies Act, but the government may pursue removals under other lawful authorities.</p>

The family is upset that Georgia's law, which restricts abortion after cardiac activity is detected, doesn't allow relatives to have a say in whether a pregnant woman is kept on life support.

          <p>Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates believes that Vladimir Putin aims to recreate the Russian empire and will not back down in Ukraine. Gates stated that Putin views Ukraine as essential to the Russian Empire's existence, echoing Zbigniew Brzezinski's sentiment. Despite President Trump's promises of a swift end to the war, Gates believes Putin is unwilling to make major concessions and wants Ukraine to be a client state of Russia. The conflict in Ukraine dates back to 2014, and Putin's determination remains unwavering despite significant losses and economic strain.</p>

          <p>A new CDC study estimates that hundreds of lives could be saved annually through increased use of life jackets and better pool fencing. The research, one of the last from the agency's injury prevention experts before recent layoffs, found that in 2022, 51 drowning deaths could have been prevented with better pool fencing, and 297 with life jackets during boating accidents. The study highlights the potential for saving lives and reducing economic costs through greater adherence to these safety measures. The agency's injury prevention researchers were among the teams that were eliminated at the agency's injury center.</p>

          <p>Democratic-led states, long confident in their ability to provide state-funded benefits to undocumented immigrants, are facing increasing pressure from the Trump administration and congressional Republicans. The federal government is using various means to penalize states that continue these programs, including executive orders and potential cuts to Medicaid funding. While some Democratic leaders cite budget constraints as the reason for scaling back immigrant benefits, others fear that these actions are driven by anti-immigrant sentiment and could undermine the party's commitment to immigrant communities.</p>
