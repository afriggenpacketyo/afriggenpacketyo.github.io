          <p>An amusement park ride in Porthcawl, Wales, malfunctioned, causing a cart to derail from its track. The incident on the "Wacky Worm" rollercoaster resulted in minor injuries to thirteen children and one adult, with seven individuals requiring hospital treatment. A witness described a metal railing falling onto a pram, narrowly avoiding more serious harm to an infant. The park, which is slated for redevelopment, will remain closed while police and safety officials conduct an investigation into the third-party owned ride.</p>

          <p>Over 120 scholars have signed an open letter condemning a Harvard University publisher for canceling a special issue of the Harvard Educational Review focused on Palestine. The academics describe the move as censorship and an example of "anti-Palestinian discrimination," stifling academic examination of the conflict amid the war in Gaza. The publisher cited issues with the review process, but editors and authors contend the cancellation is a capitulation to political pressure and an infringement on academic freedom.</p>

          <p>A second participant has been removed from the current season of the BBC's MasterChef at their own request, following a recent controversy involving the show's hosts. This follows the removal of another contestant, Sarah Shafi, for similar reasons after claims against hosts Gregg Wallace and John Torode were upheld. The BBC decided to air the pre-filmed series to honor the work of the other chefs, though episodes appear to be edited to feature less interaction with the hosts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury has sanctioned thirteen Mexican companies and four individuals for their role in a timeshare scam targeting elderly Americans. The network is accused of working with the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) to defraud victims of millions of dollars. This action is part of a broader U.S. effort to dismantle the financial operations of the violent cartel, which is also a major producer and trafficker of fentanyl.</p>

          <p>As President Trump and President Putin prepare for their summit, their primary goals appear to diverge significantly. Analysts suggest Putin seeks global recognition, a validation that Western isolation efforts have failed, and concrete territorial gains in Ukraine. Conversely, Trump is seen as driven by a desire to be a global peacemaker, potentially earning a Nobel Peace Prize, though his vacillating statements make his precise negotiating strategy difficult to predict.</p>

          <p>Aviva's chief executive, Amanda Blanc, has asserted the company's unwavering commitment to its net zero climate goals, despite increasing political pushback against such initiatives in the U.S. and U.K. Blanc emphasized that addressing climate change is crucial for the insurance business itself, citing the rising frequency of extreme weather events like floods and wildfires that impact property insurability. The statement comes as some major U.S. banks have withdrawn from climate alliances, creating a schism in the financial sector over green commitments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent sightings of rabbits in Colorado with horn-like growths have been attributed to the Shope papillomavirus, a relatively common and mostly harmless disease. The virus causes wart-like tumors that can resemble horns, inspiring the folklore of the "jackalope." Wildlife officials have assured the public that the virus is not a cause for panic, as it cannot be transmitted to humans or other animals and an infected rabbit's immune system can often fight it off.</p>
