The administration plans to send letters to numerous countries, particularly those with the largest trade deficits with the U.S., outlining the new terms. While officials suggest some flexibility may be granted for nations negotiating in good faith, the move signals a hardline stance intended to accelerate deal-making and reshape global trade relationships.

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina, bringing heavy rain and significant flooding concerns to the Carolinas. The system prompted flood watches across central North Carolina and south-central Virginia, with some areas experiencing rapid river surges and road collapses. While the storm is weakening as it moves north, authorities continue to warn of dangerous surf conditions and the ongoing risk of flash floods from the persistent rainfall.</p>

          <p>Campaigners are urging UK ministers not to eliminate Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) for children with special needs and disabilities, calling them vital legal protections. The government has not ruled out scrapping the plans, describing the current system as complex, which has drawn criticism from shadow ministers. This debate occurs as new data shows a nearly 11% increase in the number of children with EHCPs, highlighting the growing reliance on these legally binding support documents.</p>

          <p>A senior South African police commissioner has accused the country's police minister and other top officials of interfering in investigations into political assassinations to protect connected individuals. The allegations have been labeled a matter of "grave national security concern" by President Cyril Ramaphosa, prompting widespread calls from lawmakers for an urgent parliamentary debate and an independent inquiry. The controversy highlights deep-seated concerns about corruption within the police service and its impact on combating South Africa's high rate of violent crime.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after the 7/7 London bombings, this analysis examines the evolution of the UK's counter-terrorism capabilities and the changing nature of the threat. While the state has developed highly sophisticated surveillance tools and legal powers, the threat itself has become more complex and decentralized. The focus has shifted from hierarchical groups like al-Qaeda to rapidly self-radicalized lone actors inspired by online propaganda, including from the far-right, presenting a more unpredictable challenge for security services.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell by over 1% after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) agreed to a larger-than-expected production hike for August. The move to release 548,000 more barrels per day into the market is seen as an aggressive bid for market share, raising concerns about potential oversupply.
