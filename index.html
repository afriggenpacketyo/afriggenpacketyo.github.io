          <p>Hamas representatives have confirmed the start of a new round of ceasefire negotiations with Israel in Doha, Qatar, occurring shortly after Israel initiated a major offensive in Gaza, dubbed "Operation Gideon's Chariots." Taher al-Nounou, a Hamas official, stated that the talks are addressing all issues without preconditions, while Israel aims to seize strategic areas and free hostages. The Israeli military has reportedly struck over 150 targets in Gaza over the past 24 hours, as the humanitarian crisis deepens due to aid blockades and increasing casualties. The article notes that the United States President concluded his Middle East tour without achieving a ceasefire agreement.</p>

          <p>Hamas official Taher al-Nono told Reuters that a new round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations between Hamas and Israel is underway in Qatar's Doha. He said the two sides were discussing all issues without "pre-conditions". The negotiations come despite Israel preparing to expand operations in the Gaza Strip as they seek "operational control" in some areas of the war-torn enclave. The return to negotiations also comes after U.S. President Donald Trump ended a Middle East tour on Friday with no apparent progress towards a new ceasefire, although he acknowledged Gaza's growing hunger crisis and the need for aid deliveries.</p>

These Active Clubs, smaller networks of white supremacist groups, bond over white nationalist ideologies and maintain a robust online presence to encourage young men to become radicalized. Since 2023, hate groups have increased by 14%, and Active Clubs have a presence in at least 34 states. The clubs host training sessions, create propaganda videos, and participate in demonstrations, pushing male supremacy ideology and encouraging each other to reach peak physicality.</p>

          <p>Moody's Ratings has downgraded the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing the increasing burden of financing the federal government's budget deficit and rising interest costs. The downgrade reflects concerns that successive administrations have failed to address large annual fiscal deficits. Moody's expects federal deficits to widen to nearly 9% of GDP by 2035, driven by increased interest payments, rising entitlement spending, and relatively low revenue generation. The agency's decision aligns with similar downgrades by Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings.</p>

          <p>Over half of female business leaders in Japan doubt the country will achieve its target of having women occupy 30% of top corporate roles by 2030. A survey of 41 senior women, including CEOs and auditors, revealed that 73% believe a shift in top management's views is needed, while 54% cited the need to change company culture. The respondents attributed the imbalance to traditional gendered divisions of labor and work-life balance issues.

          <p>Provisional figures from the CDC indicate that drug overdose deaths in the US have declined significantly in 2024, with approximately 27,000 fewer deaths compared to 2023. This represents the steepest single-year decline in overdose deaths in 45 years, bringing the numbers back to pre-pandemic levels. The decline is widespread across 45 states and is largely attributed to the increased availability of naloxone, telehealth access to addiction treatment, and tougher enforcement on fentanyl. However, deaths from stimulants like meth and cocaine are rising, and proposed budget cuts to naloxone distribution pose a threat.</p>
