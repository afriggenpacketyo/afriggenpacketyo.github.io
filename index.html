            <p>A shooting at Florida State University in Tallahassee resulted in at least one fatality and six injuries, with the suspect in custody after being shot by law enforcement. The incident occurred near the Student Union, prompting a campus-wide shelter-in-place order that has since been lifted after the campus was secured. Students described scenes of panic and fear as they barricaded themselves in classrooms, awaiting instructions from authorities. The shooting has prompted FSU to cancel classes through Friday and has sparked renewed calls for gun reform from advocates touched by the tragedy, as well as statements from President Trump and DHS Secretary Noem.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s recent comments about autism have sparked backlash from parents and experts who say his remarks reinforce harmful stereotypes and ignore the diversity of people on the autism spectrum. Kennedy's characterization of autism as a condition that "destroys families" and prevents individuals from leading fulfilling lives has been widely criticized. Advocates emphasize that autism is a spectrum disorder with varying levels of support needed, and many individuals with autism lead successful and meaningful lives.

This report marks a shift in Netflix's strategy, as the company will no longer disclose quarterly subscriber data, focusing instead on revenue and financial metrics.

            <p>The IRS is reportedly considering rescinding Harvard University's tax-exempt status following a request from Treasury Department officials, a move that comes amid escalating tensions between the university and the Trump administration. President Trump has publicly suggested Harvard should be taxed as a political entity, alleging it is not acting in the public interest. Harvard argues there is no legal basis for revoking its tax-exempt status, which allows it to allocate more resources to scholarships, research, and innovation. This development follows the administration's recent cancellation of billions in grants and contracts with Harvard.</p>

            <p>Dozens of Democratic lawmakers are raising concerns that President Trump's tariff-heavy trade agenda is creating opportunities for corruption and self-dealing. In a letter to administration officials, the Democrats requested details on plans to prevent the misuse of tariffs for personal enrichment. As the minority party, their ability to compel a response is limited, but the letter underscores their focus on Trump's handling of the economy as they resist his second term. The Democrats are homing in on the potential for undue influence and conflicts of interest arising from the administration's trade policies.</p>

            <p>A federal court denied the Trump administration's appeal in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The court condemned the government's unwillingness to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S., calling it "shocking" and a violation of due process. The judges emphasized the importance of the rule of law and urged the Executive Branch to rectify the situation. This ruling requires government officials to be deposed about their efforts to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return.</p>
