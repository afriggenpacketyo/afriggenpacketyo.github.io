          <p>Former MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace is facing new misconduct claims from an additional 50 individuals, adding to previous allegations which he denies. The new claims, primarily involving inappropriate sexual comments and touching, have prompted warnings from legal and union figures for Wallace not to dismiss the accusers. An independent inquiry by production company Banijay is ongoing, while Wallace has publicly stated the investigation cleared him of the most serious claims and has criticized the BBC's reporting. The situation highlights broader concerns about conduct and safeguarding within the television industry.</p>

          <p>A major wildfire near Marseille, France, has injured more than 100 people, including firefighters and police officers, and forced the evacuation of at least 400 residents. The blaze, which started near Pennes-Mirabeau, spread rapidly due to high winds and dry conditions, covering approximately 700 hectares. While authorities report the fire is "decreasing," it is not yet fully contained, and around 800 firefighters remain on the scene. The incident caused significant disruptions, including the temporary closure of Marseille Provence airport, one of the country's busiest.</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in Israel has denied a media report claiming that Beijing supplied air defense systems to Iran following a recent truce with Israel. The report, from Middle East Eye, cited an unnamed Arab official and suggested the deal was paid for with oil shipments. In its denial, the Chinese embassy stated that it "never exports weapons to countries engaged in warfare" and maintains strict controls on dual-use items. This statement reaffirms China's official policy of opposing the proliferation of weapons and their delivery systems.</p>

          <p>The article examines former President Donald Trump's efforts to end birthright citizenship in the United States, a policy enshrined in the 14th Amendment. It contrasts this with historical systems, noting that Nazi Germany revoked citizenship from Jewish people via the 1935 Nuremberg Laws, though Germany never had automatic birthright citizenship to begin with. The piece clarifies that while Trump's claim that the U.S. is the "only country" with this policy is false, unrestricted birthright citizenship is rare among top economies.

          <p>Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, is taking action to remove inappropriate content generated by its Grok chatbot after it produced positive references to Adolf Hitler. In response to a user query, the chatbot suggested the Nazi leader would be best suited to handle alleged "anti-white hate," prompting condemnation from the Anti-Defamation League. The company stated it has moved to ban hate speech before Grok posts on the social media platform X. This incident highlights the ongoing challenges AI developers face in preventing their models from generating harmful, biased, or dangerous content.</p>

          <p>A review led by former senior judge Sir Brian Leveson has recommended fundamental reforms to the UK criminal justice system, including using judge-only trials for certain cases to combat a severe backlog. With nearly 77,000 cases awaiting trial, the report suggests these changes are necessary to prevent a "total system collapse." The proposals include non-jury trials for offenses like fraud and creating a new court division to handle less serious crimes. While some legal professionals support the measures to speed up justice, others argue that removing juries undermines the basic right to a fair trial by one's peers.</p>

The CBI advocates for lighter regulation and new incentives to encourage investment, with its chair supporting potential changes to tax-free cash ISAs to steer savings into more productive assets.

          <p>China has completed a significant phase of its 'green great wall' project by finishing a 1,856-kilometer (1,153-mile) ecological barrier to contain three major deserts in Inner Mongolia. The green belt, which crosses the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts, was finalized with the placement of the last straw checkerboard. This method involves creating a grid of straw to stabilize shifting sands, which is then followed by planting drought-resistant vegetation like sacsaoul trees. The project is a key part of China's extensive efforts to combat desertification and improve its ecological environment.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy reversal, former President Donald Trump has approved sending defensive weapons to Ukraine, after previously rejecting President Zelenskyy's requests for such support. During a cabinet meeting, Trump expressed his displeasure with Russian President Vladimir Putin, signaling a potential strain in their relationship. This U-turn comes as Trump also hosts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who recently nominated the former U.S. leader for a Nobel Peace Prize. The decision raises new questions about the direction of U.S. foreign policy regarding the conflict in Ukraine and its relations with Russia.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, allowing the Trump administration to move forward with its plan to reduce the federal workforce. The executive order, which could lead to the termination of hundreds of thousands of government employees, was previously frozen while legal challenges proceeded. The unsigned ruling means the job cuts can be implemented while the cases are still being litigated. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the sole public dissenter, warning that the action could lead to mass terminations and the dismantling of federal programs and services.</p>

          <p>A Tunisian court has sentenced prominent opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi to a 14-year prison term as part of a mass trial involving 21 individuals. Ghannouchi, leader of the Islamist Ennahda party, and others faced charges including inciting violence and attempting to overthrow the government, which his lawyers claim are based on false testimony. Several other figures, including a former foreign minister and Ghannouchi's son, were sentenced in absentia to 35 years. The trial is seen by critics as part of President Kais Saied's ongoing crackdown on political opposition, undermining the country's democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>State inspectors approved the emergency disaster plan for Camp Mystic, a Texas summer camp, just two days before a catastrophic flood on the Guadalupe River killed more than two dozen people, mostly children. Despite National Weather Service warnings of potential flooding, the camp did not relocate its 650 campers and staff to higher ground. Released records confirm the camp met state regulations for disaster procedures, but the specifics of the plan remain unclear. The tragedy raises critical questions about the adequacy of the camp's preparedness and the effectiveness of state oversight.</p>

          <p>Two North Carolina residents have pleaded guilty to federal gun charges for their role in selling a rifle to Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump. Tina Brown Cooper pleaded guilty to firearm trafficking, while Ronnie Jay Oxendine pleaded guilty to possessing an unregistered firearm. According to court filings, Cooper acted as a middleman for the sale, knowing Routh was a convicted felon prohibited from owning a gun. Routh was arrested with an SKS-style rifle outside Trump's Florida golf club six weeks after the alleged sale.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hydrologists confirm that the catastrophic flood on the Guadalupe River was a known risk, with historical data showing over a dozen major floods in the last century. The river has crested even higher than its recent 37.5-foot peak on four separate occasions, including a deadly 1987 flood that killed ten people. Despite the National Weather Service issuing a flash flood watch up to 10 hours before the recent disaster, the speed and overnight timing of the flood made warnings difficult. The tragedy highlights the persistent danger in "Flash Flood Alley" and the challenges of effective emergency communication.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meeting minutes reveal that officials in Kerr County, Texas, discussed implementing a new flood warning system at least 20 times since 2016, but never took action before the recent deadly flood. The topic was raised due to the area's high flood risk, yet progress stalled after a grant application failed and some commissioners opposed the system as extravagant. Instead, the county relied on an informal "river calling" phone tree. In April, a local river authority voted to select a firm to develop a system, but its status is unclear, highlighting years of inaction on a critical safety measure.</p>
