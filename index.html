          <p>Shares of CoreWeave, a cloud infrastructure provider for AI, increased by nearly 8% following the disclosure of a major agreement with Nvidia. The deal obligates Nvidia to purchase at least $6.3 billion of CoreWeave's unsold computing capacity through April 2032, highlighting the strong partnership between the two companies. CoreWeave, which went public in March and is backed by Nvidia, heavily relies on Nvidia's GPUs to serve its clients, including major tech firms like Google and Microsoft. This agreement follows another significant contract for CoreWeave with OpenAI, valued at $11.9 billion over five years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market is approaching new record highs, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq showing significant gains. The rally is partly driven by strong performances from major tech companies, including a 2.8% rise in Tesla's stock after Elon Musk purchased approximately $1 billion worth of shares. Additionally, Alphabet's market value surpassed $3 trillion, joining a small group of companies at that level. Investors are now closely watching for the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates, which is widely expected to be the first cut of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Guest-hosting "The Charlie Kirk Show," Vice President JD Vance condemned what he termed the "far left" for its perceived tolerance of political violence following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Speaking from his White House office, Vance, along with adviser Stephen Miller, vowed that the administration would use government resources to dismantle networks they claim promote violence. Vance asserted that this is not a "both-sides problem," citing a poll to argue that the left is more likely to defend political violence. The broadcast also featured tributes from Kirk's allies, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

          <p>A 15-year-old boy has died after being stabbed in the Moss Side area of Manchester. Greater Manchester Police responded to reports of a disturbance involving multiple people on Monday afternoon. Upon arrival, officers found the teenager with stab wounds; he was treated at the scene and in the hospital but was ultimately pronounced dead. Authorities have implemented a Section 60 order, granting them increased stop-and-search powers in the area, and are appealing to the public for any information regarding the tragic incident.</p>

          <p>Constance Marten, a British aristocrat, and her partner, Mark Gordon, have each been sentenced to 14 years in prison for the manslaughter of their newborn daughter, Victoria. The judge described their actions as "neglect of the gravest and most serious type," stating the baby likely died from hypothermia while the couple was living in a tent in freezing temperatures. The pair went on the run to avoid having their fifth child taken into care, as their previous four children had been. Victoria's body was later discovered in a shopping bag, leading to their conviction.</p>

          <p>An endangered Southern Resident orca, identified as J36, has been observed carrying her deceased newborn calf in the Salish Sea. This behavior, interpreted by researchers as an act of mourning or an attempt at revival, highlights the severe challenges facing this orca population. High calf mortality among these whales is linked to a shortage of their primary food source, Chinook salmon, as well as pollution and vessel noise. This is not an isolated incident; another orca from the same pod, Tahlequah (J35), gained international attention in 2018 for carrying her dead calf for 17 days.</p>

Several European nations, including Spain and Belgium, have imposed sanctions, such as arms embargoes and import bans from West Bank settlements. The pressure extends to cultural and sporting arenas, with calls for boycotts of events like the Eurovision Song Contest. While the U.S. remains a staunch ally, some former Israeli diplomats express deep concern over the country's damaged international standing, though opinions differ on whether this pressure will fundamentally alter government policy.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Proposal to Reduce Corporate Earnings Reports from Quarterly to Semiannually Sparks Debate</h2>

          <p>President Trump has proposed that public companies report their earnings every six months instead of quarterly, arguing the change would save money and allow managers to focus on long-term strategy. The idea has support from some corporate executives who feel quarterly reporting creates unhealthy short-term pressure. However, many financial experts and investor advocates have raised concerns, warning that less frequent disclosure would reduce transparency and could increase market volatility. Critics also suggest it might create more opportunities for accounting fraud or insider trading by limiting regular public scrutiny of company financials. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Some federal student loan borrowers are experiencing confusion and administrative issues as their loans are transferred to new servicing companies with little direct warning. One borrower recounts being notified of a servicer change from Nelnet to Central Research Inc. (CRI) only through a message in an infrequently checked online portal. Upon setting up the new account, the borrower's loans were placed in an administrative forbearance without request, causing concern about accruing interest. Experts advise that while such transfers are authorized by the Department of Education, borrowers should carefully monitor their accounts and credit reports to avoid payment mix-ups or errors.</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates, which have been on a gradual downward trend for much of 2025, could see another drop this week. The decline is anticipated in connection with the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, where a cut in the federal funds rate is widely expected. Lenders may preemptively lower their rates to remain competitive, potentially pushing the average below the recent 11-month low. While this is positive news for homebuyers, the article cautions that the market remains unpredictable and advises borrowers to have a good credit score to qualify for the best available rates.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewable sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the most cost-competitive forms of energy, even before accounting for government subsidies. The report uses the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark, which shows that renewables are cheaper to generate than fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, or nuclear power. However, the true cost is complex, influenced by factors such as tax incentives, tariffs, and the need for backup power sources for intermittent renewables. President Trump's policies are expected to increase costs for renewable projects while providing new tax breaks for the oil and gas industry. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees needing access to funds tied up in an annuity, there are several strategic options available, though each comes with trade-offs. The simplest method is to wait for scheduled payments to begin, but for more immediate needs, many contracts allow for partial withdrawals of up to 10% annually without surrender fees. Other strategies include taking a loan against the annuity's value, surrendering the contract for its cash value despite high fees, or using a 1035 exchange to move funds to a more favorable contract. Some annuities also have hardship provisions for specific situations like terminal illness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate is set to vote on the nomination of Stephen Miran, a top economic adviser to President Trump, to the Federal Reserve Board. The nomination is controversial due to Miran's previous writings advocating for less Fed independence and his plan to take an unpaid leave of absence from his White House role rather than resigning if confirmed. Critics argue this arrangement could compromise the central bank's political independence, especially as the administration has been openly critical of the Fed's policies. Miran has stated he would act independently, but his nomination has raised significant concerns among Democrats and watchdog groups. (not investment advice)</p>
