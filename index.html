          <p>A tragic collision between a barge and a sailboat off the coast of Miami Beach resulted in the deaths of two children. The children were part of a summer sailing program organized by the Miami Yacht Club. The incident occurred when the barge struck the sailboat, causing it to sink and throwing all six occupants, including five children and an adult counselor, into the water. In addition to the two fatalities, two other children are in critical condition, prompting a major rescue operation and an ongoing investigation by the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially accepted an "unconditional donation" of a luxury jet from Qatar, according to a memorandum of understanding. The agreement allows the U.S. Air Force to begin retrofitting the aircraft for presidential use, with the cost of refurbishment remaining classified, though some lawmakers speculate it could reach $1 billion. The memorandum states the jet is a "bona fide gift" and can be used or disposed of at the Defense Department's discretion, addressing concerns about its potential transfer to a Trump presidential library foundation after his term.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking, has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn her conviction.

This legal move comes as Maxwell is reportedly in discussions with the Justice Department about potentially cooperating with the government. The appeal focuses on whether the plea deal, made in Florida, was applicable to the federal case brought against her in New York.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines has announced it will furlough 270 pilots this fall and demote an additional 140 captains to first officers as it adjusts to a smaller flight schedule. The move is part of the airline's effort to stabilize its finances and return to profitability after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March. The furloughs will take effect on November 1. The airline industry has been facing softer demand, particularly during off-peak travel periods, prompting carriers like Spirit to take steps to align staffing levels with operational needs.</p>

          <p>An opinion article from The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration is attempting to deflect attention from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal by promoting a narrative about an Obama-era plot. The piece critiques Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's claim of "irrefutable evidence" that the intelligence community's conclusion about Russian election interference was a contrived political attack. The author contends that this is a dishonest distraction, asserting that the evidence of Russian efforts to help Trump in 2016 is publicly apparent and that the focus on this is a desperate move to change the subject.</p>

          <p>The Trump Organization has filed a federal lawsuit against unidentified online merchants for allegedly selling counterfeit merchandise on platforms like Amazon, Walmart, and eBay. The complaint, filed in Florida, accuses the sellers of using Trump trademarks on "inferior imitations" of products such as hats, mugs, and t-shirts without authorization. The company is seeking a court order to stop the merchants from using its trademarks, compel the online marketplaces to destroy the counterfeit goods, and close the sellers' accounts. The suit alleges these actions cause confusion and deception in the marketplace.</p>

          <p>The "4% rule" is a long-standing guideline for retirees, suggesting that withdrawing 4% of a retirement portfolio annually, adjusted for inflation, will likely make the funds last for 30 years. When applied to annuities, this rule serves as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income stream from an annuity against what a traditional portfolio could safely provide. While an annuity might offer a higher initial payout rate, retirees must consider that many fixed annuities don't adjust for inflation. Financial experts suggest a hybrid approach can balance the security of an annuity with the flexibility of portfolio withdrawals. (not investment advice)</p>
