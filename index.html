          <p>Iran's armed forces claimed responsibility for a missile strike on the U.S. Al-Udeid military base in Qatar, following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.

Qatar's Foreign Ministry condemned the attack as a violation of its sovereignty and international law, reserving the right to respond proportionally.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated she would favor an interest rate cut at the next policy meeting in July if inflation remains subdued. Bowman's remarks align with fellow Governor Christopher Waller, suggesting a growing sentiment within the Fed to lower rates. Trump has been pressuring the Fed to lower interest rates to alleviate the national debt, but the FOMC voted to hold rates steady at their last meeting. Bowman believes the impact of tariffs on inflation may be less significant than initially anticipated, creating room for monetary policy adjustments (not investment advice).</p>

While renewable energy groups criticized the decision, citing the potential for NYPA to build renewable sources instead, the development will test Donald Trump's executive orders to accelerate nuclear-power development.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deciding whether to pay off medical or credit card debt first involves considering the impact on credit score, interest rates, and collection risks. Credit card debt can damage credit faster and compounds more quickly due to higher interest rates, while medical debt often has a longer grace period before affecting credit. Prioritizing credit card debt makes sense to protect credit and avoid compounding interest, while medical debt may be more negotiable. Proactive management of both types of debt is essential to avoid serious financial consequences.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration stated that Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran man mistakenly deported and later charged with human smuggling, would "never go free" in the U.S., even after a judge ordered his release. Despite the judge's ruling that the government failed to prove he endangered any minor victim or posed a flight risk, the Department of Homeland Security emphasized its commitment to removing him from the country. Ábrego García is accused of participating in a trafficking conspiracy and has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>

The oil market remained largely unfazed by the attacks, but Trump's intervention reflects his concern about the economic impact of rising oil prices (not investment advice).</p>

It argues that Iran's nuclear program was not an imminent threat and that the attack was motivated by political opportunity, given Iran's internal and regional weaknesses. The author asserts that Iran's real threat is its independent foreign policy, challenging American and Israeli hegemony in the region.</p>
