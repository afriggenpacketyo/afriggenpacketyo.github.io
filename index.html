          <p>Four prominent partners at Paul Weiss, including Karen Dunn, Bill Isaacson, Jeannie Rhee, and Jessica Phillips, have announced their departure to establish a new law firm. This follows Paul Weiss's controversial decision to strike a deal with President Trump to avoid an executive order restricting its business, a move that drew criticism from associates and other firms. Dunn, a prominent Democratic lawyer, was supportive of the deal and aided in gaining support from other partners. The partners did not address the deal in their departure email, instead expressing gratitude for their time at Paul Weiss and hoping for future collaboration. This article provides insight into the internal dynamics and fallout within a major law firm following a politically charged decision. </p>

          <p>Investigators are examining whether foggy conditions and technical glitches at a San Diego airport may have contributed to a fatal plane crash that killed six people and destroyed homes. The airport's weather data system was inoperative due to a power surge, and a runway lighting system had issues. The pilot did not report any problems or declare an emergency before the Cessna 550 struck power lines and crashed. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating, aided by the FBI, and expects to release a preliminary report within 30 days.</p>

          <p>Cuts made by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to National Weather Service balloon sites have left gaps in critical weather data, impacting forecasting accuracy. Meteorologists in Michigan and Wisconsin report difficulties in predicting severe weather events due to the reduced number of balloon sites. Weather balloons provide irreplaceable data on air pressure and moisture that satellites and radar cannot replicate. Former NWS leaders warn that staffing and program cuts could lead to needless loss of life, but a NOAA spokesperson defends the NWS's forecasting capabilities, saying the reports are false and disrespectful.</p>

Critics have described the gala as a "pay for play" event. Justin Sun, a Chinese crypto mogul and top investor, posted a video of his White House tour.

          <p>President Trump has ordered massive cuts to the White House National Security Council, resulting in the dismissal of numerous policy experts. The goal of the overhaul is to eliminate bureaucracy and duplication, shifting most parts of the operation back to their home departments and agencies. After the cuts, the NSC will be approximately the same size it was at the end of Trump's first term. Trump has leaned more on cabinet members like Secretary of State Marco Rubio for foreign policy decisions rather than NSC recommendations.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology in the search for escaped inmates from a New Orleans jail has come under scrutiny, with critics raising concerns about privacy and constitutional rights. Authorities say cameras run by Project N.O.L.A., a private organization, helped recapture one fugitive, despite the police department pausing automated alerts from the group. The ACLU and some members of Congress have expressed concerns over the use of live facial recognition, citing potential racial bias and the risk of mass surveillance.

Andy Baker, Vice President JD Vanceâ€™s national security advisor, will serve as the deputy for the reconfigured NSC, alongside Robert Gabriel.

The hummingbirds have expanded their range northward due to the growing popularity of feeders. This study highlights how human influence can drive rapid evolution in species.</p>
