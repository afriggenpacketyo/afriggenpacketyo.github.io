          <p>The government shutdown continues into its second week as the Senate failed to pass any funding bills, with Democrats and Republicans blaming each other for the ongoing impasse. President Trump accused Democrats of obstructing the government's reopening due to healthcare policy disagreements. Democrats are seeking to extend health subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, while Republicans are pushing for a stopgap measure to fund the government until November 21. Air traffic control and food aid programs are being affected, with potential layoffs planned if the shutdown persists. Optimism regarding a swift resolution remains low amid continued political gridlock. Optimism score is 20.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Oklahoma Highway Patrol arrested 120 illegal immigrants in a three-day enforcement sweep along I-40 in Oklahoma. The operation targeted threats to public safety, with 91 of those arrested operating commercial motor vehicles with commercial driver's licenses. Past convictions among the suspects included DUIs, illegal re-entry into the U.S., money laundering, human smuggling, and assault. ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan emphasized the importance of removing public safety threats from America's highways and encouraged more state and local law enforcement to sign 287(g) agreements. The arrests followed a DUI-related crash in California caused by a previously deported suspect. The optimism score is 40.</p>

          <p>California has enacted a new law to regulate the volume of advertisements on streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and YouTube. The legislation requires streaming platforms to comply with existing regulations that prevent overly loud commercials, similar to those already in place for television broadcasters since 2010. Senator Tom Umberg introduced the bill after his legislative aide's newborn was disturbed by sudden ad volume spikes. The new law seeks to bring "peace and quiet" to California households by ensuring streaming ads are no louder than the programs viewers are watching. The optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a Clinton-era trade deal, has expired after Congress failed to pass a renewal bill. This expiration subjects over 6,000 African exports to higher US tariffs, creating economic uncertainty for countries like Kenya, South Africa, Lesotho, and Madagascar. These nations heavily rely on the US market for their textile and apparel industries. The White House reportedly supported a one-year extension, but no formal legislation was introduced before the act's expiration. This could push African nations further into China's economic orbit.

          <p>Job centre work coaches report difficulties in finding employers who can accommodate disabled people, especially those with long-term health conditions. Opportunities are limited for those requiring flexibility or additional support. New data indicates a decline in the number of job seekers finding work each month. The DWP aims to reform the system by shifting focus to work, skills, and opportunities, supported by £1 billion annually for employment support. Work coaches are stretched, with increasing workloads and short appointment times. The optimism score is 45.</p>

          <p>A federal judge declined to immediately block the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to Chicago, Illinois, after the state sought to use the courts to stop the deployment. The decision follows a series of legal developments over Trump’s efforts to send federal troops to Democratic-led cities. A judge in Oregon blocked the administration from mobilizing troops to Portland. Illinois filed a lawsuit to stop Trump from sending troops to the state.

          <p>Long-term exposure to sulfur dioxide, a pollutant from mining fossil fuels, has been linked to an increased risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), according to new research. Researchers compared ALS patients to healthy individuals and found a 23% higher chance of ALS diagnosis among those with greater SO2 exposure. The study focused on pollution levels before ALS symptoms appeared. High levels of SO2 can result from mining activities and the use of fossil fuels. More research is needed to devise prevention strategies. The optimism score is 35.</p>

          <p>A BBC report highlights the resurgence of modeling scams targeting older individuals, who are often lured with promises of lucrative jobs after paying for professional photoshoots. Victims like Judy Corker and Roland Parker were defrauded by fake agencies, losing hundreds of pounds on false pretenses. Scammers frequently request payments through PayPal's "friends and family" option, which lacks buyer protection. Genuine studio owners have reported a surge in people expecting shoots with cruise lines, revealing the large scale of the fraud. Reporting such incidents to Action Fraud and using secure payment methods are crucial steps to avoid these scams. The optimism score is 60.</p>
