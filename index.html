          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to protect their money's buying power with returns that can exceed the inflation rate. This article provides an overview of current CD interest rates as of July 2025, noting that online banks typically offer more competitive rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. It also explains the phenomenon of an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently provide higher returns than long-term ones. To maximize earnings, consumers are advised to compare rates from online banks and consider strategies like CD laddering. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new bill aims to accelerate the domestic mining of critical minerals essential for U.S. weapons systems, seeking to reduce reliance on China, which dominates the global supply. The proposed legislation would grant the Secretary of Defense authority to waive certain environmental regulations and judicial reviews for mining projects deemed vital for national security. This move is designed to bypass delays caused by laws like the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act. Proponents argue this will bolster military readiness, create jobs, and ensure the U.S. can efficiently counter geopolitical rivals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For taxpayers facing a debt with the IRS, deciding between handling it themselves or hiring a professional is a critical choice. This article suggests that a do-it-yourself approach may be sufficient for simpler cases, such as debts under $10,000, where an online payment plan can be established. However, for more complex situations involving debts over $10,000, unfiled returns, or IRS collection efforts like liens, enlisting a tax professional is highly recommended. Experts advise that a professional can negotiate better terms, explore more options like an offer in compromise, and prevent more severe financial consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The cost of copper in the United States has sharply increased following plans for a 50% tariff on imports, creating a significant price gap compared to global markets. This move is expected to impact American businesses and consumers, as copper is essential for products ranging from electronics to infrastructure projects. Analysts warn this could lead to higher prices on consumer goods, increased public investment costs, and even job losses as companies pass on expenses. While the stated goal is to boost domestic production, experts caution this will take years, risking demand destruction in the interim. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece warns that this buildup creates a powerful apparatus for surveillance and control that could extend beyond immigration enforcement. It frames the expansion as part of a coherent police state, connecting it to the budget's broader wealth redistribution and potential for social unrest.</p>

This freeze has resulted in more people paying higher tax rates as their wages rise, a phenomenon known as fiscal drag.

However, experts emphasize that public education on rapid evacuation is even more critical, as the first tsunami waves could strike some coastal areas within minutes.</p>

          <p>A man and two young children, aged four and seven, were killed after being swept away by record-breaking flash floods in the village of Ruidoso, New Mexico. The flooding occurred after heavy monsoonal rains fell on burn scars from previous wildfires, causing the Rio Ruidoso to rise to an unprecedented 20 feet. Emergency crews conducted over 50 rescues as the dangerous conditions led to a rapid rise in water levels throughout the area. With a flood watch still in effect, officials remain on high alert as the community grapples with the tragic loss of life from this devastating event.</p>

          <p>The deadly flash floods in Texas have intensified focus on recent staff cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) and its parent agency, NOAA, under the Trump administration. While experts state the NWS issued timely alerts for this specific event, they warn that continued reductions in staffing could compromise the agency's ability to forecast future catastrophes. The NWS has lost hundreds of employees, leaving several offices with high vacancy rates for meteorologists and key liaison positions. This raises concerns about the nation's preparedness for severe weather, as these roles are vital for coordinating with local emergency responders.</p>

          <p>Search and recovery operations are ongoing in Central Texas, where more than 170 people remain missing days after catastrophic flash floods devastated the region. The death toll has climbed to at least 110, with the majority of fatalities occurring in Kerr County, the area hardest hit by the storm. A federal disaster has been declared, allowing FEMA to support local efforts as crews search miles of the swollen Guadalupe River. The tragedy was particularly acute at Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp where at least 27 campers and counselors were killed by the rapidly rising waters.</p>

          <p>To combat a severe backlog of nearly 77,000 cases in UK criminal courts, a former senior judge has recommended fundamental reforms, including the use of judge-only trials for certain offenses like fraud. The proposal is part of a plan to prevent what is described as a potential "total system collapse," which currently forces some victims and defendants to wait years for justice. Other recommendations include more out-of-court resolutions and creating a new court division to handle less serious cases. While some legal professionals support the changes to speed up justice, others argue that removing juries undermines a fundamental right.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched its largest single-day drone attack on Ukraine since the war began, firing over 700 drones and 13 missiles overnight, resulting in several civilian deaths. The main target was reportedly the city of Lutsk, near the Polish border, which hosts Ukrainian army airfields. This major escalation came just after the U.S. president pledged more weapons for Ukraine and issued direct criticism of Vladimir Putin's actions, which the Kremlin stated it was "quite calm" about. The attack underscores the ongoing intensity of the conflict as Ukrainian President Zelenskyy continues to seek increased international support and pressure on Russia.</p>

          <p>A series of more than 37 earthquakes and aftershocks, with magnitudes up to 5.6, struck Guatemala, leading to the deaths of two men in the Escuintla region. The men were killed when large rocks, dislodged by the tremors, fell onto their vehicle from a hillside. The seismic activity, with an epicenter near the department of Sacatepéquez, caused building evacuations, landslides, and minor property damage across several regions and was felt as far away as El Salvador. In response, Guatemalan authorities have declared an orange alert and reported that at least five other people were buried by landslides.</p>

          <p>An Australian jury has convicted a woman on three counts of murder and one of attempted murder for intentionally serving a meal containing toxic death cap mushrooms to her family members in 2023.

Death cap mushrooms contain a highly stable toxin that causes catastrophic liver failure and can be fatal within 24 hours.

          <p>This article recounts the life of Joseph Kurihara, a Japanese American U.S. Army veteran from World War I who became a prominent dissident during the World War II incarceration of Japanese Americans. After witnessing the forced removal of his community and experiencing racial prejudice, Kurihara's faith in American democracy eroded, leading him to fiercely oppose accommodationist leaders within the camps. His activism during the Manzanar Uprising led to his isolation as a "troublemaker." Ultimately, feeling betrayed by the country he had served, he renounced his U.S. citizenship and moved to Japan after the war, never to return.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers is introducing legislation to create a new, independent inspector general position specifically to oversee the Executive Office of the President. Proponents argue that this watchdog is a long-overdue check on executive power that would root out fraud, waste, and misconduct within the White House, regardless of who is in office. While dozens of inspectors general monitor federal agencies, the White House currently lacks this form of internal oversight. The bill faces significant hurdles in a GOP-controlled Congress, where it is likely to be viewed as a partisan move aimed at the current administration.</p>

Both applications for home purchases and refinancing saw a 9% increase for the week, indicating a strong response from homebuyers and homeowners to the more favorable borrowing conditions. The average loan size for a purchase application also decreased, suggesting that moderating home prices and increasing inventory are contributing to buyer demand. However, rates have begun to climb again, making this brief dip a potentially short-lived window of opportunity for prospective borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>
