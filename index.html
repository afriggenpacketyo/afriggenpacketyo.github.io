          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is implementing measures to curb password sharing outside of households, mirroring strategies adopted by Netflix and Disney+. The streaming service Max has introduced the 'Extra Member Add-On' feature, allowing users to add one additional member outside their household for $7.99 per month. This added member receives their own standalone account with transferred watch history and recommendations. CEO JB Perrette stated that these advancements offer viewers a new way to enjoy content and provide subscribers with greater account management flexibility, as the company aims to boost revenue from direct-to-consumer platforms.</p>

          <p>Tesla is facing investor concerns as first-quarter results reveal sales and profit declines, prompting questions about Elon Musk's focus on his role within the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Investors are worried that Musk's political activities and time spent on DOGE are negatively impacting Tesla's performance and brand image. Analysts suggest that Musk's involvement with DOGE could permanently reduce demand for Tesla vehicles by 15% to 20% due to consumer alienation. Tesla's earnings report highlighted that 'trade policy' and 'changing political sentiment' could affect product demand, as the company reported a 71% drop in net income and a 9% slide in sales.

Hegseth claims the shared information was informal and unclassified coordination for media purposes and accuses former staffers, recently fired as part of a leak investigation, of trying to 'sabotage' the Trump administration's agenda. Hegseth stated that the evidence gathered will be handed over to the Department of Justice, and those responsible will be prosecuted if necessary.

          <p>The Supreme Court appears inclined to require a Maryland school board to allow parents to opt their elementary school-age children out of instruction featuring storybooks on gender identity and sexual orientation. The case involves a dispute between families and the Montgomery County Board of Education over whether schools unconstitutionally burden parents' First Amendment right to exercise their religion freely. The court's conservative majority seemed sympathetic to the families' argument that they should have the right to direct the religious upbringing of their children. Several justices questioned why the school system could not accommodate religious objections, as it does for other areas of instruction.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Denver has issued a temporary restraining order to prevent the removal of migrants from Colorado under the Alien Enemies Act.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced a significant overhaul of the U.S. State Department, aiming to streamline what he describes as a 'bloated' bureaucracy. The plan includes cutting approximately 700 positions and 132 offices within the department. Rubio's reforms target the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, which he claims was used by left-wing activists to target 'anti-woke' leaders and promote anti-Israel policies. The Trump administration has notified Congress about the reorganization plan, and Democratic lawmakers have requested a briefing from Rubio.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A jury has concluded that The New York Times did not libel former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin in a 2017 editorial, rejecting Palin's claim that the newspaper damaged her reputation. The lawsuit stemmed from an editorial about gun control that incorrectly linked Palin's political action committee to an atmosphere of violence before a 2011 mass shooting. The Times issued a correction less than 14 hours after publication, and former editorial page editor James Bennet apologized to Palin, stating he was tormented by the error. The jury determined that the error was not published with 'actual malice,' a requirement for public figures to win libel cases.</p>

          <p>Experts are warning that the Trump administration's plan to resume collecting defaulted student loan payments from millions of borrowers could contribute to an economic slowdown. Starting in May, roughly 5 million borrowers will have their loans sent for collections, potentially leading to wage garnishments and reduced consumer spending. Economists suggest that while the impact of student loan collections may be smaller than factors like tariffs, it could compound economic challenges and damage borrowers' credit scores. The administration defends the policy, arguing that it clarifies the path forward for loan payments and reduces the burden on taxpayers.</p>

The IMF has also increased its recession odds for the U.S. to 40%, up from 25% in October 2024. The report also revised its expectations for headline inflation for advanced economies, including the U.S., to 2.5% for 2025, reflecting an increase of 0.4 percentage point from January's projection.

Experts anticipate a rise in bankruptcy filings this summer as consumers struggle with bills and debt collections. The potential for increased financial stress is compounded by the Trump administration's economic policies, including tariffs that could fuel inflation and dampen economic growth.
