          <p>Bryan Kohberger, accused in the 2022 stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students, has agreed to a plea deal to avoid the death penalty. According to a letter sent to the victims' families, he will plead guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary. In exchange, he will receive four consecutive life sentences plus ten years, waiving his right to appeal. The deal brings a conclusion to a case that captured national attention and avoids a lengthy and painful trial for the families involved.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer posits that a new generation of younger investors is significantly shaping current market dynamics by backing companies with bold, forward-thinking ideas. He argues that these investors favor growth potential and innovative concepts, rewarding companies like Robinhood and Reddit while penalizing established giants like Apple for what they perceive as a lack of new ideas. According to Cramer, this shift marks a move towards an "idea market" focused on individual company stories rather than a market dominated by institutional investors reacting to Federal Reserve policies.

          <p>Comedian Rosie O'Donnell publicly condemned the recent lavish wedding of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren SÃ¡nchez, labeling it "gross excess" that turned her stomach. In social media posts, she criticized the couple and their celebrity guests, contrasting Bezos's treatment of his employees with the opulent display of wealth. O'Donnell also unfavorably compared SÃ¡nchez to Bezos's ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, suggesting the Amazon founder had "sold his soul." Other celebrities, including Charlize Theron, have also voiced similar criticisms of the high-profile event.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from UK child health experts indicates that declining childhood vaccination rates are often due to practical barriers rather than parental vaccine hesitancy. Obstacles such as difficulties booking appointments, lack of reminders, and limited access to GPs prevent many families from keeping their children's immunizations up to date. This decline has led to a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough, with no childhood vaccine currently meeting the WHO's 95% uptake target. The report recommends systemic improvements, including better use of NHS apps and more investment in health visitor services.</p>

          <p>This article examines the dual nature of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s role as US health secretary, highlighting both his ambitious focus on chronic disease and his history of promoting health conspiracies. While he has taken on the food industry by targeting additives and is updating national dietary guidelines, critics worry his actions are undermined by a disregard for scientific consensus. His skeptical stance on vaccines is particularly contentious, as he has dismantled an expert advisory committee and scrapped a bird flu vaccine deal.

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy reported that the company has not observed significant price increases for consumers despite the implementation of broad U.S. tariffs. He explained that Amazon and its third-party sellers mitigated the impact through strategies like forward-buying inventory before the tariffs took full effect. Jassy also noted that the competitive nature of the marketplace helps keep prices stable as many choose to absorb costs rather than lose market share. The discussion also touched upon the transformative potential of generative AI, which Jassy believes will fundamentally change both work and home life. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starting this week, approximately 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales will see a 7% reduction in their energy bills under the latest Ofgem price cap. This translates to a monthly saving of about Â£11 for a typical household, bringing the annual bill down to Â£1,720. However, experts express concern that prices, which remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels, may not fall much further and could be impacted by geopolitical uncertainty.

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing arguments over the Trump administration's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants allegedly associated with the Tren de Aragua gang. The ACLU argued that the act, historically invoked only during major wars, is being improperly applied to a criminal gang, while the administration claims the gang constitutes a "predatory incursion." The judges appeared focused on whether they have the authority to overrule a presidential determination of an armed conflict. The administration asserts the gang is a "hybrid criminal state" that may carry out assassinations in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Privy Council in London, the highest court of appeal for the Cayman Islands, has upheld the British overseas territory's Civil Partnership Law. The ruling rejected a challenge that argued the governor had overstepped his authority by enacting the law in 2020 after local lawmakers had voted it down. The law was originally introduced to comply with a court ruling that found same-sex couples were entitled to legal protections equivalent to marriage. LGBTQ+ rights campaigners have hailed the decision as a significant victory that could positively influence similar legal battles in other British overseas territories.</p>

          <p>The proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense system, envisioned as a space-based shield for the United States, is being analyzed for its potential to deter China in the Indo-Pacific. While proponents believe the multibillion-dollar project could protect against long-range missiles and bolster U.S. military posture, significant questions remain about its cost and technical feasibility. The system would depend on a complex network of satellites and sensors to intercept missile threats. This initiative is part of a broader U.S. defense strategy that views China as a "pacing threat," driving efforts to maintain a military advantage.</p>

In a letter to staff, university leaders cited reductions in federal research funding and the potential impact of a new endowment tax proposed in the Republican spending bill. The cuts are expected to lead to staff layoffs, building on a hiring freeze announced earlier this year, though faculty hiring will continue at a slower pace.

The article posits that Trump's view is not a considered moral position but a convenient way to avoid the hard work of principled foreign policy.
