          <p>The trial of ten individuals connected to the “grandpa robbers” has begun in Paris, addressing their alleged involvement in the 2016 robbery of Kim Kardashian. The defendants are accused of orchestrating a violent attack during Paris Fashion Week, where Kardashian was tied up and robbed at gunpoint of jewelry valued at over $9 million. This incident raised concerns about tourist safety in Paris, which was already dealing with the aftermath of terrorist attacks, and the trial seeks to bring those responsible to justice and address the security lapses that enabled the crime.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's administration has aggressively pursued economic disruption through trade wars and treaty withdrawals, dismantling governmental infrastructure in the process. While these changes have been profound, the possibility of reversal exists, particularly with upcoming midterm elections and the constitutional limit on Trump's term. The article draws a parallel to the Catholic Church's ability to roll back changes, suggesting that future administrations could undo Trump's policies, but the extent of this reversal remains uncertain given the depth of the changes.</p>

          <p>U.S. agriculture exporters are reporting a 'full-blown crisis' due to global backlash from President Trump's tariffs, specifically a decline in Chinese purchases of U.S. farm products. The situation has led to canceled export orders and layoffs within the sector. Data indicates China has canceled significant pork orders, and exporters are reporting substantial financial losses due to cargo diversions and refused shipments. The Port of Oakland is also warning of potential job instability and economic decline due to reduced cargo volume resulting from retaliatory tariffs. </p>

          <p>Federal investigators will conduct a controlled fire test in Pacific Palisades to determine the cause of the January fire that resulted in a dozen deaths and widespread destruction. The test, involving setting fire to parts of the Temescal Ridge Trail, aims to identify the fire's origin and how it spread during a windstorm. Investigators are exploring the possibility that the fire was a re-ignition of an earlier blaze sparked by fireworks, with the investigation prompting scrutiny of the city's fire response and leading to changes in fire department leadership.</p>
