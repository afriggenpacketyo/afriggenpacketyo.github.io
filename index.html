          <p>Bryan Patrick Miller, known locally as the 'Zombie Hunter' for his costumed appearances, was sentenced to death for the 1992 and 1993 murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas. The cold case, known as the Phoenix canal murders, was solved after more than two decades using genetic genealogy to link Miller's DNA to the crime scenes. Investigators lured Miller to a restaurant under the guise of a job offer to obtain a DNA sample from his water glass. His defense argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity due to childhood abuse, but a judge found him guilty and imposed the death penalty.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI data center provider CoreWeave declined by 18% following the release of its second-quarter financial results, which revealed a wider-than-anticipated loss. The company reported an adjusted loss of 27 cents per share, exceeding analysts' expectations of a 21-cent loss. This stock slump occurred just before the expiration of its post-IPO lock-up period, which could introduce further volatility as insiders become eligible to sell their shares. Despite the loss, CoreWeave's revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, and the company raised its full-year revenue guidance for 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

Following virtual discussions with European leaders, five principles for a peace deal were outlined, emphasizing that a ceasefire must be the first step and that any territorial negotiations must be led by Ukraine. Zelenskyy stressed that there can be "no discussions about Ukraine without Ukraine," while European allies and NATO expressed coordinated support for achieving a just peace, placing the onus on Putin to de-escalate.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Department of Veterans Affairs' Office of Inspector General (OIG) reveals a significant rise in staffing shortages across VA health facilities. The report found a 50% increase in reported shortages in the current fiscal year compared to the last, with 94% of facilities facing severe shortages of medical officers and 79% lacking nurses. The VA's press secretary contested the report's methodology, calling it subjective and not based on actual vacancy data. However, critics of the administration argue the findings reflect policies that have made it harder for public servants to do their jobs and for veterans to receive care.</p>

While the financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, the franchise was recently valued at approximately $3.65 billion. The team has been managed by Allen's sister, Jody Allen, since his death in 2018, who previously declined a reported $2 billion offer from Nike co-founder Phil Knight in 2022. The sale is pending approval from the NBA, marking a significant ownership change for the Portland-based team.</p>

          <p>Alaska's capital, Juneau, is experiencing record-breaking flooding after a glacial dam on the Mendenhall Glacier released a massive volume of water. The Mendenhall River crested at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record and prompting evacuations in low-lying areas. This annual event, known as an "outburst flood," occurs when a basin created by a retreating glacier fills with meltwater and breaches the ice dam. Authorities have installed temporary barriers to protect hundreds of homes, as these floods have caused significant property damage, including sweeping away houses, in recent years.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he will ask Congress for a long-term extension of the federal government's control over Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department. The move is part of a broader administration initiative to address crime in the nation's capital, which recently included deploying the National Guard. Under the Home Rule Act, the president can take control of the D.C. police for up to 30 days with congressional notification, but any further extension requires a joint resolution from both the House and Senate. The president stated he believes Republicans will approve the measure but did not rule out declaring a national emergency to maintain control.</p>

The official COLA is determined by the Social Security Administration in the fall, based on inflation data from the third quarter. While inflation has remained below 3% in 2025, some economists express concern that the projected adjustment may not be sufficient if consumer prices rise later in the year due to factors like tariffs.

          <p>Ahead of the Trump-Putin summit, speculation is growing over potential territorial changes in Ukraine as a basis for a ceasefire. Russia currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea and significant portions of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions. Reports suggest Moscow may demand Ukraine cede the remainder of Donetsk and Luhansk, a concession Kyiv views as unacceptable as it would create a springboard for future attacks. Another scenario involves freezing the current lines of contact, particularly in the south, which would still leave vast areas of Ukraine under Russian occupation.</p>

          <p>Fast-moving wildfires, fueled by extreme heat and strong winds, are menacing Patras, Greece's third-largest city, forcing evacuations of villages and a children's hospital. This crisis is part of a broader heatwave gripping southern Europe, which has sparked numerous blazes from Portugal to the Balkans and led to fatalities in Spain. In Greece, nearly 10,000 hectares have burned in the Achaia region, and authorities have requested EU assistance to combat over 20 active fires. Meteorologists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of such extreme weather events to human-induced climate change.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has declared that the state will proceed with drawing new congressional maps with the stated goal of helping Democrats retake the U.S. House and ending the Trump presidency. The announcement is a direct response to Republican-led redistricting efforts in states like Texas, which could increase the GOP's House majority. Newsom's move signals an escalation in the partisan battle over redistricting, with control of Congress hanging in the balance. The California state legislature is expected to release draft maps soon, though the path to approval remains to be detailed.</p>

          <p>The State Department's 2024 human-rights reports have drawn sharp criticism for significant alterations made by Trump administration political appointees. According to this article, the reports remove entire categories of interest, such as systemic discrimination against LGBTQ+ people, corruption, and violence against women, while softening depictions of dictatorships and adding harsh assessments of democratic allies like Germany. Critics and former officials argue the changes abandon internationally accepted definitions, replace objective reporting with political manipulation, and align U.S. policy with the interests of autocratic regimes, undermining the reports' long-standing credibility.</p>

          <p>A jury has found Colorado dentist James Craig guilty of first-degree murder for killing his wife, Angela Craig, by poisoning her protein shakes. The investigation revealed that Craig had researched undetectable poisons online and purchased potassium cyanide and arsenic before his wife's death in March 2023. Prosecutors argued that financial distress and an affair with a Texas orthodontist were motives for the murder, pointing to a $3.4 million life insurance policy. Craig, who pleaded not guilty, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the crime.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services (EWS), the parent company of the Zelle payment network, for allegedly failing to implement adequate safety features. The lawsuit claims that EWS designed Zelle without critical safeguards, making it a hub for fraudulent activity and allowing scammers to steal over $1 billion from users between 2017 and 2023. The legal action seeks restitution for victims and a court order requiring Zelle to implement stronger anti-fraud measures.

          <p>With interest rates remaining elevated and the potential for future rate cuts, financial experts suggest that now may be an opportune time to consider investing in annuities for retirement income. This article suggests that annuities can provide a stable, guaranteed income stream, offering a hedge against market volatility and inflation. The amount to invest depends on individual factors like age, risk tolerance, and existing income sources, with experts often recommending an allocation of 20% to 50% of a portfolio. Acting now could allow retirees to lock in higher payout rates before they potentially decrease. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Goldman Sachs economist has stood by the firm's research predicting that consumers will ultimately bear the brunt of U.S. tariffs, despite public criticism from President Donald Trump. The bank's analysis suggests that while exporters have absorbed most costs so far, about two-thirds of the burden will shift to consumers by the fall, potentially pushing a key inflation metric to 3.2%. The economist clarified that this would likely be a one-time price level effect and may not significantly alter the Federal Reserve's path, as the central bank is now more focused on the labor market.
