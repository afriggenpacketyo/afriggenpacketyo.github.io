          <p>A man from New Jersey has pleaded guilty to masterminding a nationwide criminal enterprise that stole and trafficked catalytic converters. The operation generated over $600 million by selling the stolen auto parts to a metal refinery, which extracted valuable precious metals like platinum and palladium. This guilty plea is the latest development in a case that unraveled after a routine police stop in Oklahoma uncovered a truck filled with the stolen devices. The defendant now faces a potential prison sentence of up to 17.5 years for his role in the large-scale conspiracy and money laundering scheme.</p>

          <p>More than six months after a series of catastrophic wildfires burned across Los Angeles, the remains of another victim have been discovered in Altadena. This finding brings the total death toll from the Palisades and Eaton fires to 31, with over 16,000 structures, mostly homes, also destroyed in the blazes. The victim, who has not yet been identified, was found in an area that did not receive timely evacuation alerts. The medical examiner's office is now working on identification, a complex process that can take a considerable amount of time due to the condition of the remains.</p>

The deals include securing exclusive global streaming rights for Paramount+ and extending their production contract to create at least 50 new episodes through 2030. The negotiations were complex, reportedly involving a pause initiated by Paramount's prospective buyer, Skydance Media, over the high cost. Ultimately, the agreements underscore the immense value of proven hit content in the competitive streaming landscape.</p>

          <p>First Amendment and press freedom organizations are condemning the ongoing ICE detention of Mario Guevara, a Salvadoran journalist arrested in Georgia while covering a protest. The groups, including the Committee to Protect Journalists, argue that although misdemeanor charges against him were dropped, he remains imprisoned in what they call a clear act of punishment for his journalism. Guevara is well-known for his coverage of immigration raids for a Spanish-speaking audience. His attorneys and family are calling for his release, highlighting the case as a significant threat to press freedom in the United States.</p>

The situation has become so dire that the agency's union warned it cannot remember a time when its colleagues faced the risk of dying from hunger.

Speaker Mike Johnson stated the push is for "political games" and that the administration is already handling the matter.

This article suggests that, so far, the auto industry has largely absorbed these costs rather than passing them on to consumers, who are already facing high vehicle prices.
