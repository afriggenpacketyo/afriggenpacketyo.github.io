          <h2>Audio Reveals Biden's Jocular Response During Special Counsel Interview About Memory</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newly released audio from former President Joe Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur reveals Biden joking about his age and memory during questioning about classified documents. The audio, released by Axios, features Biden slurring his words and struggling to recall key events, including the death of his son, Beau. Hur's report, while declining to press charges, described Biden as a 'sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory,' a characterization that sparked criticism from Democrats and amplified Republican concerns about his mental fitness. The article notes that Biden later withdrew from the presidential race due to concerns about his performance and mental acuity, and Kamala Harris was defeated by Trump in the general election.</p>

Potter finished just four seconds behind Luxembourg's Jeanne Lehair, despite recording the fastest run leg of the race. The challenging weather conditions led to a revised bike course, but Potter managed to navigate the changes effectively. In the Para races, Lauren Steadman, a Tokyo gold medalist, secured a comfortable victory in the women's PT5 category, while Michael Taylor took silver in the men's PT4 category.</p>

          <p>The Hinduja family tops Britain's rich list again, but the article argues the real story is the explosion of 'extreme wealth.' The gap between the rich and average person has tripled since 1989, with wealth begetting more wealth through investments. The article proposes an 'extreme wealth line' to curb the excesses of wealth inequality, similar to the poverty line, arguing that extreme wealth gives individuals too much power and causes environmental harm. The author suggests actions like raising taxes on those above the line or compelling donations to charity.</p>

The move follows electoral successes of the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
