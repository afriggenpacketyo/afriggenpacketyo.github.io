          <p>According to a European Central Bank report, gold has risen to become the world's second-largest global reserve asset in 2024, driven by central banks' increasing demand for the precious metal. Central banks are accumulating liquid assets like foreign currencies and gold to hedge against inflation and diversify their holdings, allowing them to support their currencies during economic stress. Gold is viewed as providing long-term value and resilience during times of volatility, with central banks now accounting for over 20% of global demand, up from around 10% in the 2010s. Despite recent market choppiness due to changing U.S. tariff policies, many analysts believe that the factors propelling gold's rally remain intact. (not investment advice) </p>

This AI model, inspired by the logic of the physical world, aims to build an internal simulation of reality, enabling AI to learn, plan, and make decisions in a more human-like manner. V-JEPA 2 can recognize concepts such as a ball falling off a table or an object remaining present even when hidden from view, marking a significant step towards more intuitive and responsive AI systems. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees AI as a crucial area for investment, as the company faces increasing competition from other tech giants like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google. </p>

Passport checks at Gibraltar airport will be jointly conducted by officials from Gibraltar and Spain, streamlining travel procedures for those arriving in the region. This deal aims to maintain fluid border crossings and economic stability for Gibraltar after Brexit, solidifying post-Brexit relations between the UK and EU. </p>

          <p>Paleontologists have identified a new tyrannosauroid species, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, which lived over 85 million years ago in Mongolia, bridging the evolutionary gap between smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids and apex predators like the Tyrannosaurus rex. The skeleton, discovered in the Gobi Desert in the 1970s, was initially misidentified but has now been recognized as a crucial "missing link" in the tyrannosaur family tree. Khankhuuluu weighed around 1,700 pounds and possessed teeth unsuited for crushing bone, unlike its larger descendants. This discovery is reshaping our understanding of tyrannosaur evolution, highlighting that significant scientific breakthroughs are still possible. </p>

          <p>Chinese analysts are closely monitoring the unrest in Los Angeles, viewing President Trump's deployment of troops as a risky political gamble that jeopardizes public safety and stability. One commentator suggested that Trump's heavy-handed tactics could escalate into a constitutional crisis. The remarks followed days of protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids, which led to curfews in some downtown areas. Shi Yinhong, an international relations professor at Beijing's Renmin University, stated that Trump's actions highlight his "despotic nature" to Americans and do not enhance his domestic prestige. </p>

          <p>Federal immigration sweeps in Southern California triggered protests in downtown Los Angeles, leading to clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement and prompting President Trump to deploy the National Guard and Marines. The timeline of events includes ICE agents conducting raids, protesters gathering and vandalizing federal buildings, and escalating tensions between the Trump administration and California officials. Governor Newsom and Mayor Bass criticized Trump's decision to deploy the military, calling it an abuse of power, while Trump labeled them "incompetent." The protests, concentrated near the Edward R.

Critics argue that the bill's fiscal irresponsibility could harm future generations, while the White House claims the CBO's estimate is inaccurate. Experts emphasize that the CBO score is based on the bill as written, with the expectation that certain spending and tax provisions will likely be extended, further increasing the bill's fiscal cost.

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May indicated a 2.4% annual increase, slightly below expectations, suggesting that the impact of President Trump's tariffs has not yet significantly affected consumer prices. Core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.8% over the past 12 months. The lower-than-expected inflation rate was primarily driven by a sharp decline in gasoline prices, while some grocery items and housing costs saw price increases. Economists anticipate the Federal Reserve will likely hold off on cutting interest rates until later in the year, as inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>A 21-year-old Austrian man killed nine students and a teacher at a secondary school in Graz before taking his own life, marking Austria's deadliest mass shooting in recent history. The shooter, a former student who did not graduate, used legally owned firearms in the attack. Police found a "farewell letter," a "farewell video," and abandoned plans for a bomb attack at the suspect's home. The motive for the shooting remains under investigation. </p>

          <p>As Malawi prepares for elections in September, young candidates are advocating for greater political inclusion, facing challenges from entrenched party structures and financial barriers. Despite youth comprising over half of Malawi's population, many young entrants encounter obstacles in navigating party systems dominated by older leaders. While some have successfully launched their careers, others claim that talk of youth empowerment is often empty rhetoric. Observers suggest that deliberate efforts from political parties are needed to create fair competition and meaningful opportunities for young people. </p>
