          <p>The White House budget director has accused Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell of gross mismanagement, opening a new front in the administration's criticism of the central bank. The accusation centers on a renovation of the Fed's headquarters, which is allegedly $700 million over budget and features ostentatious elements, a claim Powell has denied. This move raises questions about whether the administration will seek to remove Powell for cause, despite legal protections for Fed board members. The letter demands Powell respond to detailed questions about the project's compliance and costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Russian missile and drone strikes killed at least two people in Kyiv, Germany's chancellor pledged to purchase additional U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems for Ukraine. The commitment was made during the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome, where allies gathered to discuss reconstruction efforts and ongoing military support. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also met with his Russian counterpart, expressing frustration over the lack of progress in ending the war but hinting at new ideas for peace talks. The conference highlighted the urgent need for air defense to protect Ukraine's people and infrastructure. </p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines' stock jumped over 12% after the company reinstated its 2025 profit outlook, signaling a stronger-than-expected summer travel season. CEO Ed Bastian stated that bookings have stabilized after a dip earlier in the year, giving the airline confidence despite lowering its full-year earnings forecast from initial projections. The carrier reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that slightly beat Wall Street estimates, driven by strong sales of premium seats and its partnership with American Express. This positive report boosted shares across the airline industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official testified that the agency has not determined where it would send Kilmar Abrego Garcia if he were released from pretrial detention. Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March and was later returned to the U.S. to face criminal charges, where he is now being held in Tennessee. His attorneys are fighting to prevent him from being removed again without due process, while the presiding judge has expressed frustration over the government's lack of clarity. The case highlights the complex and uncertain situation facing individuals caught in the immigration system.</p>

          <p>The imminent end of federal tax credits for electric vehicles, worth up to $7,500 for new cars, is expected to trigger a consumer rush before the September 30 deadline. The credits were eliminated as part of President Trump's recently signed tax and spending bill, cutting short a program intended to last until 2032. Automakers like Tesla are urging customers to buy now to capitalize on the savings, with analysts predicting a "summer of the EV." Consumers must take possession of the vehicle by the deadline, creating a sense of urgency that may lead to strong sales and promotional deals. (not investment advice)</p>

Proponents, like Fed Vice Chair Michelle Bowman, argue this offers a more pragmatic, holistic view of a firm's condition. However, the move drew sharp criticism from former Vice Chair Michael Barr and Governor Adriana Kugler, who warned it could weaken critical safeguards and increase risk in the banking system.

          <p>Annuities can serve as a powerful tool to supplement and enhance Social Security benefits for retirees by creating a reliable, lifelong income stream. One key strategy is using annuity payments to cover living expenses, which allows an individual to delay claiming Social Security until age 70, thereby maximizing their monthly government benefit by about 8% for each year of delay. Additionally, certain types of annuities can help manage the tax liability on Social Security income by controlling taxable distributions. This coordination can provide retirees with greater financial security and peace of mind. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Philharmonic opened its 103rd season at the Hollywood Bowl with a program of Russian music, featuring works by Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev. The evening marked the debut of Danish conductor Thomas Sondergard, who led a powerful but sometimes uneven performance. The concert took place amid real-world tensions, including the cancellation of an upcoming performance by Gustavo Dudamel's Venezuelan orchestra due to a travel ban. Despite some technical glitches with sound and video, pianist Kirill Gerstein delivered a gripping performance of Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini.</p>

          <p>A former Department of Justice attorney turned whistleblower has provided emails to the Senate Judiciary Committee that appear to support his claim that a top DOJ official, Emil Bove, defied court orders. The initial complaint alleged Bove told lawyers to ignore court orders blocking the deportation of immigrants. The new evidence reportedly includes messages where officials discuss giving the legal go-ahead to deplane immigrants on foreign soil even after a U.S. judge had ordered the flights to return. Bove, who is being considered for a federal judgeship, has denied ever advising attorneys to violate a court order.</p>

          <p>Sweden's Migration Minister, Johan Forssell, has confirmed that his 16-year-old son was the individual recently reported by an anti-racism watchdog to have links to far-right extremist groups. Forssell stated he was unaware of his son's online activities until being contacted by security services a few weeks ago and will not resign over the matter. He explained that his son is now "deeply remorseful" and has cut off contact with the groups. The revelation has sparked accusations of double standards against the centre-right government, which collaborates with a radical anti-immigration party.</p>

          <p>Joe Root displayed exceptional grit to score an unbeaten 99, guiding England to a total of 251-4 on a challenging first day of the third Test against India at Lord's. On a slow, dry pitch, England's batters were forced to abandon their aggressive "Bazball" style and grind for runs against a disciplined Indian bowling attack. England twice found themselves in trouble, at 44-2 and 172-4, but Root's steady presence and key partnerships held the innings together. Root will resume on day two just one run short of what would be a hard-fought 37th Test century.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's praise for Liberian President Joseph Boakai's "good English," this article outlines six key facts about the unique relationship between the two nations. Liberia was founded in 1822 by freed African-American slaves, and English is its official language, often spoken with an American-style accent. Its capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe, its flag closely resembles the American flag, and its culture retains strong U.S. influences. The historical context explains the deep-rooted connections that might not be immediately obvious to outside observers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has temporarily blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for certain children born in the United States. The judge certified the case as a class action lawsuit, expanding its scope to cover all children who could lose their citizenship under the policy. The Trump administration's order challenges the long-standing interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil. This ruling is one of several legal challenges across the country seeking to halt the controversial policy from taking effect.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has stated that his country will respond with "reciprocity" to the 50% tariff on Brazilian exports announced by U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump justified the steep tariff, set to begin August 1, by citing the ongoing prosecution of his political ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, and an allegedly unfair trade relationship. However, U.S. government data shows a trade surplus with Brazil, a fact da Silva highlighted in his response. The move marks a significant escalation, as it explicitly ties U.S. trade policy to another nation's internal legal affairs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article revisits Virginia Woolf's unpublished 1932 letter on the cultural debate between "highbrow," "lowbrow," and "middlebrow" tastes. Woolf fiercely defended the highbrow, defining it as the pursuit of ideas with thoroughbred intelligence, and expressed a mutual respect for the vitality of the lowbrow. However, she reserved her sharpest criticism for the "middlebrow," whom she saw as a dishonest consumer of art, chasing fashion without genuine conviction. The essay reflects on how these terms have evolved, while noting that Woolf's passionate defense of intellectual rigor and authentic taste remains relevant in today's cultural landscape.</p>
