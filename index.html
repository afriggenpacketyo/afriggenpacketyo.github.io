        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delta and United Airlines are increasingly outpacing their competitors, capturing over 86% of the profits among the largest U.S. airlines last year. Analysts suggest their success stems from extensive networks and a strong focus on premium travel and loyalty programs, which provide a buffer against industry-wide challenges like falling airfares. Despite trimming their 2025 outlooks, both carriers point to the strength of their premium cabins and lucrative credit card partnerships as key drivers of their financial resilience in a difficult market.</p>

          <p>Ether's price surged to a multi-month high, and crypto-related stocks like Coinbase rallied as the U.S. Congress passed the GENIUS Act, the first major legislation to regulate stablecoins. The bill, which now heads to the President's desk, has bolstered market sentiment, with ether-based ETFs seeing record inflows. This legislative milestone is viewed as a significant step toward establishing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in the world's largest financial market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The University of Michigan's latest Survey of Consumers indicates a significant drop in inflation fears, with one-year and five-year forecasts falling to their lowest points since February. This decline suggests that consumer anxiety about tariff-induced price hikes has subsided, contributing to a slight increase in overall sentiment. However, survey officials note that consumers still perceive a substantial risk of future inflation, as expectations remain above pre-2025 levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have arrested Andres Felipe Pineda Mogollon in Los Angeles, the last of four detainees who escaped from the Delaney Hall Detention Facility in New Jersey last month. The four men, all in the country illegally and described by DHS as "public safety threats," reportedly escaped by breaking through a wall. The other three escapees were captured within a week of the incident, bringing the search to a close with Mogollon's capture during a traffic stop.</p>

          <p>Meta has announced it will not sign the European Union's artificial intelligence code of practice, arguing that the framework is an overreach that will stifle innovation. The company's global affairs chief stated the code introduces legal uncertainties and goes beyond the intended scope of the EU's AI Act. This decision puts Meta at odds with other major tech companies like OpenAI, which has committed to the code, and signals a growing debate over the balance between AI regulation and development.</p>

          <p>This article explains how homeowners aged 62 and older can utilize a reverse mortgage to supplement their Social Security benefits and improve their financial stability in retirement. It details three primary strategies: creating a steady monthly income stream, establishing a line of credit for unexpected costs like healthcare, or using the funds to delay claiming Social Security to maximize future benefit payments. This approach can be particularly useful for retirees who have significant home equity but limited cash flow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German farmers are significantly cutting back on the cultivation of strawberries and asparagus, leading to the lowest harvest volumes in decades. According to the Federal Statistical Office, this reduction is driven by rising production costs, especially wages, which farmers say they can no longer cover through consumer prices. The trend is causing a sharp decline in Germany's self-sufficiency for these beloved seasonal crops and is turning them into increasingly expensive luxury items for consumers.</p>
