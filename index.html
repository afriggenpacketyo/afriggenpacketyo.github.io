          <p>The predictable four-year price cycle of Bitcoin, historically driven by its 'halving' events, shows signs of breaking down due to new market forces. The introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs has brought significant institutional investment, altering traditional dynamics and causing the cryptocurrency to hit an all-time high before its most recent halving, contrary to past patterns. Experts suggest this increased market maturity, along with a more supportive regulatory environment, may lead to less extreme price volatility, potentially ending the era of 80% crashes.

          <p>A federal appeals court has dismissed a lower court's contempt order against Trump administration officials regarding the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. The case originated from the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members, which a district judge had attempted to block. The appeals court ruled that the lower court overstepped its authority, particularly since the planes were already outside U.S. airspace when the initial order was issued, highlighting significant tension between the judicial and executive branches over immigration and foreign policy.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed revoking a 2009 "endangerment finding," which provides the legal basis for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. If passed, this would remove federal pressure on automakers to produce electric vehicles, allowing them to align production more closely with current consumer demand, which has recently slowed. While this offers manufacturers more flexibility in their EV and gas-powered vehicle mix, experts note that companies have already invested heavily in EV technology and will continue to offer low-emission options to remain competitive globally.</p>

The cornerback, a sixth-round draft pick, was injured while defending a pass, resulting in torn ligaments in his knee. Head coach John Harbaugh expressed his dismay over the injury to the promising young player, who had been performing well before being carted off the field in visible pain, marking a difficult start to his professional career.</p>

          <p>Despite a significant surge in gold prices over the last two years, several factors could lead to a temporary decline, offering a potential entry point for investors. Cooling inflation, which is approaching the Federal Reserve's target, could reduce demand for gold as a hedge against rising prices. Additionally, any easing of geopolitical tensions, a major driver of recent price hikes, might also cause prices to retreat as investor demand for safe-haven assets wanes. These potential shifts suggest a possible cooling in the gold market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump cautioned federal courts against blocking his administration's tariff policies, arguing that such a move could trigger a severe economic downturn comparable to the Great Depression of 1929.

          <p>The takeover battle for Assura, a major NHS landlord, has escalated as the UK's competition watchdog investigates a £1.7 billion offer from rival Primary Health Properties (PHP). The Competition and Markets Authority is examining whether the merger would reduce competition in the healthcare property market. Meanwhile, US private equity firm KKR is urging Assura's board to accept its competing cash offer, arguing it poses no competition concerns and is now valued slightly higher than the fluctuating PHP bid.</p>

          <p>California Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis has officially dropped out of the 2026 race for governor, announcing she will instead seek the office of state treasurer. Kounalakis, who was one of the first prominent Democrats to launch a gubernatorial campaign, stated she believes she can make a greater impact by focusing on the state's financial future. Her exit reshapes the dynamics of the crowded governor's race, opening up a path for other candidates to court her key donors and supporters.</p>

          <p>The price of gold futures surged to a new record after the U.S. imposed a 39% tariff on specific imports of cast gold bars from Switzerland, a dominant player in the global refining industry. The move, detailed in a U.S. Customs ruling, expands the scope of recent tariffs and makes it economically unviable for Swiss refiners to export these products to the U.S. The decision has roiled the precious metals market, as investors reacted to the disruption in the physical gold supply chain.

          <p>Residents of Gaza City are facing immense fear and uncertainty following the Israeli government's announcement of a plan to take full control of the territory's largest city. Civilians, many of whom have already been displaced multiple times, told the BBC they fear a "death sentence" from either bombardment or starvation and feel trapped with no safe place to go. Some also expressed anger at Hamas for failing to negotiate an end to the war, which has led to widespread destruction and a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent opinion from the International Court of Justice affirmed that nations have a binding legal duty to protect the climate, making failure to do so an "internationally wrongful act." This stands in stark contrast to the U.S. government's plan to rescind the EPA's 2009 endangerment finding, the legal basis for most federal climate regulations. This divergence highlights a growing gap between the global legal community, which increasingly recognizes a right to a healthy environment, and current U.S. policy, which appears to be abdicating this responsibility.</p>

          <p>Shares of the salad chain Sweetgreen fell by over 25% after the company lowered its 2025 financial outlook for the second consecutive quarter. The company cited a combination of factors for the downgrade, including challenges with its new loyalty program, weak consumer spending, and the negative impact of tariffs. Sweetgreen now anticipates negative same-store sales for the year and a lower profit margin, with its CEO acknowledging it was a "really, really rough quarter" for the business.

This move is seen as a strategic decision to reduce reliance on Western technology, which Tehran feels has left it vulnerable. By adopting BeiDou for services like transport and agriculture, Iran aims to plug security gaps and strengthen its long-term strategic alliance with Beijing, expanding China's technological influence in the Middle East.</p>
