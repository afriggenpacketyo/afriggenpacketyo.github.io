          <p>In a groundbreaking legal move, the sister of Christopher Pelkey, a victim of a 2021 road rage incident, used artificial intelligence to create a likeness of her brother to deliver a victim impact statement during the sentencing of Gabriel Horcasitas. The AI-generated avatar spoke of forgiveness and a desire for friendship in another life, which Judge Todd Lang praised as genuine and impactful. While the use of AI in legal proceedings raises ethical questions about manipulation and deception, the video was prefaced with a disclaimer identifying it as an AI recreation. The defense lawyer suggested that the court’s reliance on the AI video could be grounds for appeal. Optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Fox News host and former New York prosecutor Jeanine Pirro as interim U.S. attorney for Washington D.C., replacing Ed Martin. Pirro, a long-time ally of Trump, previously served as a Republican district attorney and judge.

          <p>The Pentagon is set to begin the immediate removal of up to 1,000 openly transgender military members, following a Supreme Court decision allowing the Trump administration to enforce a ban. The directive also gives those who have not openly identified as transgender 30 days to remove themselves.

          <p>President Trump's selection of Dr. Casey Means, a wellness specialist, as his next surgeon general has ignited debate over whether a non-practicing physician should hold the role. Critics, including Laura Loomer, question Dr. Means's credentials and embrace of alternative medicine, while supporters like Health Secretary Robert F.

Experts note that the legal requirements for the position focus on public health experience, not necessarily an active medical license.

No injuries were reported, and the extent of the damage is still being assessed. The tower was being transported to a warehouse for testing to determine the cause of the fire.

          <p>President Trump's new trade pact with the UK, while touted as a breakthrough, offers limited substantive benefits for America. The agreement maintains the 10% import tax on most UK goods but rolls back some tariffs on strategic sectors like cars and steel. In exchange, the US secured expanded opportunities for sales of American agricultural products in the UK. Analysts suggest the deal primarily serves as a political victory for Trump, with narrow economic impact. American carmakers expressed concern that the plans would make UK-made cars less expensive to import than models made by their companies. Optimism score is 50.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has requested that House Speaker Mike Johnson include a tax hike on wealthy Americans in the upcoming fiscal package. The proposal involves creating a new top income bracket for individuals earning over $2.5 million per year and taxing income above that level at 39.6 percent. This move would partially reverse the tax cuts enacted in 2017. While alarming some Republicans, the idea is seen as a way to offset spending cuts on programs like Medicaid. Optimism score is 50.</p>
