          <p>Health officials in Coconino County, Arizona, have confirmed the death of a resident from pneumonic plague, the first such fatality in the county in over 15 years. While the risk to the public is considered low, this rare case highlights the continued presence of the Yersinia pestis bacterium, which caused the "Black Death" in the 14th century. Pneumonic plague is the most severe form of the disease, affecting the lungs, and though treatable with modern antibiotics, it remains a serious health concern. Officials have not released further details about the individual out of respect for the family.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has launched a public defense of its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation project by publishing a "Frequently Asked Questions" page on its website. This move comes in direct response to escalating attacks from the Trump administration, particularly from OMB Director Russell Vought, who criticized the project's costs and alleged extravagances. The Fed clarifies that the project modernizes historic buildings, denies claims of new VIP dining rooms, and explains cost overruns are due to unforeseen conditions like asbestos. The central bank also emphasizes that the project is self-funded and does not use taxpayer money. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the dismissal of criminal charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore, a Utah plastic surgeon accused of creating fake COVID-19 vaccination cards. The Justice Department had indicted Moore in 2023 for allegedly destroying government-provided vaccines and distributing fraudulent records for cash. In her announcement, Bondi stated that Dr. Moore "gave his patients a choice when the federal government refused to do so" and did not deserve to face prison time. The decision marks a significant development in a case that has drawn attention from figures critical of vaccine mandates.</p>

          <p>In a post on his Truth Social platform, President Trump stated he is giving "serious consideration" to revoking the U.S. citizenship of comedian and longtime critic Rosie O'Donnell. He referred to O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland, as a "threat to humanity." This move, for which there is no legal precedent or basis for a U.S.-born citizen, represents a significant escalation in the use of executive rhetoric against political opponents. O'Donnell responded on social media, calling the president a "criminal con man" and stating the threat is why she left the country.</p>

          <p>Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have become the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles title at Wimbledon in 89 years, a milestone not seen since 1936. The duo defeated Rinky Hijikata and David Pel in a decisive 6-2 7-6 (7-3) victory on Centre Court. The historic win marks a significant achievement for British tennis, as they were already the first all-British pair to even reach the final since 1960. The victory is a culmination of a successful partnership for Cash and Glasspool, who teamed up less than a year ago.</p>

          <p>The New Hollywood String Quartet is celebrating its 25th anniversary with a summer festival dedicated to the original Hollywood String Quartet of the 1940s and 50s. The original ensemble, founded by top film studio musicians, was groundbreaking in bridging the worlds of classical music and Hollywood film scores. The festival, introduced by celebrated conductor Leonard Slatkin—son of the original quartet's founders—features performances of repertory from the earlier group's classic recordings. The event celebrates a unique Los Angeles legacy of genre-busting musical excellence and the enduring connection between cinematic and classical traditions.</p>

          <p>Entrepreneur and speaker Grant Cardone has generated significant controversy with comments calling a $400,000 annual salary "embarrassing" for a husband and father. In a widely circulated clip, Cardone argued that such an income, which breaks down to about $35,000 a month, is not enough to live on and that anyone can achieve it simply by "showing up." He later clarified his remarks were directed at people in the insurance industry who he believes should aim higher, but the comments were widely perceived as out of touch. The statement drew heavy criticism for devaluing an income level that places an individual in the top few percent of American earners.</p>

          <p>A Morgan Stanley report has identified the "low altitude market," encompassing drones and electric air taxis (eVTOLs), as a potential $9 trillion opportunity by 2050. While companies like Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation are direct plays, this analysis suggests that data-mining firm Palantir Technologies is a less obvious but potentially dominant long-term winner. Palantir's AI-driven software and existing partnerships with the U.S. military and commercial defense contractors position it uniquely to manage the complex data and logistics of this new digitized airspace. The article notes Palantir's high valuation but sees its technological expertise as a key advantage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A collectibles shop in New Bedford, Massachusetts, was the target of a robbery where a thief stole more than $113,000 worth of rare Pokémon trading cards. The break-in at 1st Edition Collectibles occurred early Tuesday morning, with the perpetrator smashing a window to gain entry. Surveillance footage showed a masked individual who appeared to know exactly which high-value items to take, including a Skyridge Crystal Charizard and a 1st Edition Shadowless Blastoise. The store's owners noted that each graded card has a unique serial number, which they have publicized to help track and recover the stolen property.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched another large-scale overnight attack on Ukraine, using hundreds of drones and cruise missiles in a bombardment that killed at least six people and wounded dozens more. The attacks targeted multiple regions, including Chernivtsi in the southwest and Lviv in the west, a key hub for foreign military aid. Ukrainian officials reported that air defenses shot down a majority of the incoming threats, but falling debris and direct hits caused fatalities and significant damage. The intensified long-range assault coincides with a renewed Russian push along the front line, where Ukrainian forces are under severe pressure.</p>

          <p>Hartford Bakery, Inc. has issued a voluntary recall for its "Lewis Bake Shop Artisan Style 1/2 Loaf" bread because the product may contain undeclared hazelnuts. The recall, shared by the FDA, affects approximately 883 loaves sold in 12 states through retailers like Kroger and Walmart. The presence of undeclared nuts poses a risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reactions to consumers with a nut allergy. While no major injuries have been reported, the company initiated the recall after one customer experienced digestive discomfort and others noticed the nuts in the product.</p>

Race safety personnel initiated CPR before being joined by county rescue teams and a helicopter, but Stypula was pronounced deceased at the scene. The Hardrock Hundred is an exceptionally challenging race that climbs over 13 major mountain passes.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated a major reduction-in-force, laying off 1,353 civil and foreign service employees as part of a sweeping reorganization plan by the Trump administration. The cuts are part of a larger plan to reduce the department's domestic workforce by 15% and eliminate or merge numerous offices to streamline operations. Many of the affected offices focus on human rights, refugee assistance, and foreign aid, including the entire global programs office in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the cuts will severely undermine U.S. diplomatic capabilities and national security.</p>

According to sources, the dismissals were identified through the Justice Department's "weaponization working group" and included various personnel, some of whom were support staff with no direct prosecutorial role. This move follows earlier purges and reassignments within the DOJ and has reportedly sent a "chill" through the department's career workforce.

Florida was praised for its strong growth and relative insulation from a trade war with China. Texas's large, diverse economy was also seen as a major strength, while North Carolina was noted for its consistent growth and solid housing market, contributing to its overall top ranking for business.
