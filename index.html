          <p>Alibaba reported stronger-than-expected net income for its June quarter, driven by a 26% year-over-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division, largely fueled by high demand for AI products. This growth in the cloud unit, along with a revival in its e-commerce business, has contributed to a significant rally in the company's stock this year. Despite overall revenues falling slightly short of analyst forecasts, the company's profitability was bolstered by gains from equity investments. However, increased spending in the competitive instant commerce sector led to a decrease in adjusted earnings for its core e-commerce division. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ended the 'de minimis' trade exemption, which previously allowed shipments under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. This abrupt policy change is causing significant disruption for global retailers like Tapestry and Lululemon, who relied on the provision for their e-commerce operations. The move has snarled international supply chains and is expected to lead to higher prices for consumers, with small businesses on marketplaces like Etsy facing severe operational challenges. The administration cited concerns over tariff evasion and the entry of illicit goods as reasons for the change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Trump to prevent her termination from the central bank's board. Trump seeks to remove Cook based on allegations of mortgage fraud from before her tenure at the Fed. In response to Cook's request for a temporary restraining order, the administration has asked a federal judge to deny the injunction and allow the firing to proceed without delay. The Federal Reserve itself has taken a neutral stance on the merits of the case but has requested a prompt ruling from the court to resolve the high-stakes dispute over the independence of the central bank.</p>

Newsom accused Trump of having authoritarian tendencies, citing the deployment of the National Guard in states without gubernatorial consent and suggesting the president does not believe in fair elections.

          <p>Since President Trump took office, his administration's focus on mass deportation has significantly reshaped immigration enforcement in the United States. Data published by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) tracks the number of individuals arrested, detained, and deported, providing a statistical look at the impact of these policies. The Guardian has been archiving and analyzing this data, which is released bi-weekly, to illustrate the trends in enforcement actions. The figures show a clear implementation of the administration's hardline immigration platform, offering a quantitative measure of the changes that have occurred across the country.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose to a 2.9% annual rate in July, its highest level since February. This increase, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, suggests that tariffs may be influencing prices in the U.S. economy. Despite inflation running well above the Fed's 2% target, markets still anticipate an interest rate cut in September, as policymakers weigh the risk of a weakening labor market. The report also showed resilient consumer spending, which increased by 0.5%, indicating continued economic strength despite higher prices. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the CCN has since revised its analysis, now suggesting that some merger scenarios could result in no savings or even incur additional costs.

In a court filing, they claim Mangione's targeted killing was intended to normalize violence as a means to achieve political or ideological goals. They point to the NFL headquarters shooter, who also left behind writings explaining his motives, as an example of this influence.

The situation is compounded by Hungary's ongoing blockade of Ukraine's EU accession talks.

          <p>India's economy demonstrated robust growth, expanding at an annual rate of 7.8% in the quarter ending in June, exceeding economists' forecasts. The expansion was primarily driven by strong performance in the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. However, some economists note underlying signs of a slowdown, as nominal GDP growth, which isn't adjusted for inflation, has decreased. The strong real GDP figure was partly influenced by a soft deflator. Concerns remain about the potential impact of new U.S. tariffs on Indian imports, which could soften growth in the upcoming quarters and have already put pressure on the Indian rupee.

          <p>An upcoming military parade in Beijing to commemorate the end of World War II will provide a rare glimpse into the current hierarchy of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). Since the PLA does not publicly announce personnel changes, the prominence of certain generals during the event can signal who is favored for senior leadership roles. Conversely, the absence of previously high-profile figures may indicate who has fallen out of favor, potentially due to the ongoing anti-corruption campaign that has already seen numerous military officials removed from their positions. The parade serves as a key moment for observers to analyze the opaque power dynamics within China's military.</p>

          <h2>US Ambassador Expected to Skip Major Military Parade in Beijing</h2>

          <p>The U.S. ambassador to China, David Perdue, is reportedly expected to not attend a major military parade in Beijing next week commemorating the end of World War II. According to sources, this move appears to be part of a coordinated effort by Western diplomatic missions to opt out of the event, despite pressure from the Chinese government to attend. The parade is a significant national event for China, and the absence of high-level Western diplomats could be interpreted as a political statement. It remains unclear whether the U.S. embassy will send a lower-level representative in the ambassador's place.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. retirement system, which received a C+ rating in a global index, differs significantly from top-ranked systems like those in the Netherlands and Australia primarily because it relies on voluntary participation. While the U.S. heavily uses 401(k)-style defined contribution plans, other nations mandate contributions, ensuring broader coverage for their populations. Experts suggest that making retirement savings contributions mandatory is a key feature that strengthens pension systems and addresses modern challenges like increased longevity. Without such a requirement, the U.S. system faces a significant risk of leaving many citizens without adequate retirement funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) hiring expo in Arlington, Texas, attracted thousands of applicants from diverse backgrounds, reflecting a wide range of motivations for joining the agency at the forefront of the Trump administration's deportation efforts. The recruitment drive, part of a push to hire 10,000 new officers, drew former law enforcement, young people seeking stable careers, and naturalized citizens who support stricter immigration enforcement. The event also drew protesters who condemned the applicants for seeking to work for the agency. The story highlights the complex and often personal reasons people are drawn to ICE, even as its operations face intense public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A German jogger, Yanni Gentsch, has ignited a national movement after she confronted and filmed a man who was secretly recording her backside while she was running. Her video of the encounter went viral, and she launched a petition to make all sexually motivated, secret recordings a criminal offense, as current German law only covers filming of private parts. The petition has garnered over 125,000 signatures and has drawn widespread support, prompting German justice ministers to consider amending the criminal code.

This decision marks the third time a member of the powerful Shinawatra political dynasty has been removed from the premiership by the court.

India is a major exporter of key spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, which are essential components of the popular pumpkin spice blend. While the immediate impact on this year's products may be minimal due to existing stock, the tariffs are expected to eventually increase the cost of these spices for companies. This could lead to higher prices for a vast range of consumer goods, testing just how much Americans are willing to pay for their favorite autumn flavor. (not investment advice)</p>
