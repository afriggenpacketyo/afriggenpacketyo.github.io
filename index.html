          <p>Australia's economic growth remained stagnant at 1.3% year-on-year in the first quarter, failing to meet economists' expectations, as global trade tensions continue to simmer. This figure mirrors the previous quarter's growth rate and comes after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) reduced interest rates to a two-year low in May due to receding inflation concerns. The RBA anticipates a gradual increase in domestic GDP growth throughout 2025, fueled by a recovery in consumption and sustained public demand. However, the central bank acknowledges that weaker global demand and domestic uncertainty could temper this anticipated growth. (not investment advice)</p>

Culver City police initially attempted to stop Flenoy, who had an outstanding warrant for felony carjacking and weapons charges. Flenoy fled, resulting in a short chase that ended when he ran a red light and crashed into another car. The two children and Flenoy were transported to the hospital for evaluation of their injuries, while Timberline Davenport, a passenger in Flenoy's car who also had outstanding warrants, was also transported to the hospital for minor injuries.</p>

          <p>Former professional boxer Duke Tanner, who was granted clemency by President Trump after serving 16 years for drug trafficking, shared his experiences and views on potential pardons. Tanner emphasized Trump's thorough review process for clemency cases and suggested that any pardon decision would be based on a careful examination of the facts. Tanner also spoke about the series of pardons granted by former President Biden, including to his son Hunter, and noted that it cannot be compared to his own incarceration and subsequent release. Tanner believes Trump's pardons are a means of holding the criminal justice system accountable.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded guidance from the Biden era that required hospitals to perform emergency abortions under federal law. The previous guidance, issued after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v.

HHS and CMS stated that the rescinded guidance did not reflect the current administration's policy, while affirming their commitment to enforcing EMTALA.

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, has passed the House and is now in the Senate, facing criticism for rolling back parts of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Critics argue the bill would cause millions to lose Medicaid coverage and make it harder to sign up for health plans, while Republicans claim it reduces waste and abuse in Medicaid. The bill includes changes to ACA enrollment periods and eliminates policies that allowed low-income individuals to sign up year-round, potentially leaving millions without health insurance by 2034. The Medicaid changes would reduce federal spending on the program by about $700 billion over 10 years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent controversy has erupted in mountaineering over the use of xenon gas by British climbers to accelerate acclimatization on Mount Everest, mirroring debates about fair play in sports. The use of xenon gas, banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency, raises questions about whether it provides an unfair advantage. Similarly, Nike's attempt to help Faith Kipyegon run a sub-four-minute mile is facing scrutiny due to the potential use of pacers and advanced technology, sparking discussions about the ethics of innovation in sports. These debates highlight the tension between pushing the boundaries of human achievement and maintaining the integrity of competition.</p>

Critics argue that halting work permits could hinder asylum seekers' ability to support themselves, driving them into the underground economy.
