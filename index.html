          <p>Despite President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, both countries have accused each other of violations. Israeli Defense Minister Katz stated that Iran launched missiles after the agreement was supposed to take effect, prompting Israel to resume bombing targets. However, Iranian media denied these claims. The ceasefire, brokered by Trump with assistance from Qatar, aimed to end the 12-day conflict that resulted in numerous casualties, but its fragility is evident as both sides continue to trade accusations and the situation remains tense. Optimism remains low as the situation unfolds.</p>

          <p>NATO allies have convened in The Hague for a two-day summit to discuss increasing defense spending amid escalating tensions in the Middle East and the ongoing war in Ukraine. Leaders from the 32 member states, along with representatives from Indo-Pacific partners, are expected to address both crises during the session. A key demand from US President Donald Trump is getting NATO members to commit to increasing defense spending to 5%, which is likely to be a central point of discussion at the summit, which is taking place in the Netherlands.</p>

          <p>President Trump's intervention in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran may be yielding positive results with a ceasefire agreement in place, although its stability remains uncertain. While Iran agreed to halt strikes against Israel, Israel agreed to stop striking Iran after achieving its objectives. However, the fragility of the agreement was highlighted by accusations of ceasefire violations from both sides shortly after its supposed implementation. The success of this ceasefire could mark a significant step back from a wider regional conflict.</p>

Morgan adjusted her CV to be more AI-friendly, leading to more assessment invitations and eventually a job offer. Despite the challenges, Caitlin is set to begin her career in London, highlighting the competitive nature of the graduate job market.</p>

Derek Dixon sued Perry for $260 million, alleging sexual harassment, assault, and retaliation. Some experts view their silence as a lack of moral courage and self-serving behavior, given Perry's past support for the couple. Others suggest their silence stems from a desire to avoid entanglement in a scandal, particularly given their precarious standing in both Hollywood and royal circles.</p>

          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague is placing heavy demands on Germany's military, the Bundeswehr, with ambitious goals for defense spending and troop numbers. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged to provide the necessary resources to make the Bundeswehr the strongest conventional army in Europe. NATO aims to increase defense spending to 5% of member states' economic output by 2035. The summit also addresses the need for additional troops in Europe, which could require Germany to recruit tens of thousands of new soldiers.</p>

          <p>More than 100 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system. The MPs are concerned about the proposed cuts to disability and sickness-related benefits payments, which aim to save Â£5 billion a year by 2030. The amendment cites concerns about the number of people expected to be pushed into relative poverty, a lack of consultation, and an inadequate impact assessment. The vote on the government's bill is scheduled for July 1.</p>

          <h2>China's Airlines May Face Less Disruption in Iran-Israel Conflict Compared to Western Rivals</h2>

          <p>Western airlines may face greater disruption than their Chinese counterparts due to the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, which forces carriers to avoid dangerous airspace on China-Europe routes. Western firms are barred from Russian airspace, while Chinese companies can still use it, giving them a competitive advantage. The airspace closures by Iran, Israel, Iraq, and Jordan have led to flight diversions and cancellations. Western airlines are diverting flights through Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan, as well as southern routes over Egypt and Saudi Arabia, while Chinese airlines have more flexibility.</p>
