          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that both Russia and Ukraine need to make compromises to reach a negotiated settlement in their ongoing conflict. During a podcast interview, Rubio expressed hope for a swift resolution but acknowledged that it may take time. He stated that neither Russia would take over the entire country nor would Ukraine push them back to pre-2014 boundaries. Vance expressed confidence in the U.S. proposal and urged both countries to accept it or face the U.S. withdrawing from the negotiation process.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has consumed 11,500 acres and is about 30% contained, leading to a state of emergency and evacuations. The Jones Road Wildfire, which started in the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, has destroyed one commercial building and several vehicles, threatening over 1,300 homes. Acting Governor Tahesha Way declared the emergency, while the New Jersey Forest Fire Service works to fully contain the blaze, which they expect to be the largest in the state in 20 years. Residents have returned home, and major roads have reopened, as firefighters continue to manage the situation amidst dry conditions and high wildfire activity this year.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a significant rally after indications of a potential de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war and President Trump's confirmation that he has no plans to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared over 1,000 points, with similar gains in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Trump signaled a substantial reduction in tariffs on China, currently at 145%, while China also has high levies on American goods. However, analysts caution that the market's reaction may be short-lived due to the volatility of Trump's rhetoric. (not investment advice)</p>

The EU argues that Apple must allow alternative app marketplaces, and Meta's 'consent or pay' model doesn't provide users with sufficient freedom in consenting to data usage.</p>

          <p>Nearly 100 days in, Donald Trump’s second term as US president has been defined by his determination to upend the established order on nearly all fronts of domestic and foreign policy. In the second of this series , we look at the extent to which the president’s actions have unravelled and possibly broken relations with Washington’s closest allies. As former US president Joe Biden ’s administration wound down in January, China faced more pressure on multiple fronts – diplomatic, economic and military – than it had for decades, largely owing to the alliances the American leader worked to bolster during his single term in the White House.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has been marked by disruptive policies, straining relationships with traditional US allies and providing China with an opportunity to strengthen its global position. Trump's imposition of steep tariffs on allies has fractured the Western alliance, allowing China to potentially escape the geopolitical constraints imposed by the previous Biden administration. This shift is particularly evident in Europe, where leaders express doubts about the future of the trans-Atlantic alliance, potentially opening doors for China to expand its influence.</p>
