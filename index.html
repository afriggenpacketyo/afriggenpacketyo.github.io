        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has revealed a new set of tariffs, notably a 100% levy on certain imported drugs unless the manufacturer establishes a factory in the U.S. Additionally, 25% tariffs will be placed on heavy-duty trucks and 50% on kitchen and bathroom cabinets, with a 30% tax on upholstered furniture. The stated goal is to protect American manufacturers from what the administration calls a "flooding" of foreign products. Critics, however, warn that these measures will likely lead to higher prices for consumers and create challenges for industries reliant on imported parts.</p>

          <p>Sir Menzies "Ming" Campbell, a distinguished British politician and former leader of the Liberal Democrats, has passed away at the age of 84. Before his 28-year career as a Member of Parliament for North East Fife, he was a celebrated sprinter who held the UK 100m record and competed in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Remembered for his principled opposition to the Iraq War, colleagues from across the political spectrum have paid tribute to him as a "true Liberal giant" and a courteous, respected public servant.</p>

          <p>An opinion article from Fox News posits that the Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency is advancing the interests of Black Americans by proposing the repeal of Biden-era vehicle tailpipe standards. The author argues these regulations disproportionately harm lower-income communities by increasing the cost of new and used gasoline-powered cars, which are essential for economic mobility. The piece contends that rolling back these standards makes vehicle ownership more affordable, thereby helping to reduce the racial wage gap, and dismisses criticism from environmental justice activists as out of touch.</p>

          <p>Top-ranking Chinese official Wang Huning has called for strengthening education in the national standard language during a visit to the Xinjiang region. This directive is part of a broader push by Beijing to reinforce the "sense of community of the Chinese nation" and maintain social stability. The visit by senior officials underscores the central government's intensified focus on cultural and religious assimilation in the region. Historically, southern Xinjiang has been an area of ethnic tensions, which Beijing has attributed to religious extremism and has responded to with strict control measures.</p>

          <p>Individuals exposed to teargas and other chemical agents during recent protests in the U.S. report experiencing significant, long-lasting health problems, including severe menstrual cycle disruptions. Protesters from events in Michigan and Los Angeles describe issues like intense cramping, irregular periods, and hormonal imbalances, echoing findings from a 2021 study of protesters in Portland. The lack of research on the effects of these chemicals on reproductive health and the proprietary nature of their formulas have made it difficult to regulate their use. Activists are now trying to document these health impacts to raise awareness.</p>

          <p>Google is altering its content moderation policies, signaling a significant shift from prioritizing factual accuracy to championing "free expression." Its YouTube division announced it will now allow accounts previously banned for spreading misinformation about COVID-19 and the 2020 election to apply for reinstatement, reversing its former lifetime ban policy. This change comes amid regulatory pressure and follows years of the company promoting its fact-checking initiatives to combat false narratives. The move reflects a broader trend in the tech industry and is framed by the company as a commitment to open discussion.</p>

          <p>A political analysis explores the contradiction within progressive circles: the belief that Donald Trump poses a grave threat to democracy, yet a reluctance to moderate policy positions to improve electoral chances. The article examines the work of political scientists who argue that in the current nationalized political climate, individual candidate moderation offers little to no electoral benefit. However, the author contends that this research on down-ballot races doesn't negate the potential benefits of moderation at the national party level, where voter attention is highest. The piece suggests that underestimating the risks of ideological inflexibility could be perilous.</p>

Both viruses can cause serious illness, especially in vulnerable populations.

Another key tool is the implementation of export controls on dual-use items, which are goods with both civilian and potential military applications.

This consolidation threatens independent journalism and places control of a vital information platform for young people into very few hands.</p>

          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is championing a proposal to create a network of city-owned grocery stores designed to keep prices low by operating on a non-profit basis. While the idea has found support among many likely voters, it has drawn sharp criticism from established grocery executives, who argue that running a supermarket in the city is far more complex than the proposal suggests. The article notes that municipal grocery stores have a mixed record of success elsewhere in the U.S., with some small towns finding them essential while others have seen them fail financially.</p>

          <p>An article challenges the Trump administration's justification for using lethal force against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean, noting a lack of evidence that fentanyl is trafficked along this route. While President Trump has repeatedly cited fentanyl to defend these actions, U.S. Coast Guard data shows that maritime seizures in the region consist almost exclusively of cocaine and marijuana, with no documented fentanyl confiscations. Critics suggest the administration is using the fentanyl crisis as a fact-free pretext to justify aggressive policies, including potential military action against Venezuela, that have little connection to the actual sources and routes of the synthetic opioid.</p>

          <p>In a podcast discussion, retired Admiral Bill McRaven reflects on whether the United States is still perceived as a global force for good. He argues that America's historical greatness is tied to its goodness, citing actions like the Marshall Plan, but acknowledges that recent transactional foreign policies have caused allies to question this role. McRaven also discusses the military's apolitical nature, emphasizing that its oath is to the Constitution, not a president. He expresses concern over the current political climate but maintains optimism that the American people will ultimately reject authoritarian trends and hold their leaders accountable.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the Trump administration's prosecution of Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ) is a dangerous test of authoritarian power. McIver faces felony charges for interfering with federal officers during the arrest of another Democratic official, an incident the author describes as a chaotic scrum engineered by law enforcement. The piece contends the charges are dubious and serve to financially drain a political opponent, as ethics rules prevent her from accepting free legal help. This prosecution is presented as a potential new weapon to intimidate lawmakers and circumvent the Constitution's Speech and Debate Clause, which is meant to protect them from executive intimidation.</p>

          <p>An analysis of ICE data reveals that detained immigrants are being transferred between facilities more quickly and frequently this year, a practice that advocates say disrupts legal representation and isolates individuals. Attorneys report that these transfers are sometimes used as a retaliatory measure, moving detainees far from their families and legal support networks to states with fewer resources for migrants. The journeys themselves can be arduous, and the system for tracking detainees is often slow to update, leaving families and lawyers struggling to locate them. This tactic creates an environment of fear and can pressure detainees to abandon their cases.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that despite campaign promises to lower energy prices, the Trump administration's actions are driving up electricity costs. The author cites several policies, including raising taxes on clean energy, blocking renewable projects on federal lands, and imposing tariffs that increase the cost of materials for all types of power generation. The article also points to support for increased natural gas exports, which reduces domestic supply, and forcing customers to subsidize unprofitable coal plants. The author concludes these actions are either a result of economic incompetence or a deliberate strategy to make electricity more expensive.</p>

Spanning nearly 9,000 square feet on a one-acre lot, the property features 10 bedrooms, ornate details like coffered ceilings and stained-glass windows, and a hidden bookshelf door.

          <p>Following President Trump's suggestion of a link between Tylenol and autism, medical experts are emphasizing a more nuanced view of the research. Physicians and even authors of studies cited by the White House clarify that while some association exists with chronic use, no causal relationship has been proven, and acetaminophen remains the safest option for treating fever in pregnancy. Untreated fevers pose significant, documented risks to a fetus, including birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders. The consensus from medical groups is that pregnant individuals should use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time under a doctor's guidance.</p>

This plan is modeled on international administrations that oversaw transitions in East Timor and Kosovo. Blair, who served as a Middle East envoy after leaving office, has recently participated in planning talks with U.S. officials regarding Gaza's future, though his office stated he would not support any plan that displaces its people.</p>
