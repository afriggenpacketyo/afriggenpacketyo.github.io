          <p>San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey is listed as questionable for the season opener due to a calf issue, raising concerns among fans given his injury history. McCaffrey, however, expressed confidence to reporters, stating he feels "great" and plans to play against the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. This situation mirrors last season when a similar injury concern led to him being placed on injured reserve, but he insists this time is different and that missing practice was a precautionary measure.</p>

          <p>For the second time in two days, Venezuelan military aircraft, identified as F-16 fighter jets, have flown over the USS Jason Dunham in international waters. U.S. Defense Department officials described the action as a "game of chicken" and a "highly provocative move" intended to interfere with American counter-narcotics operations in the region. The incident follows a U.S. strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug-trafficking boat and a warning from President Trump that such actions could lead to trouble.</p>

The ruling states that the Department of Homeland Security's decision to revoke their protected status was unlawful, especially since conditions in their home countries remain dangerous. This decision allows approximately 1.1 million people to continue living and working legally in the U.S., though the DHS has indicated it will appeal.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has updated a draft of its major cryptocurrency market structure bill, the Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025. A key new provision aims to prevent traditional securities, like stocks, from being regulated as commodities if they are converted into tokenized digital assets. The bill, championed by Senator Cynthia Lummis, seeks to establish clear regulatory boundaries between the SEC and CFTC for digital assets and is hoped to be passed by the end of the year.

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.8 billion, winners face a critical decision between taking a lump sum or receiving annual payments. A certified public accountant advises that while the lump sum offers investment control, it can be "dangerous" for those unaccustomed to managing vast wealth, noting many past winners have gone bankrupt. The annuity option is presented as a "safe bet" that makes it harder to overspend, though the net payout after taxes is significantly reduced. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter has publicly questioned the status of a complaint against Snap's "My AI" chatbot. The FTC referred the complaint, which alleges the chatbot poses risks to young users, to the Department of Justice in January, but there has been no public update since. Slaughter stated that the public deserves answers regarding the investigation, highlighting ongoing concerns about the safety of AI products, particularly those interacting with children.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added only 22,000 jobs in August, falling far short of forecasts and raising concerns about the nation's economic health. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, its highest level since 2021, while job numbers for June were revised to show a net loss, the first monthly decline since 2020. Economists attribute the slowdown to uncertainty from the Trump administration's tariffs and other factors, increasing the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates.

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission is reversing its rule that would have banned noncompete agreements for most U.S. workers. The ban, finalized under the Biden administration, was halted by a federal judge and is now being formally vacated by the new Trump-appointed FTC leadership. The new chair, Andrew Ferguson, argued the rule was an overreach of authority but stated the agency will instead pursue enforcement actions against specific, abusive noncompete agreements that violate existing antitrust laws.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to officially rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War, restoring the name it held until 1947. The administration stated the change is intended to "project strength and resolve" and foster a "warrior ethos" within the U.S. military. The move, which has been criticized by some as a childish and needlessly aggressive rebranding, will require congressional approval to become permanent and could cost billions to implement across the agency.</p>
