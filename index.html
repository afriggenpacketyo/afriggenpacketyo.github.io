          <p>A 64-year-old man has been arrested by the FBI in connection with a drive-by shooting at the ABC10 television station in Sacramento. The building was struck by at least three rounds on Friday, though fortunately, no injuries were reported among the station's staff. The suspect, initially arrested by local police and released on bail, was taken back into custody on federal charges of interfering with a radio communications station. The motive for the attack remains under investigation, prompting condemnation from officials as an attack on democracy.</p>

          <p>Individuals facing terminal illness are increasingly creating personal music playlists to provide comfort and connection during their final days. This practice is gaining recognition in palliative care for its therapeutic benefits, as music can trigger powerful memories and emotions, reducing anxiety and psychological pain. Neurologically, music activates multiple brain regions, allowing it to reach even unconscious patients, as hearing is often the last sense to fade. These playlists also serve as a lasting comfort for grieving loved ones, helping them stay connected to the person who has passed away.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region saw gains on Monday, following a strong performance on Wall Street at the end of the previous week. Investors are closely watching for China's upcoming decision on its loan prime rates, with analysts polled by Reuters widely expecting the rates to remain unchanged. This anticipation follows the central bank's recent move to hold a key interest rate steady. Major indices in Japan, South Korea, and Australia all opened higher, reflecting a generally positive sentiment across the region's financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German and Swedish fighter jets were scrambled to intercept a Russian IL-20M reconnaissance aircraft flying over the Baltic Sea without a flight plan or radio contact. The German military visually identified the plane before handing over the escort to their Swedish NATO partners. This incident is the latest in a series of recent Russian military incursions into or near NATO airspace, which have heightened regional tensions. Other recent events include Russian drones entering Polish airspace and fighter jets violating Estonian airspace, prompting consultations among NATO allies.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance's prominent role at Charlie Kirk's memorial service is being interpreted as a strategic move to solidify his position as a frontrunner for the 2028 Republican presidential nomination. By aligning himself closely with Kirk's legacy, Vance is appealing to the influential young Christian conservative base that Kirk cultivated through Turning Point USA. His actions, including guest-hosting Kirk's podcast and taking a hardline stance on cultural issues, reflect an ambition to merge Donald Trump's populist appeal with a more focused brand of economic nationalism, setting the stage for his political future.</p>

          <p>In a coordinated diplomatic shift, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have officially recognized a Palestinian state. The leaders of the three nations stated the move is intended to revive hope for a two-state solution and is not a reward for Hamas, which they emphasized can have no role in a future government. The decision drew a sharp rebuke from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a "huge reward to terror" and vowed that a Palestinian state would not be established. The largely symbolic act aligns these countries with over 140 other nations that already recognize Palestine.</p>

          <p>According to a researcher who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, children with exceptional social skills are often raised by parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. These practices include openly discussing feelings to build emotional vocabulary, demonstrating empathy in daily interactions, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Parents are also advised to teach conflict resolution, validate their child's feelings, and help them recognize social cues. By creating an environment of emotional safety, parents can equip their children for healthy real-world relationships.</p>

The project, named "Mice Against Ticks," aims to create mice that are heritably immune to Lyme, meaning their immunity is passed down to their offspring. By introducing these engineered mice into the ecosystem on islands like Nantucket, scientists hope to break the transmission cycle where ticks become infected by biting mice.

This special generation lives up to nine times longer than typical monarchs, allowing them to complete the arduous journey their ancestors have made for thousands of years. However, the monarch population has declined significantly due to habitat loss, particularly the eradication of milkweed plants essential for their life cycle. Efforts are underway to protect their wintering grounds and restore milkweed habitats.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are expected to be part of an investor group aiming to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as likely participants, describing them as "American patriots." The potential sale is mandated by a 2024 law requiring the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. arm over national security concerns. The White House has signaled that a deal could be finalized in the coming days, potentially giving influential media figures control over the popular platform.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expected to announce that the use of Tylenol (acetaminophen) by pregnant women is potentially linked to autism, according to reports. Federal health officials may warn against its use early in pregnancy unless for a fever, and also highlight a form of folate as a possible treatment. The maker of Tylenol, Kenvue, has strongly refuted any causal link, citing over a decade of research and stating that such claims pose a health risk to expecting mothers with few safe alternatives for fever reduction. President Trump has teased a major announcement related to autism.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has called for a universal condemnation of political violence, regardless of its source. Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," Shapiro described the nation as being at an "inflection point" and urged Americans to focus on commonalities rather than differences. He referenced his own recent experience with political violence, including an April firebombing at the governor's mansion. Shapiro emphasized the distinction between protected, though sometimes hateful, political speech and illicit incitement to violence under U.S. law.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary defensive plays that were instrumental in his team's 3-2 victory over the New York Mets. In the fifth inning, Young prevented an extra-base hit with a juggling, "hacky-sack" style catch, kicking the ball back into the air with his foot after it was jarred from his glove at the wall. Later, in the ninth inning, he made a leaping grab at the fence to rob Francisco Álvarez of a potential game-tying home run. The loss was a significant blow to the Mets' playoff hopes in a tight National League wildcard race.</p>

          <p>Gabrielle has intensified into a Category 1 hurricane, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. The National Hurricane Center reported that the storm is currently located southeast of Bermuda and is tracking north-northwest with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph. While no watches or warnings are currently in effect for land, swells generated by the hurricane are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward. The storm formed about a week after the historical peak of the hurricane season.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung stated he would agree to a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that freezes North Korea's nuclear weapons production as a realistic interim step. In an interview with the BBC, Lee acknowledged that while complete denuclearization remains the long-term goal, an immediate freeze would be a feasible alternative given that the North is producing 15-20 new nuclear weapons annually. He expressed hope that Trump and Kim could resume talks, citing their apparent mutual trust, which could contribute to regional and global security.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has officially approved a £2.2 billion, privately-financed plan to build a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport. The project involves bringing the airport's existing northern runway into regular use, which could increase its annual flight capacity from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 by the late 2030s. While the government and airport officials champion the expansion for its potential to create jobs and stimulate economic growth, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups. Campaigners have condemned the move as a "disaster for the climate crisis" due to the inevitable rise in emissions.</p>

          <p>A three-year-old female mountain lion, known as F390, was struck and killed by a vehicle on State Route 74 in San Juan Capistrano, leaving her two 14-month-old cubs to fend for themselves. According to the UC Davis California Carnivores Program, the cubs were still dependent on their mother for learning crucial hunting and survival skills. Researchers successfully placed a GPS tracking collar on the female cub to monitor her progress and survival in the wild without her mother. The incident highlights the significant threat that vehicle collisions pose to Southern California's fragmented mountain lion populations.</p>
