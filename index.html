          <p>Lando Norris topped the final practice session at the Japanese Grand Prix, but the session was significantly disrupted by trackside grass fires. The fires, believed to be caused by sparks from the cars igniting dry grass, led to two red flags despite mitigation efforts implemented after similar incidents on Friday. The FIA plans to further dampen the grass before qualifying to prevent additional disruptions. Rain is expected on race day, adding another layer of complexity to the event.</p>

          <p>In Delta, Ohio, a town with strong support for Donald Trump, residents express optimism about the president's newly unveiled global tariffs. Despite market turmoil and warnings of rising consumer prices, many believe the tariffs will level the playing field and boost US industry. Residents are willing to endure potential price increases if it means bringing companies and jobs back to America. Even those with reservations about Trump's policies are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, hoping for positive change.</p>

          <p>Nike's iconic Air Jordan 1s could see price increases due to President Trump's tariffs on goods from Asia, where the majority of Nike's shoes are manufactured. The company's stock fell after the tariff announcement, raising concerns about the impact on its supply chain. While Nike may try to absorb some of the costs, analysts predict that prices will likely rise by 10-15%. Nike might also consider downgrading the technology used in the shoes or extending the design cycle to keep retail prices low.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's cuts to the federal bureaucracy have included slashing funding to the Institute of Museum and Library Services, an agency that provides grants to America's libraries. Staffers from Elon Musk's budget-cutting team, DOGE, descended on the Institute, leading to terminated grants and disruption to library services. The cuts are impacting programs and services that support libraries in rural areas, leaving library officials in a state of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Senator Marco Rubio defended the US response to the Myanmar earthquake, dismissing criticism that the Trump administration's cuts to USAID hindered rescue efforts. Rubio argued that the US had to balance humanitarian aid with other national interests. He blamed the military regime in Myanmar for limited access, despite the state department's claim of a formal request for assistance. Rubio also criticized global NGOs, stating that the US would prioritize direct assistance over funding them.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's tariffs are roiling global financial markets, with stocks tumbling across the board from New York to London. Wall Street suffered its worst week since the onset of the Covid-19 crisis five years ago as investors worldwide balked at the US president’s risky bid to overhaul the global economy with the vast tariffs. Experts are all but unanimous that the impact on global growth of Wednesday’s extraordinary Rose Garden press conference will be negative – but just how bad remains highly uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Senate is on track to adopt the GOP budget plan after a marathon vote series, inching closer to enacting President Trump's agenda. The resolution aims to make tax cuts permanent, authorize additional tax cuts, and raise the debt ceiling. Democrats are offering amendments to challenge Republicans on issues such as Medicaid and tariffs. The budget blueprint is the first step in the reconciliation process, allowing Congress to bypass the usual 60-vote threshold in the Senate.</p>
