        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order designating the left-wing Antifa movement as a "domestic terrorist organization," citing a pattern of political violence. This move followed the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, an event Trump linked to left-wing rhetoric, although investigators have not confirmed any group affiliation for the suspect. The order mandates federal agencies to investigate and dismantle this decentralized movement, which identifies as anti-fascist and anti-racist. Critics express concern that this designation, unprecedented for a domestic group under U.S. law, could expand surveillance powers and potentially suppress free speech, while experts highlight that far-right violence remains the leading domestic extremist threat.</p>

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to China David Perdue stated that a significant meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is more likely to take place early next year rather than this fall. This assessment followed a Friday call where Trump mentioned a potential meeting in South Korea next month and subsequent reciprocal visits, details not corroborated by China's official statement. Perdue, speaking during a U.S. lawmaker delegation's rare visit to Beijing, described the relationship between Trump and Xi as "very good and very encouraging." The delegation also discussed resolving differences over TikTok ownership and stressed the importance of boosting communication, especially on military matters, to prevent misunderstandings between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>Singapore's core inflation rate, which excludes private transport and accommodation costs, registered a softer-than-expected rise of 0.3% in August, reaching its lowest point since February 2021. This figure was below economists' projections and a decrease from the previous month's 0.5%. Headline inflation also eased to 0.5%. The Monetary Authority of Singapore had projected core inflation to average between 0.5% and 1.5% for 2025. This easing occurs as Singapore anticipates weaker economic growth in the latter half of the year, despite better-than-expected GDP growth in the second quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky referenced "Russia's violation" of NATO airspace in Copenhagen, but Danish police stated no immediate link between the incidents in Norway and Denmark has been established, and EU/NATO leaders have not made public attributions.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mike Freelander, a pediatrician, strongly urged Australians to rely on scientific evidence for medication decisions, specifically refuting U.S. President Donald Trump's recent comments linking paracetamol (Tylenol) use during pregnancy to autism. Freelander highlighted that extensive studies have disproven a causative effect, with the largest Swedish and Japanese studies finding no such link, despite small associations. He stressed that paracetamol is classified as safe and crucial in pregnancy, with alternatives posing greater risks to the fetus. The article criticizes Trump and his health secretary for promoting unscientific health policies that cause distress and could lead to inappropriate health outcomes, emphasizing the importance of trusting regulatory bodies like Australia's TGA.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation uncovered an industrial-scale black market for Premier League tickets, where unauthorized resale websites exploit fans by selling tickets at inflated prices or rendering them invalid. The issue was starkly illustrated when a South Korean fan paid £900 for a Tottenham ticket that was deactivated upon entry to a Brighton match. Brighton & Hove Albion Football Club is actively combating this illegal practice, utilizing new technologies and a dedicated tickets investigation officer to identify and block hundreds of touted tickets, preventing significant financial gains for touts. The club urges fans to purchase directly from official sources to avoid fraud, while the Premier League is implementing new digital ticketing rules with encrypted barcodes to further deter touting.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco, Rita Lin, ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding that had been frozen at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The judge granted a preliminary injunction, finding that the government likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act by suspending grants without specific details or proper procedures. UCLA had faced a total of $584 million in suspended grants over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. This ruling follows a previous order that restored $81 million to UCLA and aligns with other rulings against the Trump administration's use of federal funding to pressure elite colleges.</p>

Allardyce, who guided Bolton Wanderers to Europe with this style, notes that his methods were once heavily criticized but are now becoming commonplace, with coaches like Luis Enrique even watching games from the stands for a better overview, a practice Allardyce pioneered. The article highlights a shift away from possession-based play and "playing out from the back" due to the high risk of conceding goals. This resurgence suggests a return to more pragmatic and effective strategies that prioritize scoring and defensive solidity.</p>

          <p>While major European financial centers face an IPO drought, Stockholm's Stock Exchange is thriving, raising nearly $2 billion in 2025. This success is attributed to Sweden's deep-seated "equity culture," a diverse pool of domestic capital, and a supportive regulatory framework developed over decades. Government policies, including tax-incentivized savings funds and the Investment Savings Account, have fostered high retail investor participation, with about 70% of household wealth held in equity. The market also benefits from "cornerstone" investors and an efficient IPO process, where private equity firms ensure value for new public investors. Despite being relative to a quiet Europe, Sweden's model provides a blueprint for fostering a robust domestic investment ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Washington, D.C. man, Jacob Samuel Winkler, has been arrested and charged with a federal felony for allegedly shining a laser pointer at presidential helicopter Marine One while President Trump was aboard. A Secret Service officer witnessed Winkler, who was reportedly acting erratically, aiming the red laser beam at the helicopter after flashing it at the officer's face. Authorities stated that this behavior endangered Marine One and its occupants by potentially blinding or disorienting the pilots, risking an airborne collision. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro emphasized that such acts are serious offenses and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle intensified into a major Category 4 storm, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, and was forecast to pass east of Bermuda. Packing maximum sustained winds of 140 mph, Gabrielle is tracking northeast, with swells expected to reach the East Coast from North Carolina to Atlantic Canada, posing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Despite initial NOAA predictions for a busier-than-average season, hurricane activity has been quieter than anticipated, with only one of the previous six named storms making U.S. landfall.

          <p>Stephen Miller delivered a eulogy for Charlie Kirk that is analyzed as a "battle cry" for the Trump administration's "state-sponsored war" on perceived foes, embodying the core ethos of Trumpism. The article critiques Miller's rhetoric, which depicted opponents as "worthless, irredeemably wicked," and destined for destruction, contrasting sharply with Republican complaints about Hillary Clinton's "deplorables" comment. Miller's speech, delivered at high volume, repeatedly asserted the moral superiority of Trump's side and the inherent evil of their adversaries, making no distinction between political opponents and those implicated in Kirk's murder. This analysis highlights a deliberate strategy to demonize opposition and consolidate power through divisive language.</p>

          <p>Writer Jack Thorne commended the "remarkable" journalists who exposed the phone hacking scandal, ahead of ITV's new drama "The Hack," starring David Tennant as investigative reporter Nick Davies. Thorne noted that the scandal revealed a troubling relationship between the press, politics, and police, going beyond just journalistic misconduct. Unlike the Post Office Horizon IT scandal, where a TV dramatization was needed to gain public traction, Thorne celebrates this case as an instance where journalists successfully held their own industry accountable. He acknowledges the bravery required to expose such issues within one's own field, highlighting the importance of independent and courageous journalism.</p>

          <p>China has decisively rejected Nvidia's B40-series chips, stripped-down versions of advanced AI chips offered by the U.S. to slow China's technological progress while maintaining dependence on American suppliers. Regulators have reportedly ordered tech companies to halt purchases and launched antitrust investigations, signaling a turning point in global technology politics. This rejection stems from China's shift in calculus: once tolerating reliance on U.S. supply chains, Washington's sweeping restrictions have made self-sufficiency a national necessity. Beijing views accepting these diluted chips as an acknowledgment of U.S.-dictated tech inferiority, opting instead to vigorously pursue indigenous innovation and technological independence.

This diplomatic move comes amid increasing international pressure on Israel over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and West Bank settlements. The U.S., Germany, and Italy were notably absent from a French-Saudi summit on a two-state solution. While Israel views such recognition as rewarding Hamas, international leaders, including the UN Secretary-General, emphasize a two-state solution as the only credible path to lasting peace, as calls for a permanent ceasefire intensify.</p>

He also advised against giving Tylenol to young children and suggested spacing out childhood immunizations, claiming "they pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies." Trump explicitly stated his advice was based on "what I feel," rather than comprehensive research, dismissing the need for further studies. Medical experts, including Tylenol's maker, strongly refute the autism link, emphasizing the drug's safety for pregnant women and warning of health risks from avoiding it, while researchers note that autism is complex and not attributable to a single cause.</p>

          <p>A decline in sex drive after childbirth is a common experience for many parents, often leading to intimacy issues in relationships. Reality TV star Holly Hagan-Blyth shared her experience, noting how she avoided affection due to fear it would lead to sex, and emphasized the importance of open communication with her husband to alleviate pressure. Medical experts explain that significant hormonal shifts, including drastic drops in estrogen and progesterone, cause physical changes like vaginal dryness, making sex painful. The article also highlights that men can experience a decreased libido due to the emotional impact of fatherhood.

          <p>Hundreds of pigs have been released into England's New Forest for the annual "pannage" season, a historic practice dating back to 1079. This ecological stewardship involves pigs grazing on acorns, chestnuts, and beech mast, which are toxic to the forest's free-roaming ponies and cattle. The verderers initiated pannage due to a "heavy acorn crop," emphasizing its importance for the forest's ecology and the well-being of other livestock. While celebrating this unique tradition, officials urge visitors to maintain a safe distance from the pigs and drive carefully, as past seasons have seen animals struck by cars.
