          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has officially reopened sections of the Seine River for public swimming, a legacy project of the 2024 Olympics. The city has established three supervised swimming zones, complete with lifeguards and amenities, following a €1.4 billion effort to improve water quality, which had been dangerously polluted since the ban was enacted in 1923. While the river hosted Olympic events, this move makes it accessible to the public, fulfilling a long-held promise to reclaim the waterway for residents and tourists.</p>

          <p>Following the tragic death of Liverpool forward Diogo Jota in a car crash, his former Wolves captain Conor Coady shared a heartfelt tribute, describing him as a dream to work with and an amazing person. Coady recounted Jota's immediate impact at Wolves, praising his tenacity, quiet leadership, and the bravery he showed in joining the club while it was in the Championship. He emphasized that Jota's character as a teammate and friend was even more remarkable than his incredible footballing talent, which he later showcased at Liverpool.</p>

          <p>Scotland's rugby team narrowly defeated the Maori All Blacks 29-26 in a thrilling opening match of their New Zealand summer tour. Both teams scored four tries, but a crucial first-half penalty from Adam Hastings made the difference for the tourists. Despite facing intense pressure and going down to 14 men twice, Scotland's defense held firm in the final moments to secure the win. The victory was a significant achievement for a predominantly second-string Scottish side against a formidable opponent in Whangarei.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation into Bangor Cathedral has uncovered serious allegations of a "binge drinking culture" and significant safeguarding failures under the leadership of the recently retired Archbishop of Wales. Former choir members described inappropriate events, including a "seven last shots of Christ" drinking game on Good Friday, and a culture where excessive alcohol consumption was normalized. The report also details an instance of sexual assault at a cathedral event and highlights a lack of proper safeguarding training, creating an environment described as unsafe for children.</p>

          <p>The 90-day pause on President Trump's sweeping "liberation day" tariffs is set to expire, creating significant uncertainty for the U.S. economy amid ongoing inflation concerns. Despite administration claims that numerous trade deals would be secured, few have materialized, leaving businesses to grapple with the potential re-imposition of high import duties. Economists and business leaders warn that even existing tariff levels are contributing to rising costs for consumers and could disproportionately harm mid-sized businesses, highlighting the administration's unpredictable trade strategy.

          <p>Scientists in China have made a significant breakthrough in regenerative medicine by successfully restoring damaged ear tissue in mice, a finding that could have future implications for human organ repair. The research, published in the journal Science, identified a disabled "genetic switch" that prevents regeneration in mice. By reactivating this switch, the team was able to induce the production of retinoic acid, a key compound in tissue development, leading to the complete restoration of cartilage and other tissues. This discovery offers new hope and a potential pathway for organ regeneration research.</p>

This approach aligns with the Democratic Progressive Party's emphasis on a distinct Taiwanese identity, separate from the legacy of the KMT party that retreated to Taiwan after the civil war.

          <p>President Donald Trump made a false claim during a speech, suggesting China does not use wind power and stating he had never seen a wind farm there, which prompted immediate fact-checking on social media. In reality, China is the world's leading producer of wind energy, with significantly more capacity than the United States. The comments came as Trump renewed his attacks on renewable energy, coinciding with a new bill that eliminates tax credits for wind and solar projects. Critics argue this move will decimate the industry and represents a major act of strategic self-harm. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a scary knee injury to third baseman Max Muncy, the Los Angeles Dodgers do not anticipate altering their trade deadline strategy. Initial fears of a season-ending injury were allayed when tests revealed only a bone bruise, with an expected recovery time of about six weeks. This timeline would allow Muncy to return well before the playoffs. The team's management expressed confidence in their internal options to cover third base in the interim and believes they can weather his absence without making a desperate trade for a replacement.</p>

          <p>Authorities in New York City temporarily closed a portion of the beach in Far Rockaway, Queens, on the Fourth of July after several sharks were spotted swimming dangerously close to the shore. Drones operated by the city's emergency management team confirmed the sightings, prompting lifeguards to clear the water for about an hour as a safety precaution. The incident occurred just days after New York's governor announced enhanced shark surveillance measures for Long Island beaches ahead of the holiday weekend to ensure the safety of all beachgoers.</p>

The government's new guidelines focus on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through improved technology and digitalization.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has denied a last-ditch legal effort to halt the deportation of eight immigrants, clearing the way for their removal to countries including South Sudan, Vietnam, and Mexico. The men, all of whom have been convicted of serious crimes, were scheduled to be flown out of the country by the Trump administration on Friday evening. Lawyers for the immigrants had argued they could face perilous conditions upon their return, particularly the individual being sent to war-torn South Sudan, but the court ultimately ruled against them.</p>

          <p>A protest in Mexico City against gentrification and the negative impacts of mass tourism turned violent, with some demonstrators smashing storefronts and harassing foreigners. The march, which began peacefully, was organized by locals who are being priced out of their neighborhoods like Condesa and Roma due to soaring rents driven by an influx of foreign "digital nomads." Protesters carried signs demanding stricter housing laws and an end to what they see as the displacement of local residents. The unrest highlights growing tensions over the city's transformation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed his administration's major tax and spending legislation into law during a Fourth of July event at the White House. The bill, which the president called "big, beautiful," enacts significant tax cuts, increases defense spending, and provides more aggressive funding for immigration enforcement. While the administration claims the law will stimulate economic growth, it has been met with fierce opposition from Democrats. Critics warn that the legislation will primarily benefit the wealthy while negatively impacting low-income earners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A controversial Connecticut law that permits towing companies to sell towed vehicles just 15 days after seizing them is facing criticism for being predatory and targeting working-class communities. Residents of a Waterbury apartment complex reported that one company, MyHoopty.com LLC, towed over 1,000 cars in two years, often for minor infractions like expired registrations. Critics argue that the short timeframe and associated high fees make it nearly impossible for low-income individuals to retrieve their vehicles, leading to the loss of essential transportation.</p>
