          <h2>Trump Administration to Request Unsealing of Jeffrey Epstein Grand Jury Transcripts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 22:15:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following public pressure, President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek court approval for the release of grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. This move comes amid ongoing conspiracy theories about Epstein's death and a supposed "client list," which the Justice Department has stated does not exist. While the request aims to address demands for transparency from both Republicans and Democrats, legal experts note that unsealing grand jury records is rare and requires overcoming significant legal hurdles. The transcripts would also only represent a small portion of the total evidence gathered in the investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to two U.S. intelligence sources, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian was injured last month during an Israeli attack on Iran. The sources confirmed Iranian state-run media reports that Pezeshkian sustained leg injuries while escaping through an emergency shaft during a Supreme National Security Council meeting targeted by the strike. In a recent interview, Pezeshkian himself claimed Israel had attempted to assassinate him but failed. The incident occurred during a 12-day conflict that also saw the deaths of several high-ranking Iranian military commanders and concluded with a ceasefire brokered by the Trump administration.</p>

          <h2>China Reveals New Military Drone with Vertical Take-Off and Landing Capabilities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 22:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has unveiled a new unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that takes off and lands vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket. Developed by the state-owned Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, the drone demonstrated advanced autonomous capabilities, including target allocation and threat avoidance, during a recent test in Sichuan province. This design allows it to operate without a runway, providing significant tactical flexibility for reconnaissance and situational awareness missions in rugged terrain. With a 2.6-meter wingspan, the drone's design resembles the U.S. military's MQ-35 V-BAT, enabling faster flight than a quadcopter.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are struggling to pass a $9 billion rescissions package, which targets foreign aid and public broadcasting, before a critical deadline. The effort has been complicated by internal party divisions over releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Democrats have demanded a vote on a bipartisan bill to force the release of the Epstein documents, but Republican leadership has resisted, offering a non-binding resolution instead. This political infighting has stalled the funding-cut legislation, which the Senate has already passed in a slightly smaller version, highlighting deep rifts within the GOP.</p>

          <p>The state of California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for canceling $4 billion in federal funding for its high-speed rail project. The suit, filed by Attorney General Rob Bonta, alleges the decision was politically motivated, arbitrary, and an abuse of discretion that will cause significant economic harm to the state's Central Valley. Governor Gavin Newsom described the move as a "heartless attack" and a "political stunt to punish California." The administration cited budget shortfalls and missed deadlines in its decision to pull the funding from the long-delayed project connecting San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>President Trump's ongoing criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stems from the central bank's decision to maintain relatively high interest rates to combat inflation. This article details the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices, explaining how raising rates cools inflation but can slow economic growth. Trump, who appointed Powell in his first term, has recently expressed frustration with these policies and a costly renovation of the Fed's headquarters, even inquiring about the possibility of firing the chair. However, federal law protects Fed board members from being removed without cause, making such an action legally untested and potentially disruptive to financial markets.</p>

This follows the recent elimination of the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screening.

Despite the cooling, this marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, maintaining pressure on the central bank to consider raising interest rates.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a common vein condition, following speculation over photographs showing swollen legs and a bruised hand. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the diagnosis came after a comprehensive exam and that the condition is benign, particularly in individuals over 70. A note from the White House physician confirmed there is no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. CVI occurs when leg veins struggle to pump blood back to the heart, causing fluid to pool in the lower limbs.</p>

          <p>Five migrants deported from the United States to Eswatini under a third-country agreement are being held in solitary confinement, according to an Eswatini government spokesperson. The men, who the U.S. says were convicted of serious crimes, are citizens of other nations and were sent to the southern African country because their home countries would not accept them. This action is part of the Trump administration's controversial program of deporting individuals to countries with which they have no ties. Human rights reports have previously cited credible accounts of torture and inhumane conditions within Eswatini's prison system.</p>

          <p>In this op-ed, Dr. Thienminh Dinh, an internationally mobile doctor, recounts the harrowing conditions and profound human suffering witnessed while working in a Gaza field hospital. The article describes treating severely injured children, including a 10-year-old orphan whose body was shattered in an airstrike that killed her mother and brother. Dr. Dinh rejects the label of "hero," instead bestowing it upon the local Palestinian healthcare workers who continue their duties daily despite immense personal loss and constant danger. The author calls for an end to the blockade, the bombing of hospitals, and a permanent ceasefire.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beef prices in the United States have reached record levels, with the average price of ground beef hitting $6.12 per pound in June. This surge is attributed to a decades-long decline in the U.S. cattle herd, which is now at its smallest size since 1951. Factors contributing to the tight supply include persistent drought, which has raised feed costs and led ranchers to sell off cattle, and a recent ban on cattle imports from Mexico due to a parasite outbreak. Experts suggest that with strong consumer demand during grilling season, significant price relief is unlikely in the near future.</p>

          <p>Abbott Laboratories CEO Robert Ford stated that the more than 8% drop in his company's stock was an "overreaction" from Wall Street. While Abbott beat second-quarter earnings expectations, investors were disappointed by the company's decision to tighten its full-year earnings guidance. Ford attributed the revised forecast primarily to weaker-than-expected performance in its diagnostics business in China, while emphasizing that other segments, like medical devices, are seeing double-digit growth. He expressed confidence in the company's fundamentals but acknowledged it may take a few quarters for the China diagnostics market to recover. (not investment advice)</p>

The former USC star was arrested after a highway patrol officer found him asleep at the wheel of a Rolls-Royce blocking traffic near LAX. As part of the plea deal, Addison was sentenced to 12 months of probation, a $390 fine, and must complete two online courses.

The inquiry from the White House is seen as part of a broader pressure campaign by the Trump administration, which has grown increasingly frustrated with the Fed's refusal to lower interest rates.

          <p>President Trump is facing increasing pressure from both his own supporters and Democrats to release all Justice Department files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a demand he continues to resist. The controversy has been fueled by conspiracy theories and the recent revelation of a bizarre, hand-drawn note from Trump to Epstein, which the President denies writing. While Trump has directed his AG to seek the release of grand jury transcripts, critics argue this is insufficient and that the full file is a matter of public interest. This has placed congressional Republicans in a difficult position, appearing to shield potential co-conspirators.</p>
