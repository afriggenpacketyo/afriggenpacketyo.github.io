        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bill Owens, the executive producer of '60 Minutes,' resigned after 37 years with CBS News, citing concerns over corporate interference and a loss of independence in running the show. His departure follows months of alleged heavy-handed treatment by corporate leaders, potentially influenced by President Trump's lawsuit against CBS's parent company, Paramount, over an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump's lawsuit alleges election interference, which legal observers dismiss, but Owens reportedly refused to apologize to Trump. The pending sale of Paramount to Skydance Media, led by a Trump associate's son, adds further complexity to the situation, raising questions about the show's future editorial direction. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court appeared sympathetic to parents in Montgomery County, Maryland, who sought the right to opt their children out of elementary school reading material featuring LGBTQ+ themes. The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, centers on whether the school district's policy violates the parents' religious freedom. Justices debated the balance between inclusivity initiatives and parental rights, with concerns raised about the content of some books and the potential for widespread opt-outs. The court's decision, expected by late June, could significantly impact how public schools address religious objections to curriculum content.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts caution that the Trump administration's resumption of collecting defaulted student loan payments from millions of borrowers could negatively impact the U.S. economy, which already faces recession risks. Approximately 5 million borrowers will have their loans sent to collections, potentially leading to wage garnishments and reduced consumer spending. While the overall impact may be smaller than factors like tariffs, the debt collections could exacerbate economic challenges, particularly for borrowers with damaged credit scores. The policy clarifies the path forward for loan payments after years of uncertainty. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price has climbed above $90,000, driven by investors seeking alternatives to a weakening dollar and volatile stock markets. The cryptocurrency has shown resilience, decoupling from risk assets as it gains over 9% in April, outperforming gold. Despite the positive trend, analysts note light trading volumes and emphasize the need for a significant catalyst, such as Federal Reserve easing or tariff deals, for Bitcoin to break through resistance levels. The recent surge coincides with renewed pressure from President Trump on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cautioned that President Trump's tariffs pose a significant threat to the global economy, potentially sparking a full-blown trade war.

The surge in policy uncertainty, driven by Trump's tariffs on steel, aluminum, and Chinese goods, is a major concern, with fears rising that targeted countries will retaliate.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has emphasized the critical role of the US-India partnership in global progress, warning that the 21st century could be a "dark time for humanity" without close cooperation between the two nations. Vance contrasted India's rising power and national identity with a "self-loathing" West. He also praised Prime Minister Modi and advocated for increased US military equipment sales to India. Vance said US and Indian negotiators had finalized “terms of reference” for a bilateral trade agreement that Delhi is urgently seeking.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that revenue from tariffs could potentially replace the federal income tax, an idea he previously mentioned during his presidential campaign. However, economists are skeptical of this proposal, deeming it unrealistic. While tariff negotiations are ongoing, economists argue that the scale of tariffs required to offset income tax revenue would be impractical and economically damaging. There's currently a 90-day pause on the sweeping tariffs enacted by the Trump administration in early April, and most countries face a universal tariff rate of 10%.</p>

The author argues that the relevant legal and constitutional issues have nothing to do with whether Abrego Garcia is a good person or not. The key questions are whether the administration has the power to bypass due process and whether it has to try to remedy the mistake it made in sending Abrego Garcia to a foreign prison. The government has broad authority to deport illegal immigrants. It also has the authority to put convicted criminals in any prison it deems appropriate.</p>
