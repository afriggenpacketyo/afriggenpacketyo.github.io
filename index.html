          <p>This article argues that the cooperative "Shanghai spirit" demonstrated by Asian powers like China, Russia, and India needs a corresponding Western commitment to prevent global fragmentation. It suggests that political declarations are insufficient without robust economic institutions similar to the post-World War II Bretton Woods system. The author posits that creating new monetary, trade, and development frameworks is essential to support a new world order. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), now encompassing 27 members and partners, is highlighted as a significant bloc that could contribute to such a global initiative.</p>

          <p>A significant fire occurred at a restaurant within the BBC's former Television Centre headquarters in West London, prompting a large-scale emergency response. Approximately 100 firefighters and 15 fire engines were dispatched to the nine-story building in White City, which now contains flats, studios, and restaurants. Residents were evacuated from the building as a precautionary measure, with reports of smoke filling the corridors. While the fire caused considerable disruption and damage to the restaurant and external decking, London Fire Brigade has not reported any casualties from the incident.</p>

          <p>Prince Hisahito, nephew of Japan's Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a formal coming-of-age ceremony, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. As the second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his status intensifies the ongoing debate about the country's male-only succession laws. With only two male heirs younger than the current emperor, there are growing concerns about the future of the 2,600-year-old monarchy. The ceremony has renewed public discussion around whether the rules should be changed to allow female members, like Emperor Naruhito's daughter Princess Aiko, to ascend the throne.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, Germany, with a series of exhibitions and events. However, the centennial is shadowed by political attacks from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has criticized the movement's 'globalist uniformity' and echoes historical condemnations by the Nazi party. The Bauhaus Dessau Foundation's director expressed concern over the AfD's rise but noted that the campaign has also generated significant public support for the institution. The centennial's theme, 'To the Core,' explores both the materials used in modernist design and the movement's societal impact.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard in Washington, D.C. to address crime has ignited a contentious debate between congressional Democrats and Republicans. Democrats have criticized the move as an overreach and an embarrassment on the world stage, especially since Mayor Muriel Bowser did not request the troops. Conversely, Republicans argue the presence of the Guard has made the city safer, citing a reduction in crime rates. The deployment follows the federalization of the local police force and has led to a lawsuit from the D.C. Attorney General seeking to remove the troops.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to analysis from Oxford Economics, China's recent push to combat 'involution'—destructive, low-quality price competition—is not expected to trigger a large-scale supply-side reform like the one initiated in 2015. While President Xi Jinping's criticism of cutthroat discounting has raised investor hopes for significant economic intervention, the current environment makes such measures difficult. The research firm suggests that China currently lacks the capacity for both major production cuts and meaningful demand-side stimulus. Therefore, the path to resolving the country's supply-demand imbalances appears more complex and less direct than in the past. (not investment advice)</p>

The audacious save, where Higuita cleared the ball by diving forward and kicking it with his heels over his back, cemented his reputation as one of football's most flamboyant and unconventional players. Known as 'El Loco' (The Madman), Higuita was a pioneer of the 'sweeper-keeper' role, famous for his risk-taking style, goal-scoring abilities, and on-field dribbling.

A looming confidence vote against Prime Minister Francois Bayrou's government, which lacks a majority for its proposed budget cuts, is heightening market uncertainty. Economists are concerned that political deadlock and a failure to implement austerity measures could destabilize the eurozone's second-largest economy, although a short-term crisis is not yet anticipated. The situation is complicated by pressure from the EU to reduce its budget deficit and the potential for widespread strikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The sudden resignation of UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and the ensuing cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Keir Starmer are dominating British newspaper headlines. Media outlets describe the situation as a 'meltdown' and a 'Nightmare on Downing Street,' with Starmer seen as battling to control a crisis within his Labour government. The large-scale reshuffle is interpreted as a desperate attempt to restore order and counter the government's declining poll numbers and the rise of the Reform UK party. Commentators view the loss of Rayner as a significant blow, removing a key figure who connected with a different segment of the electorate than Starmer.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 Jannik Sinner has reached the U.S. Open final after defeating Félix Auger-Aliassime 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 in a competitive semifinal match. After a dominant first set, Sinner appeared to be hampered by a stomach issue and called for a trainer, allowing the Canadian to capture the second set. However, the defending champion recovered his form to close out the match, becoming the youngest man in the Open era to reach all four major finals in a single season. He will now face Carlos Alcaraz in a historic final that will also decide the year-end No. 1 ranking.</p>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the United States, is set to deliver a speech describing President Donald Trump as a maverick 'risk taker' whose disruptive approach is necessary in a world where business as usual is failing. The speech is seen as a strategic move to solidify the UK-US relationship and counter the influence of Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who has aligned himself with Trump's MAGA movement. In a notable shift, Mandelson, a prominent anti-Brexit campaigner, will also reportedly cast Brexit as a liberating force that has freed the UK to pursue closer economic ties with the United States.</p>

In response, Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, stated there is no causal link, a position supported by the FDA and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Medical experts emphasize that research on the topic is conflicting and inconclusive, with some large-scale studies finding no association.

          <p>China is leveraging its party-to-party diplomatic channels as President Xi Jinping hosted leaders from the world's four other ruling communist parties. These interactions, managed by the Communist Party's International Department, are a key component of China's foreign policy, distinct from traditional state-level diplomacy. This approach allows Beijing to build relationships and exert influence with over 600 political parties worldwide, not just those in power. While China does not aim to lead a global communist movement, these party-centric engagements have become an increasingly active and important tool in its diplomatic strategy, particularly in regions like the Middle East.</p>
