          <p>Thursday's UK newspaper headlines are dominated by Sir Keir Starmer's reversal on winter fuel payments for pensioners, a move seen as a significant backtrack after facing pressure from Labour MPs and local election defeats. The Financial Times highlights Starmer's 'U-turn' due to growing backbench rebellion. Several papers also cover Donald Trump's meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, where Trump confronted him with a video alleging white farmers in South Africa were being murdered and their land confiscated, sparking controversy. Other headlines include potential wealth taxes and Tottenham's Europa League victory.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has confirmed that Canada is engaged in "high level" discussions with the United States regarding participation in President Donald Trump's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense program. The program, estimated to cost $175 billion, aims to create a multi-layered defense system capable of detecting and intercepting various missile threats. Carney emphasized the growing missile threats, including those potentially originating from space, and stated that Canada is seriously considering contributing to the program to enhance its national security, though he did not disclose potential financial commitments.

The amendment also renames MAGA Savings Accounts to "Trump" Accounts and expedites cuts to clean energy credits.

Kim attributed the accident to carelessness and ordered immediate restoration and investigation, emphasizing the political significance of the repair.

          <p>President Trump's massive tax and spending bill has cleared a procedural hurdle in the House of Representatives, setting up a floor vote despite deep divisions among Republicans. The bill, which extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and increases spending on the military and immigration enforcement, faces opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans who are concerned about its impact on the national debt. The bill would tighten eligibility for food and health programs for low-income Americans to offset the costs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $3.8 trillion to the US's debt over the next decade.</p>

          <p>President Trump's shifting trade tactics are creating uncertainty for India and its American business partners, particularly Apple, which has been diversifying its production away from China. Despite India's efforts to attract businesses fleeing China and its cozy relationship with Prime Minister Modi, Trump has changed his approach with China, reducing tariffs and complicating India's trade negotiations. Trump has also demanded that Apple move its production to the United States instead of India, jeopardizing India's efforts to become a manufacturing hub.

The program is allocated around 1 trillion yen and could last until the end of March 2026, with the reintroduction of subsidies coinciding with an upcoming parliamentary election.

          <p>President Trump publicly dressed down South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval Office based on a fringe conspiracy theory about the persecution of white South Africans. Trump claimed that white people were "being executed" and questioned Ramaphosa about why he was not doing more, despite police statistics showing no evidence that white people are more vulnerable to violent crime. Trump's actions demonstrate his views on race, framing white people as victims and ignoring the complexities of South Africa's history. He even played a video purporting to show burial sites of murdered white farmers, further promoting the false narrative.</p>

The legislation includes extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts, temporary changes designed to make good on several of Trump's campaign pledges, and several proposed changes to Medicaid. The House plan would lift the cap to $40,000 for married couples with incomes up to $500,000. Beginning at the end of 2026, childless adults without disabilities would be required to work 80 hours per month to qualify for Medicaid benefits.</p>

JPMorgan upgraded emerging market equities, citing easing U.S.-China trade tensions and attractive valuations.

          <p>A federal judge has stated that the Trump administration "unquestionably" violated a court order by attempting to deport eight migrant detainees, including some from Myanmar and Vietnam, to South Sudan. The administration said the eight men were in the U.S. illegally and hailed from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan and Vietnam. The judge ordered the administration to retain custody of the would-be deportees and provide them with "reasonable fear" interviews, assessing their legal entitlement to stay in the U.S. due to risk of persecution or torture.</p>

The groups accuse the airlines of misleading passengers and creating confusion by charging additional fees for hand baggage that doesn't meet their guidelines. They claim these practices breach EU consumer law, with passengers potentially paying up to €280 extra for luggage. The groups have requested an investigation by the European Commission and national consumer authorities, demanding sanctions for the "illegal" practices and advocating for a standard luggage allowance within ticket purchases.</p>

The 5,000-ton destroyer sustained damage due to a loss of balance during launch, with some sections of the bottom crushed. Kim vowed to hold officials accountable and ordered repairs to be completed before June. The incident follows the unveiling of another 5,000-ton destroyer-class vessel last month.

Immigration has been a cultural fault line in British politics, with attitudes to immigration and race shaping voter allegiances.</p>
