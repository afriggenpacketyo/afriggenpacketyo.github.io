          <p>A New York judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, his former co-star in 'It Ends With Us.' The lawsuit stemmed from Lively's allegations of sexual harassment on set and a smear campaign against her, which she detailed in a New York Times article and subsequent legal complaint against Baldoni's Wayfarer Studios. The judge ruled that Baldoni failed to adequately prove Lively's threats amounted to wrongful extortion and that evidence did not show the New York Times acted with malice in publishing their story. Baldoni has until June 23 to amend and refile allegations related to contract interference, while Lively had previously sought to withdraw claims of emotional distress from her suit.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is splitting into two companies, raising questions about the future of TNT Sports. The new structure will separate streaming and studios from legacy cable networks and TNT Sports. CEO David Zaslav indicated that it will be up to the Global Networks team to decide how to monetize TNT Sports programming, including licensing it to other businesses. This could lead to a merger or licensing deal with another media company, such as Comcast's forthcoming Versant spinout, but tax implications will need to be considered. (not investment advice)</p>

President Trump's federalization of the California National Guard raises questions about the legal basis for such action. The author argues that the protests do not meet the threshold of a "rebellion" and that the use of the military in domestic situations should be a last resort. The situation is especially alarming given the Trump administration's history of disregarding norms and the broad powers granted to the president under the Insurrection Act.</p>

          <p>The White House stated that the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles was intended to deter violence amid protests, following a tense phone call between President Trump and Governor Newsom. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed Newsom and Mayor Bass had "handicapped" the LAPD, leading to increased violence. Leavitt suggested that political leaders could face arrest for obstructing federal enforcement, and the president is considering all options, including invoking the Insurrection Act. The administration aims to create an environment for peaceful protest while addressing violent disruptions.</p>

Rudd, who was groomed online and investigated by MI5, took her own life in a children's home in 2022 after the charges were dropped. The coroner found there was arguably a "systems failure" by counter-terror police and Derbyshire County Council, failing to refer her earlier as a potential victim of modern slavery.

          <p>Florida's Department of Children and Families (DCF) sent a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, demanding it cease reporting on foster families for a story about a nonprofit associated with Governor Ron DeSantis' wife, Casey DeSantis. The agency claimed the newspaper intimidated foster families into making negative statements about the Hope Florida Foundation. The Orlando Sentinel's executive editor refuted the agency's claims, stating the story was investigating grants distributed by Hope Florida. The DCF posted the cease-and-desist letter on social media, defending Hope Florida's support for foster families.</p>

          <p>A medical tribunal has determined that the failings of a doctor in the care of Martha Mills, who died from sepsis, amounted to "gross negligence" and were "particularly grave". Martha's death led to the implementation of "Martha's Rule" in hundreds of hospitals, granting parents the right to seek an urgent second opinion. The tribunal found that consultant Prof Richard Thompson failed to recognize the severity of Martha's illness and did not examine her in person or transfer her to intensive care. The tribunal concluded that Prof Thompson's fitness to practice is impaired.</p>
