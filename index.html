          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo quipped he would move to Florida if socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani becomes New York City's mayor. The comment, made at a private Hamptons event, drew laughter but also underscored tensions in the unconventional mayoral race, which also includes incumbent Eric Adams. Cuomo, who is considering an independent run, heavily criticized Mamdani's platform, calling his proposals unrealistic and a "death sentence" for the city's housing supply. Cuomo's adviser later clarified the remark was meant to highlight the high stakes of the election.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans for a new law targeting individuals preparing for mass violence, even without an ideological motive. This move follows the Southport attack, where the perpetrator murdered three girls but could not have been charged with a serious preparatory offense beforehand due to the lack of a terrorist link. The proposed legislation aims to close this legal gap, granting police similar powers to those used against terror suspects, allowing them to intervene based on preparatory actions. This change is designed to address the growing threat from lone, violence-obsessed individuals.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts gave superstar shortstop Mookie Betts an unplanned day off, citing concerns over his mental state and mechanical struggles at the plate. Betts is experiencing a career-worst season, with his batting average and OPS falling to new lows, prompting the decision after just one game following the All-Star break. Roberts hopes that having Betts watch a game without the pressure to perform will be beneficial for his mindset and help him break out of the extended slump. The move highlights the urgency of the situation for the player and the team.</p>

          <p>At least 32 Palestinians were killed Saturday near food distribution hubs in southern Gaza, with witnesses and hospital officials attributing the deaths to Israeli army fire. The incident occurred near sites run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, where crowds had gathered for aid. Witnesses described indiscriminate fire, while the Israeli military stated it fired warning shots at suspects who approached troops in a closed area. The event highlights the catastrophic humanitarian crisis and the dangers civilians face while seeking essential supplies in the war-torn region.</p>

          <p>The family of Cornelius Taylor, a homeless man killed when a bulldozer crushed his tent during an encampment sweep, is suing the city of Atlanta. The lawsuit alleges that city workers acted negligently by failing to check inside the tents before clearing the area in preparation for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Taylor's death has sparked outrage among advocates, who criticize the city's approach to homelessness amid an affordable housing crisis. The family's attorneys argue the tragedy was preventable and are seeking justice and a change in how the city treats its unhoused population.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a $20 billion libel lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch. The suit stems from an article alleging Trump signed a "bawdy" birthday letter for Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which Trump has vehemently denied as "FAKE." The lawsuit claims the report was false and defamatory, accusing the newspaper of journalistic failures. This legal action comes as Trump faces pressure to disclose more about his past association with Epstein, who died in jail while facing sex trafficking charges.</p>

These pouches, which are currently unregulated by age, deliver a powerful nicotine hit and are reportedly causing severe gum damage and addiction in teenagers. Health professionals and Trading Standards officers express frustration over their inability to prevent sales to minors and are urging the government to pass legislation to regulate the products.

Drivers interviewed at Edinburgh Airport called the charges "extortionate" and "greedy," opting to coordinate pickups in unauthorized areas despite the risk of fines.

          <p>The traditional six-week school summer holiday in the UK is facing scrutiny, with proposals to shorten it and redistribute the time throughout the year gaining traction. Proponents argue a shorter break could reduce learning loss, ease childcare burdens for working parents, and help families struggling with "holiday hunger" without access to free school meals. However, the idea is divisive; while some parents are in favor, many teachers oppose it, viewing the long break as essential for rest and preparation. The discussion reflects a broader re-evaluation of the school calendar in response to modern social pressures.</p>

While Chile's government plans to ramp up production to fight climate change, residents are skeptical of mining companies' promises to mitigate the damage.

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are seriously considering a reunion with veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. Paul, who is 40 years old, played for the Clippers for six seasons and ushered in the memorable "Lob City" era. Frank praised Paul as a "great player" and a "great Clipper," indicating that the team is looking to add more ball-handling and playmaking depth to its roster. If signed, Paul would join a backcourt that already includes James Harden and Bradley Beal, providing veteran leadership.</p>

          <p>German goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger was the hero in a dramatic Euro 2025 quarterfinal, leading her team to a 6-5 penalty shootout victory against France after a 1-1 draw. Germany played with only ten players for over 100 minutes after an early red card, with Berger making crucial saves throughout the match and extra time. In the shootout, she not only scored a penalty herself but also saved the decisive final spot-kick to secure the win. The victory was a moment of redemption for Berger, who has twice overcome battles with cancer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After years of rapid growth fueled by China's economic rise, the popularity of learning Mandarin is waning in Western countries like the U.S., UK, and New Zealand. University enrollments and secondary school participation in Chinese language programs have seen significant drops from their peaks a decade ago. This trend suggests a "huge shift" in perception, likely influenced by changing geopolitical relationships, economic tensions, and a different view of China's global role. This decline marks a notable reversal from when Mandarin was widely hailed as the essential language of the future for business and diplomacy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on flights from Mexico and threatened to end a key alliance between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico. The move is a response to the Mexican government's actions that forced airlines to relocate from Mexico City's main airport, which the U.S. argues violates a bilateral trade agreement and unfairly benefits Mexican carriers. Under the new rules, all Mexican airlines must seek U.S. government approval for their flight schedules. The dispute could impact millions of travelers and escalates trade tensions with a major U.S. partner.</p>

His day included a moment of disbelief when his shot from the rough dislodged a buried golf ball, leading to a bogey. However, he immediately bounced back with a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt that sent the supportive home crowd into a frenzy. Despite the rollercoaster round, McIlroy finished at eight under par, six shots behind the leader, feeling he has at least a "half-chance" heading into the final day.</p>

Despite the deployment of Syrian security forces to enforce the truce, reports of gunfire and looting continued in Suweida city.

          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy towards closer security cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a trio known as the "E3." This strategic shift, highlighted by a new bilateral treaty with the UK, is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty over future U.S. commitment to NATO. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has signaled that the nuclear deterrents of France and the UK could supplement, or even one day replace, the U.S. security guarantee for Europe. This move represents a significant re-alignment as Germany seeks to bolster European defense independence and cohesion.</p>
