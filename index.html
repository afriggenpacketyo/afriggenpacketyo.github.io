          <h2>UK's June Inflation Rate Surpasses Expectations, Reaching 3.6%</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 02:47:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's annual inflation rate unexpectedly rose to 3.6% in June, exceeding economists' forecasts of 3.4%. The Office for National Statistics attributed the increase primarily to motor fuel prices, while food price inflation also continued to climb. This data intensifies the pressure on the Bank of England, which is navigating high inflation alongside a contracting economy. Despite the inflation figures, many economists still anticipate an interest rate cut in August to stimulate economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former UK Defence Secretary Sir Ben Wallace has defended his decision to seek a gagging order to prevent reporting on a major data breach. The leak exposed personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for UK relocation, putting them at potential risk from the Taliban. Wallace stated the injunction was a necessary measure to protect lives, not a cover-up, a sentiment echoed by the current government which has apologized for the breach. The details only became public after a High Court judge lifted the order, revealing the government's response and the establishment of a new resettlement scheme.</p>

          <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations on both revenue and profit. The company also reported strong net bookings, a key indicator of future demand, driven by the needs of the artificial intelligence sector. However, ASML expressed caution about its future outlook, narrowing its 2025 sales growth forecast and stating it could not confirm growth for 2026 due to macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties. This reflects the broader challenges facing the semiconductor industry, including the impact of U.S. tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This commentary analyzes President Trump's recent shift in policy towards Ukraine, including supplying missile defense systems, as a pragmatic rather than ideological move. The author argues that Trump, who previously scorned Ukrainian aid, has been persuaded by Europe's new financial commitments, such as NATO members pledging 5% of GDP to defense. The piece suggests Trump views the situation through a transactional lens, where Europe is now paying its share, making support for Ukraine a better "deal." It concludes that while this provides relief for Kyiv, Trump's support remains tenuous and dependent on his perception of who is footing the bill.</p>

          <p>China's imports of naphtha, a key petrochemical feedstock, are forecast to hit a record 16 to 17 million metric tons this year. Analysts attribute the surge to the startup of new petrochemical plants and a strategic shift away from U.S. propane and ethane, supplies of which have been disrupted by trade tensions. This increased demand from China is expected to provide significant support for Asian refiners' profit margins for the feedstock.

          <p>According to market research firm Rho Motion, global sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles increased by 24% in June compared to the previous year, totaling 1.8 million units. The growth was primarily driven by strong demand in China, which saw a 28% jump and accounted for 60% of the worldwide total, and a 23% rise in Europe. In contrast, the North American market lagged, with sales falling by 9%. For the first half of 2025, global EV sales are up 28%, underscoring the accelerating but regionally uneven transition to electric mobility. (not investment advice)</p>

Before the game, the 37-year-old future Hall of Famer delivered a speech to his teammates about the importance and responsibility of being an All-Star. During his brief, one-inning appearance on the mound, he was mic'd up for the broadcast, showing a lighter side before exiting to a loud ovation. The article portrays Kershaw, who was a sentimental "Legend Pick" for the game, as a respected figure who provided a memorable moment in what could be his final Midsummer Classic.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to establish national standards for the Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) system in college sports. This move follows the advancement of a House bill, the "SCORE Act," aimed at creating a federal framework to supersede the current patchwork of state laws governing how student-athletes can be compensated. The NIL rules, enacted in 2021, have dramatically reshaped college athletics by allowing athletes to profit from endorsements and other deals. The executive order represents a significant federal intervention into the ongoing, and often chaotic, evolution of amateur sports.</p>

The defense argued that the evidence is not conclusive and portrayed the victim as "broken" by her husband's infidelities, suggesting she may have taken her own life.
