          <p>Ukraine's security service (SBU) claims to have exposed a spy network run by Hungarian military intelligence, which was allegedly gathering information about Ukrainian defenses in the Zakarpattia region near the Hungarian border. Two Hungarian citizens, former members of the Ukrainian military, have been detained for allegedly collecting data on air defense systems and local sentiment in the event of a Hungarian incursion. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto responded cautiously, suggesting the allegations should be treated as propaganda until official information is provided, while emphasizing that anti-Hungarian sentiment is common in Ukraine. The alleged spies face treason charges and could face life imprisonment.</p>

          <p>Oghenochuko Ojiri, an art expert featured on the BBC's Bargain Hunt, has pleaded guilty to eight counts of failing to report high-value art sales to Nazem Ahmad, who was sanctioned by the US in 2019 for allegedly financing Hezbollah. The offenses occurred between October 2020 and December 2021, during which Ojiri sold artwork worth Â£140,000 to Ahmad. Despite reading news reports about Ahmad's sanctions and discussing them with others, Ojiri did not notify the authorities, a violation of the Terrorism Act 2000. Ojiri has been granted bail but must surrender his passport and will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on June 6.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has ruled out reducing the consumption tax rate to alleviate the impact of inflation and U.S. tariffs, despite growing calls from the opposition and some ruling party lawmakers. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi stated that cutting the consumption tax, a crucial revenue source for Japan, would be inappropriate. This decision comes as Japan faces economic challenges from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and rising inflation. The government plans to address these issues through other economic measures, while opposition parties advocate for a temporary removal of the consumption tax on food items.</p>

          <p>Amidst rising tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, Keen, a U.S.-based footwear company, has pledged not to increase its prices for consumers. The company has been proactively diversifying its supply chain for over a decade to mitigate the risks associated with over-reliance on any single country. Keen operates plants in the U.S., Dominican Republic, and Thailand, and partners with manufacturers in Cambodia, India, and Vietnam, allowing it to spread costs and avoid significant tariff impacts. While other retailers plan to pass tariff costs onto consumers, Keen is absorbing these costs through shared responsibility with its partners.</p>

          <p>The U.S. supply chain is facing a record surge in cargo theft, with organized criminal groups exploiting technology to steal truckloads of valuable products. Strategic theft, where criminals deceive shippers, brokers, or carriers, is on the rise, representing about one-third of all cargo theft. In 2024, Verisk CargoNet recorded nearly 3,800 incidents of cargo theft, with reported losses topping $455 million, though experts estimate the true toll is closer to $1 billion or more annually. Law enforcement officials and industry experts say the sophisticated nature of these thefts makes them difficult to track and deter, leading to increased costs for consumers.</p>

          <p>This article argues that attempting to time the stock market based on political events and trade policies, such as those of President Donald Trump, is a risky and often unsuccessful endeavor. The market's rapid fluctuations following the election, hitting a record high, then sinking, and subsequently rebounding, demonstrate the difficulty in predicting market movements. The article highlights the importance of disciplined investing rather than making sweeping portfolio changes based on news headlines. The author advises against trying to sell at the high or buy at the low, as it requires being right twice, which is nearly impossible.</p>

          <p>As the conflict between India and Pakistan escalates, a reporter reflects on the heightened tensions reminiscent of the 1971 war. This time, the conflict involves advanced weaponry and drones targeting populated areas. The most significant difference, however, is the overwhelming amount of disinformation on social media and television, making accurate reporting difficult and adding to the sense of panic. Despite India's economic growth and technological advancements, the risks of a wider conflict have increased, with borders becoming irrelevant due to advanced weapons and drones.</p>

          <p>A 75-year-old man, Stephen Glantz, has been charged with animal cruelty after authorities discovered nearly 100 cats, including two dozen dead kittens, in his suburban New York home. The house was condemned as uninhabitable due to the overpowering odors of feces and urine. Authorities found 69 living cats, many with medical ailments, and 28 dead cats, some wrapped in a freezer. Three of the living cats were later euthanized due to their poor condition. The man and the cats were living in alarming conditions, and the surviving cats are now being treated at an animal shelter.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's ongoing criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and attempts to influence the central bank's monetary policy could sabotage the US economy. Trump's desire for lower interest rates clashes with the Fed's independent role in managing inflation. Independent central banks generally outperform those controlled by political interests, as politicians tend to prioritize short-term gains over long-term economic stability. Trump's meddling could undermine trust in the Fed and exacerbate economic uncertainty, potentially leading to boom-bust cycles and higher inflation, as seen in countries like Venezuela and Turkey.</p>
