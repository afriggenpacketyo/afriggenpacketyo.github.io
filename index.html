          <p>During a Pirates-Cubs game at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, a fan, later identified as Kavan Markwood, fell from the right-field bleachers over the 21-foot Clemente Wall, landing on the warning track and sustaining critical injuries. Medical personnel responded swiftly, and Markwood was transported to a hospital; the game was temporarily delayed as players and staff offered prayers. Pittsburgh Public Safety is treating the incident as accidental and investigating the circumstances of the fall. The Pirates organization expressed their support for Markwood and his family, while players shared messages of concern and hope for his recovery.</p>

          <p>Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was photographed using the Signal app during a Cabinet meeting, a day before President Trump announced his replacement by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The photo revealed Waltz was communicating with high-profile figures like Vice President JD Vance and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. This incident follows previous scrutiny over Waltz's use of Signal, including inadvertently inviting a journalist to a group chat discussing sensitive military plans. Despite the administration's stance that Signal is an approved app, investigations into its use for official business and records retention are ongoing.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the United States is fixated on "beating China" but needs to focus on its own internal alignment of purpose, goal, and means. The article criticizes the Trump administration's chaotic approach to the global tariff war and suggests that fuzzy thinking is not exclusive to Trump when addressing China. It emphasizes the importance of a clear strategy and understanding of the adversary for success in any conflict.</p>

          <p>Troubled rollout of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is causing delays and complications for students trying to access financial aid for college.

The delays are putting college dreams on hold, as many students rely on FAFSA to make college affordable.

          <p>Fires that have been raging in central Israel since Wednesday are largely under control, according to the country's Fire and Rescue Authority. Hot, dry conditions and strong winds made controlling the fires challenging, but an evacuation order for 12 towns near Jerusalem has been lifted. Several countries dispatched aircraft to assist in the emergency, and a major highway linking Jerusalem and Tel Aviv has reopened. While authorities provided conflicting accounts for the cause of the fire, the fires led to the cancellation of most official events celebrating Israel's Independence Day.</p>

          <p>Former National Security Advisor John Bolton discusses his views on President Trump's second term, characterizing it as incoherent and driven by Trump's desire to be the center of attention. Bolton suggests that Trump lacks a grand strategy or coherent policy approach, relying instead on reactions. While acknowledging that some of Trump's decisions align with conservative principles, Bolton believes the system of checks and balances will ultimately prevail. Bolton views Trump's tariffs as another act of stupidity, similar to the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of couples are choosing a life without children, influenced by factors such as high costs, climate change fears, and career priorities. The U.S. fertility rate has plummeted in recent decades, with many young adults saying they simply don't want kids. Amy Blackstone, a sociology professor, notes that child-free individuals often value their relationship with their partner and do not want a child to change that dynamic. While some are confident in their decision, others wonder about the future and the absence of a large family during holidays.</p>

          <p>Apple is shifting some of its iPhone production to India, with a majority of iPhones sold in the US now originating from India, in an effort to mitigate the impact of President Trump's tariffs. Vietnam will be the primary country of origin for iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirPods sold in the United States. CEO Tim Cook noted that while China will remain a key manufacturing hub for products sold outside the US, the threat of tariffs has forced Apple to rethink its supply chain strategy.

          <p>Cambodia continues to grapple with the deadly threat of landmines, a legacy of decades of conflict stemming from the Vietnam War era. Millions of mines, cluster bombs, and unexploded ordnance still litter the countryside, causing numerous casualties and hindering development. While Cambodia had hoped to be mine-free by 2025, the plan is no longer feasible due to the vast areas that remain to be cleared. Organizations like Cambodia Self Help DeMining are working to remove these explosives, but the process is dangerous and slow.</p>
