            <p>A helicopter crash in the Hudson River near Lower Manhattan killed six people, including a family of Spanish tourists and the pilot. The chopper, operated by New York Helicopter Tours, plunged into the water shortly after takeoff from the Wall Street Heliport. Witnesses reported seeing the helicopter falling without a tail rotor or main rotor blade. An investigation is underway by the FAA and NTSB to determine the cause of the crash, with recovery crews working to retrieve wreckage from the river.</p>
