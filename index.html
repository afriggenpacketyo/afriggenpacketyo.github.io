          <p>Japan's exports fell by 1.7% year-on-year in May, marking the steepest decline since September 2024, amid ongoing trade uncertainties. This drop, although less severe than economists' predictions, reverses April's gains and highlights the impact of declining exports on Japan's GDP, which contracted in the first quarter of the year. The Bank of Japan has acknowledged that trade-related factors are likely to moderate the country's growth. Ongoing trade talks with the U.S. and potential tariff increases add further complexity to Japan's economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator John Thune suggests that Iran should return to the negotiating table to dismantle its nuclear program to avoid potential U.S. military involvement.

He hopes for internal change within Iran and believes that the current situation may be a pivotal moment akin to the Iranian Revolution. Thune also addresses the possibility of a supplemental spending package to aid Israel, which would be considered after the budget reconciliation process.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed a recent decision to pause immigration arrests at farms, hotels, and restaurants, now allowing targeted worksite enforcement operations to continue. This reversal comes shortly after concerns arose among industry leaders about the impact of the administration's immigration crackdown on foreign-born workers. The Department of Homeland Security maintains that worksite enforcement is crucial for safeguarding public safety and economic stability, targeting illegal employment networks. Despite the initial pause, ICE arrests have been increasing, though they remain below the levels sought by the White House.</p>

          <p>The G7 summit concluded with statements on AI and critical minerals but without a specific statement on Ukraine due to objections from the United States. Other member countries felt that the watered-down language proposed by the U.S. would not have been fair to Ukraine. President Trump has repeatedly declined to blame Russia for invading Ukraine. The lack of consensus highlights divisions among G7 members regarding the approach to the conflict.</p>

          <p>New York City's mayoral primary election will use ranked-choice voting, allowing voters to rank their top five candidates. If no candidate receives over 50% of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and subsequent rounds count voters' next choices. This system has led to unique alliances, with some candidates cross-endorsing each other to prevent a specific candidate from winning. Results will be delayed due to the complexity of tabulating ranked-choice ballots, with preliminary totals expected after the polls close and fuller results reported a week later.</p>
