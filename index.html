          <p>A new food aid system in Gaza, conceived and largely developed by Israelis, is set to bypass the United Nations and experienced aid agencies. The plan, presented as a neutral initiative run by American contractors, aims to undermine Hamas's control and prevent aid from reaching militants. However, the UN warns that the plan could restrict aid to limited areas and potentially displace civilians out of northern Gaza, as initial distribution sites would be in the south. The project began in late 2023 with meetings of Israeli officials, military officers, and business people, eventually leading to the hiring of private contractors for food distribution.</p>

In the game's final seconds, Clark appeared to be fouled by Natasha Cloud, but no whistle was blown, costing the Fever a chance to tie or win the game. The no-call also prevented Clark from potentially reaching a milestone of a 20-point, 10-rebound game. Cloud has previously stated that criticism of physical plays against Clark is rooted in racism.</p>

          <p>French authorities suspect arson may have contributed to a significant power outage in southeast France, disrupting the Cannes Film Festival's closing day. The outage affected approximately 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes area and led to traffic disruptions and shop closures. Authorities are investigating a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes, and a collapsed high-voltage line. Despite the disruptions, festival organizers confirmed that the closing ceremony, including the Palme d'Or award, would proceed as planned due to an independent power supply.</p>

Harvard has sued the administration, arguing that the order would cause immediate and irreparable injury, and has won a temporary block pending further hearing. The administration is also considering imposing heavy taxes on capital gains from university endowments. The US government is demanding that Harvard implement sweeping reforms by August 2025, supposedly in order to counter what it perceives as the dominance of left-wing ideologies at Harvard faculties.</p>

          <p>Despite Israel allowing a limited number of aid trucks into Gaza, aid agencies warn of an impending famine due to ongoing war and severe restrictions. While hundreds of trucks are ready with supplies, distribution is hampered by security clearance delays, logistical problems, and infrastructure damage. The UN criticizes Israel's plan to use private security firms for aid distribution, arguing they already have established networks. With most of Gaza's population dependent on aid, the limited influx and distribution issues put millions at risk of starvation.</p>
