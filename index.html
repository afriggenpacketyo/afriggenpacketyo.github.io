            <p>In Medford, Oregon, an 11-year-old girl's testimony became crucial in the investigation of her father's murder and her sister's disappearance in 2017. Sierra Friar, hiding in her room, overheard a struggle and later identified her sister Ellie's forbidden boyfriend, Gavin MacFarlane, outside the house. The police investigation led to the discovery of Aaron Friar's body and the arrest of Ellie, Gavin, and his friend Russell Jones. The case revealed a complex web of relationships and conflicting accounts, ultimately resulting in convictions for all three individuals involved in the murder conspiracy.</p>

            <p>Detective Bill Ford's unorthodox interrogation technique, offering a cigarette to suspect Russell Jones, proved pivotal in solving the disappearance of Aaron Friar in Medford, Oregon. Jones, initially hesitant, confessed to helping dispose of Friar's body after Ford appealed to his conscience. This breakthrough led investigators to Friar's remains and implicated Jones, along with Ellie Friar and Gavin MacFarlane, in the murder.

            <p>Despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's declared "Easter truce," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported ongoing Russian military actions in Ukraine. Zelenskyy stated that in the first six hours of the truce, there were 387 shellings and 19 assaults by the Russian army.

            <p>Malaysian durian growers are experiencing a significant increase in exports to China, driven by Chinese consumers' growing preference for fresh, naturally ripened fruit. Improved logistics and a steady supply have contributed to this surge, with Malaysian suppliers expecting a 30% increase in exports this year. Unlike Thailand and Vietnam, Malaysian durians are allowed to ripen naturally on the tree before being harvested, which is a key factor in their popularity. This trend presents substantial opportunities for Malaysian durian growers in the Chinese market.</p>
