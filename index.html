          <p>Moderna has lowered the upper end of its 2025 revenue projection, citing a delay in Covid vaccine shipments to the United Kingdom. Despite this adjustment, the biotech company's second-quarter financial results surpassed Wall Street's expectations, largely due to successful cost-cutting measures. The company is navigating a challenging market with declining Covid vaccine sales and is also in the process of reducing its workforce by 10%. This financial report reflects the ongoing transition for vaccine manufacturers in a post-pandemic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has begun selling its first-ever assigned seats for flights, marking a significant departure from its long-standing open-seating policy. The cost for seat selection will vary based on the route, travel date, and seat location, potentially adding hundreds of dollars to travel costs for families. This change is part of a broader strategy to generate new revenue streams, following pressure from investors to align with competitors who earn billions from such fees. The airline is also introducing baggage fees and a basic economy fare, fundamentally altering its business model.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai has vowed to continue negotiations with the United States after the Trump administration imposed a 20% tariff on Taiwanese exports. While this rate is lower than an earlier proposal, it is higher than the rates secured by other Asian economies like Japan and South Korea. Lai described the current tariff as a "phased outcome" of ongoing talks, expressing hope that further discussions will lead to a more reasonable and favorable rate for Taiwan. The situation highlights the ongoing complexities of global trade negotiations under the new US tariff system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron's second-quarter earnings fell significantly due to lower crude oil prices and a financial loss related to its acquisition of Hess Corporation. Despite the profit decline, the company's adjusted earnings per share exceeded Wall Street expectations, and it achieved record global production of 3.4 million barrels per day. The recently finalized Hess acquisition is expected to boost future earnings and contribute to cost-saving synergies. The report illustrates the volatility of the energy market and the strategic moves major oil companies are making to secure future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported a decline in second-quarter profits compared to the previous year, but still surpassed analyst expectations.

          <p>A new peer-reviewed study suggests that a mass die-off of monarch butterflies in Southern California in 2024 was likely caused by pesticide exposure. Researchers tested deceased butterflies found near a wintering sanctuary and discovered an average of seven different pesticides in each, at levels suspected to be lethal. The findings provide rare, direct evidence supporting the theory that pesticides are a significant factor in the dramatic decline of monarch populations. The study points to the need for reduced pesticide use, especially near sensitive habitats, to protect the iconic species.</p>

          <h2>Families Call for Stricter Rules for Older Drivers After Fatal Accidents in UK</h2>

          <p>The family of a 79-year-old woman killed in a car crash in Cornwall is advocating for an overhaul of the UK's regulations for older drivers, calling the current system "unsafe and inadequate." In the UK, drivers must self-declare medical conditions and renew their license every three years after age 70, with no mandatory medical or driving tests. This article highlights cases where age-related health issues may have contributed to fatal accidents, sparking a debate over whether medical professionals should be required to report unfit drivers. The issue is growing as the number of elderly drivers on the road increases.</p>

          <h2>Despite Low Approval Ratings, Democrats Show Underlying Strengths for Midterm Elections</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Although the Democratic Party is facing historically low approval ratings, a deeper analysis suggests its position may not be as dire as it appears. The party's poor favorability is partly driven by disaffected but loyal Democrats, a group likely to vote in the midterms. Furthermore, President Trump's own approval ratings are declining, and voters may feel the full economic impact of his tariffs closer to the election. However, the article also notes significant challenges, including a weaker partisan identification compared to 2017 and formidable obstacles to retaking the Senate.</p>

          <p>A court in Hong Kong has officially frozen an HSBC account containing US$1.8 billion, central to a legal battle over the inheritance of the Wahaha beverage empire. The lawsuit was filed by three alleged extramarital children of the late founder, Zong Qinghou, against his publicly known daughter and current CEO, Kelly Zong Fuli. The plaintiffs claim a breach of a family agreement to establish trusts for them. The court order will remain in effect pending the outcome of a parallel lawsuit in mainland China, highlighting a complex and high-stakes family dispute.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Ray Dalio has finalized his departure from Bridgewater Associates, the massive hedge fund he founded in 1975, by selling his last remaining equity and stepping down from the board. This move completes a management transition that began in 2022, though Dalio will continue to serve as a mentor and remain a significant investor in the firm's strategies. The transition was facilitated by raising capital from existing investors and employees. This marks the end of an era for one of the most influential figures in the modern financial world.

          <h2>Emergency Savings a Key 'Security Blanket' for Protecting 401(k) Retirement Funds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 06:15:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Having an emergency savings fund is crucial for protecting long-term retirement accounts, according to new research from Vanguard. The study found that 401(k) investors with at least $2,000 in a rainy-day fund are significantly less likely to take out loans or make hardship withdrawals from their retirement plans. This cash buffer is especially important for hourly workers with volatile incomes, who are more prone to tapping into their 401(k)s for unexpected expenses. Experts recommend automating savings into a liquid, high-yield account to build this financial security. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing effects of climate change are making mountaineering in regions like the Himalayas and Karakoram significantly more dangerous. Rising temperatures are melting the snow and ice that act as a natural "glue" for rocks, leading to a greater risk of rockfalls and avalanches. Expeditions are now forced to start earlier in the season and climb at night to avoid the warmest, most hazardous parts of the day. These changes, coupled with extreme weather events like glacial lake outburst floods, pose a threat not only to climbers but also to the local economies that depend on mountain tourism.</p>

          <p>The UK's Met Office has named Storm Floris, the fifth named storm of the season, which is expected to bring strong winds and heavy rain across the country on Monday. Forecasts predict the storm will travel across the northern half of the UK, with wind gusts potentially reaching 60-80 mph in coastal and hilly areas. Due to trees being in full leaf, there is an increased risk of them being toppled, which could lead to travel and power disruptions. The public is advised to monitor forecasts as the storm system develops over the Atlantic.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a policy change that will restrict its main civil service internship program exclusively to university students from poorer families. This initiative, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to increase the representation of working-class individuals in Whitehall and ensure the civil service better reflects the country. A person's eligibility will be determined by their parents' occupations. Successful interns will be fast-tracked for the main graduate recruitment program, a move welcomed by social mobility advocates but criticized by some conservatives as "leftist social engineering."</p>

          <p>This historical article examines the methods of the Stasi, East Germany's infamous Ministry for State Security, which systematically spied on its own citizens to maintain party control. Under the motto "we must know everything," the Stasi employed around 90,000 full-time staff and up to 200,000 informal collaborators to monitor any perceived dissent. Using tactics like mail interception, wiretapping, and psychological intimidation, the agency created an atmosphere of pervasive fear and mistrust. The piece reflects on the motivations of those who worked for the Stasi and the lasting impact of its surveillance on German society.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's reduction of federal support for renewable energy, Southern California is forging ahead with clean hydrogen projects as a key part of its climate strategy. One of the largest projects, a facility in Vernon, will produce green hydrogen to power heavy-duty trucks, aiming to reduce emissions in the transportation sector. While the federal landscape has become less favorable, California's own state-level regulations and climate goals are driving investment. This commitment positions hydrogen as a potentially resilient energy source in the state's transition away from fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>An abandoned Southern California Edison power line suspected of starting the deadly Eaton fire could have been removed years ago under a proposed state rule, according to records. In 2001, Public Utilities Commission staff proposed forcing utilities to remove old lines, but the regulation was weakened after opposition from utility companies. The final rule allowed utilities to decide when a line was "permanently abandoned," letting them keep unused infrastructure in place indefinitely. Critics, including a former regulator, argue this rollback of safety measures contributed to preventable wildfire risks.</p>

          <p>A recent FDA expert panel has drawn sharp criticism from prominent medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for allegedly spreading misinformation about the safety of SSRI antidepressants for pregnant women. Panelists cited studies linking the drugs to various health risks, but critics argue this misrepresented the body of evidence, which largely supports the drugs' safety. Medical societies expressed alarm that such claims could create unnecessary fear and barriers to care for perinatal depression, a condition that itself poses significant health risks to both mother and child if left untreated.</p>
