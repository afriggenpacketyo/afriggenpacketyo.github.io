          <p>Japan's exports experienced a 1.7% year-on-year decline in May, marking the sharpest fall in eight months, primarily due to a significant drop in shipments to the United States. Exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, also decreased, contributing to the overall decline. The Bank of Japan has acknowledged that the country's growth is likely to moderate due to trade uncertainties and slowing overseas economies. This decline in exports has already impacted Japan's GDP, with the economy contracting in the first quarter of the year. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>New Yorkers voting in the city's Democratic mayoral primary election will be able to rank their top five candidates thanks to ranked-choice voting. If a candidate gets over 50% of the first-choice votes, that candidate wins the race outright. If no candidate breaks 50%, the candidate with the least amount of votes is eliminated, and vote tabulation continues in rounds. Ranked-choice voting allows voters to have more choices, positive campaigns and collaboration between candidates. </p>

          <p>The NAACP announced it will not invite President Trump to its national convention, breaking a 116-year tradition. The civil rights organization cited Trump's attacks on democracy and civil rights as the reason for the decision. NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson stated that Trump is attacking democracy and civil rights and undermining pillars of democracy to benefit personally. The White House responded sharply, stating that the NAACP is advancing hate and division. </p>
