        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tensions are rising between China and the Philippines over Sandy Cay in the South China Sea, as both nations intensify their efforts to assert sovereignty over the disputed reef. The Chinese coastguard reported that it addressed six Filipinos who illegally landed on the reef, accusing them of violating China's territorial sovereignty. This incident followed a Chinese operation where coastguard personnel planted a Chinese flag on the reef. The Philippines maintains that its military and law enforcement conducted a routine maritime domain awareness exercise in the area, where at least seven Chinese vessels were present, highlighting the ongoing conflict in the region. Optimism is limited as the dispute escalates, potentially destabilizing the region.</p>

Sediment samples showed a decline in swamp cypress pollen and a spike in charcoal deposits around 100 BC, coinciding with the Han's assault on Nanyue's capital, Panyu, which was set ablaze.</p>

          <p>Australia's opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has stated that Indigenous "welcome to country" ceremonies are "overdone" and should not be performed at sporting games or military commemorations. This statement follows an incident where an Aboriginal elder was heckled during a welcome ceremony, sparking public outcry. Dutton has previously called the tradition "virtue signaling" and believes the frequency of the ceremonies cheapens their significance and divides the country, sparking debate about how to acknowledge Indigenous history.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's policies, including tariffs, could harm the U.S. auto industry by isolating it from innovation and foreign competition. While tariffs aim to protect the industry, domestic policies risk cutting it off from advancements in electrification, digitization, and automation. China's progress in producing next-generation vehicles, backed by state subsidies, poses a significant threat to the American auto industry. The piece suggests that the U.S. risks losing its capacity to manufacture vital technologies and military equipment if the auto industry declines.</p>
