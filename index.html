        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article discusses how President Trump's policies are eroding the United States' soft power, which has historically been a key component of American influence. Actions such as attacking academic freedom, cutting research grants, and displaying authoritarian tendencies are undermining the rule of law and tarnishing America's image as a democratic exemplar. The article contends that these actions are inadvertently ceding ground to China in the global competition for pre-eminence, as Beijing benefits from the shift in international attraction due to the US administration's compromised soft power reservoir.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News poll reveals that the approval rating for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet has hit a record low of 27.4%, a significant drop due to growing dissatisfaction over the government's handling of rising prices. The disapproval rating has risen to 55.1% as consumers struggle with soaring rice prices and perceive the government's efforts to address the cost-of-living crisis as insufficient. A majority of respondents expressed support for consumption tax cuts to alleviate the financial burden on households, while concerns remain about the potential impact on social security services.</p>

          <p>Following Pete Rose's reinstatement to Major League Baseball, a debate has ignited regarding his eligibility for the Baseball Hall of Fame, despite his lifetime ban for betting on baseball games. Some argue that Rose's on-field achievements, including being the all-time Hit King, warrant his inclusion, while others maintain that his actions compromised the integrity of the game. The article emphasizes that the Hall of Fame should honor his accomplishments as a player, and that his personal failings should not overshadow his greatness. The Classic Baseball committee is not scheduled to meet until December 2027 to determine Rose’s fate.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proceeding with plans to construct additional sections of the border wall in a remote area of Arizona, raising concerns about the impact on wildlife migration. The construction will sever a critical wildlife corridor for animals migrating between Mexico and Arizona. Conservationists argue that the wall is an expensive, unnecessary, and environmentally disastrous project that will impede the movement of various species, including bears, mountain lions, and wolves. The project is also occurring despite a decline in unauthorized border crossings in the area.</p>

While no formal agreements were reached, Brazilian media reports indicate that the government is open to Chinese investment in Avibras and interested in leveraging Norinco's expertise in public security technology, including facial recognition systems.</p>

Sulzberger, the publisher of The New York Times, discusses the growing threats to press freedom in the United States, particularly since President Trump's return to office.

He emphasizes the importance of independent journalism in holding power accountable and providing the public with the full story, while acknowledging the challenges of maintaining this position in an increasingly polarized media landscape. The publisher also expresses concern about the news industry's business model and the dominance of tech giants, but remains hopeful due to the dedication of journalists to their craft.</p>

          <p>A new CDC study indicates a significant decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies under seven months old, attributed to the widespread availability of a vaccine for pregnant individuals and a monoclonal antibody treatment for infants. Hospitalizations decreased by as much as 56% compared to pre-pandemic RSV seasons, with newborns experiencing a decrease of up to 71%. However, older children did not see the same benefit, suggesting that the shots are indeed behind the decrease in hospitalizations for younger children.

          <p>Portugal is holding its third parliamentary election in three years after the previous government collapsed due to a failed confidence vote. Opinion polls suggest that Montenegro's Democratic Alliance is likely to win the most votes but fall short of a parliamentary majority, continuing a decade of political instability. Issues such as housing and immigration have dominated the campaign, and the rise of the far-right Chega party has further complicated the political landscape.

The repatriation followed diplomatic efforts and the Smithsonian's new ethical returns policy.

Arnaz's innovations, such as filming “I Love Lucy” and owning the show's negatives, transformed the television business model and paved the way for greater representation of Latino stories in popular culture.
