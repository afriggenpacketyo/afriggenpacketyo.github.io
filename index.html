            <p>The community of Wigtown, Scotland, rallied together to save a 200-year-old pub, The Wigtown Ploughman, from being converted into flats. After the pub closed due to market conditions following the Covid pandemic, local residents formed the Wigtown Community Inn community benefit society. With support from South of Scotland Enterprise and a community share issue, they purchased the building and reopened it. The pub's revival is expected to boost local businesses and rekindle community connections in an area that sometimes feels forgotten.</p>

            <p>The US television institution, Saturday Night Live, is expanding to the UK with a spin-off planned for next year by Sky, overseen by the original show's creator Lorne Michaels. The British version aims to replicate the fast-paced, live sketch comedy format that has made SNL a cultural staple in the United States. However, some industry experts question whether the UK version will be able to attract the same level of celebrity guests or capture the unique comedic traditions of the British comedy scene. Previous attempts to translate US late-night shows to the UK have struggled, but the sketch format is well-suited to the social media age.</p>

The update came after a court order demanding daily reports on efforts to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S., following a Supreme Court ruling that the government must facilitate his return. Abrego Garcia, who has lived in Maryland for 15 years, was deported despite a 2019 court order protecting him from deportation due to safety concerns in El Salvador, the Trump administration has claimed that Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang, which his lawyers and his wife deny.</p>

            <p>The UK government rushed emergency legislation through Parliament in a single day to take control of the Chinese-owned British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, averting a potential closure. Government officials were stationed nearby awaiting Royal Assent to finalize the law, which allows them to secure raw materials for the plant's blast furnaces. The move follows concerns that Jingye, British Steel's parent company, was attempting to sell off materials already en route to Lincolnshire. Nationalization, with the government taking full ownership, is looking increasingly likely as a long term solution.</p>

            <p>Speculation rises about a potential meeting between Xi Jinping, Kim Jong-un, and Vladimir Putin in Moscow for Russia's Victory Day celebrations. Such a meeting would mark the first public appearance of the three leaders together, signaling solidarity and defiance against US pressure. While strengthening North Korea's alignment with Russia, it would also present a challenge for China, further complicating Beijing's stance on a nuclear-armed Pyongyang and its growing ties with Moscow. The Kremlin has announced Xi's visit to Moscow for the May 9 events, with preparations underway for Kim's potential attendance.</p>

            <p>Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus's visit to China signals a potential shift away from India's dominance in the country's foreign policy. China has committed US$2.1 billion in investments, loans, and grants to Bangladesh, focusing on modernizing infrastructure and developing key sectors. This move could allow Bangladesh to diversify its alliances and strengthen ties with Southeast Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region. Previously, Bangladesh under ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina had helped strengthen India’s access to its northeastern states and the Bay of Bengal.</p>
