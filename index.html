          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 11:00:39 EDT</div>

          <p>Iran's semi-official Fars news agency reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian suffered a minor leg injury during an alleged Israeli airstrike on June 16. The attack reportedly targeted a secure government facility in Western Tehran where Pezeshkian was holding a meeting with senior officials. Six bombs or missiles reportedly aimed at entry/exit points to disrupt evacuation and airflow. Officials escaped through an emergency hatch, with Pezeshkian and others sustaining minor leg injuries. This alleged strike, claimed to be similar to an Israeli plan that led to a Hezbollah leader's assassination, occurred during a 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran, which concluded with a U.S.-brokered cease-fire.</p>

          <p>This article highlights 16 intriguing abandoned locations worldwide that have been repurposed into popular tourist attractions, offering a unique glimpse into history and decay. From the Maunsell Sea Forts in England, built for WWII defense, to the SS Ayrfield shipwreck in Australia, now a floating mangrove forest, these sites captivate visitors. Other examples include Italy's Poveglia island, a former quarantine station turned mental hospital known for paranormal activity, and the relocated Rubjerg Knude Lighthouse in Denmark. The list also features the diamond ghost town of Kolmanskop in Namibia and China's replica "Paris of the East," Tianducheng, showcasing how forgotten spaces can blend eerie fascination with historical significance.</p>

          <p>Barbara Rae-Venter, a retired patent attorney, has pioneered the use of investigative genetic genealogy to solve long-standing cold cases, including the infamous Golden State Killer. Her method involves building family trees from crime scene DNA to identify perpetrators and missing persons, a technique she initially used to help adoptees find biological parents. This article highlights her success in identifying Joseph James DeAngelo, responsible for at least 13 murders and more than 50 sexual assaults, and later Dennis Gribble, a sexual assault perpetrator, leading to convictions decades after the crimes. While raising privacy concerns, the approach has proven highly effective in bringing justice to victims and their families.</p>

          <p>One year after the attempted assassination of President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has significantly upgraded its security protocols. The agency now deploys military-grade drones for enhanced aerial reconnaissance and has established mobile command posts to improve direct communication with local law enforcement, addressing critical failures from the previous incident. These substantive advancements aim to prevent a repeat of the July 13, 2024, event where a gunman wounded Trump and tragically killed a rallygoer. Six Secret Service personnel were suspended following an internal investigation, underscoring the agency's commitment to implementing comprehensive reforms for future protection.</p>

          <p>A Senate report indicates that the U.S. Secret Service denied multiple requests to enhance President Trump's security detail before the attempted assassination in Butler, Pennsylvania. The report found at least 10 requests for additional resources, including counter-drone systems and counter-sniper personnel, were unfulfilled or denied. These communication failures and alleged negligence contributed to the preventable tragedy where a rallygoer was killed and Trump was injured. The report contradicts earlier Secret Service testimony and highlights a lack of formal process for resource requests, prompting ongoing reforms within the agency to address systemic issues and improve future protective operations.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has called on the European Union to "defend European interests resolutely" in response to Donald Trump's threat of imposing 30% tariffs on nearly all EU imports. While the EU has paused retaliatory tariffs to de-escalate tensions, Macron insists on preparing credible countermeasures if no agreement is reached by August 1. This comes as the EU seeks new trade deals with partners like Indonesia to diversify markets and strengthen its economic position. The situation highlights divisions within the EU on how to respond, with some leaders urging calm while others, like Macron, advocate for readiness in a potential trade war.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is making transshipping a central focus of his trade policy, threatening higher tariffs on goods routed through third countries to evade existing trade barriers, particularly those on China. This strategy, exemplified by a Vietnam deal and recent tariff letters to the EU and Mexico, seeks a more precise and rigorous definition of "origin" for products. The article explains how this approach could significantly impact global supply chains and trade compliance, potentially leading to litigation and strong reactions from countries like China. This reordering of international trade rules reflects a long-standing, bipartisan concern about tariff evasion and its broader economic implications. (not investment advice)</p>

This initiative aims to boost EV sales, which currently lag behind mandated targets, addressing key consumer concerns over high upfront costs and "range anxiety." The government seeks to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles ahead of the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales, demonstrating a commitment to environmental and automotive policy.</p>

His departure highlights the struggles of traditional Reagan conservatives within the modern GOP, as he aims to "fight for the soul of the party" from outside Congress.

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples outlines five often-neglected weekday habits that foster stronger relationships, even amidst busy schedules. These include establishing a "mini morning routine" for brief connection, sending thoughtful check-ins during the day, and prioritizing individual "me time" to de-stress before reconnecting with one's partner. Additionally, happy couples intentionally carve out daily "us time" free from distractions and conclude their day with a quiet emotional check-in to prevent issues from festering. These small, intentional rituals are presented as powerful tools to maintain intimacy and prevent minor issues from escalating, contributing to overall relationship satisfaction and stability.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese satellites, Shijian-21 and Shijian-25, appear to have successfully docked in geostationary orbit, potentially marking a historic in-orbit refueling mission. US-based space situational awareness provider COMSPOC observed the satellites visually merged between July 2 and 6, following multiple close approaches in June and July. If confirmed, this autonomous satellite servicing feat would be a significant technological achievement, one that the United States has yet to accomplish in this domain. This development highlights China's rapidly growing capabilities in advanced space operations and its potential to reshape future space logistics and military advantages in orbit.</p>

Citing issues like the broadcast of Bob Vylan at Glastonbury and a withdrawn Gaza documentary, Dawes criticized the BBC for its slow response and internal investigations. She emphasized that while the BBC generally delivers high-quality content, these "own goals" are frustrating and risk public confidence. The BBC is expected to publish reports on these incidents and implement changes, including no longer broadcasting "high risk" live performances, to restore its reputation and public accountability.</p>
