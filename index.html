        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. unexpectedly rose by 2% in July, reaching an annualized rate of 4.01 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. This increase is attributed to a temporary dip in mortgage rates during May and June, which slightly improved housing affordability. While the median home price hit a record for July at $422,400, the annual price growth has slowed significantly to just 0.2%, suggesting the market may be nearing an inflection point. A notable rise in housing inventory, now at its highest level since May 2020, is helping to ease price pressures and provide more options for buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New York state appeals court has overturned the monetary penalty of over $500 million imposed on Donald Trump and his company in a civil business fraud lawsuit. The court ruled that the fine was excessive and violated the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. However, the same ruling upheld the original finding that Trump and other defendants had committed business fraud. The non-monetary sanctions, designed to curb the company's business practices, will also remain in effect. New York Attorney General Letitia James has announced her intention to appeal the decision to the state's highest court, while Trump celebrated the ruling as a total victory.</p>

In addition to the murder charge, Zaarour faces a charge for possession of a bladed article and is scheduled to appear in court. A 31-year-old woman, who was arrested at the scene on suspicion of conspiracy to murder, has since been released on bail pending further investigation.</p>

          <p>Erik Menendez, who was convicted along with his brother Lyle for the 1989 murders of their parents, appeared virtually before a California parole board to argue for his release. After nearly three decades in prison, Menendez is seeking to demonstrate that he is no longer a threat to public safety and has been rehabilitated. The brothers' original sentences of life without parole were reduced, making them eligible under a youth offender law as they were under 26 at the time of the crime. Their defense has long maintained they acted in self-defense against parental abuse, a claim disputed by the Los Angeles County District Attorney, who strongly opposes their release.</p>

          <h2>Recent Botulism Fatalities in Italy Spark Discussion on Food Truck Safety</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 14:07:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent deadly botulism outbreak in Italy, linked to a food truck, has raised consumer concerns about the safety of mobile food vendors. Two people died and fourteen were hospitalized after consuming contaminated food, prompting questions about whether food trucks pose greater health risks than traditional restaurants. Medical experts note that botulism is rare in the U.S., with most cases stemming from improper home canning rather than commercial kitchens. However, they acknowledge that the limited space, smaller refrigeration units, and restricted access to water in food trucks can increase the risk of foodborne illnesses if safety protocols are not strictly followed, emphasizing the importance of consumer awareness.</p>

          <p>Shares of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store experienced a significant drop of about 10% after the company revealed a new, modernized logo as part of a broader brand revitalization effort. The new design removes the iconic image of a man leaning against a barrel and the phrase "old country store," which prompted considerable criticism on social media. Some conservative commentators suggested the change was an attempt to distance the brand from its traditional American image. This incident highlights the potential for brand refreshes to face political and cultural pushback, impacting stock performance in a highly polarized environment.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has instructed medical officials and international aid organizations to prepare for the evacuation of Gaza City's one million residents ahead of a planned major offensive. The warning included information that hospital infrastructure in southern Gaza is being adapted to accommodate an influx of patients from the north. However, the plan has been met with strong opposition from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, the UN, and other aid groups, who argue it would devastate the remaining health system and endanger countless lives. These organizations have vowed to remain in the city to provide aid as heavy Israeli bombardment continues in the area.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive new study analyzing millions of birdsong recordings has found that artificial light pollution is significantly altering the daily routines of birds worldwide. Researchers discovered that birds in light-polluted areas begin their vocalizations about 20 minutes earlier and end them 30 minutes later, effectively lengthening their day by an average of 50 minutes. The study, which covered over 500 species, noted that birds with larger eyes, such as American Robins, were more sensitive to the light. While the long-term effects on bird populations are still unknown, the findings provide unprecedented evidence of the global impact of human-made light on wildlife behavior.</p>

The two nations have technically been at war since 1967, and tensions have remained high, particularly since the fall of the Assad regime.

The number of asylum seekers housed in hotels has seen a slight increase but remains well below its 2023 peak.

          <p>A political analysis suggests that Stephen Miller's intense focus on mass deportations may be counterproductive to President Trump's efforts to consolidate power. The article argues that while the militarized immigration enforcement in cities like Washington, D.C. is cruel, it is also ineffective at genuine political repression and instead galvanizes public opposition. This approach is contrasted with more subtle, systemic methods of eroding democratic institutions, which are described as a greater threat. The author posits that Miller's single-minded obsession with immigration leads to highly visible, authoritarian-style tactics that generate significant backlash without achieving broader strategic goals for the administration.</p>

As a result, WH Smith has drastically cut its group profit forecast for the year to £110 million from an expected £140 million. An independent review has been launched to investigate the blunder, which has drawn comparisons to a past accounting scandal at Tesco and tarnished the company's efforts to refocus on its profitable travel retail business.</p>

Failing these exams requires students to continue studying and resitting them alongside their further education courses, creating what some describe as a dispiriting cycle.

          <p>While reverse mortgages can provide a source of income for seniors by tapping into home equity, they come with significant disadvantages that homeowners should carefully consider. These loans often involve high upfront fees, closing costs, and mortgage insurance premiums that can quickly erode the value of the asset. The loan balance grows over time as interest compounds, reducing the equity left for the homeowner or their heirs. Furthermore, borrowers must still pay for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance, and failing to meet these obligations can lead to foreclosure, posing a risk of losing the home.</p>

          <p>A new survey reveals that 44% of American adults are now ordering meals from the kids' menu at restaurants, citing lower prices and smaller portion sizes as the primary motivations. This trend emerges as consumers grapple with rising food costs and seek ways to cut back on spending when dining out. The research highlights the financial pressures facing many households, which have led to shifts in consumer behavior. With the cost of fast food having increased substantially over the past decade, the simpler and more affordable options on children's menus have become an attractive alternative for budget-conscious adults.</p>

          <p>Country music star Morgan Wallen has chosen not to submit his highly successful album, "I’m the Problem," for consideration at the upcoming Grammy Awards. The album has dominated the Billboard 200 chart since its release but will not be in contention for any awards. Wallen, despite his immense commercial success, has had a contentious relationship with the Recording Academy and parts of the music industry following past controversies, including being filmed using a racial slur. This decision ensures that one of the year's best-selling albums will be absent from the music industry's most prestigious awards ceremony.</p>

          <p>A Memphis jury has acquitted Hernandez Govan of first-degree murder and conspiracy charges in connection with the 2021 killing of rapper Young Dolph. Prosecutors had alleged that Govan organized the ambush at a local bakery, but he was not accused of being one of the shooters. The jury deliberated for about three hours before returning the not-guilty verdict. The defense questioned the police investigation and the reliability of a key witness, who had already admitted to being one of the gunmen. The verdict marks a significant turn in the high-profile case surrounding the death of the beloved Memphis artist.</p>

          <p>Comedian Marc Maron has become an outspoken critic of what he terms the "anti-woke" movement in comedy, arguing that it has helped normalize far-right politics and dumbed down the craft of stand-up. In a new HBO special and recent interviews, Maron has specifically called out podcasters like Joe Rogan and Theo Von for platforming extremism under the guise of free speech and comedy. He contends that this trend has shifted comedy from a tool for elevating perception to one that relies on "hackneyed" jokes and punching down at marginalized groups. Maron suggests this shift in comedic culture is not just a matter of taste but has real-world political consequences.</p>

The post was made in the aftermath of the July 2024 Southport attack and called for violence against asylum seekers. Her case and sentence have sparked a debate in the UK about free speech and the severity of punishments for online speech versus physical acts of protest. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticized the sentence as disproportionately harsh compared to those given to rioters, suggesting that the law may need parliamentary review to rebalance priorities between protecting people from words and ensuring public safety.</p>

          <p>Chipotle has launched a new drone delivery service called "Zipotle" in the Dallas, Texas area, in partnership with logistics provider Zipline. The service uses autonomous aircraft, known as Zips, to deliver digital orders directly to customers' homes within minutes. Initially available to a small number of customers, the program is expected to expand in the coming weeks. When a Zip arrives at its destination, it hovers at an altitude of about 300 feet and gently lowers the order to the ground. The initiative aims to provide faster delivery to keep food fresh and serve locations that are typically difficult to reach with conventional methods.</p>

          <p>Author and historian Walter Isaacson has described President Donald Trump's recent dealings with semiconductor companies Nvidia and Intel as a "scattershot method of crony capitalism." Isaacson argued that this approach, where the government favors specific companies and industries, is a recipe for corruption and will not be successful in reviving American manufacturing. His comments follow the Trump administration's push for a stake in Intel and an agreement where Nvidia and AMD will pay a percentage of their China revenues to the U.S. government for export licenses. Isaacson warned that such state capitalism often devolves into a system where companies pay tribute to political leaders.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled approximately $12.3 million in federal grant funding for sex education programs in California, citing the inclusion of "radical gender ideology" in the state's curriculum. The Administration for Children and Families stated that California refused to comply with federal demands to remove content related to transgender and gender non-conforming identities. California officials had argued that their materials are medically accurate and were previously approved. The canceled funding supports programs reaching about 13,000 youths in schools, foster care, and juvenile justice facilities, marking another front in the ongoing legal and cultural conflicts between California and the federal government.</p>

          <p>Despite recent optimism from U.S. President Donald Trump, the likelihood of a direct summit between Russia's Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky seems to be decreasing. While Moscow has expressed openness to talks, it has attached preconditions that are almost certain to be unacceptable to Kyiv, including security guarantees that would effectively limit Ukraine's sovereignty. Conversely, Ukraine insists that any meeting must follow an agreement on security guarantees from its Western allies, a framework Russia would reject. This diplomatic impasse, coupled with disagreements over a neutral location for potential talks, suggests that a breakthrough remains remote as the war continues without abatement.</p>

          <p>Powerful waves generated by Hurricane Erin are threatening to cause the collapse of several beachfront homes in Rodanthe, North Carolina. Photos show houses on elevated supports being battered by the churning Atlantic, with some support beams appearing to buckle under the pressure. This is an ongoing issue in the Outer Banks, where at least 11 homes have fallen into the ocean since 2020 due to persistent coastal erosion. While the hurricane exacerbates the problem, the National Park Service notes that the dynamic and shifting nature of the barrier islands makes such development inherently risky, with some areas losing up to 15 feet of beachfront annually.</p>

          <p>Despite remaining offshore, Hurricane Erin is causing significant impacts along the U.S. East Coast, bringing coastal flooding and dangerous conditions to North Carolina's Outer Banks. A storm surge breached protective dunes, cutting off Highway 12, the main thoroughfare on the vulnerable barrier islands. Evacuation orders were issued for some areas, though the storm's primary threat to the U.S. remains high surf and powerful rip currents. The Category 2 hurricane is now moving northeast away from the coast, with forecasters expecting it to gradually weaken as it heads into the open Atlantic, though its effects will still be felt in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast.</p>
