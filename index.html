          <p>A vehicle drove into a crowd in the East Hollywood area of Los Angeles, resulting in at least 20 injuries, according to the city's fire department. Emergency services reported that up to five people are in critical condition and as many as ten others are in serious condition following the early morning incident. The event prompted a large-scale police and emergency response on Santa Monica Boulevard, where the scene was secured for investigation. The context of the incident remains under investigation by local authorities.</p>

          <p>The Tall Ships Races, described as Scotland's largest tourist event of the year, has commenced in Aberdeen, drawing expectations of hundreds of thousands of visitors. The four-day festival features dozens of impressive vessels from around the world and includes entertainment like a concert by the band Deacon Blue. However, the event faces a Met Office yellow warning for heavy rain, which could impact the festivities. Organizers aim to turn Aberdeen into a "party city" for the duration of the event.</p>

          <p>The expiration of the interest-free payment pause for the SAVE student loan plan on August 1st is expected to cause a significant financial shock for millions of borrowers. As the SAVE plan is now effectively defunct, enrollees will see interest accrue again and may face doubled monthly payments if they switch to other plans like Income-Based Repayment (IBR). Experts warn that the increased financial burden could force some borrowers into default or severe financial hardship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Economists are evaluating the impact of President Trump's tariffs, noting some positive outcomes like increased tax revenue and corporate commitments to US investment. However, they also caution that these policies have started to push up consumer prices, risking inflation and disrupting the economy. The frequent changes and legal challenges to the tariff policies create an uncertain environment for businesses, making long-term investment decisions difficult. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Donald Trump cannot escape the political ghost of his past relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, an issue that has been weaponized by conspiracy theories within his own MAGA base. The author contends that the administration's recent attempts to debunk a specific "client list" theory have backfired, fueling outrage among followers. This creates a "conspiracy theory gap" where Trump is losing control of a narrative he helped cultivate, making the Epstein connection a persistent vulnerability.</p>

          <p>As President Trump's tariffs push the effective rate to its highest since 1910, consumer prices are showing signs of rising, contrary to administration claims that inflation is on track. In response to the economic data and the Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates, Trump has escalated his public attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell. This has raised concerns among economists about potential political interference with the central bank's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To combat impulsive and emotionally-driven spending, financial therapists and consumer experts recommend a more mindful approach to purchasing. They suggest consumers ask themselves critical questions about their budget, emotional state (using the HALT acronym for hungry, angry, lonely, or tired), and underlying motivations before making a purchase. This self-reflection, combined with practical research on price and quality, can help foster more intentional and satisfying spending habits.</p>
