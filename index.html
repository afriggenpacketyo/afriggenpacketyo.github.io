          <p>A sniper opened fire on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas, killing two detainees and critically wounding a third before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence, citing anti-ICE messages found on shell casings near the shooter's position on a nearby rooftop. Department of Homeland Security officials condemned the attack, linking it to heated political rhetoric against the agency and calling for it to cease. The event has prompted reactions from lawmakers who are urging an end to politically motivated violence against law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The first family has arrived in the United Kingdom under a new "one in, one out" agreement with France, which involves the UK accepting a refugee for each migrant returned across the Channel. This pilot program is part of the government's strategy to deter illegal small boat crossings, though it has faced criticism from opponents for being an ineffective deterrent. So far, four migrants have been deported from the UK under the scheme, while over 30,000 have crossed the Channel this year. The government aims to dismantle smuggling networks profiting from these dangerous journeys.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a class-action lawsuit against The Hershey Company that claimed its Halloween-themed candies were deceptively packaged. Consumers argued that the spooky designs shown on the wrappers, such as faces on Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins, were absent on the actual unwrapped chocolates. The judge ruled that while the appearance might be disappointing, the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate economic harm as the candies were not rendered worthless. The plaintiffs' attorney has stated their intention to amend and refile the complaint, continuing the legal challenge.</p>

          <h2>Advanced AI Models Now Capable of Passing All Levels of Chartered Financial Analyst Exam</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 13:24:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent research has revealed that advanced artificial intelligence models can now pass all three levels of the rigorous Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exam, a feat that typically requires humans over 1,000 hours of study. A study by NYU Stern School of Business and GoodFin found that frontier large language models successfully answered both multiple-choice and complex essay questions from the difficult Level III mock exams. While this technological leap highlights AI's growing analytical reasoning capabilities in finance, experts believe it will transform the industry rather than completely replace human analysts, who excel in understanding nuanced context and client intent.</p>

          <p>Maurice Hastings, a 72-year-old man who was exonerated after spending 38 years in prison for a 1983 murder he did not commit, will receive a $25 million settlement from the City of Inglewood. His conviction was overturned in 2022 after new DNA evidence identified the real perpetrator, Kenneth Packnett, who died in prison in 2020 while serving time for a separate case of kidnapping and sexual assault. Hastings' lawsuit alleged that an Inglewood police detective falsified evidence and buried information that supported his alibi. While Hastings stated no money could restore his lost years, the settlement marks a welcome end to his long ordeal.</p>

          <p>Financial regulators are moving to eliminate the $25,000 minimum equity requirement for "pattern day traders," a rule that has been in place since the dot-com era of 2001. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved replacing the fixed threshold with a more flexible intraday margin rule based on the specific positions taken during the day. This change, which is pending SEC approval, aims to make active trading more accessible to retail investors with smaller accounts. The overhaul reflects the significant technological and market access changes that have occurred in the trading landscape over the past two decades.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that FCC Chairperson Brendan Carr's successful pressure on Disney to suspend ABC host Jimmy Kimmel represents a calculated attack on critical political speech. The author contends that Carr, using the recent murder of a political operative as a pretext, is implementing a censorship plan outlined in the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 playbook. This action is framed as an authoritarian move to eliminate ridicule of the administration, turning the FCC from a protector of free speech into an enforcer of the executive's will. The piece suggests this move undermines conservative claims of being victims of speech suppression.</p>

Analysts caution that the monthly data is often volatile and subject to revision, but acknowledge it points to underlying strength in the new-build market.

The panel also voted against a combination vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox (MMRV) for young children and postponed a vote on the hepatitis B vaccine given at birth.

The delay has frustrated northern mayors, who were anticipating a major commitment to the key infrastructure project aimed at improving connectivity and boosting the regional economy.

However, other research suggests that restricting access to skilled H-1B workers could harm long-term economic growth, as these employees often help firms expand and create additional jobs for native-born workers.

          <p>The Kremlin has pushed back against recent comments from President Trump, who described Russia's military as a "paper tiger" and suggested Ukraine could win back all its territory. A Kremlin spokesperson stated that Trump's assessment was likely influenced by Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's perspective following their meeting at the UN. The official asserted that Russia is a "real bear," not a paper one, and remains economically stable despite sanctions, with its military operation continuing as planned. This exchange marks a notable shift in Trump's public rhetoric, though there is no indication of a corresponding change in U.S. policy toward the conflict.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian mining company Lithium Americas surged over 100% following reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the firm. The proposal comes as the company renegotiates a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for its Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, a joint venture with General Motors. An administration official indicated that if loan repayments are deferred, the government wants a small equity stake to mitigate risk for taxpayers. This move reflects a broader White House strategy to secure direct ownership in supply chains for critical minerals essential for technologies like electric vehicle batteries.

          <p>Oregon authorities have exhumed the partial remains of an unidentified woman known as "Oak Grove Jane Doe," nearly 80 years after her dismembered body was discovered in the Willamette River in 1946. The victim, a middle-aged white woman, died from blunt-force trauma to the head before her body was placed in burlap sacks and discarded. Critical evidence, including the remains, had been missing from police custody since the 1950s, stalling the investigation. A recent inquiry located her likely burial site, and though degraded, the recovered remains will now undergo advanced forensic testing in the hope of finally identifying her.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has sent a letter to Rolex CEO Jean-Frederic Dufour questioning whether the company's hosting of President Donald Trump at the U.S. Open was an attempt to gain influence regarding tariffs. The letter suggests Rolex may be trying to secure exemptions from a 39% levy Trump recently placed on Swiss exports. Warren expressed concern that the company might be following a playbook used by other corporations to curry favor with the president through flattery or investments. The White House dismissed the inquiry as an "asinine conspiracy theory," while Rolex has not yet commented on the matter.</p>

          <p>Kathleen Corradi, appointed as New York City's first-ever citywide director of rodent mitigation, or "rat czar," has resigned from her post. Appointed by Mayor Eric Adams in 2023 with a mission to reduce the city's estimated 3 million rats, Corradi was tasked with a $3.5 million initiative that included public awareness campaigns and rat birth control. During her tenure, calls to the city's 311 service line regarding rats saw a significant decrease. Mayor Adams praised her creative and confident approach to the complex task and affirmed that the city's efforts to combat its rodent problem will continue unabated.</p>

          <p>A wave of youth-led, anti-corruption protests has swept across several Asian nations, including Nepal, Indonesia, and the Philippines, largely organized and fueled by social media. Young activists, part of Generation Z, are using platforms like TikTok and AI tools to highlight perceived government corruption and the lavish lifestyles of political elites and their children, dubbed "nepo kids." This digital activism has translated into major street demonstrations, some of which have turned violent, leading to government resignations and policy changes. The movements show a growing sense of cross-national solidarity among young protesters who feel disenfranchised by inequality and a lack of opportunity.</p>

          <p>A fact-check of President Donald Trump's address to the United Nations General Assembly reveals several inaccurate and misleading statements on topics including his diplomatic record, climate policy, and the UN headquarters itself. Trump falsely claimed to have ended seven wars, when in fact many of the conflicts he cited remain unresolved or his role in them is disputed. He also misleadingly stated that Germany had abandoned its green agenda to return to fossil fuels and nuclear power, despite Germany having completed its nuclear phaseout. Additionally, his claims about the cost and effectiveness of renewable energy were contradicted by recent data.</p>

His show was briefly suspended by ABC following comments he made about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel clarified it was not his intent to make light of the murder and accused the head of the FCC of using "mob tactics" to suppress speech. The return broadcast was not aired by some local ABC affiliates, and President Trump, who had supported the suspension, criticized the network for reinstating the host.</p>

          <p>Peter Mutharika has won Malawi's presidential election, ousting incumbent Lazarus Chakwera in a victory driven by public frustration over severe economic hardship. Over the past five years, Malawi has experienced soaring inflation, which surged from under 10% to over 30%, and a rise in poverty affecting a majority of the population. Analysts attribute the economic collapse to overspending, corruption, and inadequate agricultural policies. The incoming president faces immense pressure to restore fiscal discipline, implement austerity measures, and deliver decisive policies that can stabilize the economy and provide relief to citizens.</p>

Israel has not commented but previously stated it would not allow the flotilla to breach its naval blockade of Gaza.
