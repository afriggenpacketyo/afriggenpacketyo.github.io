        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey by Natixis Investment Managers found that 21% of Americans believe it will take a miracle to retire securely, citing concerns like insufficient savings and inflation. Despite recent stock market optimism, many feel their financial goals are unattainable. Financial experts counter this sentiment, emphasizing that a structured plan, rather than a miracle, is the key to a secure retirement. They advise starting early, maintaining consistency, and seeking professional guidance to navigate the complexities of long-term financial planning and avoid emotional decision-making.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has suggested that publicly traded companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a change that would require SEC approval. He argued on Truth Social that this shift would save money and encourage a focus on long-term strategy over short-term profits, a sentiment previously echoed by figures like Warren Buffett. Proponents of the current quarterly system argue it provides necessary transparency and timely information for investors. The proposal aligns U.S. corporate reporting standards more closely with practices in the European Union and the UK.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Career coaches are cautioning job seekers against placing excessive trust in artificial intelligence tools for creating resumes and cover letters. Experts note that AI can fabricate information, a phenomenon known as hallucinating, and often produces generic, keyword-stuffed applications that lack authenticity. They have observed instances where candidates submitted resumes with inaccurate experience or even included AI prompts in their application answers. The advice is to use AI for polishing a self-written draft rather than for initial generation, ensuring the final product is accurate and reflects the applicant's unique voice.</p>

          <p>Professional golfer Phil Mickelson has publicly commented on the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, criticizing the extremist rhetoric that has emerged following the event. In a post on X, Mickelson expressed that the tragedy has exposed both the best and worst of humanity, condemning those who support the alleged shooter's actions. He lamented what he described as an extremist faction with a moral superiority complex, calling for accountability for their 'disgusting rhetoric.' Mickelson's statements position him as a prominent sports figure speaking out against political division in the wake of the killing.</p>

          <p>Amid a challenging housing market with high interest rates, prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing face affordability issues. As of September 11, 2025, average rates for a 30-year mortgage stand at 6.53%, while a 30-year refinance rate is slightly higher at 6.72%. Experts suggest that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could bring relief to borrowers. To secure better rates, individuals are advised to strengthen their credit profiles, aiming for scores in the mid-to-high 700s, and to compare offers from multiple lenders.

          <p>Documents show that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook designated a condominium she purchased in 2021 as a 'vacation home' on a loan estimate form. This characterization could potentially weaken the Trump administration's claims that she committed mortgage fraud by allegedly declaring two properties as primary residences simultaneously. The administration has sought to remove Cook from her position, a move she is currently fighting in court. This new evidence emerges as a critical detail in the ongoing investigation and the political battle over the Federal Reserve's leadership.</p>

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and lines of credit (HELOCs) present an affordable borrowing alternative compared to high-rate personal loans and credit cards. As of mid-September 2025, average interest rates for 10-year home equity loans are around 8.38%, with HELOC rates averaging 8.10%. These financial products allow homeowners to leverage their property's value for a lump-sum payment or a revolving credit line. While offering lower rates and potential tax benefits, they use the home as collateral, posing a risk of foreclosure if payments are not met. (not investment advice)</p>

City's strategy focused on creating midfield overloads, particularly down the left flank, with winger Jeremy Doku moving centrally to disrupt United's marking assignments. This forced United's defenders into difficult decisions and created disjointed pressing, leaving players like Phil Foden with space to advance the ball.

Sze, known for his collections that often draw on Southwestern landscapes and ancient Chinese poetry, will serve a one-year term. His appointment comes during a period of turmoil for the Library of Congress, following the recent firing of its head, Carla Hayden. For his term, Sze plans to focus on the art of translation as a way to deepen the public's appreciation for poetry, a craft he credits with helping him develop his own writing.</p>

          <h2>Africa's Critical Mineral Wealth Holds Transformative Economic Potential</h2>

          <p>Africa is becoming a crucial player in the global supply of critical minerals, which are essential for green energy technologies and modern electronics. The continent is a leading source of cobalt, platinum, and manganese, and this resource wealth could boost sub-Saharan Africa's GDP by 12% over the next 25 years. However, challenges remain in ensuring that the revenue benefits local communities and that extraction is environmentally sound. Experts argue that for Africa to fully capitalize on this opportunity, nations must move up the value chain by refining minerals domestically rather than just exporting raw materials.</p>

          <h2>Exploitation of Critical Minerals Fuels Conflict and Instability Across Africa</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global demand for critical minerals is exacerbating political instability and conflict in several African nations. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, disputes over valuable coltan mines have fueled a decades-long conflict, with armed groups smuggling the mineral to fund their operations. This illicit trade contaminates global supply chains designed to ensure responsible sourcing. Meanwhile, political instability in the Sahel region has caused mining investors to flee, shifting focus to more stable countries like the Ivory Coast. The resource race highlights the challenge of managing mineral wealth without triggering violence and displacement.</p>

The Duke of Sussex, who was in Ukraine to promote his Invictus Games Foundation, also commented on his ongoing legal case against a newspaper publisher, framing it as a matter of accountability, not revenge.

          <p>Public health experts are expressing alarm over a significant loss of expertise at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) due to high-profile departures and extensive layoffs. They warn that this 'brain drain' leaves the nation less prepared for future health crises, such as new pandemics or outbreaks of diseases like Ebola and measles. The article connects these changes to a broader political agenda, including proposals in Project 2025, that seeks to curtail the agency's authority.
