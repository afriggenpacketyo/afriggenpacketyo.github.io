        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japan Tourism Agency has urged Agoda International Japan to address ongoing booking problems reported by travelers and hotels. Issues include incorrect reservation details and travelers arriving at hotels to find no record of their paid bookings. While Agoda submitted a list of measures to the agency, some hotel operators claim problems persist. Toyoko Inn Co. has even warned travelers about booking issues involving Agoda and its partner firms, citing incorrect room types and reservation dates and rooms listed at significantly higher prices. If Agoda fails to implement drastic measures, the Japanese government may impose administrative penalties. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Bankrate survey reveals that nearly half of Americans believe they need to earn $100,000 or more annually to feel financially secure, with 26% requiring $150,000 or more. This is in contrast to the median household income in 2023, which was a little over $80,000. The survey also indicated that 77% of Americans do not feel completely financially comfortable, a rise from previous years. Experts attribute this to stagnant wages, rising prices, political instability, and increasing expenses like child care and student loan payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Embassy in Qatar has advised American citizens to shelter in place as a precautionary measure due to escalating tensions between Iran and Israel. This follows a State Department warning for U.S. citizens worldwide to exercise increased caution, subsequent to the U.S. joining Israel's assault on Iran. Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest U.S. base in the Middle East, houses approximately 8,000 U.S. troops and was visited by President Trump the previous month.

          <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the administration is confident that weekend airstrikes "completely and totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear facilities. This statement comes amid questions regarding the extent of the damage, particularly at the Fordo site, which is built deep underground. Leavitt asserted that the U.S. had a high degree of confidence that Iran's enriched uranium was stored at the targeted locations. She added that Iran no longer possesses the capability to construct a nuclear weapon and pose a global threat.</p>

          <p>A suicide bomber attacked a Greek Orthodox church in Dweil'a, Syria, killing at least 25 people and wounding over 60. The attacker opened fire before detonating an explosive vest inside the Mar Elias Church during prayers, marking the first attack of its kind in Syria in years. While no group immediately claimed responsibility, the Syrian Interior Ministry attributed the attack to an extremist from the Islamic State group. The Syrian Information Minister condemned the attack as a terrorist act, reaffirming the state's commitment to combating criminal organizations.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. health insurers have voluntarily agreed to streamline and reduce prior authorizations, a process often criticized for causing care delays and physician burnout. Plans under insurers like CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, and Cigna committed to actions aimed at connecting patients to care more quickly and reducing administrative burdens. These changes will be implemented across various markets, including commercial coverage and certain Medicare and Medicaid plans, benefiting an estimated 257 million Americans. The goal is to ensure patients receive medically necessary care without unnecessary delays or administrative hurdles.</p>

His platform includes policies such as rent freezes, free city buses, and increased taxes on corporations and high-income earners. Despite facing criticism for his limited political record, Mamdani's campaign has energized young voters and sparked debate on the city's future direction.</p>

          <p>Tesla launched its Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, marking a significant step in autonomous transportation. This service is being compared to Baidu's Apollo Go, which began testing in China in 2019 and has since expanded to over 15 cities, including Hong Kong and Dubai. While Tesla's Robotaxi is initially available in Austin, Elon Musk plans to expand based on performance. Apollo Go currently operates commercially in several cities, offering driverless taxi services.

          <p>Following US-China talks in London, there are indications that Beijing may have gained a negotiating edge over Washington, although observers caution against expecting a full restoration of senior-level exchanges. President Trump's competing priorities could divert attention from establishing a lasting agreement on US-China trade relations. Despite this, Beijing should advance a leader-driven process to stabilize bilateral ties and lay the groundwork for a trade agreement ahead of a potential summit. The framework reached in London represents a temporary truce, with China currently positioned as a front-runner in Washington's trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the idea that Americans are overwhelmed by the abundance of choices in modern life, suggesting this exhaustion contributes to the appeal of leaders like President Trump who offer relief from decision-making. It references the historian Sophia Rosenfeld's book, *The Age of Choice*, which argues that the concept of freedom has become synonymous with having endless options, potentially leading to a hollow sense of identity. The author explores how the consumer revolution and the rise of individualism have shaped the perception of choice, while also noting the potential for this focus on choice to overshadow values such as the common good.</p>

Even within Trump's coalition, figures like Elon Musk and Oren Cass have criticized the plan.
