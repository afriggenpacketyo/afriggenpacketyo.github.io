          <p>President Trump met with conservative Republicans to address concerns about the budget bill, which includes his second-term agenda, but faces opposition from both fiscal conservatives and blue-state Republicans. House Speaker Mike Johnson described the meeting as productive, while some Republicans voiced strong disagreement with the bill's spending cuts. The Rules Committee held an overnight meeting as conservatives pushed for steeper cuts to Medicaid and the elimination of clean energy subsidies, while blue-state Republicans sought an increase to the state and local tax deduction cap. The budget bill is estimated to add trillions to the deficit over the next decade.</p>

A preliminary autopsy indicated that Helms died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and Martin died from a gunshot wound inflicted by Helms.

          <p>A New York City pilot program is helping formerly incarcerated individuals find jobs in the trucking industry, which currently faces a shortage of about 60,000 drivers. The Commercial Driver's License Workforce Development Program, a partnership between New York City's Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice and Emerge Career, trains formerly incarcerated people for trucking jobs, helping them obtain commercial driver's licenses and connecting them with trucking companies. Participants in the program have a significantly lower rate of recidivism, and graduates receive job offers with an average starting salary of $75,000 per year. The program aims to provide a second chance for individuals re-entering society while addressing a critical need in the American supply chain.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized South Africa's land seizure policies from white farmers, falsely accusing the government of systemic persecution. However, this article highlights Trump's own past use of eminent domain to take land for his border wall in Texas. The article draws a parallel between Trump's condemnation of South Africa's land policies and his own actions, noting that he has long been quick to embrace similar tools at home, both as a developer and as president. The article references interviews with farmers in South Texas who were impacted by Trump's border wall construction, illustrating the human cost of such policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed that there is an ongoing "genocide" against white farmers in South Africa during a meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. Ramaphosa, major political parties in South Africa, and a South African court have denied the existence of a white genocide in the country. While murders of farmers occur, South African crime statistics do not differentiate between the races of victims, and there is no specific category for farm murders. The White House released a statement after the meeting titled "President Trump is Right About What’s Happening in South Africa," doubling down on the administration's unfounded claims of genocide happening in the nation.</p>

          <p>Texas lawmakers advanced a bill to clarify medical exceptions under the state's restrictive abortion law, though it does not expand abortion access or include exceptions for rape or incest. The bill specifies that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment and defines a "life-threatening" condition as one capable of causing death. While supporters say it will avoid confusion among doctors, critics argue it doesn't go far enough and may not change the understanding that abortions are largely illegal in Texas. Lawmakers in other states with abortion bans have also sought to clarify medical exceptions, with varying degrees of success.</p>

          <p>St. Louis' emergency management chief, Sarah Russell, has been placed on administrative leave after tornado sirens failed to activate ahead of a deadly tornado.

Russell was attending an offsite workshop when the tornado warning was issued, and her call to the Fire Department did not clearly direct them to activate the sirens. The city has changed the siren activation protocol, putting the Fire Department solely in charge, and is conducting an external investigation into the incident.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that Chief Justice John Roberts was "profoundly wrong" for recent comments he made on the Supreme Court's role to check the excesses of the executive branch. Vance believes the courts are attempting to overturn the will of the American people, particularly regarding immigration policies. He defended the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act and argued that the courts need to be "extremely deferential" to the president's political judgment. Vance's comments are part of a larger argument the White House has been making for months -- that the president has the executive authority to enact immigration policies, regardless of what the courts may say.</p>

The ruling came after USIP leaders sued the government following their ejection from their positions in March.

Representatives of DOGE, led by Elon Musk, seized control of the institute's headquarters, prompting a legal battle.

A New Jersey judge ordered the administration to allow Khalil to meet with his wife and lawyers, but it was unclear whether the order would permit him to meet his son.

Murphy, said the government had given the deported men little more than 24 hours’ notice, which he described as “plainly insufficient.” The flight carrying the deportees had landed in Djibouti, where U.S. military personnel were standing by to assist with securing detainees.</p>
