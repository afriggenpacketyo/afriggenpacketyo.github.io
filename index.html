          <p>Former President Donald Trump is intensifying his efforts to broker an end to the war in Ukraine, announcing a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest. This diplomatic push follows a tentative ceasefire in Gaza and is a central theme of his 2024 campaign. Trump has expressed growing frustration with Putin's reluctance to engage in direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom he is scheduled to meet at the White House. The administration is also considering new sanctions and the sale of long-range missiles to Kyiv to increase pressure on Moscow to negotiate.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is holding a procedural vote on a full-year funding bill for the Pentagon in an attempt to break the legislative stalemate that has caused a multi-week government shutdown. Republican leadership is pursuing this strategy to restore funding for the military, but the measure is expected to be blocked by Democrats. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated that his party finds it unacceptable to fund defense without also addressing domestic priorities like healthcare and housing. The move highlights the deep partisan divisions that continue to paralyze Congress and prevent the government from fully reopening.</p>

          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune has announced his intention to advance a bipartisan bill imposing new economic sanctions on Russia, stating that the "time has come" for a vote. The legislation, which has broad support with 85 co-sponsors, aims to increase pressure on Moscow to end its war in Ukraine by targeting countries that purchase Russian energy exports. The push for a vote gained new urgency following President Trump's recent phone call with Vladimir Putin and a planned summit between the two leaders. The White House had previously sought modifications to the bill to allow for more presidential flexibility.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, 83, fell in a Capitol hallway on Thursday while on his way to a series of votes related to the ongoing government shutdown. He appeared unsteady but was helped up by his security detail and continued walking, later participating in the scheduled votes. This incident follows a previous fall in 2023 that led to a significant absence from the Senate for hospitalization and rehabilitation. McConnell, who has walked with a limp since overcoming polio as a child, announced in February that he would not seek reelection and will retire at the end of his term in 2027.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors in Maryland are expected to ask a grand jury to indict former National Security Adviser John Bolton for allegedly mishandling classified documents. This development follows recent indictments of other Trump administration critics, including former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, fueling accusations of political retribution. The investigation into Bolton centers on classified information allegedly possessed after his government service and related to his 2019 memoir. Bolton has consistently denied any wrongdoing, stating no classified material was unlawfully removed or published.</p>

          <p>The way people interact with friends and family on social media is increasingly resembling one-sided, parasocial relationships typically felt with celebrities. As platforms prioritize algorithmically-driven content over personal connections, interactions with loved ones become part of a passive stream of consumption, similar to viewing posts from influencers. This shift reduces the expectation of reciprocity, a key component of real relationships, and can lead to a feeling of being a spectator in friends' lives rather than an active participant. Experts suggest this trend is part of a broader change where social networks are becoming more like entertainment hubs than spaces for genuine sociality.</p>

          <p>After 24 years of service, U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Doug Krugman has resigned from the military, citing President Trump's contempt for the constitution as his reason for leaving. In an op-ed, Krugman expressed deep concern for the country's future, warning of a potential "collapse" of the U.S. government system. He pointed to the pardoning of January 6th insurrectionists and the testing of legal and constitutional limits as actions he is unwilling to defend. Krugman urged other military personnel to question potentially immoral or illegal orders, reminding them they are not alone in their doubts.</p>

          <p>While high-yield savings accounts remain more profitable than traditional ones, savers must adapt their strategies as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates. Financial experts advise avoiding several costly mistakes, such as exclusively using local brick-and-mortar banks, which typically offer lower rates than online competitors. It is also recommended to consider splitting funds with a fixed-rate Certificate of Deposit (CD) to lock in current high rates before they fall further. Despite declining returns, these accounts still offer significant value and flexibility compared to standard savings options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has revealed plans for a new monument in the nation's capital, a large arch informally dubbed the "Arc de Trump." The structure, officially named the "Independence Arch," is modeled after the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and is slated for construction on the Virginia side of the Memorial Bridge. Trump showcased models of the arch at a White House dinner for wealthy donors, expressing his preference for the largest version. The project is intended to be completed for the nation's 250th anniversary, but details on its cost and funding have not been disclosed.</p>

          <p>Soybeans have become a cornerstone of the global food system, primarily as the main protein source for livestock feed rather than for direct human consumption. The U.S. is the world's second-largest producer, with most of its exports historically going to China to feed its massive pork and poultry industries. The recent trade war initiated by the Trump administration has disrupted this relationship, causing U.S. soy sales to plummet while benefiting producers in South America. While politically significant for farm states, the conflict highlights the inefficient use of a highly productive crop that could be used more sustainably to feed people directly.</p>

          <p>Recent reports of elevated lead levels in products like cinnamon and protein powders are raising public health concerns, though experts emphasize that the primary risk comes from long-term, cumulative exposure. Lead is a naturally occurring metal, but high levels can cause serious health issues, particularly in children. Since supplements are not strictly regulated by the FDA, consumers are advised to prioritize whole foods and look for trusted third-party certifications like USP on products. Experts caution against relying on blood tests for assurance, instead recommending preventative measures to minimize intake from all potential sources.</p>

          <p>A major lawsuit has been filed in the United Kingdom by over 3,000 people against Johnson & Johnson, alleging the company knowingly sold talcum powder contaminated with carcinogenic asbestos for more than 50 years. The claimants, who developed cancer and other diseases, argue that internal documents show the company was aware of the risks but chose profit over consumer safety. J&J only stopped selling its talc-based powder in the U.K. in 2023, three years after pulling it from U.S. and Canadian markets. The company's consumer health spin-off, Kenvue, denies the allegations, stating its products are safe and asbestos-free.</p>

The measure did not secure the necessary 60 votes, with the primary sticking point being Democrats' insistence on extending enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies. Democratic Senator Mark Kelly urged President Trump to engage directly with congressional leaders to break the impasse. Republican leaders maintain that discussions on ACA subsidies should only occur after the government is reopened, prolonging the political stalemate.</p>

In response, local officials are fighting the deployment in court, while community activist groups have organized "Rapid Response" brigades to monitor ICE activity and warn residents. The federal operation, aimed at mass deportations, has been met with disciplined, coordinated resistance from the city and its residents.</p>
