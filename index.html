          <p>As G7 leaders convene in Canada, ongoing trade instability, conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are central to discussions. Allies are uncertain whether President Trump will align with them on major geopolitical issues, given his trade tariffs and foreign policy decisions. The summit aims to facilitate consensus on global economic and geopolitical challenges, but internal divisions, particularly regarding Trump's trade policies, pose a problem. Bilateral meetings are expected, but the likelihood of significant trade deals remains uncertain, although Trump expressed optimism about potential progress on agreements. Optimism is tempered by existing tensions and potential trade wars, making the summit's outcome unpredictable.</p>

          <p>With potential Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon, savings experts are weighing in on the most beneficial certificate of deposit (CD) term. Short-term CDs are currently offering the highest interest rates, making them attractive for maximizing returns. Long-term CDs, while having lower rates currently, offer longer-term security and predictability, especially if further rate cuts occur. A CD ladder, which involves opening multiple CD accounts with varying terms, provides a balance between locking in rates and maintaining flexibility. It's crucial to research and compare rates from different banks and credit unions before opening a CD account. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris unexpectedly closed due to a strike by staff protesting unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing, and difficult working conditions. The closure, a rare occurrence, left tourists confused and frustrated, highlighting the museum's struggle with overtourism. The Louvre, which welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year, faces challenges such as water leaks, temperature swings, and outdated infrastructure. President Macron's renovation plan aims to address these issues, including giving the Mona Lisa her own dedicated room and creating a new entrance to relieve pressure on the main entrance. The situation underscores the need for immediate improvements to support the staff and enhance the visitor experience.</p>

          <p>TP-Link, Chinaâ€™s leading Wi-fi router manufacturer, has laid off most employees at a chip development unit in Shanghai amid setbacks, according to people familiar with the matter and local media reports. Lianzhou International, known globally as TP-Link Systems and the overseas arm of the router maker, cut the majority of workers at its Shanghai-based chip unit last week, according to two people with knowledge of the situation, who declined to be named because they are not authorised to speak to news media. One source said the cuts followed difficulties in chip development, with one product failing to pass final testing.</p>

          <p>WhatsApp is set to launch three new advertising features in a global rollout across the messaging app. The new ads will not be shown in the same place as people's private chats, nor will the contents of their messages - which are encrypted - be used to decide which ads to display. The new ad features will appear in a section called Updates, which is a separate tab at the bottom of the app. The company is "laying the foundation for WhatsApp to finally become a monetisable platform at scale".</p>
