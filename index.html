          <p>President Trump declared that the U.S. military successfully attacked three Iranian nuclear sites, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. All American planes are reported to be safely out of Iranian airspace after a full payload of bombs was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. This action follows escalating tensions and prior strikes by Israel on Iran's nuclear capabilities, with the U.S. utilizing bunker-buster bombs to target heavily fortified underground sites. The decision to directly involve the U.S. comes after more than a week of strikes by Israel on Iran that have moved to systematically eradicate the country's air defenses and offensive missile capabilities, while damaging its nuclear enrichment facilities. The U.S. president is scheduled to address the nation later in the evening. Optimism is low given the recent military action.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The ruling prevents a policy change that would have stripped universities of tens of millions of dollars allocated for research in critical technology fields such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Judge Talwani deemed the NSF's announced changes in May as arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, particularly regarding indirect costs like building maintenance. The University of California estimated that the change would have cost them nearly $100 million annually, but this ruling protects their funding for now. The stability of research funding is positive news for academic institutions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated assisted departure flights from Israel, with two flights already transporting approximately 70 U.S. citizens and their families to Athens. This evacuation effort began shortly before President Trump announced U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee urged other U.S. citizens needing assistance to register with the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP). The move follows earlier confusion regarding U.S. government assistance for Americans evacuating Israel, as tensions between Israel and Iran have escalated. The successful evacuation of citizens is a positive step amidst regional conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly contradicted his Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, regarding Iran's nuclear weapons program. Gabbard testified in March that U.S. intelligence assessed Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, but Trump asserted that Iran was "very close to having one." The White House stated that Iran possesses everything needed to build a nuclear weapon and requires only the supreme leader's approval. This disagreement occurred as Trump considers joining Israel in strikes against Iran, and two days later, Mr. Trump announced the U.S. had launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities. The discrepancy in intelligence assessments adds uncertainty to the situation.</p>

          <p>The article provides details on the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bomb and the B-2 Spirit bomber, which are potentially being considered for use against Iran's Fordo nuclear facility. The MOP is designed to destroy deeply buried facilities, penetrating up to 200 feet underground before exploding. The B-2 Spirit is the only aircraft in the U.S. Air Force capable of carrying the MOP due to its weight. The B-2's stealth capabilities allow it to evade air defenses and reach heavily defended targets, making it a key asset in potential strikes against Iran's underground nuclear sites.

          <p>The article details the significance of Iran's Fordo nuclear facility, which is buried deep within a mountain and considered a key site for potential clandestine nuclear weapons development. Despite Iran's denial of any interest in building nuclear weapons, international experts and monitors have long been concerned about Fordo. The facility is heavily fortified with air defenses, making it a challenging target for military strikes. The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency declared Iran non-compliant with its monitoring efforts, raising further concerns about the activities taking place at Fordo. The analysis of Fordo's capabilities underscores the complexity of the situation.</p>

Tikhanovsky's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, thanked President Trump for brokering the deal. The Belarusian leader reportedly ordered the release at Mr. Trump's request. This development signals a potential warming of ties between Washington and Moscow-ally Belarus, although the country still holds over 1,000 political prisoners.

Reed suggested that Trump's stance is politically motivated, given his contemplation of an attack against Iran. The senator argued that if National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard made a false statement in her testimony, it should have been corrected immediately, not after Israeli actions. This criticism highlights the tension between political considerations and intelligence assessments in the context of potential military action.

This measure is expected to face legal challenges from critics who argue it violates the separation of church and state. Supporters claim the Ten Commandments are foundational to the U.S. judicial and educational systems.

South Arcade gained traction via TikTok, where the Y2K hashtag has been used in millions of posts. Their music appeals to both those who experienced the Y2K era and younger fans seeking escapism. The band's success reflects the growing interest in Y2K culture.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, giant statues of Michael Jackson were erected around the world to promote his album HIStory. These 32-foot fibreglass statues followed Jackson on his global tour, becoming iconic landmarks. While the fate of some statues remains uncertain, others have been found in unexpected locations, such as a McDonald's in the Netherlands and a nightclub in Austria. The McDonald's statue was removed after the Leaving Neverland documentary, while the Austrian statue is now for sale. The article explores the current whereabouts and stories behind these pop culture relics. The statues serve as a reminder of Jackson's global impact.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article examines the trend of social media posts offering quick fixes to lower cortisol levels, a stress hormone. Experts warn that these simplistic solutions often fail to address the underlying causes of stress and may prevent individuals from seeking necessary medical treatment. Jasleen Kaur Carroll, who experienced burnout, tried various social media hacks without success. High cortisol levels can cause weight gain and other health problems, potentially indicating a rare condition like Cushing's Syndrome. Instead of relying on quick fixes, experts recommend addressing the root causes of stress through therapy, mindfulness, and lifestyle changes. Addressing stress requires a holistic approach.</p>

          <p>Former Texas Representative Blake Farenthold, who left Congress amid sexual harassment allegations, has passed away at the age of 63. Farenthold's former political consultant confirmed that he died due to health reasons. He was elected in 2010, upsetting long-serving Democratic Rep. Solomon Ortiz, and announced in 2017 that he would not seek reelection. Farenthold had denied accusations from a former aide, which included sexually suggestive comments and behavior, but apologized for an office atmosphere that was less than professional. After leaving office, Farenthold started his own radio show. His death marks the end of a controversial political career.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has proposed offering new army recruits a Â£10,000 bonus to boost troop numbers. The plan aims to increase the number of trained soldiers from just under 71,000 to more than 73,000. The Lib Dems also suggest distributing pamphlets to every British home to ensure preparedness for conflict or cyber-attacks. New recruits would receive the bonus after completing training and serving for two years, while former armed services personnel would be offered a Â£20,000 payment for re-enlisting. The proposal is designed to address an increasingly unpredictable world situation. The plan is contingent on increased defense spending.</p>
