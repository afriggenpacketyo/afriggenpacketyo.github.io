        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's export growth experienced a slowdown in May, reaching a three-month low, primarily due to a decline in shipments to the United States following the imposition of tariffs by President Donald Trump, as China exported $28.8 billion worth of goods to the US, down from $33 billion in April. While overall exports saw a 4.8% year-on-year increase, this was a decrease from the 8.1% growth observed in April, with exports to the U.S. specifically falling by almost 12% month-on-month. This report coincides with another round of trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials in London, while Beijing has introduced new stimulus measures, including interest rate cuts, to cushion the economic impact.

          <p>Geely Auto, China’s second-largest carmaker, announced it will cease building new plants due to severe global overcapacity, a decision expected to affect the broader industry. Chairman Li Shufu stated the company will focus on technological advancements to become a key player in future mobility, as this announcement comes amid a fierce price war in China's automotive market. Leading carmakers like BYD and Leapmotor have slashed prices by up to 20% to maintain market share, while discounts from Chinese carmakers more than doubled to a record 16.8% in April, according to a JPMorgan Chase report. </p>

Webster's role as a seamer came about during the Covid pandemic when Tasmania needed a seam-bowling all-rounder, with the help of pace-bowling coach Adam Griffith. Initially seen as a gimmick due to his history as an off-spin bowler, Webster gained credibility after consistent performance and support from teammates like Usman Khawaja.</p>

Despite a temporary trade truce, tariffs imposed earlier in the year had already caused damage, and exports of rare earths also saw a decline.</p>
