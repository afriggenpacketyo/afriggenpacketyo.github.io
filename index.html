          <p>The United Kingdom has recorded its hottest day of the year, with temperatures exceeding 32°C, and Suffolk has become the first area to officially enter a heatwave after surpassing 27°C for three consecutive days. Amber heat health alerts are in effect across England until Monday, raising concerns about increased pressure on health and social care services. The Met Office forecasts temperatures could reach 33°C on Saturday in central and eastern England, with possible "tropical nights" where temperatures remain above 20°C. Regional fire services are issuing water safety warnings, while health organizations advise precautions for those with heart conditions and encourage checking on elderly neighbors as the heatwave continues. The rising temperatures are due to an area of high pressure across the UK drawing in hot weather from Western Europe. Optimism is mixed as authorities are preparing for the worst case scenario.</p>

          <p>U.S. troops stationed in the Middle East are facing increased risks of attacks amidst escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, particularly if the U.S. becomes involved. President Trump is expected to decide within two weeks whether to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, a move that Iran warns will have severe consequences. The Pentagon has increased its forces in the region, including deploying the aircraft carrier Nimitz, to enhance defensive capabilities. There are currently over 40,000 U.S. troops and Defense Department civilians stationed across various countries in the Middle East, including Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates, all potentially facing heightened threats. The safety of U.S. forces remains the top priority as tensions continue to rise in the region.</p>

He has six children conceived naturally with three different partners and over 100 children fathered through sperm donations. Durov also mentioned his strict daily routine, which includes intense workouts and abstaining from alcohol, coffee, tea, and sugar, as well as his denial of charges by French authorities alleging Telegram is used for criminal activities.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been briefed on the potential risks and benefits of striking Fordo, Iran's secure nuclear site, believing disabling it is necessary due to the risk of rapid weapons production.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated that Trump will decide within two weeks whether to order a strike. The UK's foreign secretary is engaging in diplomacy to find a resolution, while Trump is aware of ongoing discussions with Iranian officials, with intelligence reports suggesting Iran is close to possessing nuclear weapons.

          <p>Aid distribution in Gaza has devolved into deadly chaos, with hundreds killed as residents compete for scarce supplies. Since Israel sidelined the UN and tasked assistance to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an opaque U.S.- and Israeli-backed contractor, aid deliveries have been accompanied by near-daily fatalities. Over 400 people have been killed and more than 3,000 wounded since the GHF began operations in late May, with residents describing the situation as a real-life version of "Squid Game." The GHF's distribution methods, including dumping boxes on pallets and using armed private contractors, have been criticized for increasing the danger and failing to meet the needs of the starving population, as the distribution practices were entirely predictable.</p>

He noted that Hollywood productions were not providing opportunities for him to be himself, often being asked to clean up his accent. Luna's presence in American productions has helped increase Latinx representation, though disparities persist, with Latinx actors often portraying stereotypical roles, and that there is an imbalance of Latinx representation in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers are undergoing a major shift as the majority ownership is being sold to Mark Walter, president of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and his group TWGC Global, valuing the franchise at $10 billion. This move is seen as a positive change for the Lakers, who have lacked a sustained championship vision since the death of Jerry Buss in 2013. Walter's group is expected to invest heavily in the team's infrastructure, coaching staff, and scouting, similar to their successful revitalization of the Dodgers. The new ownership may lead to changes in player dynamics, with less sentimentality towards aging superstars like LeBron James, and a stronger focus on building a championship-winning team, rather than catering to individual players.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok's sale in the US for another 90 days, marking the third delay in enforcing the law requiring the app to be sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The extension allows more time for a deal to be reached for the sale of TikTok in the US, which must now occur by September 17, according to Trump. The law was prompted by concerns that TikTok or ByteDance could be forced to hand over data on US users to the Chinese government, a risk that TikTok denies. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the extension aims to ensure the deal is closed, safeguarding the data of American users.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that American taxpayers will not fund President Donald Trump's appeal in the $83 million defamation case brought by columnist E. Jean Carroll. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied Trump's request to have Justice Department lawyers argue on his behalf. The DOJ had argued that since some of Trump's alleged conduct occurred within his presidential role, they should defend him. Oral arguments in Trump's appeal are scheduled for June 24, following a previous denial of Trump's request to rehear a challenge to a $5 million civil judgment awarded to Carroll in 2023.</p>

The defense argued that Read was framed by a group of people, including law enforcement, and that O'Keefe was involved in a fight inside another home before his death.

The independent report cited poor financial judgment, weak governance, and a failure to identify and address the worsening crisis. The report highlighted that nearly £40 million of ringfenced money had been misspent, and there was a lack of action to address an £8 million deficit due to a decline in international student recruitment.

          <p>Social Security is projected to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year earlier than previously anticipated, potentially leading to a 20% reduction in monthly benefits.

If the trust funds are depleted, beneficiaries could face benefit cuts ranging from 19% to 23%, with the average retiree's benefit decreasing significantly. Advocacy groups are urging lawmakers to take swift action to shore up the program, either by raising revenue or cutting benefits, to ensure the stability of Social Security for current and future retirees (not investment advice).</p>
