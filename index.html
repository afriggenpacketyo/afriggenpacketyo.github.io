          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Sonay Kartal and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova was disrupted when the electronic line-calling system failed at a critical moment. During a tie at 4-4 in the first set, the system did not make an audio call on a Kartal backhand that was visibly long, forcing the chair umpire to halt play. After confirming the system was down, the umpire ordered the point to be replayed. Pavlyuchenkova, who would have won the point and gained the advantage, lost the replayed point and subsequently the game, stating later that the game was 'stolen' from her.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow has released a new book on the life of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, exploring the author's enduring relevance and complex personality. The article details how Twain's sardonic humor was rooted in personal pain, including a fear of poverty that fueled his adult life despite his literary success. Chernow's work traces Twain's journey from a mischievous boy in Missouri to a global icon who helped define the American identity. The biography delves into themes of money, politics, and race that are still resonant today, portraying Twain as a vital and multifaceted figure in American culture.</p>

          <h2>Filmmaker Ken Burns Criticizes Proposed Funding Cuts to Public Broadcasting</h2>

          <p>Renowned documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has described the proposed elimination of federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as "shortsighted" and "misguided." His comments come as the White House targets public media entities like PBS and NPR, claiming they spread radical propaganda. Burns, whose films have been a staple of PBS for decades, argues that the move is based on a false perception of public media as a left-wing entity. He emphasized that PBS provides essential services, especially to rural areas, including children's programming, educational content, and emergency information.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders are urgently attempting to secure a trade agreement with Washington before a looming deadline for potential 50% tariffs threatened by the Trump administration. The article highlights a significant internal split, with Germany advocating for a quick deal to prevent a trade war, while France prefers to hold out for more favorable terms. The uncertainty has caused significant disruption to the global economy, and EU officials are now bracing for at least a baseline 10% tariff on exports to the US, regardless of the outcome of the talks.

          <p>Fifty years after its premiere, the cast and crew of "Jaws" are reflecting on the notoriously difficult production that created a Hollywood blockbuster and changed cinema forever. Actor Richard Dreyfuss recalls the challenging shoot on the open seas and his initial belief that the film would be a failure, largely due to the malfunctioning mechanical shark. The article details how director Steven Spielberg, then only 27, turned these adversities into opportunities, creating suspense that terrified audiences. Despite on-set tensions and a spiraling budget, the film became a cultural phenomenon that ushered in the era of the summer blockbuster.</p>

          <p>Stephen Miran, Chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, has indicated that the deadline for new U.S. tariffs could be extended for countries negotiating trade deals in good faith. As President Trump's July 9 deadline approaches with few deals finalized, Miran suggested that nations making necessary concessions might see their date rolled back. However, he warned that countries not negotiating seriously could face higher tariffs. This approach introduces flexibility into the administration's hardline stance, although it remains uncertain which specific nations, such as those in Europe or India, might receive an extension.

          <p>Economists are predicting that the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration could significantly slow the U.S. job market and overall economic growth. The end of the previous administration's immigration surge is expected to lower the number of jobs needed to keep unemployment stable, with some forecasts suggesting a drop to as low as 50,000 per month. While White House officials argue that native-born workers and new tax incentives will fill any labor gaps, many economists, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, warn that a shrinking labor force will inevitably diminish economic expansion.

          <p>According to former NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad, significant staffing cuts at the agency have compromised the United States' ability to accurately predict severe weather events. He stated that many weather forecast offices are operating without a full staff, placing an extra burden on existing employees and potentially degrading forecast quality. While not directly blaming the cuts for the lack of warning in the recent deadly Texas floods, Spinrad warned that predictions for hurricanes, tornadoes, and other natural disasters will inevitably degrade without adequate research and staffing.

          <p>The head of London's Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, has argued that football clubs should contribute to the £70 million annual cost of policing their matches in the UK. Citing overstretched funding, Rowley suggested a "polluter pays approach," where event organizers requiring police support help cover the expense rather than diverting resources from local communities. The commissioner's comments were part of a broader call for radical police reform, including consolidating the 43 forces in England and Wales into a smaller number of larger, more efficient bodies to better manage resources.</p>

          <p>An opinion article analyzes China's long-standing goal of rebalancing its economy by boosting domestic demand, a move gaining urgency amid faltering global demand and geopolitical shifts. While Premier Li Qiang has recently emphasized this pivot, the transition faces significant challenges. The piece notes that imports have declined and household savings remain high, indicating uneven and cautious consumer confidence. Structural factors, such as a limited social safety net and concerns over healthcare and retirement costs, continue to suppress widespread spending despite recent rises in disposable income.

A few hours later, it attacked a 53-year-old farmer who was sleeping outdoors, leading to a struggle before police scared the animal away. The farmer was hospitalized with wounds to his head, shoulder, and legs, and the lion was later found and killed by authorities.</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic shift, Russia has officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, becoming the first country to do so since the group's return to power in 2021. The Taliban's foreign minister welcomed the decision as the start of a "new phase of positive relations." Experts suggest Russia's motives are likely economic, aiming to establish Afghanistan as a trade hub to Asia and bypass Western sanctions. The move is expected to pressure other nations, particularly authoritarian states, to follow suit, while human rights activists fear it validates the Taliban's oppressive policies, especially against women.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace's participation in the Europa League is in doubt due to complications arising from its majority shareholder John Textor's multi-club ownership network. UEFA rules prevent clubs with the same decisive influence from competing in the same tournament, and Textor also owns French club Lyon, who also qualified. The outcome hinges on a French football authority hearing regarding Lyon's finances, which could see them relinquish their European spot. The situation is further complicated by Textor's pending sale of his Palace shares to New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, creating significant uncertainty for the club.</p>

          <p>Critics and analysts are warning that President Trump is overseeing a significant expansion of presidential power that is undermining democratic checks and balances. The article details a series of unilateral actions, including ordering a military strike on Iran without congressional approval, imposing tariffs via national emergency declarations, and taking control of a state's National Guard. These moves, combined with pressure on the Justice Department and defiance of judicial orders, are seen as setting dangerous precedents. While supporters dismiss fears of an autocracy, experts argue that partisan loyalty is preventing effective oversight and eroding long-standing constitutional norms.</p>

          <p>Five months into his second term, the U.S. economy under President Trump has not experienced the golden age he promised nor the catastrophe critics predicted, according to this analysis. Key indicators like unemployment and inflation have remained relatively stable, with modest GDP growth. The article argues that Trump's policies, including moderated tariffs and tax cut extensions, have not been significant enough to cause a major shift in either direction. While long-term fundamentals may be at risk, the short-term reality is an economy that is simply "okay," which may not be sufficient for voters who remain unhappy with their financial situation.

However, the critic argues that its overly serious tone and on-the-nose evangelism make it unlikely to resonate beyond its core Christian audience. The piece contrasts it with more successful biblical adaptations like "The Prince of Egypt," which succeeded through stronger character-driven drama.</p>

This speculation is fueled by the primary victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York City's mayoral race and widespread voter anger at current party leadership. The article suggests a growing divide between establishment Democrats and a progressive base that wants a stronger focus on working-class economic issues.

Commissioned by a Left Party lawmaker, the report states that most international law experts believe the criteria for self-defense under the UN Charter were not met. The analysis argues that Israel would need to prove an imminent threat of a nuclear attack, not just the possession of nuclear material. The findings contrast with the German government's official support for the strikes, creating a point of internal political and legal debate.</p>
