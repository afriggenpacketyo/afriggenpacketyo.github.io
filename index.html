            <p>Elaine and Graeme Winn, a British couple from Leicestershire, were among the four fatalities in a cable car crash near Naples. The cable car cabin plummeted after a supporting cable snapped, prompting a criminal investigation into the incident. The cable car operator claimed a recent safety inspection had been passed just two weeks prior to the accident. Ten people were rescued from a second cabin, and authorities are investigating whether strong winds contributed to the crash, as the service had been suspended due to adverse weather just days before.</p>

            <p>Kenni Burns, former Kent State coach, is under investigation for allegedly accepting over $100,000 in loans from a school booster who was also a vendor.

An independent investigation found no evidence Burns paid interest on the loans, potentially violating state ethics laws. Burns was fired on April 11 after being placed on administrative leave in March, with Kent State providing no public explanation for either action.</p>

            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, lasting from Saturday evening to Sunday midnight, citing humanitarian grounds. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized the announcement as a manipulative tactic, pointing to ongoing Russian drone strikes. This announcement follows failed attempts at Easter ceasefires in previous years and comes amid frustrations from the Trump administration regarding the pace of peace talks. Simultaneously, Russia and Ukraine conducted a prisoner exchange, mediated by the United Arab Emirates, marking the largest exchange since the invasion.</p>

His death, struck by a tram while contemplating the Sagrada Família, symbolizes his mission to find meaning in an industrialized world.

            <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportations of Venezuelans detained in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The court's order directs the Trump administration to cease removals until further notice, following concerns raised by the ACLU about due process violations. The ACLU argued that immigration authorities were attempting to deport Venezuelans without providing a fair opportunity to challenge their removal. This action highlights ongoing legal battles over immigration policy and the use of wartime laws.</p>

            <p>Scientists claim to have discovered a "new colour," dubbed "olo," a saturated shade of blue-green, through laser stimulation of specific retinal cells. Participants in the experiment reported witnessing a colour more intense than any seen in the real world. The research, published in Science Advances, may have implications for understanding colour blindness. However, some experts argue the perception of a new colour is open to interpretation, suggesting it may be a variation of existing colour perception.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced plans to make it easier to fire thousands of federal workers by stripping them of civil service protections and reclassifying them as "at-will" employees. The proposed "Schedule Policy/Career" classification would affect approximately 50,000 federal workers, aiming to improve accountability and efficiency. Critics express concern about potential political influence and the erosion of job security for career government employees. This move is seen as an effort to align the federal workforce with the president's policy agenda.</p>
