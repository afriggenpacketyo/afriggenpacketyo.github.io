          <p>Researchers in Beijing have developed a new genome editing system, programmable chromosome engineering (PCE), which significantly improves upon older methods. Published in the journal Cell, this technology allows for the precise and efficient editing of very large DNA fragments, ranging from thousands to millions of bases, in higher organisms like plants. This breakthrough is expected to accelerate advancements in crop trait improvement and offer new avenues for treating genetic diseases. The Chinese Academy of Sciences also notes its potential to speed up the development of artificial chromosomes, a key component in the emerging field of synthetic biology.</p>

          <p>Shanghai's nighttime economy is experiencing a significant boost, largely driven by the passion of Gen Z for live theater performances. Young residents are spending a substantial portion of their income on attending multiple shows per week, socializing, and collecting memorabilia. This trend aligns with the city government's "Night Economy 2.0" initiative, which aims to stimulate domestic consumption by simplifying event approvals and enriching cultural offerings. The government sees this as a crucial strategy to counteract economic deflationary pressures and boost demand amid ongoing trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European leaders from the UK, France, Germany, and other nations have issued a joint statement insisting that any peace negotiations between the U.S. and Russia must include Ukraine. The statement comes ahead of a planned summit in Alaska between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, where Trump has suggested potential territorial exchanges could be discussed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has firmly rejected any agreements made without Kyiv's participation, calling them "dead decisions." European allies are concerned about being excluded from talks that directly impact their security and have reaffirmed their support for Ukraine.</p>

The Palestinian Football Association reported that al-Obeid was shot and killed by Israeli forces while waiting for humanitarian aid in Gaza. Salah, who has consistently advocated for humanitarian access to Gaza, has been joined by other football figures in speaking out about the conflict.</p>

Urakawa passed away on Saturday after being knocked out in an August 2nd fight. His death follows that of another boxer, Shigetoshi Kotari, who died on Friday from injuries sustained in a separate bout on the same fight card. Both athletes had undergone surgery for subdural hematomas, a condition involving bleeding between the skull and the brain, highlighting the severe risks of the sport.</p>

          <p>This article pays tribute to former Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota, who tragically died in a car accident in early July. It highlights his profound humility and deep connection to his roots, recounting how he remained in his youth team dormitory even after joining the senior side because he considered the caretaker his family. Described as "an ordinary boy in a world of superstars," Jota was known for his generosity, such as asking for charity donations instead of wedding gifts. The piece remembers him as a person who valued honesty and never forgot those who supported him.</p>

          <p>Wang Xingxing, the founder of Chinese robotics firm Unitree, predicts that robotics could experience its "ChatGPT moment" within the next two to three years. He defines this milestone as a robot being able to perform a complex task, like cleaning a room, in a completely new and unfamiliar environment for the first time. Speaking at the World Robot Conference in Beijing, Wang expressed doubts about the capability of current models to achieve this. He suggested that alternative approaches, such as generative "world models" like Google's Genie 3, might have a higher probability of success in advanced robot motion control.</p>

          <p>The murder of Alexandra Pennig, a 32-year-old nurse found shot in her apartment, was solved thanks to a small piece of a bathroom door lock. Initially, Matthew Ecker, who was with Pennig, claimed she had locked herself in the bathroom and died by suicide before he broke the door down. However, investigators found a broken piece of the door's lock mechanism underneath Pennig's body. This discovery indicated the door was forced open before she was shot, leading detectives to conclude Ecker broke in and then killed her. Ecker was subsequently convicted of second-degree murder.</p>

          <p>Officials in Los Angeles are making an urgent plea to residents of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills to cease all water usage, including flushing toilets, due to a major service disruption. The outage, affecting about 9,200 households, began when a critical water control valve broke, and has been complicated by a regional heatwave. Although some service has been restored, authorities warn that continued consumption is depleting pressure in a 10-million-gallon tank, delaying full repairs. A subsequent blowout of a temporary pipe has further complicated efforts to restore the system.</p>

          <p>Northern China, including Beijing, has once again been struck by severe and deadly flooding during its traditional rainy season in July and August. This year's disaster marks the fifth major flooding event in the region since 2012, raising questions about its frequency and severity. The recent storms are noted as unusual because they primarily impacted the northern parts of the capital. This contrasts with the severe floods that occurred in 2016 and 2023, which were concentrated in the southern areas of Beijing, indicating a shift in the affected geography.</p>

Furthermore, significant delays in the reconstruction of the Camp Nou stadium mean his debut will be at the small training ground stadium.

          <p>This opinion article by Simon Tisdall argues that the world is moving closer to nuclear catastrophe with a concerning lack of public opposition. The piece points to Russia's withdrawal from the INF treaty and its development of new hypersonic missiles, as well as the corresponding buildup of NATO's nuclear-capable forces in Europe. Tisdall notes that unlike the massive anti-nuclear protests of the 1980s, the current arms race is met with an "eerie silence." He warns that the collapse of arms-control agreements and the view of nuclear weapons as offensive tools are creating an unprecedentedly dangerous global environment.</p>

Key barriers include a lack of childcare, difficulties with the recognition of foreign qualifications, and the need for strong language skills for female-dominated fields.
