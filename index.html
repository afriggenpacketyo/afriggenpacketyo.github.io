        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines will cut 35 daily flights from Newark Liberty International Airport's schedule, beginning this weekend, after experiencing significant flight disruptions. CEO Scott Kirby cited air traffic controller staffing shortages and FAA technology problems as the primary causes for the delays, impacting thousands of passengers. Kirby mentioned that 20% of Newark's air traffic controllers had recently left their positions following multiple technology failures. The airline is urging the FAA to more strictly manage airport capacity to mitigate the impact of these ongoing staffing and infrastructure issues on travelers. Optimism surrounding this situation is low given the immediate impact to travelers and the difficulty in resolving staffing and technological challenges. </p>

          <p>In a BBC interview, Prince Harry conveyed his deep frustration over security arrangements in the UK and the resulting strain on his relationship with his father, King Charles. Harry revealed that his father is not speaking to him due to the security dispute, and expressed concern about the limited time he may have left with his father, who is battling cancer. He highlighted the lack of contact between his children and their wider family in the UK, stating he is "gutted" and "devastated" by the situation. Despite these grievances, Harry emphasized his desire for reconciliation and called on his father, the prime minister, and the home secretary to intervene and resolve the security issue, which he views as the main obstacle to healing family rifts.</p>

          <p>The Three Brothers Diner in Danbury, Connecticut, a family-run business for 50 years, is facing economic uncertainty due to declining consumer sentiment. Owner Stanley Kallivrousis has observed a decrease in customer traffic and changes in eating habits, with people sharing meals and taking leftovers home. Despite these challenges, the diner remains a community hub, supported by loyal customers. While the price of food has remained steady, Kallivrousis has paused expansion plans, and some cooks have left for more flexible work in the gig economy.</p>

          <p>The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) has issued a warning about potential measles exposure at Chicago O'Hare International Airport following two confirmed cases in Cook County. One of the individuals traveled internationally through O'Hare in April, prompting health officials to list specific dates and locations within the airport where exposure may have occurred. The IDPH urges individuals to ensure they are fully vaccinated with two doses of the MMR vaccine, especially before international travel. Health officials emphasize that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles, as misinformation has contributed to declining vaccination rates and recent outbreaks.</p>

          <p>A review of the remake of Françoise Sagan's "Bonjour Tristesse" notes that while the film captures the dreamy seaside setting and attractive cast, it suffers from an over-intellectualization of motive, which undercuts the narrative's briskness. The director's effort to dig deeper into the characters' circumstances results in dialogue that feels clinical rather than revelatory. Chloë Sevigny's performance is praised for embodying emotional susceptibility, but overall, the film's turmoil is not fully felt despite its well-made nature.</p>

          <p>Senator John Fetterman's former chief of staff, Adam Jentleson, wrote to a doctor expressing concern about the senator's erratic behavior and potential backsliding in his mental health recovery. The letter, obtained by The New York Times, detailed observations of "warning signs" and concerns about Fetterman's adherence to his medical plan. Fetterman has responded by stating that his actual doctors and family have affirmed that he is very well and called the New York magazine article a "hit piece."</p>

          <p>Puerto Rico has voluntarily dismissed its 2024 climate lawsuit against big oil, just days after the U.S. Justice Department sued two states over similar litigation. The lawsuit alleged that oil and gas giants misled the public about the climate dangers associated with their products. The filing did not list a reason for the dismissal, but it comes amid attacks on climate-accountability litigation and pressure from pro-fossil fuel groups.</p>

Researchers at Centivax combined two antibodies from Friede's blood with a drug that blocks neurotoxins, protecting mice from the venom of 19 deadly snake species.</p>
