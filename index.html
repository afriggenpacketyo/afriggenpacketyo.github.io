          <p>An aesthetic beautician in County Durham has apologized after leaving multiple women seriously ill by injecting them with an illegal Botox-type product called Toxpia. One victim was left fighting for her life and required resuscitation after developing botulism, a rare but life-threatening condition. The beautician, who was not properly licensed to use the product, had told clients it was a "new type of Botox." An investigation by the UK Health Security Agency is now underway, prompting warnings for consumers to verify their practitioners' qualifications and the legality of the products being used.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell has been controversially called up to the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia as a replacement for an injured player. His selection marks a significant return to the international stage after a nearly two-year absence from Test rugby. The decision is considered controversial because Farrell has not played competitively in nine weeks following a concussion. Critics point out that other in-form players who have been actively training with their national squads were overlooked in his favor.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have narrowly advanced President Trump's signature legislative package, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," after a prolonged late-night procedural vote. The nearly 1,000-page bill proposes a major realignment of the federal government, extending tax cuts while also redirecting funds from social programs and clean energy toward immigration enforcement and national defense. Leadership is now pushing for a final passage vote before a self-imposed July 4th deadline, despite ongoing divisions within the Republican party over the bill's contents and financial impact.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An upcoming U.S. jobs report is expected to show that hiring slowed in June, a potential consequence of economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's widespread tariffs. Forecasters anticipate the addition of 110,000 jobs, a decline from the previous month, as businesses navigate the new trade landscape. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring this data, with Chairman Jerome Powell signaling a potential willingness to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy, though he remains wary of tariff-induced "stagflation," where inflation rises as economic growth slows.

          <p>A federal jury delivered a mixed verdict for hip-hop mogul Sean Combs, acquitting him of serious racketeering and sex trafficking charges but finding him guilty of two lesser counts of transportation for prostitution. While a legal win for the defense, the trial has permanently damaged his reputation and brand, following months of disturbing allegations and the leak of a video showing him physically assaulting his former girlfriend. The article suggests that despite the verdict, the graphic details revealed in court and dozens of pending civil lawsuits leave his future uncertain.</p>

          <p>New research using continuous glucose monitors has identified a pattern in some people called being a glucose "dipper," where blood sugar crashes two to three hours after a meal. These dips are linked to increased fatigue, mood changes, and consuming hundreds of extra calories throughout the day, potentially hindering weight loss. To prevent these crashes, experts recommend strategies like never eating carbohydrates alone, instead pairing them with protein, fat, and fiber to stabilize blood sugar levels and maintain energy.</p>

          <p>Unlike in 2017 when they vocally opposed similar measures, Republican governors are now remaining notably silent as Congress moves to pass historic cuts to Medicaid. The proposed legislation would create multi-billion dollar holes in their state budgets and reduce coverage for millions, yet few red-state governors are speaking out against it. This silence provides crucial political cover for GOP lawmakers from their states who are supporting the bill, marking a significant shift in the political landscape surrounding healthcare policy.</p>
