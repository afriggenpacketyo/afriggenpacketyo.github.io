          <p>An explosion at a bar in Madrid, Spain, injured at least 25 people, with two in serious condition. The incident occurred at the "Mis Tesoros" bar in the Puente de Vallecas district. While initial reports suggested a gas leak as the cause, authorities are still investigating and have ruled out the possibility of more victims trapped under rubble. Residents of the nine housing units in the building will be rehoused due to the building's instability, as the entrance area is severely damaged and inaccessible. The chief firefighter noted that some upper apartments remained undamaged, but access is impossible. The situation is being closely monitored as investigations continue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Thai government has lifted a decades-long ban on working rights for long-term refugees from Myanmar residing in nine camps near the border. This decision comes as the United States has cut humanitarian aid programs, previously being the largest funder of food aid for these displaced individuals. Charities managing foreign food aid were compelled to cancel rations for most refugees due to these cuts, exacerbated by an influx of new refugees from the civil war in Myanmar. The Thai government's move aims to enable refugees to support themselves and their families, with the UN Refugee Agency welcoming it as a potential regional benchmark. The policy shift is viewed as a turning point that will stimulate the local economy.</p>

          <p>Ursula von der Leyen highlighted the story of Sasha, a Ukrainian boy taken to a "filtration camp" by Russian soldiers, during her State of the Union address. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Russia has allegedly abducted tens of thousands of Ukrainian children, placing them in orphanages or adoptive families. The Ukrainian government has made the return of these children a prerequisite for ceasefire negotiations, though Russia denies these allegations. Despite mounting international pressure, conflicting figures on the number of children involved and the means of their relocation complicate the matter. Efforts to repatriate the children are ongoing, with Save Ukraine helping to bring back dozens each month.</p>

          <p>Russian and Belarusian forces have commenced the joint military exercise "Zapad 2025" amid rising regional tensions. The exercises, held every four years, involve significant military activity near key European borders, simulating potential conflict scenarios. While reports indicate fewer troops involved compared to the 2021 edition, neighboring NATO members are on high alert, especially following a recent Russian drone incursion into Poland. Poland has responded by closing its border with Belarus and initiating its own military exercises, while Lithuania has increased its border presence. The exercise takes place in the immediate aftermath of a Russian drone incursion into Poland.</p>

          <p>The FBI is offering a $100,000 reward for information on a man who allegedly fired a gun at officers during an immigration sweep at a Camarillo pot farm. The raid, which targeted Glass House Farms, resulted in over 300 arrests and the death of a worker trying to evade capture. Protests erupted at the scene, leading to clashes with immigration agents, and one protester has already been charged with assaulting agents. The FBI emphasizes that it does not investigate First Amendment-protected activity, but will pursue those who assault law enforcement officers. The raids shook up the state's cannabis industry.</p>

          <p>Lawyers and advocates express concern that approximately 1,000 Central American children in the U.S. are at risk of being deported to dangerous situations before their immigration court proceedings conclude. The U.S. government is reportedly expanding its list of children from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador for potential removal. A federal judge temporarily blocked a flight to Guatemala after 76 children were removed from shelters without notifying their parents. Attorneys argue that U.S. officials lack the authority to remove these children without allowing them to have their asylum cases heard. The legal battle continues, with lawyers seeking to extend the emergency order to protect children from other countries.</p>

          <p>Before appointing Lord Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the US, Prime Minister Keir Starmer questioned him about his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Starmer sent three questions via his chief of staff, addressing Mandelson's continued contact with Epstein after his conviction, reports of staying at Epstein's home while the financier was imprisoned, and association with a charity backed by Ghislaine Maxwell. Mandelson's responses were initially deemed sufficient, but new emails revealed supportive messages sent to Epstein after his guilty plea, leading to Mandelson's dismissal. The controversy has raised questions about Starmer's judgment and the extent of his knowledge regarding Mandelson's relationship with Epstein.</p>

          <p>Major political parties in Nepal have demanded the reinstatement of the parliament dissolved by the president following deadly anti-corruption protests. The parties argue that President Ram Chandra Poudel acted unconstitutionally. The dissolution was a key demand from the protest movement, but the parties believe the protesters' demands should be addressed through a democratically elected institution. President Poudel urged restraint and called for elections. The protests were triggered by a ban on social media platforms and have widened to encompass deeper discontent with Nepal's political elite.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum to NATO allies, stating that the US will impose "major" sanctions on Russia only when they agree to do the same and cease buying Russian oil. He also called on NATO countries to significantly increase tariffs on China. Trump criticized NATO for its less than 100% commitment to ending the war in Ukraine. The president has repeatedly previewed additional sanctions on Russia and has already doubled tariffs on India, which purchases oil from Russia. It remains uncertain whether NATO countries will comply with these demands.</p>
