          <p>The UK government has delayed its planned reforms for the Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (Send) system until 2026, pushing back its Schools White Paper. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated the delay allows for a "period of co-creation" to test proposals with parents and experts. While advocacy groups expressed frustration over the continued uncertainty for families, they also acknowledged the importance of taking time to make the right decisions for a system that has been described as being in crisis.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted its eighth airstrike on an alleged drug cartel vessel since early September, with the latest incident occurring in the Pacific Ocean. According to officials, the strike resulted in the deaths of the two to three people aboard, bringing the total number of individuals killed in these operations to at least 34. This marks a geographical expansion from the previous seven strikes, which all took place in the Caribbean Sea, and continues a controversial policy of using lethal military force for drug interdiction.</p>

The woman, Burcu Yesilyurt, stated she was trying to act responsibly by not spilling the liquid on the bus she was about to board. After the incident gained significant media attention, Richmond-Upon-Thames Council reviewed the case and rescinded the fine, acknowledging the contravention was minor and apologizing for the inconvenience caused.</p>

          <p>Alphabet, Google's parent company, is contributing $22 million towards the construction of a new White House ballroom as part of a legal settlement with Donald Trump. The settlement stems from Trump's ban from the YouTube platform following the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. This contribution covers nearly 10% of the estimated $250 million cost for the project, which has drawn public criticism following the demolition of parts of the White House's East Wing to accommodate the new structure.</p>

          <p>A new study from investment firm Schroders reveals that 90% of working Americans plan to claim Social Security benefits before the maximum age of 70, despite this strategy ensuring higher monthly payments. Many respondents understand the financial trade-offs but cite immediate financial need and concerns about the program's long-term solvency as reasons for filing early. This trend contradicts common financial advice, which often recommends delaying benefits to maximize lifetime income, highlighting a disconnect between optimal strategy and the financial realities many retirees face.</p>

          <p>A significant increase in consumer electricity bills is being partly attributed to the growing energy demand from new data centers built to power the artificial intelligence industry. For the first time in two decades, overall energy demand is rising as efficiency gains are outpaced by the proliferation of these energy-intensive facilities. The article suggests that speculation by tech companies, who may be securing power from multiple utilities for data centers that might not be built, could lead to normal customers bearing the cost of unnecessary infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Shares of Beyond Meat saw a dramatic reversal, slashing massive gains and briefly turning negative after a multi-day surge driven by meme stock traders. The rally began after the plant-based food company was added to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, triggering a short squeeze. Despite soaring over 100% at one point, the stock's volatility highlights the speculative and unstable nature of such trading phenomena. The company's stock has been under long-term pressure, having fallen significantly since its 2019 public debut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walmart is pausing its hiring of job candidates who require H-1B visas, a decision that follows the Trump administration's move to increase the application fee for these skilled worker visas to $100,000. The policy change by the nation's largest private employer reflects how corporate strategies are adapting to the administration's stricter immigration and labor policies. While Walmart primarily uses H-1B visas for a small number of corporate roles, the pause illustrates the broader impact of the fee hike, which business groups argue will harm U.S. competitiveness.</p>

This order is the latest development in Zuma's extensive legal battles related to corruption charges that have followed him since his presidency, which ended in 2018.</p>
