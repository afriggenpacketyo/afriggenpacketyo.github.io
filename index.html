        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reports that nearly 13 million people have been displaced in West and Central Africa due to a combination of conflict, climate shocks, and migration trends, creating a "perfect storm" of mass displacement. Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Cameroon host about 80% of the internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the region, with drought, flooding, violence, and insecurity forcing people to seek shelter elsewhere. While the UN has been sponsoring voluntary returns, repatriation efforts are hampered by political crises and budget cuts, leading to reduced humanitarian aid and increased fragility for displaced people. The IOM notes that economic needs are also a key driver of migration, and migrants often face dangerous routes due to efforts to stem migration to Europe.</p>

          <p>Pop Mart International Group's shares experienced a significant drop in Hong Kong after the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party of China, criticized the company's blind box business model. The newspaper warned against the addictive nature of these collectibles, which involve sealed packaging that encourages frequent repeat purchases to obtain rare items. Legal experts and academics cited in the article described these products as "business traps" exploiting unpredictable rewards, particularly affecting minors with limited self-control. Chinese authorities had previously banned the sale of blind boxes to children under eight in 2023 to curb addiction, signaling increasing regulatory scrutiny of this popular business model.</p>

          <p>UK retail sales experienced a notable decline in May, falling at the fastest pace in over a year, according to official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Sales volumes dropped by 2.7%, marking the largest monthly fall since December 2023, with supermarkets reporting a particularly "dismal" month. Food retailers saw reduced sales of alcohol and tobacco as households cut back on spending, while clothing and household goods stores also reported "slow trading". Separate data indicated that government borrowing increased last month, reaching the second-highest level for May since monthly records began in 1993.</p>

This commitment was conveyed during a meeting between Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong and US Ambassador to China David Perdue in Beijing. Wang emphasized the need for "mutual respect" from Washington and expressed hope that the US would uphold an attitude of equality and address each other's concerns. Last year, both countries held meetings to discuss closer cooperation, establishing anti-drug hotlines for information sharing, and Perdue expressed his willingness to promote US-China relations and advance cooperation in law enforcement areas.</p>

          <p>Right-wing populists harbor animosity towards cities due to their liberal elites, immigrants, net-zero policies, left-wing activists, globalized businesses, and outspoken municipal leaders. Populists often draw support from conservative, less privileged areas and view cities as symbols of a future that challenges their traditional values. This animosity is evident in actions like Donald Trump's administration targeting Los Angeles and the imprisonment of Istanbul's mayor, as well as threats against municipal figures like London's mayor. The right's insistence that cities have been ruined by liberals ignores the political complexity and potential for urban conservatism.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has expressed disappointment with the Ninth Circuit Court's decision to allow President Trump to maintain control of the California National Guard, while also claiming a victory in the court's rejection of Trump's assertion of unlimited authority. Newsom emphasized that the court rejected Trump's claim that he can federalize the National Guard at will without judicial oversight. The ruling stems from Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles to quell riots during demonstrations against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a move Newsom criticized as an authoritarian overreach.</p>

The Buffalo Bicycle's heavy-gauge steel frame is durable in rough terrain, reducing the need for frequent repairs. CHEWs using the bicycles reported a 108% increase in households reached each week, and the time to reach health facilities dropped by nearly half.</p>

          <p>Kyodo News reports that 87 Japanese nationals and their family members have been evacuated from Iran and Israel amid rising tensions in the Middle East. Japan's core consumer prices rose by 3.7% in May, driven by surging rice costs, marking the largest increase in over two years. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba will visit the Netherlands for a NATO summit to deepen Japan's partnership with the alliance. A member of the pop group Tokio has been removed from a TV show due to past conduct breaches, and figure skater Kaori Sakamoto plans to retire after the Olympics.

The network's president declined to provide further details on the cases, citing privacy concerns.

          <p>A US appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump can continue to control National Guard troops in Los Angeles, despite objections from California's governor. The court stated that Trump's administration presented a defensible rationale for deploying the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property. This ruling halts a lower court's decision that ordered Trump to return control of California's National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom. Newsom criticized Trump's decision to send troops to LA to quell anti-immigration protests, calling it an authoritarian move.</p>

Qiushi, the partyâ€™s theoretical journal, said that recent affirmations of the need for frugality in official meals are intended to limit extravagant practices, not ordinary dining. Some local governments were scrutinizing every meal gathering and intervening in every banquet, which was derailing their original intention and bringing unnecessary shocks to the catering industry.</p>

This has renewed discussions about the U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed Golden Dome multi-layered missile defense system, a costly project aimed at defending the U.S. from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles. Private space companies, facing budget cuts at NASA, are vying for a piece of the project's pie, especially after Elon Musk's recent public feud with Trump left SpaceX's potential role in the scheme under question. The House Appropriations Committee unveiled the draft of its fiscal 2026 defense spending bill that features a $13 billion allocation for "missile defense and space programs to augment and integrate in support of the Golden Dome effort."
