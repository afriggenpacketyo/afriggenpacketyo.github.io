          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 14:15:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent NIH-funded study suggests that manual acupuncture can be an effective treatment for chronic low back pain in adults, offering an alternative to opioids. The "BackInAction" trial, involving 800 older adults, found that participants receiving acupuncture reported greater reductions in pain-related disability and intensity compared to those receiving only usual medical care. This traditional Chinese medicine technique, which involves inserting fine needles into the skin, has more than doubled in use among American adults over the past two decades, with many seeking it for pain relief and its favorable safety profile. The findings suggest it works as well as more familiar treatments for pain management.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's captain, Martin Odegaard, has set a new Premier League record by being substituted before halftime in three consecutive starts, highlighting a frustrating, injury-plagued start to his season. The 26-year-old Norwegian midfielder was withdrawn just 30 minutes into the match against West Ham due to a knee-to-knee collision, following earlier substitutions for a recurring shoulder issue. Manager Mikel Arteta expressed concern over the captain's latest injury, noting his importance to the team's attacking capabilities. The series of early exits underscores the physical challenges Odegaard has faced, limiting his impact on the field.</p>

          <p>The pharmacy chain Rite Aid has announced on its website that all of its store locations have now closed, ending decades of operation. This development follows the company's second bankruptcy filing in nearly two years, with the first occurring in October 2023. Since that initial filing, Rite Aid has closed over 520 pharmacies, representing about a quarter of its stores at the time. The company has been grappling with significant debt, declining sales, and litigation related to the opioid crisis, including a Justice Department complaint for unlawfully filling prescriptions.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 drivers are split on the use of a new driver-cooling system ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix, which has been declared a "heat hazard" due to extreme temperature and humidity. Red Bull's Max Verstappen criticized the system, stating he will not use the cooling vest and opposes plans to make it mandatory, citing discomfort and flawed design. In contrast, Mercedes' George Russell plans to use the vest, noting his team has made improvements to mitigate cockpit heat. The debate highlights the physical demands of racing in such conditions and the challenge of implementing effective safety measures without compromising driver preference or performance.</p>

          <p>In Tbilisi, Georgia, police deployed water cannons and pepper spray against tens of thousands of protesters who attempted to storm the presidential palace during a municipal election. The demonstrations were a response to what critics describe as the ruling Georgian Dream party's repressive policies and a shift away from democratic values towards Russian influence. Protesters, carrying Georgian and EU flags, expressed their desire for the country to join the European Union, a goal the government has stalled. The unrest reflects widespread frustration over the jailing of opposition figures and a crackdown on dissent.</p>

          <p>Populist billionaire Andrej Babiš and his ANO movement have won the Czech parliamentary election, signaling a potential political shift for the country. With nearly all votes counted, ANO captured 35% of the vote, defeating the pro-Western coalition led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala. This result marks a political comeback for Babiš and may align the Czech Republic more closely with the pro-Russian stances of neighboring Hungary and Slovakia, particularly concerning support for Ukraine. Babiš could form a majority government by partnering with anti-migrant and right-wing parties that also secured seats in parliament.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department is considering a design for a $1 coin to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary, featuring former President Donald Trump. A draft design, shared by U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach, shows Trump with a clenched fist under an American flag with the words "fight, fight, fight," referencing his defiant response after surviving an assassination attempt. While a Treasury spokesperson stated the design is not final, they noted it reflects the country's enduring spirit. The proposal comes as polls indicate low approval ratings for Trump, with a majority believing he has worsened the national economy.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) has installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, a significant milestone for the predominantly white denomination. Curry, 53, succeeds the Rev.

His election is seen as a hopeful step toward greater inclusivity in a church that is over 95% white but has been investing in multicultural ministries. As leader, Curry will navigate challenges common to mainline Protestant denominations, including declining membership and ongoing theological debates.</p>

Despite calls from ministers to postpone the event following a recent deadly synagogue attack in Manchester, organizers proceeded with the demonstration. The majority of arrests were for supporting a proscribed organization, with police deploying 1,500 officers to manage the event in Trafalgar Square. An Amnesty International UK spokesperson criticized the arrests as a breach of human rights obligations, while Jewish community leaders described the protest's timing as "phenomenally tone deaf."</p>

          <p>Amid the ongoing government shutdown, Democrats are actively refuting Republican claims that their funding proposals include "free healthcare for illegals." Democratic leaders like Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries have clarified that federal law already prohibits using funds from programs like Medicaid and the ACA for undocumented immigrants, and they are not seeking to change this. Instead, their bill aims to reverse cuts to Medicaid eligibility for lawfully present noncitizens, such as refugees and asylum seekers, which were enacted under a recent Trump-era law. This political messaging battle highlights the different priorities of each party.</p>

The shutdown is also seen by some as an opportunity for Trump to advance his goal of deconstructing the administrative state.

The regulator stated the death was a preventable tragedy, and since the incident, measures have been implemented across the industry to secure or remove these types of windows.</p>

          <p>A senior White House official, Anthony Salisbury, accidentally revealed plans to deploy the U.S. Army's elite 82nd Airborne Division to Portland, Oregon. The leak occurred when Salisbury was observed using the Signal messaging app in a public space, with messages showing discussions with a senior adviser to the Secretary of Defense about the deployment. The conversation suggested the Defense Secretary wanted direct orders from President Trump for "top cover" due to the likely controversy of using a top-tier military unit for domestic purposes. The White House confirmed the official's identity but claimed no classified information was revealed.</p>

          <p>U.S. stock markets demonstrated resilience, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reaching new record highs this week despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. The rally was largely driven by strong performances in the healthcare and technology sectors, with life sciences and pharmaceutical stocks surging after a tariff exemption deal. The artificial intelligence trade also continued to boost tech stocks and utilities, which benefit from the increased power demands of data centers. The market's positive performance suggests investors have largely dismissed the shutdown as a non-event for the economy's immediate future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel has deported 137 international activists to Turkey after intercepting the Global Sumud Flotilla, which was attempting to deliver aid and break the maritime blockade of Gaza. The flotilla, which included nearly 50 vessels, was intercepted in international waters, an action condemned by Turkey as a breach of international law. The interception and detentions have sparked large-scale protests in support of the activists and Palestinians in major cities across Europe. This event occurs as diplomatic efforts continue, with Hamas recently responding positively to a U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal aimed at ending the ongoing war.</p>

The U.S., under Donald Trump's influence, is pursuing a more privatized, lightly regulated model for stablecoins, which some economists fear could lead to a future crash. In contrast, Europe is moving towards a central bank digital currency, while the UK is attempting to find a middle ground. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has been named as a potential key figure in a U.S.-led peace plan for post-war Gaza, a suggestion that has drawn significant criticism. According to the proposal, Blair could serve on a "Board of Peace" overseeing a new technocratic government in the territory. However, his legacy in the region is controversial, stemming from his role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and his subsequent eight-year tenure as a Middle East envoy, which many Palestinians viewed as ineffective and biased towards Israel. Critics argue his involvement would be counterproductive.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the prosecution of Kilmar Ábrego García on human-smuggling charges may constitute illegal retaliation by the Department of Justice. The judge granted a hearing to determine if the charges are vindictive, filed only after Ábrego successfully sued the Trump administration for his wrongful deportation to El Salvador. The ruling cited "remarkable statements" by the deputy attorney general that seemed to link the prosecution to Ábrego's legal victory. The case has become a focal point in the partisan conflict over the Trump administration's aggressive immigration and deportation policies.</p>

Published in a scientific journal, the research aimed to understand the cumulative destructive effect of such a rapid-succession attack. The findings indicated that a multi-point explosion creates a significantly larger and deeper crater, dramatically expanding the damage zone compared to a single detonation. While the scientists claim the test provides valuable data, it also underscores the escalating arms race and the need to develop more resilient bunkers capable of withstanding such powerful weaponry.</p>
