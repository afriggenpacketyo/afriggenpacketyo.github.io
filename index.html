          <p>Meta has filed a lawsuit against Joy Timeline HK Ltd., the developer of the CrushAI app, which allows users to create nonconsensual, sexualized images of individuals using artificial intelligence. The Hong Kong-based company allegedly ran ads on Facebook and Instagram to promote the app, circumventing Meta's ad review process after repeated removals for violating platform rules. Meta aims to halt Joy Timeline from advertising on its services and is updating its enforcement methods with new technology to identify and remove such ads, even those without explicit nudity. The company is also sharing signals with other tech companies and disrupting networks of accounts promoting these services, underscoring its commitment to protecting its community from abuse. </p>

Trump claimed that reducing rates by two percentage points would save the U.S. $600 billion annually, but expressed frustration that Powell has not taken such action.

          <p>Senate Democrats are warning that proposed cuts to federal Medicaid spending could devastate hundreds of rural hospitals, particularly in states with Republican senators and those that voted for President Trump. Citing a commissioned report, they identify 338 rural hospitals at risk due to the potential reduction in Medicaid funding. The Democrats argue that these cuts, outlined in a House-passed budget package, could lead to reduced federal Medicaid spending by over $800 billion over the next decade, leaving millions more uninsured. The American Hospital Association has also cautioned that Medicaid cuts could have a devastating impact on rural hospitals, which often serve as the sole source of care for rural communities.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed eight new advisors to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, raising concerns due to the inclusion of individuals with a history of criticizing vaccine recommendations.

Critics, including Dr. Jason Goldman, express concern over the lack of transparency and the potential impact on public confidence in vaccine recommendations.

New Hampshire residents tip the most, averaging 16.07% of their spending on food away from home, while Utah residents tip the least, at 4.09%. The study also finds that tipping rates are higher in states where people dine out more frequently, with Washington D.C. residents spending the most on dining out at $10,291 per capita in 2023. The analysis highlights the role of tipping in subsidizing service industry wages and the potential impact of proposed tax changes on tipped workers.</p>

Stewart publicly addressed the issue, stating that he is not asking for anything the Bengals have not done before, but feels the team is prioritizing winning arguments over winning games. The dispute reportedly stems from the Bengals' attempt to change the way their first-round rookie contracts are structured, which would allow the team to void future guarantees.

Many believe that the 10% tariffs currently in effect will remain, rather than the higher rates initially proposed. This optimism stems from recent trade negotiations and court challenges, suggesting a potential softening of Trump's trade policies. However, some caution that this optimism may be premature, as the leverage of these countries is not the same as China's.</p>

          <p>Court documents reveal that the U.S. Department of Education had planned to involve the Treasury Department in managing the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio. The plan included transferring nine Education Department employees to the Treasury to discuss collections activities. However, these plans are currently on hold following a court ruling that blocked the Trump administration from dismantling the Education Department. Experts suggest that these discussions indicate the administration's desire to reduce the Education Department's role in managing student debt.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns, President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted inflation data, with recent consumer and producer price readings remaining benign. Several factors have contributed to this, including companies stockpiling imported goods ahead of tariff announcements, the time lag for tariffs to affect the real economy, and limited pricing power due to cautious consumer spending. Economists anticipate that the effects of tariffs may materialize in the coming months, but these factors have kept inflation in check so far. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are common ways to invest in a diversified basket of stocks or bonds and both can be actively or passively managed. ETFs are traded like individual stocks, and prices fluctuate during trading hours while mutual funds must be purchased and sold directly and are priced at the end of the market day. ETFs tend to have lower expense ratios than mutual funds because when investors buy mutual fund shares, there's more work that goes into managing the transaction, which leads to higher costs for the mutual fund company. It's important to consider fund costs since they can ultimately take a bite out of overall returns. (not investment advice)</p>
