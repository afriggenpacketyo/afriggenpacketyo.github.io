          <p>Reece Galbraith was sentenced to 14 years in jail after his illegal cannabis factory exploded, killing seven-year-old Archie York and Jason Laws in Benwell. The explosion was caused by a buildup of butane during the production of drug-infused sweets. In court, Archie's mother confronted Galbraith, expressing her grief and anger over the loss of her son. The incident highlights the dangers associated with illegal drug manufacturing and the devastating consequences it can have on innocent lives, as well as the risk of death to those involved in the illegal operation itself.</p>

          <p>Burberry plans to cut approximately 1,700 jobs globally as part of its ongoing turnaround strategy, aiming to save ¬£60 million by 2027, adding to ¬£40 million in cuts previously announced. The job cuts, impacting about 20% of Burberry's workforce, will primarily affect office-based roles, stores, and its Castleford factory. Despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, CEO Joshua Schulman remains optimistic about Burberry's future, even though analysts have expressed concerns about the pace of the turnaround, while shares jumped 15% after the announcement.</p>

          <p>Despite efforts toward gender equality, many people still assume mothers are the default parent, often overlooking fathers' roles and responsibilities. Research shows schools and medical offices are more likely to contact mothers, even when fathers are listed as the primary contact. This bias can create frustrations for both parents, disrupting mothers' work and undermining fathers' involvement. Outdated software systems and societal stereotypes contribute to this issue, highlighting the need for institutions to update their practices and recognize fathers as equally capable caregivers.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reduced most of their recent tariffs on each other's imports and suspended part of the reciprocal duties for 90 days, following trade talks in Switzerland. The U.S. lowered tariffs to 30% from 145%, while China reduced its tariffs to 10% from 125%. However, both countries retained some tariffs and plan further negotiations. China also agreed to suspend non-tariff countermeasures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals, which should improve relations between the two countries.</p>

He explores work-arounds to serve a third term, reflecting a willingness to subvert the Constitution's purpose if he can evade its literal restrictions. This approach, exemplified by his stance on the Twenty-Second Amendment and the emoluments clause, reflects a "bad-man" perspective, treating the law as an adverse force to be gamed for personal gain.</p>
