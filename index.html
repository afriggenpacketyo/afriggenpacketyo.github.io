          <p>Archaeologists have discovered an ancient purple dye factory in modern-day Israel, dating back to 1100 B.C. This site, Tel Shiqmona, is identified as a specialized facility for large-scale production of purple dye, which was highly valued in antiquity and mentioned in the Bible. The factory produced dye and dyed fibers/fleeces, indicating an efficient process. Researchers used chemical and mineralogical analyses to understand each artifact. The article describes the site as an industrial area, likely emitting a terrible odor, where wool fleeces were dyed in various shades of purple, red, and blue.</p>

          <p>Police are investigating an alleged attack on a prison officer by Axel Rudakubana, who was sentenced to a minimum of 52 years for murdering three young girls. Rudakubana allegedly threw boiling water over the officer, who was hospitalized as a precaution. The incident at HMP Belmarsh has raised concerns about the safety of prison officers, especially after a similar attack by the Manchester Arena bomber. The Prison Service has stated that violence will not be tolerated and that they will push for the strongest possible punishment for attacks on staff, and are reviewing protective body armour for prison officers.</p>

          <p>For years, China's leader Xi Jinping has been planning to make the world dependent on its exports and know-how. He has ramped up exports, deepened China‚Äôs position as the world‚Äôs leading base for manufacturing, and introduced new weapons of economic warfare such as export controls and antimonopoly laws. When the current Trump administration slapped huge tariffs on Chinese goods, China retaliated with its own taxes and imposed export restrictions on critical minerals. This strategy aims to flip the leverage so that the world is reliant on China, and China is reliant on no one.</p>

          <p>A teenage amateur footballer, Cerys Vaughan, who was banned by the Football Association for remarks made to a transgender woman opponent, is demanding an apology from the governing body. Vaughan was sanctioned for improper conduct after asking the rival player if they were a man during a friendly match, and subsequently raising concerns about fairness and safety with the referee. An FA appeal board found that Vaughan had received an ‚Äúunfair‚Äù hearing, quashing the original ruling, and the case has since been dropped after the complainant withdrew.</p>
