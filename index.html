        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, has initiated a nationwide probe into election practices, focusing on identifying and removing noncitizens from voter registration lists. This effort, part of the Trump administration's push for election integrity, involves requesting voter data from states, leading to resistance from some, like New Hampshire. The initiative stems from a March executive order and has faced legal challenges, with critics like Senator Dick Durbin arguing it could disproportionately affect minority voters. While the administration cites widespread fraud, evidence of noncitizens casting ballots remains scarce.</p>

          <p>An NPR comic explores the common social awkwardness many people feel when receiving a compliment. Social psychologist Erica Boothby and behavioral scientist Xuan Zhao delve into the science behind these reactions, explaining what our responses reveal about our self-perception. The article suggests that dismissing praise can negatively affect both the giver and the receiver. Ultimately, it makes a case for learning to graciously accept kind remarks as a way to improve social interactions and self-esteem.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A noticeable trend has emerged in international diplomacy where world leaders are increasingly using praise and flattery to engage with President Trump. Examples include the UK Prime Minister presenting a rare second state visit invitation and Israel's Prime Minister nominating Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize. Analysts suggest this approach is a strategic shift from Trump's first term, as leaders now recognize his personal and decisive leadership style. This tactic aims to keep Trump on their side to achieve favorable outcomes, such as increased NATO defense spending and new trade agreements.</p>

          <p>Japan has officially recorded its hottest July since data collection began in 1898, with average temperatures 2.89 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 norm. The extreme heat, which saw a record 41.2 Celsius in one region, is expected to continue through August, prompting official warnings for heatstroke prevention. The early end to the rainy season contributed to the conditions, which are also impacting the country's iconic cherry blossoms. Experts warn that this trend is driven by climate change and that the entire summer is likely to set new temperature records.</p>

          <p>The song "Golden" from the animated Netflix film "KPop Demon Hunters" has surprisingly reached number one on the UK Singles Chart. The film, about a fictional K-pop girl band that fights supernatural threats, has become the streaming service's most-watched animated movie. Ejae, who co-wrote and performed the track, described the success as overwhelming and dream-like. The song's hopeful and powerful message is credited for its wide appeal, making it the first K-pop single to top the UK chart since "Gangnam Style" in 2012.</p>

          <p>Despite international aid efforts, including airdrops and a US-backed humanitarian foundation, Palestinians in Gaza report a deepening starvation crisis where the search for food is a "death journey." Residents say the aid is insufficient and distribution is perilous, with the UN reporting over 1,300 Palestinians killed while trying to access aid since May. The dire situation on the ground contrasts sharply with international political discussions about Palestinian statehood, which Gazans feel are meaningless without tangible changes. Many express a profound loss of dignity and hope, living on canned food and witnessing severe health deterioration in children.</p>

Authorities have been instructed to enhance mosquito elimination efforts and implement port quarantines to cut off the transmission channels. Hong Kong health officials noted that Foshan's case count had surpassed 6,500 by July 30, though all reported cases have been mild with no fatalities.</p>

The club recently rejected a £110 million bid from Liverpool for the Swedish player, whom they value at around £150 million. Isak was left out of the team's pre-season tour due to a minor injury and has been training alone at his former club, a fact Howe learned through the media.

Trump baselessly accused the agency of rigging the figures, a move that critics condemned as authoritarian and damaging to public trust in official data.

          <p>China's customs authority has tightened import rules for durians from Vietnam after detecting unsafe levels of the metal cadmium and an organic compound. The new regulations require enhanced pre-export safety checks and "batch by batch" testing upon arrival. Any shipments that fail to meet standards will be returned or destroyed, and the corresponding exporters will be suspended from the Chinese market. This move has already impacted trade, with the value of fresh durian shipments from Vietnam to China falling by approximately 45% in the first half of 2025.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: EU Must Reject Unfavorable Trade Deal with the United States</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the recent EU-US trade deal negotiated by Ursula von der Leyen is a "capitulation" that must be rejected by the European Union. The authors contend the agreement is economically damaging, offering one-way concessions that hurt key European industries while giving up leverage against US pressure. They criticize the deal for undermining the EU's international credibility and for pledging billions in EU investment in the US. The article calls on EU governments and the European Parliament to course-correct and salvage the situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Tesla Ordered to Pay $243 Million in Lawsuit Over Fatal Autopilot Crash</h2>

          <p>A Miami jury has found Tesla liable in a 2019 fatal crash, ordering the company to pay $243 million to the family of the 22-year-old victim and her injured boyfriend. The lawsuit argued that Tesla's Autopilot technology failed, as the driver was distracted and the system did not provide alerts before hitting the couple's vehicle. The plaintiffs' attorney stated that Tesla marketed the technology irresponsibly by not restricting its use to controlled-access highways. Tesla, which plans to appeal, maintains the driver is solely responsible and that Autopilot requires full attention.</p>
