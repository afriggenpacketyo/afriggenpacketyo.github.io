            <p>An Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) inquiry into the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza concluded that an "operational misunderstanding" and "breach of orders" led to the tragic incident. The IDF claimed its troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat, citing "poor night visibility" as a contributing factor. The deputy commander of the unit involved was dismissed for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report. The report also alleged that six of the casualties were Hamas members, a claim that has not been independently verified.</p>

            <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee suggests that President Trump's tariffs could create an "artificially high" level of economic activity followed by a summer drop-off. Businesses and consumers are preemptively buying goods in anticipation of tariffs, which may inflate economic activity in the short term. Goolsbee notes that sectors like the auto industry are likely to stockpile inventory before tariffs increase. He also expressed optimism about the longer-term economic outlook, provided the country can navigate the tariff situation.</p>
