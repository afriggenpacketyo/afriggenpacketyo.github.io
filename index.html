            <p>The Chinese government has reportedly instructed domestic airlines to cease accepting deliveries of Boeing jets, escalating trade tensions with the United States. China is also allegedly halting purchases of airline parts from U.S. companies, according to sources familiar with the situation. This action follows China's increase in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, potentially doubling the price of U.S.-made aircraft. Boeing is slated to ship approximately ten 737 Max aircraft to Chinese carriers, but the new order could disrupt these plans.</p>

Xi's vision reflects Beijing's belief in the decline of the US and the rise of China, aligning with Russia against Washington.

            <p>Several prisons in France have been hit by a wave of overnight attacks, with seven establishments targeted. Vehicles were set on fire, and one prison entrance was targeted with gunfire. Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin linked the attacks to the government's crackdown on drug trafficking. The prison guard union expressed deep concern and called for urgent government action to protect prison staff. No group has claimed responsibility, but anarchist slogans were found at some sites.</p>

If terms cannot be reached, Dubois will be ordered to face Derek Chisora. Usyk aims to secure the undisputed title before retiring, potentially after two more fights.</p>

            <p>U.S. gambling firms are lobbying against consumer protections intended to reduce addiction-related harms, according to a non-profit watchdog. Regulations such as restrictions on advertising and deposit limits are facing pushback from the industry. This follows a surge in online gambling since a 2018 Supreme Court ruling, with Americans placing around $150 billion in wagers last year.

            <p>Some of Donald Trump's biggest donors and investors, with substantial financial ties to the president, are positioned to potentially profit from a U.S. takeover of Greenland. The administration's interest in Greenland is driven by securing rare minerals and reopening oil and gas exploration. An analysis reveals that tech moguls, fossil fuel executives, and crypto tycoons have collectively donated significant sums to Trump's campaign while also having financial interests in Greenland's resources. This raises ethical concerns about potential conflicts of interest.</p>

Some argue that progressive neighborhood preservationism is to blame, while others point to greed and the lack of incentives for building affordable housing. The increasing economic and social power of women, and the desire to stay close to family, is also explored as a contributing factor to decreased mobility.</p>
