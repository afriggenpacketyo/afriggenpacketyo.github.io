          <p>General Motors has revised its 2025 earnings guidance to account for a potential $4 billion to $5 billion impact from President Donald Trump's auto tariffs. The Detroit automaker's adjusted earnings before interest and taxes are now projected to be between $10 billion and $12.5 billion, down from the previous estimate of $13.7 billion to $15.7 billion. This adjustment reflects the company's anticipation of significant financial repercussions stemming from the newly imposed tariffs. The revision underscores the substantial financial risks that the automotive industry faces due to shifting trade policies.</p>

          <p>Former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams has said he was insulted by the BBC's response to his complaint about a Spotlight program concerning the murder of Denis Donaldson. Adams is suing the BBC for damages at the High Court in Dublin, alleging the program falsely implied he sanctioned the murder. The BBC rejected Adams' solicitors' request for an apology and compensation, stating the program was responsible journalism. Adams claims the BBC doubled down on the allegations and dismissed efforts to resolve the issue.</p>

          <p>This article examines the role of sport in Nazi Germany, highlighting its use for promoting health, performance, and military readiness. Individual sports were secondary to collective activities aimed at strengthening the "national body." The Nazis initially rejected international competitive sport but later embraced the 1936 Olympic Games for propaganda purposes. The article also discusses the exclusion of Jews from sports clubs and the impact of Nazi ideology on women's sporting activities.</p>

          <p>Ukraine signed a deal giving the United States control over a share of its future revenue from natural resources. The agreement involves creating a joint investment fund between the countries, and is intended to give President Trump a personal stake in the country’s fate while addressing his concerns that the United States has provided Kyiv with a blank check to try to withstand Russia’s invasion. The deal was initially meant to be signed when President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine visited Washington in February, but a signing ceremony was abruptly canceled.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk described his first 100 days in Washington leading his Department of Government Efficiency as "very, very intense," and, while he said he was proud of his team's work, he blamed what he called an "entrenched set of interests" for hindering their effectiveness so far. Musk claimed that if DOGE is going to get to $1 trillion in cuts, it may come down to "how much pain is, you know, the cabinet and Congress going only to take. It can be done, but it requires dealing with a lot of complaints."</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has heard three religion cases in the last month, culminating in an argument over a Catholic charter school in Oklahoma, and the side pressing religious-freedom claims seemed likely to prevail in all three. Since 2012, the pro-religion side has won all but one of 16 First Amendment cases about the government’s relationship with faith. A 2021 study found that the Roberts court ruled in favor of religious people and groups over 83 percent of the time, compared with about 50 percent of the time for other courts since 1953.</p>
