          <p>Several federal prosecutors in Los Angeles have resigned following a controversial plea deal offered to a sheriff's deputy convicted of using excessive force. The new U.S. attorney, Bill Essayli, appointed by President Trump, offered a misdemeanor plea to Trevor Kirk, who was previously found guilty of a felony for assaulting a woman. This decision led to the resignation of key prosecutors, including the chief of the Public Corruption and Civil Rights Section. The move has been criticized as unorthodox and potentially undermining the integrity of the jury verdict.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Party in California is grappling with the question of whether their leaders are too old, as some members propose exploring a mandatory retirement age for state and local officeholders. The idea, initiated by San Francisco Democrats, stems from concerns about leaders holding onto power past their prime, referencing examples like Dianne Feinstein and Joseph R. Biden. While some argue it is ageist and discriminatory, others believe it is necessary to make way for younger candidates and avoid situations where leaders' health impacts their ability to serve effectively.</p>
