          <p>Assata Shakur, a prominent member of the Black Liberation Army, has died in Cuba from health complications at the age of 78. Convicted in 1973 for the murder of a New Jersey state trooper, she escaped from prison in 1979 and was granted political asylum in Cuba in 1984. Shakur, who was the first woman placed on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorist list, remained a controversial figure, viewed by some as a symbol of resistance against racial injustice and by others as a convicted murderer.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has announced it will permit Boeing to resume issuing its own airworthiness certificates for some new 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner aircraft. This authority was revoked in 2019 and 2022, respectively, following fatal crashes and production defects, placing certification solely in the FAA's hands. The decision signals renewed regulatory confidence in Boeing's manufacturing quality, though the FAA will still alternate certification duties with the company and maintain increased oversight on production rates.</p>

The show was pulled by Sinclair and other station owners after host Jimmy Kimmel made controversial comments regarding a conservative activist. In its statement, Sinclair cited feedback from various community stakeholders and underscored the importance of responsible broadcasting, while also noting that its proposals for a network ombudsman have not yet been adopted by ABC and Disney.</p>

Tamura, a former high school football player, left notes referencing the brain disease and asking for his brain to be studied. While the finding provides context to his actions, experts cited in the article caution that a CTE diagnosis does not fully explain such complex and violent behavior.</p>

          <p>The Ryder Cup began with a surge of American energy, as Bryson DeChambeau and Justin Thomas secured an early lead, electrifying the massive home crowd at Bethpage Black. However, the initial momentum quickly faded as the European team mounted a formidable comeback across all matches. Europe's players demonstrated steady precision, silencing the partisan crowd and winning three of the four morning foursome matches to take a commanding 3-1 lead, spoiling the Americans' planned party.</p>

Prosecutors remain skeptical, pointing to the nature of the wounds and Elliott's demeanor after calling 911, creating a mysterious and tragic case with no clear motive for the killing.</p>

          <p>Moldova's Central Electoral Commission has excluded the pro-Russia party "Heart of Moldova" from participating in this weekend's parliamentary elections. The decision follows a court ruling that limited the party's activities amid an ongoing investigation into illegal financing and vote-buying, which officials allege is part of a Russian effort to influence the election. The party has denied the accusations, calling the move a politically motivated attempt by the current pro-European government to silence opposition ahead of the critical vote.</p>

          <p>A political analysis suggests that Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent focus on immigration, including the announcement of a mandatory digital ID, is a direct strategic response to the rising political threat of Nigel Farage's Reform UK party. With polls showing Reform's growing popularity, Starmer is positioning his Labour government to address voter concerns about border control head-on. This shift marks a significant change from the government's earlier priorities and frames the next election as a battle between Labour's "patriotic national renewal" and Reform's populism.</p>
