          <h2>Chinese Civil Servants Avoid Dining Out Amidst Strict Local Austerity Measures</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Local government officials across China are increasingly avoiding dining out due to stringent, and often shifting, local austerity campaigns that exceed central government regulations. This phenomenon, described as "ceng ceng jia ma" or adding extra layers of control, has led some department heads to outright ban their staff from eating in restaurants to avoid scrutiny. Officials indicate this lifestyle change is a response to the unpredictable nature of anti-corruption measures, which create an environment of caution and self-preservation among civil servants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant domestic policy bill championed by President Trump narrowly passed a key procedural hurdle in the Senate following a dramatic, late-night vote. The measure advanced 51-49 after several Republican holdouts reversed their opposition, narrowly avoiding the need for a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. The bill now faces a lengthy full reading on the Senate floor, a delay tactic initiated by Democrats, before a final vote can occur. Its passage remains uncertain as it must also be re-approved by the House, where some Republicans have already voiced opposition to the Senate's version. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fast-moving brush fire, named the Lake fire, erupted near the Silverwood Lake State Recreation Area in San Bernardino County, quickly growing to 477 acres.

Boaters and park rangers assisted in moving people to safety before they were eventually escorted back to their vehicles. Fire crews are battling the flames from both the ground and air, and the cause of the fire is currently under investigation.</p>

          <p>The Leadmill, a legendary music venue in Sheffield for 45 years, has hosted its final gig after losing a prolonged battle with its landlords, the Electric Group. The venue was a cultural cornerstone, launching the careers of bands like Pulp and Arctic Monkeys and creating lasting memories for generations of music fans. While the new owners state it will remain a music venue, many artists and patrons, including local musician Richard Hawley, have lamented the closure of the original institution and vowed not to return under new management, viewing it as a loss for the city's grassroots music scene.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new partnership with major supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to encourage healthier food choices among consumers. The voluntary plan aims to tackle rising obesity rates by having retailers promote nutritious options through methods like special offers, loyalty point incentives, or in-store layout changes. While the initiative is designed to increase accountability by requiring businesses to report on healthy food sales, it does not impose specific targets. The goal is to make healthy eating more accessible and affordable, thereby reducing long-term pressure on the National Health Service.</p>

This issue echoes the tragic history of its UK counterpart, where two former contestants died by suicide, leading to increased mental health protocols. Psychologists note that while UK productions have enhanced their duty of care, the US version faces challenges in balancing the demand for drama with contestant stability. The franchise provides psychological support, but experts warn that the pressures of overnight fame and social media scrutiny remain a significant uphill battle for reality TV participants.</p>

He alluded to past instances where he felt compelled to speak out against threatening statements from high-level politicians, emphasizing that such actions are inappropriate and dangerous.

The protests, which began last year after a deadly railway station roof collapse, have been fueled by accusations of government corruption and ties to organized crime.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cities often experience significantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas due to a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect. This occurs because dark surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain the sun's heat, which is then slowly released, warming the air. In contrast, rural landscapes with more vegetation and water benefit from natural cooling through evaporation. As climate change leads to more frequent and intense heatwaves, this effect makes urban populations, which are projected to grow, especially vulnerable to extreme heat and related health risks.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched through Venice to voice their opposition to the lavish wedding of billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez. Activists and residents argue the event highlights the exploitation of the historic city, which already suffers from overtourism, high living costs, and environmental fragility. The demonstration, held under banners like "Kisses Yes, Bezos No," contrasted sharply with the star-studded, multi-day celebration. Protesters criticized a donation made by Bezos to Venetian environmental groups as a superficial gesture, demanding policies that prioritize the city's citizens over wealthy tourists.</p>

          <p>Primary schools in Kent, UK, are trialing a new educational program to teach children as young as five about sun safety to help prevent future cases of skin cancer. The initiative, which is planned for a nationwide rollout, instructs students on applying sunscreen, reading UV indexes, and understanding the risks of sun exposure. Health experts emphasize that sunburn during childhood significantly increases the risk of developing melanoma later in life. With melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, the program aims to instill lifelong healthy habits and empower the next generation to protect their skin.</p>

          <p>Japan has successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, marking the end of the vehicle's 24-year career as a cornerstone of the nation's space program. The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deploying a government satellite designed to monitor greenhouse gases. The H2A series, which had a 98 percent success rate, is now being replaced by the more cost-effective H3 rocket. The final launch represents a significant milestone in Japan's aerospace history as it transitions to its next generation of space vehicles.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major demonstration for human rights and solidarity against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The large turnout was partly a reaction to the government's attempt to ban the march, citing a controversial 2021 law that conflates homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, defied the ban, framing the event as a peaceful show of freedom against a "hateful power." The march celebrated LGBTQ+ rights while also serving as a broader protest against the ruling Fidesz party's policies.</p>

          <p>Despite the Dodgers' 9-5 loss to the Kansas City Royals, Shohei Ohtani delivered his strongest pitching performance of the season, showcasing dominant potential. In his two innings of work, Ohtani threw a 101.7-mph fastball, the fastest of his MLB career, and effectively attacked the strike zone with a mix of high-velocity heat and sharp breaking balls. While his workload remains limited as he recovers from Tommy John surgery, the outing was a significant positive for the team. The Dodgers' bullpen and defense struggled after his departure, allowing the Royals to secure the victory.</p>

          <p>According to former Microsoft AI head Harry Shum, China is rapidly catching up to the United States in the field of AI algorithms, even as it lags significantly behind in advanced chip technology. Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that the US maintains a clear lead in AI chips, a gap that will take years to close. However, he highlighted the success of Chinese start-ups like DeepSeek, which have developed powerful large language models at a fraction of the cost and with far fewer chips than their Western competitors, demonstrating significant progress in algorithmic efficiency.
