          <p>A Peruvian farmer, SaÃºl Luciano Lliuya, lost his decade-long climate change lawsuit against RWE, a major European energy company, over potential flooding from a glacial lake swollen by climate change. Lliuya argued RWE's emissions contributed to the melting glaciers threatening his city and sought funds for a protective dyke. The court in Germany ruled the probability of the lake bursting was too small to hold RWE liable, though Germanwatch, an environmental group, claimed a partial victory, stating that the court accepted the broader principle that climate change plaintiffs can sue companies over carbon emissions. The court's decision was based on factual risk assessment rather than rejecting the legal basis for such lawsuits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has escalated his conflict with Harvard University, accusing it of disrespecting the country and mishandling antisemitism. He claimed Harvard loses money each time it challenges his policies and alleged the university enrolls too many foreign students, including potential "troublemakers." Trump suggested capping foreign student enrollment at 15% and criticized Harvard's handling of international students, citing national security concerns. The administration has taken steps to block Harvard from enrolling international students and has threatened to cut federal funding due to perceived antisemitism on campus, leading to legal challenges from the university.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security agents are conducting unannounced "wellness checks" on migrant children across the U.S., raising concerns among educators, advocates, and lawyers. These checks, often carried out by agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), involve interviewing children at schools, homes, and shelters. Critics argue that these visits are a pretext for immigration enforcement and could lead to deportations, while the Trump administration claims they are intended to ensure the children's well-being and protect them from exploitation. The involvement of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a social services agency, in these checks has also drawn criticism.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering pardoning individuals charged with conspiring to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in 2020, describing the case as a "railroad job." He expressed skepticism about the seriousness of the plot and suggested the defendants may have been entrapped. Two of the six defendants were convicted at trial, while two others pleaded guilty, and two were acquitted. Trump's potential pardons would add to his extensive use of pardon power, particularly for those convicted in the January 6 Capitol riot.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposal to redirect $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools faces significant legal and practical obstacles, according to education experts. Federal grants are awarded competitively for specific research purposes, and trade schools typically lack the infrastructure for such research. Experts argue that redirecting funds would require evidence that Harvard's grants were improperly awarded, which has not been alleged. While trade schools can apply for federal grants, they generally do not qualify for the same type of research funding as universities like Harvard.</p>

Concerns about the potential for tariffs to slow growth while raising inflation are complicating the Fed's decision-making process.
