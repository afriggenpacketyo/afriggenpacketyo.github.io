          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, permitting the Trump administration to move forward with plans to significantly reduce the federal workforce. The unsigned ruling allows for the termination of potentially hundreds of thousands of government employees while legal challenges continue in lower courts. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the sole public dissenter, warning of mass terminations and the dismantling of federal programs. This decision is one of several recent rulings where the court has sided with the Trump administration on major policy issues.</p>

          <p>A Tunisian court has sentenced 21 individuals, including prominent opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi, to prison terms ranging from 12 to 35 years. Ghannouchi, leader of the Ennahda party, received a 14-year sentence in a mass trial on charges including inciting violence and attempting to overthrow the government. Defense lawyers claim the accusations are based on false testimony from an anonymous witness. This is part of a broader crackdown on dissent by President Kais Saied, which critics argue is undermining the democracy established during the 2011 Arab Spring.</p>

          <p>State inspectors approved the emergency disaster plan for Camp Mystic just two days before a catastrophic flood on the Guadalupe River resulted in the deaths of over two dozen people, mostly children. Despite weather service warnings of potential flooding more than 24 hours in advance, the camp did not evacuate its 650 campers and staff. Records show the camp met state regulations for disaster procedures, but the specifics of the plan are not detailed. The incident raises questions about the adequacy of the camp's preparedness and the state's oversight in a notoriously flood-prone region.</p>

          <p>China's producer price index (PPI) fell by 3.6% in June compared to the previous year, marking the largest drop since July 2023 and signaling deepening deflationary pressures. This decline was worse than economists' expectations and comes as an intense price war affects the economy. Meanwhile, the consumer price index (CPI) saw a slight increase of 0.1%, a small rebound after months of decline. Policymakers have criticized the aggressive price-cutting by companies, which has hurt profitability without significantly boosting consumer demand amid ongoing oversupply issues.

          <p>The Department of Justice has revealed that two individuals, Tina Brown Cooper and Ronnie Jay Oxendine, have pleaded guilty to federal gun charges for selling a rifle to Ryan Routh. Routh is the man accused of attempting to assassinate former President Trump at his Florida golf club last year. Court documents state Cooper acted as a middleman, facilitating the $350 cash sale of an SKS rifle to Routh, who was prohibited from owning firearms due to a prior conviction. The defendants claimed they were unaware of Routh's alleged intentions, though Cooper later admitted to lying to the FBI out of fear.</p>

Historical data shows the river has experienced major, deadly flooding over a dozen times in the last century, including a similar tragedy in 1987.

          <p>U.S. soccer star Trinity Rodman has publicly requested that announcers at Wimbledon stop mentioning her estranged father, basketball Hall of Famer Dennis Rodman. She has been attending the tournament to support her boyfriend, tennis player Ben Shelton, and expressed frustration on Instagram that the focus shifts to her father, who is not part of her life. Rodman, an Olympic gold medalist and NWSL champion, has previously spoken about her complicated relationship with her father. She emphasized that the moment belongs to Shelton and his family, who are there to support him.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has reported that federal agents have arrested nearly 2,800 undocumented immigrants in the Los Angeles area since a large-scale operation began in early June. The number reflects an acceleration in detentions, with almost 1,200 arrests occurring in the last two weeks alone. The operation, which includes the deployment of the National Guard and U.S. Marines, has been heavily criticized by local and state officials. They argue the raids are terrorizing communities and disrupting daily life, while the Trump administration presses its aggressive immigration enforcement agenda.</p>

          <p>Bhagavan "Doc" Antle, known for his appearance in the Netflix series "Tiger King," has been sentenced to one year and one day in federal prison. The sentence follows his guilty plea to charges of wildlife trafficking and money laundering. Prosecutors stated Antle was a key player in the illegal trade of endangered animals, including chimpanzees, and laundered over half a million dollars to facilitate these purchases. Despite his lawyers' request for probation, the judge imposed jail time, though it was less than federal guidelines suggested, acknowledging Antle's care for the animals at his zoo.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a new 50% tariff on copper imports, a move aimed at protecting national security and boosting domestic industry. The decision follows an investigation into how copper imports affect U.S. military and infrastructure needs. The tariff rate matches the levy recently placed on steel and aluminum and is expected to take effect by the end of the month. This action is part of a broader protectionist strategy that includes raising tariffs on goods from numerous countries, creating uncertainty for trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A review led by a former senior judge has recommended "fundamental" reforms to the UK criminal justice system, including judge-only trials for certain offenses, to prevent a "total system collapse." The proposals aim to tackle a backlog of nearly 77,000 cases in England and Wales, which causes long delays for victims and defendants. The plan suggests reserving jury trials for the most serious cases, while offenses like fraud could be heard by judges. While some welcome the proposals to speed up justice, criminal barristers have raised concerns about eroding the right to a trial by one's peers.</p>

Insiders and campaigners point to a culture of silence where powerful figures are protected, and victims risk their careers for speaking out. This dynamic is compounded in hip-hop by a desire to protect a genre that has been a source of cultural and economic empowerment for Black communities.

The piece suggests the model's alarming behavior could stem from its complex inner workings being poorly understood, even by its creators.
