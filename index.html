        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk announced that its once-daily oral obesity pill demonstrated significant weight reduction in a late-stage trial, with results comparable to its popular Wegovy injection. The phase 3 trial showed an average weight loss of 16.6% after 64 weeks, boosting the company's shares by over 5%. This development positions the "Wegovy pill" as a major contender in the competitive market for oral obesity treatments, offering an alternative for patients averse to injections and strengthening Novo's portfolio against rivals like Eli Lilly.</p>

          <p>China's defense minister, Dong Jun, delivered a speech at a security conference condemning what he described as Western "bullying" and the formation of military alliances with "selfish interests." Without naming specific countries, he urged regional allies to resist disguised hegemonic logic and defend the post-war international order. Dong characterized Western-led blocs as exclusive groups designed to serve their own interests, a message that appeared to resonate with some defense chiefs from Southeast Asia who also criticized unilateral actions like U.S. tariffs and called for stronger multilateralism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study on the fears of the German population reveals that the rising cost of living is the primary concern for the 15th time in the survey's history. Despite ongoing global crises, overall anxiety among Germans has slightly decreased, which one political scientist suggests could be a sign of relief after years of crisis. Concerns about finances, including tax increases and unaffordable housing, dominate the top worries, followed by the fear of being overwhelmed by immigration. Dissatisfaction with politicians remains high, though fears related to climate change have fallen in the rankings.</p>

The 26-year-old World Player of the Year missed the quarter-final victory over Scotland but has passed all necessary medical protocols. Her return, along with prop Hannah Botterman, is expected to bolster England's squad for what is anticipated to be their most challenging match of the tournament. England is currently on a 16-game winning streak against France but faces a tough opponent in their bid to reach the final.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve's Independence Faces Unprecedented Test Amid Political Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 05:00:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The independence of the U.S. Federal Reserve is under significant strain as President Trump continues to publicly pressure the central bank for more aggressive interest rate cuts and seeks to influence its composition. The recent appointment of White House economic adviser Stephen Miran as a Fed governor, who voted for a deeper rate cut in his first meeting, has intensified these concerns.

          <p>A new conservative watchdog organization, the Safety and Prosperity Oversight Coalition, has launched with the goal of holding governmental and private institutions accountable. Led by veteran Republican political operative Chris Zeller, the group aims to be a leading voice for conservative values and effective governance. Its focus will be on scrutinizing government spending, addressing misconduct in both public and corporate sectors, and advocating for reforms through audits, legal challenges, and public education campaigns. The coalition intends to provide a conservative counterweight to accountability efforts from the left, promoting transparency and integrity across major American institutions.</p>

          <p>Hyundai Motor has revised its full-year financial targets, lowering its expected operating profit margin for 2025 from a range of 7-8% down to 6-7%, primarily citing the impact of ongoing U.S. tariffs.

          <p>U.S. beef prices have surged to historic highs as the nation's cattle herd has shrunk to its smallest size in 75 years, largely due to drought and high operating costs for ranchers. While consumer demand for beef has remained strong for years, recent data suggests shoppers are finally beginning to resist the high prices, with spending on ground beef plateauing. The slow repopulation of herds, combined with reduced foreign imports, means that supply is likely to remain tight for the foreseeable future. This situation is forcing both restaurants and consumers to reconsider their purchasing habits.</p>

The ousted CDC director recently testified that Kennedy pressured her to pre-approve changes to the childhood vaccine schedule.

          <p>President Trump has ordered the formation of a federal task force, including the National Guard, to be sent to Memphis, Tennessee, to address crime, mirroring a similar deployment in Washington, D.C. The move, supported by Tennessee's Republican governor but opposed by Memphis's Democratic mayor, is part of a broader push to assert federal intervention in cities. Legal experts and civil liberties advocates express deep concern that this pattern tests the limits of presidential power. They also worry it normalizes the presence of military troops in domestic, non-emergency situations, which could chill civilian life and erode long-standing norms.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors suggest Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of killing Charlie Kirk, was motivated by the activist's anti-trans rhetoric, citing texts with his transitioning roommate. However, evidence of a broader political ideology is scarce, leading some researchers to focus on his apparent obsession with the "performance of violence." Inscriptions on the bullet casings, such as "notices bulge uwu," are identified as inscrutable online memes from gaming culture rather than clear political statements.

The remedies include barring exclusive default-search deals and requiring some data sharing, but critics argue they are insufficient.

          <p>An opinion article reflects on the changing political landscape in the United Kingdom, drawing parallels between the rise of Nigel Farage's Reform UK party and the MAGA movement in the United States. The author, who moved from the U.S. to Britain, notes the shock at how quickly right-wing populism has gained traction, harnessing the anger of those who feel let down by the political system. While acknowledging key differences, such as the role of evangelical Christianity in U.S. politics, the piece questions how long Britain will remain a sanctuary from the divisive political forces seen across the Atlantic.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the University of Delaware have discovered how to synthetically produce a molecule found in the leaves and bark of the guava fruit plant that shows promise in fighting liver-related cancers. Using a process called natural product total synthesis, the research team created a chemical pathway to replicate the molecule, which could lead to more effective and accessible treatments. With liver cancer cases projected to rise, this breakthrough may open new avenues for developing medicines, as many clinically approved drugs are derived from natural products. The team is now collaborating with the National Cancer Institute to explore the molecule's potential against other cancers.</p>

The Belgian midfielder, who won 16 trophies with City over a decade, left in June and will now face his old team for the first time. De Bruyne's arrival at Napoli has been compared to that of club legend Diego Maradona, and he has made an immediate impact with two goals in his first three games. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said it will be "nice to have him back."</p>
