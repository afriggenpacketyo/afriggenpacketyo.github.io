          <p>Elon Musk has strongly criticized the major tax-and-spending bill supported by President Trump, labeling it a "DEBT SLAVERY bill." The Tesla CEO, a significant financial backer of Republicans, vowed to fund primary challenges against any fiscal conservatives who vote in favor of the legislation. Musk argued that members of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending are now supporting the largest debt increase in history, a move he described as a shameful betrayal of their principles. His tirade highlights a significant rift between the billionaire entrepreneur and the current direction of the Republican party's fiscal policy.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Mexico discovered twenty bodies, many of them decapitated, on a highway in the state of Sinaloa. The gruesome scene is believed to be the result of a violent, ongoing turf war between rival factions of the Sinaloa drug cartel. The conflict, which has intensified since the capture of a co-founder last year, pits loyalists of Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada against a faction led by the sons of JoaquÃ­n "El Chapo" GuzmÃ¡n. This event underscores the escalating brutality and instability in the region, where criminal violence has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives since 2006.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit a new, controversial immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" by state officials. Governor Ron DeSantis announced that the facility, located at a remote airport, is designed to house, process, and deport up to 5,000 unauthorized immigrants. Administration officials highlighted the center's isolation and surrounding dangerous wildlife as a deterrent against escape. The visit emphasizes the administration's aggressive stance on immigration enforcement and the use of unconventional methods for detention and removal.</p>

          <p>The High Court in the United Kingdom has dismissed a legal challenge brought by human rights campaigners aimed at halting the export of British-made F-35 fighter jet components to Israel. The judges ruled that the court lacked the constitutional authority to intervene in what it deemed a sensitive political matter for the executive branch. Campaigners, including Amnesty International and Oxfam, argued the exports risk UK complicity in violations of international law in Gaza.

The posts came just weeks after the Trump Organization announced a licensing deal for a new wireless service called Trump Mobile, which will operate on all three major US carrier networks, including AT&T. This timing has drawn attention to the intersection of the president's political platform and his family's commercial ventures.

          <p>Alec Baldwin and other producers of the film "Rust" have settled a negligence lawsuit filed by three crew members who witnessed the fatal 2021 on-set shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The crew members, who sued for the trauma they experienced, had alleged that the tragedy was caused by dangerous cost-cutting and a failure to follow safety rules. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. This resolves one of the civil cases stemming from the incident, which has also led to criminal charges and a conviction for the film's weapons handler.</p>

Furthermore, it could damage U.S. diplomatic relations with countries dependent on these funds and destabilize the very communities America seeks to support abroad.

          <p>The White House has declared victory in a trade dispute with Canada, stating that Prime Minister Mark Carney "caved" to pressure from President Trump by rescinding a proposed digital services tax. The tax would have targeted large U.S. technology firms like Google and Meta. After Trump threatened to raise tariffs and called off trade negotiations in response, Canada announced it would scrap the tax. The White House press secretary framed the reversal as a major win for American companies and a demonstration of President Trump's effective negotiating tactics.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced it is examining reports of civilians being harmed or killed while approaching aid distribution centers in Gaza. The statement follows numerous reports from medics and eyewitnesses, as well as a UN figure stating that more than 400 Palestinians have been killed seeking aid since late May. While denying deliberate fire on civilians, the IDF acknowledged that "inaccurate" fire may have led to casualties in some cases. The military says it is reorganizing access to the sites to minimize friction with the local population.</p>

          <p>Robinhood's stock surged to an all-time high after the company announced it would offer tokenized shares of private companies OpenAI and SpaceX to its users in the European Union. This move marks the company's first effort to make private equity accessible to retail investors via blockchain technology, a step made possible by the EU's more flexible regulatory environment. The launch is part of a broader global crypto expansion for Robinhood, which aims to democratize access to assets historically limited to insiders and wealthy investors. (not investment advice)</p>
