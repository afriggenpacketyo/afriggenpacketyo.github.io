          <p>Following citywide Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations and subsequent protests, the Trump administration is deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles. President Trump stated that the federal government would intervene due to the inability of California's governor and Los Angeles' mayor to handle the situation, while Governor Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory and an overreach of federal power. The deployment raises questions about federal authority over the National Guard and waivers of the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts military involvement in domestic law enforcement. The situation remains tense, with protests continuing and local leaders expressing concerns about escalating tensions and erosion of public trust.</p>

Introduced in 1999 with the i-mode service, Docomo's emoji played a crucial role in shaping the visual language of texting, particularly among teenagers in Japan. The company cites the global adoption of Google's emoji as the reason for the change, with new Android smartphones and feature phones adopting Noto Color Emoji or Samsung emoji instead.

While the original study identified dimethyl sulfide as a promising biosignature, subsequent research has found insufficient evidence and proposes the presence of other non-biological molecules.

          <p>A referendum in Italy proposing to halve the time required to apply for citizenship has polarized the country, with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni boycotting the vote. The referendum seeks to reduce the waiting period from 10 years to five, aligning Italy with most other European nations, and could potentially grant citizenship to up to 1.4 million foreign residents. Supporters argue that the reform would integrate long-term residents who contribute to Italian society, while opponents express concerns about diluting national identity. The debate highlights the sensitive issue of immigration and citizenship in Italy, with accusations of racism and concerns about the integration of foreign nationals.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to launch a registration system to encourage people to maintain connections with rural areas facing depopulation, with the goal of attracting over 10 million users in the next decade. The initiative, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, seeks to reverse the trend of overconcentration in major cities by offering certificates and information on local events to registered nonresidents. While details are still being developed, the program aims to leverage existing systems like the hometown tax program to incentivize support for rural economies. However, some officials express skepticism about the plan's novelty and its potential impact on regional revitalization.</p>
