            <p>Sarah Wynn-Williams, a Meta whistleblower, testified before a Senate panel, claiming that Facebook, now Meta, worked closely with the Chinese government to censor posts on its platform. She alleged Meta provided custom censorship tools, allowed CCP access to user data, and removed accounts of Chinese dissidents during her tenure from 2011 to 2018. Meta refuted these claims, stating they do not operate in China today, and that the allegations are divorced from reality. The hearing underscores Washington's growing concerns about China's economic and national security threat, amidst escalating tensions and trade disputes.</p>

            <p>The Justice Department is seeking to drop charges against Henrry Villatoro Santos, who was previously identified as the "East Coast leader" of MS-13, a move that deviates from historical precedent. While Attorney General Pam Bondi initially announced his arrest with great fanfare, the DOJ now intends to deport him, rather than pursue a criminal conviction. Former Justice Department officials express concern that deporting a gang leader without a conviction could allow him to re-enter the country. The charging documents against Villatoro Santos only briefly mentioned his alleged MS-13 affiliation.</p>

            <p>President Trump abruptly reversed course on his sweeping "reciprocal" tariffs, instituting a 90-day pause for most affected nations except China, after days of promoting his trade gamble. He cited market volatility and anxieties as the reason for the change, despite previously insisting the tariffs were here to stay. The White House spun the reversal as a strategic move, claiming it created leverage for negotiations, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stating Trump wants to be "personally involved" in these negotiations. Trump is escalating tariffs with China, increasing them to 125% after Beijing retaliated with taxes on U.S. goods.</p>

            <p>President Trump explained his sudden reversal on tariffs by stating that people were getting "a little bit afraid" and he noticed volatility in the markets. Despite previously insisting on the tariffs, Trump emphasized the need for flexibility and claimed the pause was something he had been considering for a while. White House officials portrayed the move as courageous and part of a grand negotiation strategy, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent arguing it created maximum leverage. Trump's announcement led to a market surge, but uncertainty remains regarding future trade relations, especially with China, where tariffs are being increased.</p>

            <p>President Trump's decision to pause higher tariffs was initially presented by aides as a strategic masterstroke to reset America's trade imbalance. However, Trump himself admitted that concerns about the bond market and pressure from Republicans influenced the decision. While the White House claims the pause is a result of countries seeking renegotiated trade deals, critics suggest it was a response to growing economic anxieties. The move underscores the tension between Trump's protectionist impulses and the potential economic consequences of a full-blown trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump accused Taylor, who wrote anonymously against him, of leaking classified information and Krebs of weaponizing his position against free speech. Critics argue that Trump is using the justice department for revenge, stifling dissent and undermining civil liberties. The actions against Taylor and Krebs were part of a series of executive orders signed by Trump, including one aimed at reviving US shipbuilding and another ending regulations on water pressure from shower heads.</p>

The relationship with Trump is described as a rollercoaster, with tensions arising from differing views on the war and gratitude for US aid. Zelensky's leadership and authority have been essential for Ukraine's unity, but adapting to Trump-era diplomacy will be a significant challenge.</p>

            <p>President Trump's recent tariff announcements have been a mix of policy change and negotiation tactics. He initially announced a minimum 10% tax on imports and higher rates for specific countries but has now paused the country-specific tariffs for 90 days. Tariffs on Chinese imports are increasing to 125% amid an escalating trade war. While the White House claims this is due to nations offering to negotiate, the moves have created economic uncertainty and strained international relationships. The situation remains fluid, with potential impacts on import prices and trade-dependent jobs.</p>
