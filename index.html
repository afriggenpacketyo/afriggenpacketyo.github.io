        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court's injunction, ruling that the Trump administration's attempt to end birthright citizenship is likely unconstitutional. The First Circuit Court of Appeals cited historical precedents, including the rejection of efforts to restrict citizenship in cases like Dred Scott and during the Chinese Exclusion Act era. The court's opinion emphasized that American tradition recognizes citizenship based on birth within the United States, rather than the actions or status of one's parents. The Trump administration has previously asked the Supreme Court to review the executive order in separate cases.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence chipmaker Cerebras Systems has officially withdrawn its plans for an initial public offering (IPO), according to a recent SEC filing. The decision comes just days after the company announced it had raised over $1.1 billion in a private funding round, reaching a valuation of $8.1 billion. A company spokesperson stated that Cerebras still intends to go public eventually but felt its original prospectus was outdated given the rapid advancements in the AI sector. The withdrawal is not related to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which has limited SEC operations.</p>

          <p>The individual who killed two people in a knife and car attack at a Manchester synagogue was on police bail for a sexual assault allegation at the time of the incident. Police believe the 35-year-old attacker, who was killed by officers, may have been influenced by extremist ideology, leading to further arrests. One of the victims was also accidentally killed by police gunfire during the response. The families of the two deceased men have paid tribute to them as heroes who died while protecting others during the attack on Yom Kippur.</p>

          <h2>Poll Reveals Americans Widely Condemn Political Violence but Expect It to Increase</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 18:00:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that while Americans across the political spectrum overwhelmingly find political violence unacceptable, a majority are concerned it will rise in the coming years. The survey highlights a disconnect where most people believe they can get along on a personal level, but that politics drives them apart. Fewer than half of respondents feel comfortable expressing their political views publicly, and many report rarely engaging in political discussions with those holding different opinions. This apprehension contributes to a general pessimism about the nation's ability to overcome political divisions.</p>

          <p>The developer of ICEBlock, an application that allows users to report sightings of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, is appealing to Apple to reinstate the app after it was removed from the App Store. The removal followed pressure from the Trump administration, which argued the app could endanger law enforcement officers. The app's creator, Joshua Aaron, defended ICEBlock by comparing it to traffic apps like Waze and stated its purpose is to help immigrants, drawing parallels between current enforcement tactics and historical persecution. Google has also removed similar apps from its platform.</p>

          <p>Denmark is increasing its preparedness for what its Prime Minister has termed a Russian "hybrid war," following repeated sightings of unidentified drones in its airspace. The incursions have heightened public anxiety and prompted the government to urge citizens to stock emergency supplies for at least three days. While Russia denies any hostile intent, Danish officials, along with NATO allies, view the drone activity as a serious security threat intended to undermine the state without engaging in direct armed conflict. The situation reflects growing nervousness among European nations backing Ukraine against Russia's invasion.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recently unveiled 20-point peace plan for Gaza presents some new elements, such as a temporary international governing body, but still faces fundamental obstacles that have thwarted previous efforts. The proposal requires Hamas to disarm and release all hostages, while Israel would conduct a staged withdrawal, yet both sides have deep-seated reasons to resist these terms. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's participation may be a strategic move, counting on Hamas to reject the deal, which would then grant Israel U.S. backing to "finish the job." This article suggests the war is likely far from over, as the plan's success hinges on overcoming significant political resistance within both Israeli and Palestinian leadership.</p>

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, criticizing the court's use of its emergency docket to interfere in the case.

Vought, a seasoned budget hawk, is being positioned as the enforcer of these cuts, with the administration threatening to slash funding for what it terms "Democrat agencies."

          <p>This opinion article critiques a custom "challenge coin" created by and for FBI Director Kash Patel, arguing it reflects a lack of seriousness and gravitas for the head of the nation's top law enforcement agency. The coin features imagery associated with the Marvel vigilante character The Punisher, a symbol also used by some extremist groups, along with stylized initials and a tommy gun. The author contrasts this with the traditional, dignified nature of military and government challenge coins, suggesting Patel's version is more fitting for a cosplay convention than the FBI. The piece concludes that the coin is a metal symbol of the hollowness of Patel's leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While bankruptcy can offer a financial lifeline, filers must meet strict eligibility criteria, and many applications are rejected due to disqualifying factors. For Chapter 7 bankruptcy, failing the "means test" by having an income above the state median is a common disqualifier. Other reasons for rejection across both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 include recent bankruptcy discharges, failure to complete mandatory credit counseling, and any fraudulent behavior such as concealing assets or lying on forms. This article explains these rules and suggests alternatives like debt consolidation or settlement for those who do not qualify. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Georgia-based journalist Mario Guevara has been deported to El Salvador following a 100-day detention by ICE. Guevara was arrested in June while covering a protest, and although local charges were dropped, he was transferred to ICE custody due to a prior administratively closed immigration case. An appeals court denied his final request to stay in the U.S., ruling that he had not filed the correct paperwork for permanent residency. The ACLU and other advocates have condemned the deportation as government retaliation for his reporting on law enforcement activities.</p>

Goodall's findings were initially met with skepticism but were later validated, making her a global icon for animal conservation. Through the Jane Goodall Institute and decades of advocacy, she inspired millions to take action to protect the environment and its inhabitants.</p>

Farrington was prompted to see a doctor only after discovering a pea-sized lump in her armpit.

          <p>Google is laying off 50 workers at its offices in Sunnyvale, California, joining other major tech companies in reducing staff. The job cuts affect roles in user experience, software engineering, and program management, with over 100 design-related positions also eliminated in its cloud division. Analysts suggest these layoffs are a response to a potential economic downturn and increasing efficiencies from artificial intelligence, which can automate tasks like coding and design. This move follows similar workforce reductions at other tech giants like Salesforce, Intel, and Meta.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government shutdown is set to continue into a second week after the Senate once again failed to pass spending proposals from either party. Both a Republican-led and a Democrat-led bill failed to secure the necessary 60 votes, with lawmakers remaining deadlocked over healthcare funding. The White House has warned of potential mass layoffs of federal workers if the stalemate persists, a step it described as necessary for "fiscal sanity." Meanwhile, the administration has already suspended billions in federal infrastructure funding for projects in several Democratic-run states and cities.</p>
