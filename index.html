        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual Perseids meteor shower, one of the most anticipated celestial events, is expected to be significantly hampered by a bright moon during its peak on August 12-13, 2025. According to the American Meteor Society, the waning gibbous moon will be 84% full, potentially reducing visibility by up to 75%. This means viewers in North America may only see 10-20 meteors per hour, a sharp decrease from the typical 50 or more under dark sky conditions. The Perseids are caused by debris from the comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, and experts suggest that viewing a week after the peak might yield better results as the moonlight subsides.</p>

          <p>A BBC Panorama investigation delves into the contentious medical evidence surrounding the case of former nurse Lucy Letby, convicted of murdering seven babies. The article explores the deep division between those who see her as guilty and a defense campaign that claims she was wrongly convicted based on flawed evidence. It examines the specific case of Baby O, where prosecution claims of impact-type liver injuries and air embolism are challenged by independent experts and even one of the authors of a study cited by the prosecution. The defense has presented alternative theories, such as accidental needle injury or birth trauma, but these too face contradictions and a lack of consensus among experts, illustrating the complexity and uncertainty in the case.</p>

          <p>A Chinese state media outlet has publicly questioned the safety of Nvidia's H20 artificial intelligence chips, urging a boycott by domestic consumers. The commentary suggests the chips, designed specifically for the Chinese market, could contain "back doors" for U.S. government surveillance, citing historical and recent American legislative efforts to embed tracking features in technology. This campaign of distrust continues despite Nvidia's chief security officer issuing a strong denial, stating there are no back doors, kill switches, or spyware in the company's products. The article highlights the escalating technological tensions and propaganda battle between the U.S. and China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Israeli airstrike near Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital has resulted in the deaths of five Al Jazeera journalists, according to the broadcaster. The network condemned the incident as a "targeted assassination" and a premeditated attack on press freedom. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it targeted one of the journalists, Anas al-Sharif, alleging he was the head of a Hamas terrorist cell, a claim Al Jazeera and press freedom groups dispute. This event has intensified criticism of Israel's actions, with organizations like the Committee to Protect Journalists noting a pattern of Israel killing journalists and subsequently accusing them of terrorism without providing substantial evidence.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has shrunk by 20% over the last six years, now numbering around 450,000 personnel, a direct consequence of the nation's critically low birth rate. With the world's lowest fertility rate at 0.75 babies per woman, the country faces a significant challenge in maintaining its defense capabilities, especially against North Korea's much larger army. A recent study suggests a minimum of 500,000 soldiers are needed for adequate defense, placing South Korea in a difficult strategic position. This demographic crisis has fueled debates about national security, including controversial proposals to conscript women into the mandatory 18-month military service.</p>

          <p>A unique summer camp in the Carpathian mountains of western Ukraine offers therapeutic support to children whose parents are missing due to the war. Run by the charity Gen.Ukrainian, the camp helps children cope with the ambiguous loss and trauma of having a parent who may be a prisoner of war, presumed dead, or trapped in occupied territory. Psychologists at the camp explain that these children are often in a "frozen state," unable to grieve properly and living with constant uncertainty. Through group therapy, art, and recreational activities, the camp provides a safe space for them to share their experiences and find solidarity with others facing similar situations.</p>

          <p>Tesla, the electric vehicle and energy company led by Elon Musk, has applied for a license to supply electricity directly to households and businesses in the UK. If approved by the energy regulator Ofgem, Tesla could enter the British energy market as early as next year, challenging established utility companies. The company already operates a similar service in Texas, allowing customers to power their homes and charge their vehicles, often at a lower cost. This strategic move leverages Tesla's existing UK customer base of over a quarter-million EV owners and thousands of home battery installations, even as the company faces declining vehicle sales in Europe.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced that his country will officially recognize a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly in September. The decision follows commitments from the Palestinian Authority to demilitarize, hold elections, and continue recognizing Israel's right to exist, with assurances that Hamas will have no role in a future state. This move aligns Australia with other nations like the UK, France, and Canada, and is framed as an effort to advance a two-state solution and break the cycle of violence. The announcement has drawn criticism from Israel, which argues that such recognition "rewards terrorism," and diverges from the U.S. position on the matter.</p>

In social media posts, Trump announced a tough new approach, stating the homeless must move immediately and that there would be no "Mr. Nice Guy" in dealing with criminals. The deployment, which included at least 120 FBI agents, appeared to confuse some residents, while homeless individuals in nearby encampments expressed fear of displacement. This action comes despite official data showing that violent crime in the city hit a 30-year low in 2024, and it fuels speculation about a potential federal takeover of policing in the capital.</p>

His administration, a coalition with the Social Democrats, is navigating a hyperpolarized environment where compromise is often viewed as weakness. Merz is simultaneously accused of being too far left and too close to the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), which is actively working to undermine his government. Despite the negative portrayal, Merz's strategy focuses on demonstrating competence and delivering on key issues like infrastructure and security, hoping this pragmatic approach will counter the populist tide and stabilize his coalition.</p>

The agreement signals a complex phase in U.S.-China trade relations, where market access for American tech firms is being tied directly to financial returns for the U.S. government.

For instance, the handout represents over 13% of an average resident's annual income in the poor province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in wealthy Shanghai.

          <p>Firefighters in western Colorado are battling two major, lightning-caused wildfires that have burned over 120,000 acres. The larger blaze, the Lee Fire, has forced evacuations in two counties and threatened the town of Meeker. The fires are fueled by severe drought conditions, allowing them to spread rapidly even with moderate winds, and have created dangerous situations that have forced crews to pull back for safety. While resources are flowing into the region due to a relatively quiet fire season elsewhere, the weather forecast predicts continued hot, dry, and windy conditions, offering no immediate relief for firefighters or residents affected by poor air quality.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 6.1 earthquake struck Turkey's northwestern Balikesir province, resulting in the death of an 81-year-old woman who was pulled from the rubble in the town of Sindirgi. The quake, which was felt as far away as Istanbul, caused the collapse of 16 buildings and injured at least 29 people, according to Turkey's interior minister. Search and rescue operations have concluded, with officials stating there were no other signs of serious casualties. Turkey is situated on major tectonic plates and frequently experiences seismic activity, including a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake in February 2023 that killed over 50,000 people in the country's southeast.</p>

          <p>NASCAR rookie Connor Zilisch, 19, suffered a broken collarbone after falling from the roof of his car while celebrating a victory in the Xfinity Series race at Watkins Glen. After winning the race, Zilisch climbed onto his car to celebrate but lost his balance and fell head-first to the ground. He was taken to a hospital, where CT scans for a head injury came back clear, but the collarbone fracture forced him to withdraw from the following day's Cup Series race.

          <p>A coalition of top European leaders, including those from the EU, France, Germany, and the UK, has issued a joint statement emphasizing that a lasting peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Kyiv's involvement. The statement comes ahead of a planned one-on-one meeting between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. While welcoming U.S. efforts to end the conflict, the European leaders stressed that Ukraine must have freedom over its own destiny and that meaningful negotiations can only begin with a ceasefire. The White House has indicated it is open to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy joining the meeting, but it currently remains a bilateral summit as requested by Putin.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has introduced new measures to make it easier for NHS employers in England to hire newly qualified nurses and midwives, addressing a surplus of graduates. With up to three times more graduates than vacancies in some areas, the changes aim to cut red tape by allowing trusts to recruit based on anticipated need, even before formal vacancies arise. The Department of Health said the plan will support the record number of students who trained during the pandemic. While nursing unions welcomed the move as a source of hope for students, employer representatives raised concerns about how the new measures would be funded amid already strained budgets.</p>

          <p>The man who opened fire on the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, killing a police officer before dying himself, has been identified as Patrick Joseph White, a 30-year-old who had become fixated on his distrust of COVID-19 vaccines. According to authorities and his father, White blamed the vaccine for causing him depression and suicidal thoughts. The incident, which left bullet marks on several CDC buildings, has prompted a union representing CDC workers to demand that federal officials condemn vaccine misinformation, which they say puts scientists at risk. CDC employees will work remotely while campus security is assessed following the traumatic event.</p>
