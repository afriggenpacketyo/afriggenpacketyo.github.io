          <p>Shares of Kering, the parent company of Gucci and Saint Laurent, experienced a significant increase following reports that Renault's Luca de Meo is set to become the group's new CEO. De Meo, known for his successful turnaround of Renault, is expected to bring his brand management and marketing expertise to the luxury goods sector. Kering has faced challenges with its Gucci brand, leading to a decline in share value, so de Meo's appointment is seen as a strategic move to rejuvenate the brand and improve overall financial performance. Investors are optimistic that de Meo can replicate his success at Renault and revitalize Kering's key brands. Optimism for Kering's future has grown with this new development.</p>

          <p>Israel and Iran have continued their exchange of attacks, with Israel vowing that Tehran will "pay the price" for its latest missile strikes. Despite the ongoing conflict, financial markets initially showed signs of stability, with oil prices slightly retreating and stock indices in Tel Aviv and Europe opening higher. Analysts suggest that the muted market reaction may be due to hopes for a swift resolution to the conflict or a contained, surgical response by Israel. The conflict's potential impact on oil supplies and shipping lanes remains a key concern for investors. Market participants remain vigilant for further developments.</p>

          <p>China has increased its nuclear arsenal by 100 warheads in 2024, reaching a total of 600, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. This expansion is the fastest among all countries, raising concerns about a potential new nuclear arms race. While the overall global nuclear inventory has slightly declined, the report highlights the continued dominance of Russia and the United States, which together possess approximately 90% of the world's nuclear weapons. China maintains that its nuclear capabilities are at the minimum level required for national security and adheres to a "no first use" policy.</p>

          <p>A documentary titled "Sabbath Queen" follows the journey of Amichai Lau-Lavie, an openly queer rabbi, as he explores his identity and advocates for peace. Lau-Lavie, who comes from a long line of Orthodox rabbis, uses his unique platform to challenge homophobia, racism, and misogyny within Judaism. The film showcases his various initiatives, including Lab/Shul, an experimental Jewish community, and Storahtelling, a ritual theater company. Lau-Lavie emphasizes the importance of inclusivity and compassion, particularly in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, advocating for empathy towards both Israelis and Palestinians. He hopes to represent a Jewish lineage that prioritizes morality and universal values.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has drastically reduced its aid plans due to significant funding cuts. OCHA is now seeking $29 billion in funding, a substantial decrease from the $44 billion requested in December, as less than 13% of the required funds have been received. This reduction forces OCHA to prioritize aid to the most urgent needs, impacting assistance to millions of people in over 70 countries. The agency attributes the funding shortfall to cuts from major donor countries, including the United States, and global economic uncertainty. OCHA calls for greater global responsibility and commitment to alleviate suffering.</p>

          <p>An Australian police officer was fatally shot while serving a warrant to repossess a home in North Motton, Tasmania. The officer was shot by a member of the public upon arrival at the property, prompting a response from a second officer who injured the suspect before he surrendered. The incident is considered shocking due to the rarity of deadly shootings in Australia, which has strict gun laws. Investigations are underway, and support is being provided to those affected by this tragedy. The officer is remembered as a dedicated member of the community with 25 years of service.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to discuss Cyprus' potential role in the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC) during his visit to the country. The IMEC is a trade link via sea and railway that is widely seen as a counter to China's Belt and Road Initiative. Modi's visit also carries symbolic weight, seen as a message to Turkey, which has historically supported Pakistan against India.

However, analysts doubt that Europe can overtake the established influence of the U.S. or China in the region, as economic ties are the primary driver of relationships in Southeast Asia. The EU needs to increase its presence and investment in the region to compete effectively. Trade remains the most important factor in Southeast Asian relationships.</p>

          <p>Scotland will export up to 100 truckloads of waste daily to England following the implementation of a landfill ban on biodegradable municipal waste. The ban, aimed at reducing methane emissions, is set to begin at the end of the year, but current incinerator capacity is insufficient to handle the additional waste. This has led to concerns about increased emissions from transporting waste and the potential for hindering long-term recycling efforts. While the Scottish government views this as a temporary solution, critics worry about the environmental impact and the lack of progress in domestic recycling rates. The long-term environmental strategy aims to reduce waste generation.</p>

          <p>As anti-ICE riots continue across major U.S. cities, individuals involved in violent actions during protests may face federal charges, including potential "domestic terrorism" designations. While there is no specific crime called domestic terrorism in U.S. law, prosecutors can use existing laws to file charges such as arson, assault on federal officers, destruction of property, or conspiracy. Peaceful protesters exercising their First Amendment rights are not subject to such investigations or charges. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security consider violent extremists with anarchist or anti-government beliefs as part of the domestic terrorism threat landscape, especially when violence is organized and politically motivated.</p>

The proposed measures include tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip), a benefit for people with long-term health conditions. Despite concerns from Labour MPs, Starmer insists that the reforms are necessary to address a system that is not working for those who need support or for taxpayers. The government has introduced a transition period for those whose benefits are being withdrawn, but some MPs view this concession as insufficient.

Israel responded with strikes on command centers in Tehran, warning that Tehran's residents would "pay the price" for the attacks.

          <p>A 57-year-old man has been arrested in Minnesota on suspicion of killing a Democratic state lawmaker and her husband. The arrest followed a two-day manhunt after the deaths of Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, which the State Governor called a "politically motivated assassination". The suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, is also alleged to have shot and wounded Democratic State Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette, who are both now awake in hospital. Boelter was armed at the time of his arrest but surrendered peacefully.</p>

          <p>In Gaza, hunger has been used as a weapon of war, and newly established US-backed distribution points, intended to provide food, have become death traps due to Israeli forces' actions. Many have been killed while trying to access these facilities, with reports of dozens killed on various dates. The aid system, unlike previous Unrwa models, lacks structure, humanity, and community-based support, leading to chaotic scrambles for limited supplies. People are desperate and hungry, with food being a right rather than a privilege, yet they are living through famine. This article paints a grim picture of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that ice jams in the Yellow River's estuary will become more frequent by the end of this century due to global warming. As warmer weather causes upstream ice to break apart, it drifts downstream and refreezes, forming ice jams that can lead to destructive flooding. The study, based on 160 years of data, highlights a shift in the geographic distribution of ice jam hotspots downstream. The Yellow River, known as both the cradle of Chinese civilization and "China's Sorrow," faces increasing risks from these localized hazards. This article has an environmental tone.</p>
