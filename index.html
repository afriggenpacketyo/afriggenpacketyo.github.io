          <p>A 15-year-old boy has been found guilty of murdering his classmate, Harvey Willgoose, also 15, at a Sheffield school. The stabbing, which occurred with a hunting knife during a lunch break, followed a social media dispute between the two teenagers. The defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had admitted to manslaughter but denied murder, claiming he "snapped" and lost control. The jury delivered a majority guilty verdict after a month-long trial, and the boy now faces a likely life sentence.</p>

          <p>The father of Rom Braslavski, a 22-year-old Israeli hostage, has penned an emotional open letter describing the horror of seeing his son in a recent propaganda video released by Islamic Jihad. He details his son's emaciated and broken appearance after 670 days in captivity, a stark contrast to his previously strong demeanor. The father directly appeals to former President Trump, citing his perceived strength, to use his influence to secure the release of all remaining hostages, calling Hamas's actions of mass murder, sexual assault, and abduction an assault on civilization.</p>

          <p>Israel's plan to expand its military operations and take control of Gaza City has drawn sharp condemnation from international bodies and world leaders. The UN human rights chief warned the move would cause more death, displacement, and suffering, while the UK's Prime Minister called it "wrong" and Germany halted the export of military equipment that could be used in Gaza. The plan also faces internal opposition from hostage families, who fear it endangers the remaining captives and ignores military warnings, calling it a "colossal catastrophe."</p>

          <p>An article advises that savers consider opening a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) with a significant deposit, such as $10,000, before September. The reasoning is based on the high probability of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, which would likely lead to lower rates on savings products. By locking in a currently high rate with a short-term CD, savers can maximize earnings without committing their funds for an extended period, offering a balance of high returns and future flexibility in a shifting economic climate.

The meeting comes amid criticism over the administration's response to calls for releasing all related documents. Officials are said to be weighing whether to release audio from a recent Department of Justice interview with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's convicted accomplice. This follows a House Oversight Committee subpoena for the files and letters from victims criticizing the DOJ's approach to the case.</p>

Trump has threatened to impose "secondary tariffs" of around 100% on countries trading with Russia if Moscow does not end its invasion. This move marks a significant escalation in pressure on the Kremlin, as the administration seeks to make ending the war a key foreign policy achievement.

          <p>While the national average interest rate for savings accounts remains low at 0.38%, high-yield savings accounts, particularly from online banks, offer significantly higher returns, with some reaching over 4.30%. These accounts provide a safe, FDIC-insured option for growing an emergency fund, helping savings outpace inflation. Experts recommend comparing various online bank offerings to find the best rates and lowest fees. The streamlined online application process and low minimum deposit requirements make these accounts an accessible and effective tool for savers looking to maximize their interest earnings.

This move allows him to rule indefinitely without facing direct elections, extending his family's 58-year dynasty. Observers and human rights activists fear this could set a dangerous precedent for other African leaders seeking to cement their power.

Bao, who played a key role in bringing major Chinese tech firms to global markets, disappeared in early 2023 while "cooperating" with an unspecified investigation. During his absence, he resigned as CEO and chairman but remains the company's controlling shareholder. News of his release provided a boost to the company's stock, which had plummeted during his detention and the subsequent uncertainty.</p>

          <p>According to a recent CNBC survey, President Donald Trump's overall and economic approval ratings remain negative, with 51% of the public disapproving of his job performance. However, the poll also reveals a historic low in favorability for the Democratic Party, which now has a net -32 rating. Despite his own low numbers, Trump's position is bolstered by this decline in Democratic support. The survey highlights conflicting public views, with economic optimism improving slightly even as a majority reports their incomes are falling behind the cost of living. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced a plan to spend $600 billion in the U.S. over four years, a move seen as appeasing President Trump's push for domestic manufacturing without committing to full iPhone assembly in the country. The investment focuses on expanding partnerships with U.S. suppliers like Corning for glass and Coherent for sensors, and increasing chip purchases from U.S. facilities. This strategy allows Trump to claim a victory for American jobs, while Apple avoids the massive costs of relocating its final assembly lines, securing a tariff exemption on chips in the process.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI) has identified the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 as the most stolen vehicle in the United States. The high-performance muscle car, which retails for over $75,000, had a theft rate 39 times higher than the average for recent model years. The analysis found that powerful, expensive vehicles and pickup trucks are common targets for thieves. The Camaro's vulnerability is heightened by an on-board data port that can be exploited by knowledgeable thieves to steal the vehicle relatively easily, despite recent software security updates from GM.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's predictable four-year price cycle, which has historically revolved around its "halving" event, is showing signs of breaking down. Analysts suggest that the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has brought in more long-term institutional investors, altering market dynamics and leading to a new all-time high before the last halving, contrary to past patterns. Other factors, such as a more supportive regulatory environment and less market volatility, may mean the era of 80% price crashes is over, leading to a new, more stable but less predictable market behavior.

          <p>New research has revealed a concerning paradox in China's water systems: while many cities are experiencing more extreme rainfall, the overall volume of water in the country's rivers has declined over the past 60 years.

This trend poses a significant challenge for the nation, as these rivers are essential for sustaining its 1.4 billion people, vast agricultural lands, and industrial output.</p>
