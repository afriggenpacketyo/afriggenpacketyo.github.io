          <p>Elon Musk has announced the end of his tenure as a Special Government Employee, leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), established by President Trump to reduce wasteful spending. Musk expressed gratitude to Trump for the opportunity to restructure the federal government and believes DOGE's mission will continue to strengthen. The decision for Musk's departure was made at the "senior staff" level, and he did not have a conversation with the president before announcing his exit, according to a Reuters report citing a White House official. Musk is expected to return to his businesses, including Tesla and SpaceX, after his 130-day term expired around May 30.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has publicly criticized Israel's military conduct in Gaza, describing it as "beyond comprehension," particularly in response to an Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced civilians. Merz stressed Germany's historical awareness but emphasized the need to speak out when international humanitarian law is violated. The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Ron Prosor, responded cautiously, acknowledging Merz's friendship and claiming Israel is trying to save hostages, provide aid, and prevent a "terrorist regime." Experts suggest the muted Israeli response indicates Merz's remarks have resonated deeply within the Israeli political establishment, especially given concerns about Israel's growing international isolation.</p>

With Germany's historic fiscal package enabling higher defense spending, Renk is collaborating with the automotive industry, which faces challenges from a sluggish economy and competition from China and the U.S. Renk's CEO Alexander Sagel and COO Emmerich Schiller, both with automotive backgrounds, are capitalizing on this cross-industry collaboration by hiring engineers from the automotive sector. The company is looking for engineers who can adapt to the defense industry and bring in methods like continuous improvement to increase efficiency and quality.</p>

          <p>Consumers in Japan will be able to purchase rice released from government stockpiles for around $12 per 5 kilograms at smaller supermarkets by the second week of June, according to Japan's farm minister. The ministry is limiting potential buyers to small supermarkets and rice shops to ensure broad distribution after stopping orders from major retailers due to robust demand. In related news, Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggested purchases of U.S. defense equipment may help reduce the trade deficit. Toyota reported a 10% increase in global sales in April ahead of the impact of higher U.S. tariffs, while Nissan is soliciting early retirements in the U.S. as part of turnaround efforts.</p>

          <p>Portugal's anti-immigration Chega party has become the main opposition in parliament, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape and joining the surge of far-right forces in Europe. The party secured 60 of the National Assembly's 230 seats, surpassing the Socialists by two seats. This is a major accomplishment for Chega, which competed in its first election six years ago and has gained traction with its hardline stance against immigration and the inability of traditional parties to form lasting governments. The center-right Democratic Alliance will face an emboldened far-right competitor campaigning under the slogan "Save Portugal."</p>

Analysts also point to the high offer price and additional investment commitments as deterrents, especially given U.S. Steel's recent net loss.

The article discusses the radicalization process that some young Americans undergo, often through Zionist summer camps and other social apparatuses.

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggested that increased purchases of U.S. defense equipment could help reduce the trade deficit, potentially serving as a bargaining chip in bilateral tariff talks. However, he also emphasized that tariff negotiations and security matters should be treated separately. Japan is seeking the removal of higher tariffs on cars, car parts, and steel and aluminum imposed by the U.S. The Trump administration has been resistant to completely removing these levies. Japan hopes to schedule a summit between Prime Minister Ishiba and President Trump to address these trade issues.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has undermined President Trump's key economic policy by blocking his sweeping tariffs, a decision that will likely lead to White House appeals. The Court of International Trade ruled that the president lacks the authority to impose such tariffs without congressional approval. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to levy universal duties on imports. The ruling applies to tariffs against China, Mexico, and Canada, designed to combat fentanyl coming into the United States.</p>

However, the recent fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington has caused some British officials to reconsider the timing of potential sanctions.

He states that the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in "critical fields." Depending on how broadly the State Department and Department of Homeland Security define these criteria, the edict could affect many of the 280,000 or so Chinese high school, university, and graduate level students currently in the U.S.</p>

          <p>An F.B.I. intelligence memo offers new details on why the bureau concluded that some Venezuelan government officials were likely to have had some responsibility for a criminal gang‚Äôs actions in the United States, pitting it against other intelligence agencies in a heated dispute over President Trump‚Äôs use of a wartime law. The memo, whose conclusions the remaining intelligence agencies have rejected, was submitted by the administration to a federal judge in Texas. The memo detailed what only one of them had said, however.</p>
