          <p>Michael Schill has announced his resignation as president of Northwestern University after a three-year tenure. His leadership was marked by significant challenges, including campus protests over the war in Gaza and a hiring freeze following the Trump administration's decision to freeze nearly $800 million in federal research funding. Schill, who defended the university's handling of pro-Palestinian encampments before Congress, will take a sabbatical before returning to teach at the law school. The funding cuts have already led to hundreds of layoffs and created anxiety among students and faculty about the future of research at the institution.</p>

          <p>During a fiery Senate Finance Committee hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended recent leadership changes at the CDC, including the ousting of its director, Susan Monarez. Kennedy clashed with senators from both parties over his controversial views on vaccines and the administration's new policies that have created confusion and limited access to COVID-19 shots for some Americans. He denied claims that he pressured Monarez to rubber-stamp vaccine recommendations, instead asserting she was untrustworthy. The combative testimony highlighted deep divisions and concerns over the direction of U.S. public health policy under his leadership.</p>

          <p>In a strategic political move, Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani has challenged President Trump to a debate, bypassing former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who had called for debates in the New York City mayoral race. The challenge comes amid reports that the Trump administration is attempting to persuade incumbent Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa to exit the race, creating a direct contest between Cuomo and Mamdani. While Cuomo seeks a head-to-head matchup with Mamdani, both Adams and Sliwa have publicly stated they have no intention of dropping out. This development adds another layer of complexity and national political intrigue to the city's mayoral election.</p>

The chipmaker announced it had secured $10 billion in orders for its custom AI chips, known as XPUs, from a fourth major, unnamed cloud customer. This new business has boosted the company's projected AI revenue, which is expected to reach $6.2 billion in the current quarter.

          <p>ESPN host Laura Rutledge revealed on a podcast that she once created a "burner" social media account to defend her husband, former MLB player Josh Rutledge, from online critics. During his playing career from 2012 to 2017, she operated under the alias "BillyHalo76," posting positive comments and statistics to counter negative commentary about his performance. Rutledge admitted the act was wrong and a one-time occurrence, humorously noting she would occasionally tweet about superstar Mike Trout to make the account seem more authentic.

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is considering a new measure that would require landlords to ensure their rental units can be maintained at or below 82 degrees Fahrenheit. This proposal follows a similar law recently passed for unincorporated areas of L.A. County and aims to address the severe health risks posed by extreme heat, which disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. Proponents argue it is a critical public health issue, similar to existing heating requirements, as climate change intensifies heat waves. However, landlord associations oppose the measure, citing concerns about increased costs for electrical upgrades and higher utility bills for tenants, which could drive up rents.</p>

          <p>With home equity at record highs and a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut on the horizon, homeowners may be considering tapping into their home's value. However, before taking out a home equity loan, it is crucial to assess several factors to avoid financial risk, including potential foreclosure. Key questions to answer include determining the actual amount of equity available to borrow and evaluating if the financial need is truly urgent enough to justify the loan's cost. Homeowners should also weigh the benefits of securing a rate now against the possibility of lower rates in the future following anticipated Fed actions. (not investment advice)</p>

While stablecoins offer the efficiency of digital currency with the stability of fiat money, their proliferation outside of China's control complicates its efforts to promote the yuan and maintain capital controls.

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its legal battle to remove Democratic Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter by asking the Supreme Court for an emergency stay. This request follows lower court rulings that blocked the president's attempt to fire her, citing federal laws that protect commissioners at certain independent agencies from being removed without cause to ensure their political independence. The Justice Department argues that the modern FTC wields more power than it did when a 1935 precedent was set, and therefore its members should serve at the president's pleasure. The case represents a significant challenge to the established independence of federal regulatory bodies.</p>

          <p>The NBA has launched an investigation following allegations that Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard received $21 million in undisclosed payments from Aspiration Partners, a startup largely funded by Clippers owner Steve Ballmer. A report from The Athletic suggests these payments, contracted for endorsement work that was allegedly never performed, may have been a way to circumvent the league's salary cap, which exists to ensure competitive parity. The Clippers have strongly denied any misconduct, stating that endorsement deals between team sponsors and players are common. This situation brings renewed focus on the NBA's strict rules against salary cap circumvention, which previously resulted in severe penalties for the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2000.</p>

The seaweed, Heterosiphonia japonica, was pushed onto the shore and into a local estuary by the high surf and winds from the recent Hurricane Erin. As the seaweed decomposes without a strong tide to wash it back out, it releases a strong, unpleasant odor that has alarmed residents. While the smell is a natural part of the decay process, it has created a significant nuisance for the coastal community.</p>

          <p>A fast-growing wildfire in California's Sierra Nevada foothills has swept through Chinese Camp, a historic town founded by Chinese miners during the 19th-century Gold Rush. The fire, part of the TCU September Lightning Complex, has destroyed several historic buildings and forced the evacuation of the town's residents. Chinese Camp, a state historical landmark, was known for its preserved 19th-century atmosphere and was a popular stop for tourists. Historians and residents fear the irreplaceable loss of a tangible link to California's past, as the fire erases structures that had stood for over 150 years.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service has temporarily closed a post office in Torrance, California, after tests confirmed asbestos contamination within the building. As a safety precaution, thousands of pieces of mail and packages that were inside the facility are being collected and destroyed in accordance with federal and state regulations. While tests showed no asbestos in the air ducts or public areas, the presence of contamination elsewhere prompted the shutdown. Mail services have been relocated to nearby facilities, and it remains unclear how long the Monterey Street post office will be closed or if any workers were exposed.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 17:20:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article sharply criticizes the decision by Florida's surgeon general to eliminate all vaccine mandates, framing it as a dangerous and illogical move that jeopardizes children's health. The author argues that this policy, guided by the anti-vaccine stance of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., risks the resurgence of preventable diseases by undermining herd immunity. The piece satirically suggests the state has decided "there were too many children" and contrasts the state's new hands-off approach to vaccines with its strict anti-abortion laws. The author concludes that this rejection of established science is a tragic step backward for public health and child safety.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Ecuador, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the U.S. will designate the "Los Lobos" and "Los Choneros" gangs as foreign terrorist organizations. This designation allows Washington to freeze the gangs' assets, target their associates, and enhance intelligence sharing for "potentially lethal" operations against them. The move is intended to support Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa's "war" on organized crime, as the country has become a major transit point for cocaine. The U.S. also pledged millions in security and technology assistance, signaling a tougher regional approach to combating narco-trafficking and associated violence.</p>

          <p>An internal NFL report for the 2024 season, obtained by CNBC, reveals a wide disparity in ticket revenue among the league's 32 teams. The San Francisco 49ers topped the league with $176.5 million in net ticket receipts, significantly outpacing the second-place Dallas Cowboys and the league average. At the other end of the spectrum, the Tennessee Titans ranked last with $81.2 million. The report also details how teams contribute a portion of their ticket revenue to a shared pool, which is then redistributed to ensure a degree of financial parity across the league.

          <p>A federal jury in San Francisco has ordered Google to pay $425.7 million in a class-action lawsuit for violating California privacy laws by improperly tracking smartphone users. The case, which covered approximately 98 million devices between 2016 and 2024, found that Google snooped on user activity even when people thought they had activated privacy controls. Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that Google illegally used this data to boost its ad revenue. Google has denied the allegations, stating the decision misunderstands how its products work, and has announced its intention to appeal the verdict.</p>

          <p>Germany's 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign began with a stunning and historic 2-0 defeat to Slovakia in Bratislava. The loss marked the first time Germany has ever lost a World Cup qualifier away from home. The team appeared lethargic and out of sync, with head coach Julian Nagelsmann lamenting a lack of emotion and intensity from his players. Both Nagelsmann and captain Joshua Kimmich suggested the issues were related to mindset rather than tactics, as the team struggled in all areas of the game. The unexpected result raises early questions about the team's form following their disappointing Nations League performance.</p>

          <p>Daniel Levy's nearly 25-year tenure as Tottenham's chairman will be remembered as a paradox of off-field triumph and on-field frustration. He masterfully oversaw the club's transformation into a financial powerhouse, complete with a state-of-the-art £1 billion stadium and elite training facilities. However, this business acumen is often overshadowed by a lack of major trophies and a revolving door of managers, which created a sense of instability. While lauded as a shrewd negotiator, his perceived caution in the transfer market and prioritization of finances over on-pitch ambition made him a frequent target of fan protests, cementing a complex and contentious legacy.</p>

The company stated the move is necessary to ensure it can continue to support its customers, as negotiations with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union have stalled. The union, which is seeking a better contract for workers who assemble F-15 fighter jets and missile systems, criticized the decision, calling on Boeing to return to the negotiating table.

          <p>For mixed-status families across the U.S., the new school year is accompanied by intense anxiety over immigration enforcement. Undocumented parents of U.S.-citizen children express deep-seated fears that they could be detained by ICE while dropping off or picking up their kids from school. Although ICE policy generally avoids enforcement actions at schools, reports of parents being detained nearby have led some families to limit their public activities and have caused dips in school attendance. This constant fear creates a stressful environment for both parents and children, forcing families to make contingency plans like granting power of attorney in case of sudden deportation.</p>
