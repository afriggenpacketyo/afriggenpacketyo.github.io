        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump finalized a trade deal with Japan by signing an executive order, which establishes a 15% baseline tariff on most Japanese imports, including automobiles. As part of the agreement, Japan committed to investing $550 billion in U.S. government-selected projects and significantly increasing its purchases of American agricultural products, commercial aircraft, and defense equipment, alongside opening market access in several key sectors. This trade agreement was reached after months of negotiations, and its formalization occurs amidst considerable political instability for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who is facing a potential leadership challenge and calls for his resignation due to recent election setbacks and internal party dissatisfaction.

          <p>The Pentagon reported that two Venezuelan military aircraft flew near a U.S. Navy vessel operating in international waters, characterizing the action as a "highly provocative move" designed to impede counter-narco-terror operations. This incident escalates tensions between the nations, coming shortly after President Trump authorized a U.S. military strike in the Caribbean against a vessel allegedly carrying drug smugglers, which resulted in 11 deaths. The Defense Department issued a stern warning to the Venezuelan government, which it referred to as a "cartel," to cease any efforts to obstruct or interfere with U.S. military counter-narcotics and counter-terror activities. The U.S. Navy has recently deployed additional ships to the Caribbean and Pacific to support these ongoing efforts, highlighting the strategic importance of these operations in the region.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that "fairly substantial" tariffs on semiconductor imports are imminent, targeting companies that do not shift their production to the U.S. However, he clarified that firms demonstrating significant domestic investment, such as Apple, which has pledged hundreds of billions towards U.S. manufacturing, would be spared from these levies. Trump conveyed this message during a White House dinner attended by numerous tech industry leaders, underscoring the administration's strategic push to bolster the domestic semiconductor supply chain. This policy aims to incentivize global chip giants like TSMC and Samsung, who have already committed substantial funds to building U.S. plants, ensuring they receive exemptions.

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order authorizing the Department of Defense to use "Department of War" as a secondary title, aiming to project a more powerful image. This move, which cannot permanently change the name without congressional legislation, will also instruct Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to recommend further legislative and executive actions for a full renaming. Trump has frequently expressed his preference for the older name, which was used until 1947 when the department was consolidated after World War Two. The administration believes this change "conveys a stronger message of readiness and resolve" to the world.</p>

During a public appearance to promote her new book, Barrett explained that she perceived Justice Jackson's arguments as being made in strong terms, necessitating an equally robust response. She emphasized her profound respect for Jackson, clarifying that their disagreement was purely intellectual, focusing on the fundamental scope of judicial power rather than any personal animosity. Barrett stated, "I attack ideas. I don't attack people," attributing this philosophy to the late Justice Antonin Scalia.</p>

          <p>The Defense Department is considering a request from the Justice Department to deploy up to 600 military attorneys as temporary immigration judges, aiming to alleviate a backlog of over 3.4 million cases. Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell confirmed the process of identifying qualified Judge Advocates and civilian attorneys for these temporary assignments. This plan follows the Trump administration's recent relaxation of job requirements for temporary immigration judges, broadening the pool of eligible government lawyers. However, the American Immigration Lawyers Association has voiced strong criticism, arguing that immigration law's complexity differs significantly from military legal expertise, potentially undermining due process and the immigration court system's integrity.</p>

This intervention involved the removal of a basal cell carcinoma, one of the most common skin cancer types. The surgery comes months after Biden disclosed a diagnosis of stage-four prostate cancer in May, which had metastasized to his bones and was characterized by an aggressive Gleason score of nine. Despite the seriousness of the prostate cancer, his office indicated it is hormone-sensitive, offering avenues for effective management as he explores multiple treatment options.</p>

This verdict represents a significant development in the decade-long, high-profile case, with Adelson being the fifth person found guilty.

Meta has since reinstated his account, acknowledging it was disabled in error, and pledged to prevent future occurrences.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.7 billion, becoming the third-largest in U.S. lottery history, with a cash value of $770.3 million. A CBS News data analysis examined the financial implications for winners across different states, revealing substantial variations in net payouts after taxes. Federal law mandates a 24% withholding on winnings over $5,000, with an additional 14.6% due at tax time. However, states like California, Florida, and Texas, which do not levy their own lottery taxes, allow winners to retain the most funds. Conversely, states with higher income taxes on prizes, such as New York and Minnesota, yield the lowest after-tax annuitized payouts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Atlantic strongly criticizes President Trump's proposed renaming of the Department of Defense to the "Department of War," labeling it as "inanity" and a mere political spectacle. The article argues that this change, expected via executive order, reflects Trump and Secretary Pete Hegseth's desire to project a more aggressive image, rather than a thoughtful strategic shift. It emphasizes that the original renaming in 1947 by President Harry Truman was a deliberate move to reflect a broader concept of national security beyond discrete conditions of "war" and "peace." The piece also notes that even adversarial nations like China and Russia utilize "Ministry of Defense," undermining the notion that "War" conveys superior strength.</p>

Although the specific models and their full operational capabilities remain largely undisclosed, the visible GJ-11 drone, previously unveiled in 2019, is recognized as a highly stealthy, strike-focused platform.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a confounding three-game sweep at the hands of the last-place Pittsburgh Pirates, a performance that veteran infielder Miguel Rojas labeled "frustrating" and "embarrassing." The Dodgers' offense was largely stifled by Cy Young frontrunner Paul Skenes, who delivered six scoreless innings. This series loss, coupled with their inconsistent 4-12 record against teams with losing records since July 4, has raised significant concerns about their ability to secure a top playoff seed and avoid a wild-card series. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the team's ongoing slump, while players stressed the need to find joy and renewed motivation to overcome their second-half struggles.</p>

          <p>Sam Mihara, a 92-year-old survivor, recently revisited the Heart Mountain Relocation Center in Wyoming, one of ten internment camps where over 120,000 Japanese Americans were forcibly imprisoned during World War II. Mihara, who was nine when his family was unjustly uprooted from San Francisco, recounted the profound suffering endured, including his father's blindness and his grandfather's death within the camp. Retired Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lance Ito, whose parents met at Heart Mountain, also described the site as an "American concentration camp," emphasizing the "racist" nature of this historical injustice and the subsequent widespread discrimination faced by Japanese Americans upon their release.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has upheld an injunction, preventing the Trump administration from enforcing a policy directive that aimed to restrict transgender and nonbinary Americans from obtaining passports accurately reflecting their gender identities. This policy, stemming from an executive order to exclusively recognize male and female biological genders, reversed a previous Biden administration allowance for an "X" neutral sex indicator. The appeals court affirmed a district judge's conclusion that Trump's policy was arbitrary and based on "unconstitutional animus" towards transgender Americans, causing "immediate and irreparable harms." The Trump administration's appeal was rejected due to its failure to adequately address the lower court's finding regarding this discriminatory intent.</p>

Hodgkiss, who served the school for 15 years, was terminated after five transfer students were deemed ineligible by the Southern Section for providing false information, leading the school to forfeit its remaining games and self-report violations. The attorney asserts that the transferred players possessed legitimate documentation and that their moves were not primarily athletically motivated, instead suggesting a systemic strategy by an unidentified school official to "create a team that could compete" with elite programs.</p>

          <p>China's central province of Hunan is exploring an innovative application for its digital yuan, or e-CNY, by using it to address persistent payment defaults and long-delayed debts. This initiative represents a significant expansion of the central bank-backed currency's scope beyond its current use cases since its 2019 introduction. The proposed model aims to leverage the digital yuan's inherent traceability to ensure funds flow directly to the final recipient in complex payment chains, thereby increasing transparency and control in often opaque financial relationships. Analysts believe this approach could substantially enhance real-time visibility over economic transactions, potentially mitigating the widespread issue of payment defaults in China's economy.

          <p>A Southern California Lyft driver was reportedly assaulted by a seemingly intoxicated passenger who kicked him in the head and directed xenophobic comments at him, prompting a search by authorities. The incident, captured by a dashcam, unfolded on the 55 Freeway when the driver, identified as Tinh, asked a woman to remove her feet from the middle console. The passenger reacted with obscenities and questions like, "Who let you in here?", before physically assaulting the driver. The California Highway Patrol is actively investigating the verbal and physical assault, which the driver, a legal resident, described as a deeply disturbing and unprovoked attack.</p>

The 2-1 ruling, featuring two Trump-appointed judges in the majority, granted the request from Florida and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to block an order that would have halted the facility's expansion and initiated its dismantling. Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe had contended the center required federal environmental reviews, but the appellate court found that state and federal officials would likely demonstrate the facility was not subject to such acts given its lack of federal funding. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis praised the decision as a "win for the American people."</p>
