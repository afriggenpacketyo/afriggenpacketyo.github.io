          <p>Officials have declared a "mass casualty event" in central Texas after catastrophic flash floods struck the Hill Country, resulting in at least 24 deaths. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, catching communities and a children's summer camp by surprise. A significant number of people, including 23 to 25 campers from Camp Mystic, remain unaccounted for, prompting a massive search and rescue operation involving helicopters and hundreds of personnel. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a disaster declaration, promising unlimited state resources to aid in the rescue and recovery efforts in the flood-ravaged region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are maintaining their trade deadline plans after third baseman Max Muncy sustained a knee injury that was less severe than initially feared. Muncy suffered a bone bruise, not a ligament tear, and is expected to miss approximately six weeks, allowing him to return before the playoffs. Confident in his recovery and content to rely on internal options like Tommy Edman in the interim, the team's management has indicated they do not feel pressured to make a major trade to replace him. This cautious optimism stems from avoiding a season-ending catastrophe for a key offensive player.</p>

          <p>Authorities in New York City temporarily closed a portion of the beach in Far Rockaway, Queens, on the Fourth of July after multiple sharks were spotted swimming very close to beachgoers. City officials utilized drone technology to monitor the situation and ensure public safety, reopening the beach after about an hour. This incident comes as New York state officials, including Governor Kathy Hochul, have been increasing shark surveillance measures along Long Island's popular beaches to protect residents and visitors during the busy summer holiday season.</p>

          <p>As the United States increases scrutiny of China's shipbuilding industry, South Korea and Japan are strategically moving to strengthen their own sectors. South Korea's new presidential administration has labeled the domestic industry as being in a "major crisis" and has committed to revitalizing it through new growth policies. These measures focus on advancing the development of future vessels, including autonomous and eco-friendly ships, through enhanced digitalization and automation. The goal is to re-establish the nation as a global maritime power that leads in innovation and production.</p>

          <p>A Connecticut law that allows towing companies to sell impounded vehicles after just 15 days is facing sharp criticism from residents and advocates who label it as predatory. The article highlights how this practice disproportionately affects working-class individuals who may be unable to afford the steep and rapidly accumulating fees to retrieve their cars in time. Residents of one Waterbury apartment complex reported that a single towing company, MyHoopty.com LLC, took over 1,000 cars in two years, prompting them to form a neighborhood watch to monitor the company's activities.</p>

          <p>The Madre Fire, burning in a rural area of San Luis Obispo County, has rapidly expanded to become the largest wildfire in California this year, scorching over 70,800 acres. With only 10% containment, the blaze poses an immediate threat to life and property, with over 200 people under evacuation orders and 50 structures threatened. Fueled by hot and windy conditions, the fire's cause remains under investigation as more than 600 personnel, supported by air tankers from across the state, work to control its spread.

          <p>A new study has revealed that tiny marine animals called zooplankton are unsung heroes in the fight against climate change, locking away vast amounts of carbon in the Southern Ocean. Through an epic annual migration, these creatures feast on carbon-rich phytoplankton near the surface, grow fat, and then sink hundreds of meters into the deep ocean to hibernate. This process effectively sequesters an amount of carbon equivalent to the annual emissions of 55 million cars, a far greater contribution to regulating the planet's climate than scientists had previously understood.</p>

          <p>Hamas has delivered what it calls a "positive response" to the latest US-backed proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza, stating it is ready to enter negotiations. However, a senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks clarified that Hamas accepted the general framework but requested several key amendments. These include a US guarantee that hostilities will not resume if permanent ceasefire talks fail and changes to aid distribution and Israeli troop withdrawal plans. This development puts the focus back on Israel and the US to address the requested changes and continue the diplomatic process.</p>

          <p>Germany started its Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a victory over Poland, but the win was tempered by a significant injury concern. Captain Giulia Gwinn, who has a history of two previous ACL tears, left the pitch in the first half with a knee injury, casting a shadow over the team's tournament prospects. Goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller secured the deserved win for the eight-time champions.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will implement significant changes at America's national parks. The order directs federal agencies to charge foreign tourists higher entry fees, with the additional revenue earmarked for park infrastructure and maintenance. It also mandates that U.S. residents receive preferential treatment in any park access rules, such as lotteries or permit systems. In a controversial move, the order also revokes a 2017 presidential memorandum that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the management and storytelling of public lands.</p>

          <p>A board-certified cardiologist, drawing on two decades of experience treating heart attacks, has identified five common foods he considers "toxic" and never gives to his own children. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemicals in the lining, sugary flavored yogurts, processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, sugary cereals and drinks, and deep-fried foods. He argues that these items contribute to inflammation and chronic illness later in life. The article provides healthier, home-prepared alternatives for each category, advocating for a diet focused on whole, unprocessed foods.</p>
