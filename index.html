          <h2>Maersk Cuts Global Container Market Outlook Amidst Trade Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 02:51:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shipping giant Maersk has revised its global container market volume growth forecast to -1% to 4% due to increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, despite posting stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profits. The company, a key indicator of global trade, maintained its full-year profit guidance between $6 billion and $9 billion. CEO Vincent Clerc noted that trade tensions and rising uncertainty are putting global supply chains in the spotlight, with ongoing disruptions in the Red Sea expected to continue throughout the year. The shipping industry is currently navigating a complex tariff landscape influenced by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies, including high import duties on products from China, which have led to retaliatory tariffs from Beijing.</p>

          <p>Slovakia and Hungary have strongly criticized the European Commission's plan to phase out Russian gas, nuclear energy, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports by 2027, describing it as "economic suicide." These eastern European nations, which have traditionally relied on cheaper Russian energy supplies, warn that banning such imports will lead to higher energy prices for consumers. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico stated that while Slovakia is willing to work towards reducing energy dependence on third countries, completely cutting off Russian energy sources would be detrimental to the region's economy. The EU's proposal aims to ensure full energy independence from Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p>

          <p>Nintendo projects to sell 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking the first sales forecast for the successor to the successful Switch device. The Switch 2, priced at $449.99 in the U.S., boasts improved features compared to its predecessor and is set to launch in June. The original Switch, launched in 2017, became Nintendo's second-best-selling console, and investors are optimistic about the company's continued popularity, with shares up 33% this year. However, pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the U.S. were delayed due to President Donald Trump's tariffs on countries where Nintendo's consoles are manufactured.</p>

          <p>Prisons Minister James Timpson is exploring the possibility of tagging more criminals as an alternative to imprisonment, emphasizing that he is not "soft on crime" but focused on evidence-based solutions. The government is meeting with over 30 companies, including Microsoft and Google, to explore how technology can improve offender monitoring in the community and address prison violence. Timpson, known for hiring ex-offenders, acknowledges the prison system is in crisis, with overcrowding and rising violence, while advocating for rehabilitation to reduce re-offending rates. Despite efforts, over 26% of adult criminals in England and Wales reoffend within a year of release, highlighting the need for comprehensive support systems.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor projects a significant decline in operating profit for the fiscal year ending in March, citing headwinds from a stronger yen and a $1.3 billion hit from President Trump's tariffs.

The murkiness of Toyota's forecast underscores the disruption caused by Trump's tariff agenda, leaving global companies unable to estimate future prospects.

          <p>Joseph Nye, a prominent scholar of international relations and influential figure in the U.S.-Japan alliance, has died at the age of 88. Nye, who served as dean of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government and held high-ranking positions in the U.S. government, was renowned for pioneering the theory of "soft power." This theory highlights how nonmilitary strengths, such as cultural curiosity, can influence the behavior of other countries. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed condolences, acknowledging Nye's significant contributions to deepening the bilateral alliance between the U.S. and Japan.</p>

          <p>New York City Police officers arrested dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators at Columbia University's Butler Library after the protesters occupied the building and vandalized property. Two public safety officers were injured during the incident, and the university requested NYPD assistance to remove trespassers and ensure the safety of the community. Columbia University President Claire Shipman emphasized that requesting the NYPD's presence was necessary due to the large number of individuals involved and safety hazards. The protests occurred during the school's pre-final exams reading week, prompting the university to restrict campus access and implement stricter identification policies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to announce the framework of a trade agreement with the UK, marking the first such deal since imposing sweeping tariffs. The specifics of the agreement remain unclear, but it may involve lowering British tariffs on US cars and farm products, as well as taxes on US technology companies. The announcement comes as a team of British trade negotiators landed in Washington to accelerate talks. This potential agreement follows Trump's recent announcement of tariffs on the film industry, which has created setbacks in trade talks.</p>

          <p>President Trump's consideration of imposing 100 percent tariffs on films made in "foreign lands" has caused concern within the British film and television industry, which relies heavily on Hollywood productions. The industry is still recovering from pandemic shutdowns and recent strikes, and the uncertainty surrounding tariffs could hinder progress. The British government is in active discussions with the U.S. administration to address the potential tariffs, while also working to establish what may be proposed. Some trade experts question how such tariffs could be enforced, given the increasingly international nature of film productions.</p>

          <p>An Israeli military operation in the West Bank has displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians, raising fears of potential annexation of the territory. The Israeli military has maintained a long-running presence in the heart of West Bank cities in decades. The campaign has targeted Hamas and another Palestinian militant group, Islamic Jihad. Since January, however, clashes have become rare, in a sign that Israel and the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank have arrested or killed many of the militants. Palestinians are concerned that the extended presence is undermining the powers of the Palestinian Authority, and that Israel is acting as if the Palestinian Authority doesnâ€™t exist.</p>

          <p>Agatha Christie, who died in 1976, has been digitally resurrected to teach an online writing course through BBC Maestro, using AI to create her likeness based on her writings and archival interviews. While the project has the full support of Christie's family, who emphasize that it is a representation and not an attempt to bring her back to life, it has ignited ethical debates about the use of AI to resurrect the dead. Some critics argue that even with consent, the course puts words in Christie's mouth and blurs the boundaries between fact and fiction, while others suggest it offers a new way for fans to engage with her work.</p>

Smaller, isolated patches might also lie near the surface, the team wrote in the latest issue of the Chinese journal, Science Bulletin.
