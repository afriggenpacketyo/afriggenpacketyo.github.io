            <p>The United States and European allies are set to hold high-level talks in Paris to discuss strategies for ending the war in Ukraine, marking the most significant transatlantic engagement on the conflict since February. European diplomats plan to urge the U.S. to exert more pressure on Russia to agree to an unconditional ceasefire. Ukrainian foreign and defense ministers will also participate in the discussions, which include meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. Secretary of State. The talks follow a recent Russian missile attack that resulted in numerous casualties in the Ukrainian city of Sumy.</p>

            <p>Chinese developers of low-altitude aircraft, including drones and electric taxis, are exploring foreign markets like the United States, despite the imposition of high import tariffs. These companies are motivated by an expected rise in overseas demand and a higher acceptance rate for their products compared to China. Shenzhen Zero Zero Infinity Technology, for instance, plans to continue selling its drones in the U.S. and Europe, banking on competitive pricing and AI integration. This move reflects a long-term diversification strategy for Chinese firms in the face of evolving global trade dynamics.</p>

            <p>U.S. stocks experienced a downturn as Nvidia cautioned about the impact of new export restrictions to China, and companies expressed concerns about the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's trade war.

Nvidia's stock dropped after the U.S. government restricted exports of its H20 chips to China, potentially affecting its results.

            <p>With Donald Trump back in office, questions arise regarding the potential benefits and drawbacks of a UK-US trade deal. While a deal might seem desirable, concerns exist about the terms and conditions that the US might impose, particularly regarding issues like pharmaceuticals, food standards, and digital regulation. The article argues that any deal under Trump would likely prioritize US interests, potentially disadvantaging the UK. Therefore, Britain should view a trade agreement with Trump's US as a tactical measure to protect its trade interests, rather than a strategic key to economic prosperity.</p>

Now, the EU is considering using similar tactics against the US as it seeks to defend its interests in the escalating trade war.

            <p>China is shifting its approach in the trade war with the U.S., moving beyond tariffs on goods to target the American services sector and implement non-tariff restrictive measures.

Beijing's new tactics include widening export controls of rare-earth minerals, opening antitrust probes into American companies, and restricting deliveries of Boeing jets. These actions signal China's intent to retaliate in various ways and increase the pressure on U.S. companies operating in China.</p>
