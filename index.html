          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to ban mail-in voting before the 2026 midterm elections, claiming the method is corrupt and susceptible to fraud. The administration is reportedly drafting an executive order to this effect, despite constitutional scholars noting that Article I, Section 4 grants states, not the president, the authority to regulate elections. The article highlights that this power can only be altered by Congress, and points out that contrary to Trump's claims, dozens of other developed nations utilize mail-in voting systems.</p>

          <p>Jasveen Sangha, known as the "Ketamine Queen," has agreed to plead guilty to five federal charges, including providing the ketamine dose that resulted in the death of actor Matthew Perry.

          <p>A contentious penalty decision secured a 1-0 victory for Leeds over Everton, igniting debate about the Premier League's handball rule. Everton defender James Tarkowski was penalized for blocking a shot with his arm, which was positioned close to his body, a decision his manager called "wrong" and "bizarre." Pundits and former players were divided on the call, highlighting ongoing confusion over what constitutes an "unnatural" body position under the current regulations. The incident underscores the persistent controversy surrounding refereeing interpretations in top-flight football.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent in Southern California fired at a moving vehicle during an immigration stop after the driver allegedly sped away and struck two agents. The Department of Homeland Security stated the agent fired in self-defense, and no one was hit by the bullets. An immigrant advocacy group provided a different account based on video from inside the car, showing agents smashing the windows before the driver fled, followed by gunshots. The incident has heightened tensions over federal immigration enforcement tactics in the region.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers who left Texas to block a Republican-led effort to redraw voting maps have returned, declaring their protest a victory for raising national awareness. By breaking the legislature's quorum, they successfully killed the special session but now face another called by Governor Greg Abbott to pass the controversial maps. Democrats argue the new districts are racially discriminatory and plan to challenge them in court. The move is part of a larger national battle, with Democratic-led states like California planning their own redistricting to counter potential Republican gains.</p>

The summit, which also included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, highlighted a potential divergence in strategy, as Trump suggested a deal could be reached even while the war continues, a position he adopted after meeting with Vladimir Putin.</p>

The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration is illegally forcing states to choose between forfeiting critical funding for victim services and complying with conditions not authorized by the original law. The states contend the policy is part of a broader effort to coerce "sanctuary" jurisdictions and will ultimately erode trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities, hindering crime prevention.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Polari Prize, an award for LGBTQ+ literature, have canceled this year's event following a controversy surrounding the nomination of author John Boyne. Several other longlisted authors withdrew in protest of Boyne's inclusion, citing an article he wrote defending J.K. Rowling's stance on trans issues. After an open letter signed by over 800 publishing figures criticized the nomination, the prize organizers decided to pause the award for 2025. They plan to review their governance and increase trans representation on judging panels, hoping to return in 2026.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to the White House for talks with President Trump and European leaders was marked by a deliberate charm offensive to secure support. Key takeaways include Trump hinting at U.S. involvement in security guarantees for Ukraine, though emphasizing that Europe would bear most of the burden. Zelenskyy made an emphatic plea for "everything" needed to build a strong army, including weapons and training. The possibility of a trilateral meeting between Trump, Zelenskyy, and Vladimir Putin was also a central topic of discussion during the high-profile diplomatic meetings.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction preventing the Federal Trade Commission from investigating the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters for America. The probe was initiated after the group published a report alleging that ads from major companies were appearing alongside antisemitic content on the social media platform X. The judge ruled that the FTC's investigation likely represented a retaliatory action against the organization for its constitutionally protected speech. Media Matters is also facing a separate lawsuit from X's owner, Elon Musk, over the same report.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allies, President Trump stated that a ceasefire is not a prerequisite for a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine. This marks a reversal from his position just a week prior and was met with pushback from European leaders, including the German Chancellor, who insisted a ceasefire is essential for credible negotiations. While Trump did suggest the U.S. would help provide security guarantees for Kyiv, he also reiterated that European nations would be expected to carry most of the burden.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a downturn, with Bitcoin's price falling to around $115,000 after hitting a new all-time high of over $124,000 last week. The slide was attributed to broader macroeconomic concerns, including higher-than-expected inflation data that has cast doubt on a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut. This uncertainty triggered a significant liquidation wave across the market, with over $500 million in forced sales of long positions in the last 24 hours. Investors are now closely watching for economic signals from the upcoming Jackson Hole symposium. (not investment advice)</p>

In the remarks, Haliva, who resigned over intelligence failures leading to the October 7th attack, also suggested that 50 Palestinians should die for every Israeli killed, regardless of whether they are children. The comments, which he has since confirmed and expressed regret for, represent the first time a senior military figure has been heard endorsing such a high death toll as a strategic message.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An accounting practice known as the retail inventory method (RIM), used by major retailers like Walmart and Target, could temporarily distort the financial impact of new tariffs on imported goods. Because RIM uses an average cost-to-retail price ratio rather than tracking the actual cost of each item, it can initially overstate profitability when product costs rise suddenly. While this effect normalizes over several quarters, it means that upcoming earnings reports may not fully reflect the hit to retailers' bottom lines, creating a disconnect between operational challenges and reported financials.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked more than 6,000 visas for international students due to violations of U.S. law, including overstays. The department cited assault, DUIs, and burglary as common violations, and also included "support for terrorism" as a reason for about 200-300 revocations. This action is part of the Trump administration's broader crackdown on immigration and follows a recent policy change requiring enhanced social media screening for visa applicants. The move has drawn criticism from Democrats who argue it is an attack on due process for students.</p>
