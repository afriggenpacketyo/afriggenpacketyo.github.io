          <p>After weeks of heightened tensions following a militant attack in Kashmir, India and Pakistan have engaged in a significant military conflict involving airstrikes and drone attacks, marking a dangerous escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Pakistan accused India of initiating attacks on its air bases with missiles, while India claims to have intercepted many of these. The conflict has prompted international concern, with calls for restraint from global powers as the two nations employ new technologies like drones, raising fears of further escalation and regional instability. The New York Times article highlights the shift in the India-Pakistan rivalry, noting the elimination of diplomatic space and the potential for the conflict to spiral out of control.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space for 53 years. While experts are unsure of the exact re-entry location, the spacecraft's protective heat shield increases the likelihood that parts of it will survive the descent. The article provides estimates of the re-entry time and notes that if any pieces are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

The Justice Department's decision to drop the case against Adams led to resignations within the department, with critics suggesting a political bargain was struck.</p>
