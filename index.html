          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the Medicaid work requirements in President Trump's budget bill, citing a "moral component" and arguing that able-bodied individuals who refuse to work are defrauding the system. Johnson claims the bill does not cut Medicaid or SNAP but focuses on reducing fraud, waste, and abuse. He stated that the work requirements, a minimum of 20 hours per week in work, job training, or volunteering, are not burdensome. However, Senator Hawley has criticized the bill as morally wrong and politically suicidal, indicating potential opposition in the Senate. The bill is now headed to the Senate for debate.

          <p>Authorities in Kerala, India, issued an alert after a ship carrying oil and hazardous cargo capsized off the coast, resulting in leaks into the Arabian Sea. The ship, MSC ELSA 3, was traveling from Vizhinjam port to Kochi when it began to tilt dangerously and capsized due to flooding. The ship was carrying 13 containers of hazardous cargo, including calcium carbide, and significant quantities of diesel and furnace oil. Residents have been advised to avoid touching any containers or oil washing ashore, and fishermen have been asked to avoid the area.

          <p>India's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Canada's Foreign Minister Anita Anand spoke in a call on Sunday, signaling a step towards mending strained relations between the two countries. The conversation marks the highest diplomatic contact since Mark Carney became Canadian prime minister in March. Relations deteriorated after Canada accused India of orchestrating the 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Khalistan supporter, in Vancouver, allegations India denies. Both countries are considering reinstating their High Commissioners by June.</p>

          <p>North Korea arrested a senior official, Ri Hyong-son, over the failed launch of a new warship, which angered Kim Jong Un. Ri, deputy director of the ruling Workers' Party's Munitions Industry Department, is deemed largely responsible for the incident. Three officials at the Chongjin shipyard were also detained. Kim Jong Un attributed the failure to "absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism." The public disclosure of the accident and the arrests is uncommon, with analysts suggesting it signals Pyongyang's commitment to advancing its military capabilities.</p>

The proposed zone would encompass nearly all of Ukraine, excluding a small area along the Polish border. Military analysts estimate that at Russia's current rate of advance, it would take approximately 91 years to seize the territory required for the buffer zone. The analysts also suggest that achieving this goal would cost Russia 50 million soldiers, or about a third of the country's population.</p>
