          <p>President Trump stated his goal for Iran to completely abandon its nuclear program, rather than simply seeking a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Speaking after cutting short his G7 summit attendance, Trump emphasized that he wants a "real end" to Iran's nuclear ambitions. He also predicted that Israel would continue its actions against Iran, and that he would be monitoring the situation from the White House Situation Room. Trump addressed potential threats to U.S. interests, warning Iran against targeting U.S. troops and indicated the administration is working to help Americans leave the Middle East due to airspace closures.</p>

This agreement follows government intervention to prevent the closure of the plant's blast furnaces by its Chinese owners, Jingye.

          <p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs report that China's private enterprises are experiencing a resurgence due to the easing of regulatory restrictions. These changes aim to support non-state firms in achieving technological breakthroughs and expanding their international presence. The private sector's renewed "animal spirits" are evident in increased capital expenditure, overseas expansion plans, R&D spending, and fundraising activity. The sustainability of this rebound depends on more predictable policies, macro stimulus to address disinflation, and stable U.S.-China relations, as the private sector contributes significantly to China's GDP and employment.</p>

Israel's military claimed to have eliminated a top Iranian military commander, Ali Shadmani.

          <p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that global oil demand will continue to grow until the end of this decade, despite an anticipated peak in China's demand by 2027. The IEA attributes this to cheaper gasoline and slower electric vehicle adoption in the United States. While maintaining its prediction that global demand will peak by 2029, the agency notes that China's demand will peak earlier due to increased EV usage. The IEA's forecast contrasts with OPEC's view that consumption will continue to rise, and the IEA also suggests ample oil supplies through 2030 if there are no major disruptions.</p>

The order also includes provisions for steel and aluminum, but details on those tariffs were not specified, although the UK government hopes to make progress toward 0% tariffs on core steel products.

The report emphasizes that ethnicity data was not recorded for two-thirds of perpetrators, hindering the ability to draw conclusions about offenders at a national level. The government has accepted all of Casey's recommendations, but the report highlights that many of the problems have been known for years without effective action. The report stresses that too often the children being sexually assaulted are blamed instead of being helped, and it suggests that acknowledging past failures could have prevented the current situation.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a fireworks factory in Hunan province, central China, has resulted in at least nine deaths and 26 injuries. Rescue operations are ongoing, complicated by the risk of additional explosions and the lack of a nearby water source. China's Ministry of Emergency Management has dispatched a team to oversee the rescue efforts and investigate the cause of the explosion. Industrial accidents are frequent in China due to lax safety standards, with several similar incidents occurring in recent years, highlighting ongoing safety concerns in the country.</p>

          <p>President Trump has requested funding from Congress for a "Golden Dome for America," a missile defense system intended to protect the entire United States. This proposal is inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, which uses interceptor missiles to defend against incoming rockets. However, experts note that building such a system in the U.S. would be significantly more complex due to the country's size and the nature of potential missile threats. Jeffrey Lewis from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies likens the difference to building a kayak versus a battleship, highlighting the scale of the challenge.</p>

The Iranian people have been pushing back against authoritarian tendencies, but Israel's actions have thrust them into a war devised by an authoritarian leader in Jerusalem. The attacks demonstrate a contempt for the agency and aspirations of the Iranian people, who were striving for greater security, prosperity, and liberty.</p>

Bimco, representing global shipowners, noted a modest drop in ships sailing through the area, with some shipowners opting to steer clear.
