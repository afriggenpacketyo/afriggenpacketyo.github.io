          <p>Mark Carney has been elected as the new Prime Minister of Canada, according to CBC/Radio Canada projections, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape. The election was largely influenced by concerns over President Trump's threats to Canada's sovereignty and economy, leading to a surge of nationalism. Carney, with his background in finance and previous roles as governor of the Bank of England and head of the Bank of Canada, is seen as well-equipped to handle Trump's policies. His victory represents a reversal of fortunes for Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, whose association with Trump hurt his campaign. Optimism score: 65</p>

          <p>Harvard University is restructuring its diversity, equity, and inclusion office, renaming it the Office of Community and Campus Life, seemingly in response to pressure from the Trump administration. This move follows similar reorganizations at universities nationwide aimed at placating conservative critics of diversity offices. The Trump administration has also accused the Harvard Law Review of racial discrimination in journal membership and article selection. The changes reflect ongoing tensions between universities and the government over issues of diversity and inclusion. Optimism score: 55</p>
