          <p>Habibur Masum has been found guilty of murdering his wife, Kulsuma Akter, in a brutal knife attack in Bradford, UK. He stabbed her over 25 times in front of their infant son after tracking her to a women's refuge where she had sought safety. The court heard that Ms. Akter had previously been threatened by Masum, who held a knife to her throat. Despite pleading guilty to manslaughter, a jury convicted him of murder, stalking, and other charges, with sentencing scheduled for July.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of a 12-day conflict with Israel, life in Tehran is slowly resuming, but a deep sense of uncertainty and fear lingers among its residents.

Many Iranians express exhaustion and anxiety about the future, questioning the stability of the ceasefire and the direction of their country.

          <p>The United States and China have agreed on a framework for a trade deal, a development confirmed by officials from both nations. While President Trump initially announced a signed deal, it was later clarified as a framework to implement a previous agreement from Geneva. The accord appears to center on China increasing access to its rare earth minerals, which are crucial for high-tech manufacturing, in exchange for the U.S. easing certain restrictions. The deal aims to de-escalate a trade war that has negatively impacted both economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana has publicly stated his continued opposition to a Senate reconciliation bill that includes provisions for selling federal lands.

His stance places him at odds with some fellow Republicans, like Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who advocate for the land sales to address issues such as housing prices.

          <p>The recent conflict between Israel and Iran has prompted key Middle Eastern states like Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt to adopt a strategy of strategic ambiguity. While publicly condemning Israeli actions, some nations reportedly provided behind-the-scenes cooperation to intercept Iranian projectiles, reflecting their complex security ties with the U.S. and Israel. The analysis suggests these countries are primarily focused on regional stability, which requires a balanced relationship with a weakened but still significant Iran. This delicate geopolitical maneuvering is expected to continue shaping the region's foreign policy.</p>

          <p>A plan by Florida officials to construct an outdoor migrant detention camp, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," in the remote Everglades has sparked widespread condemnation. Environmental groups, immigration advocates, and the Miccosukee Tribe have decried the project, which aims to house up to 5,000 detainees in tents amid extreme heat, humidity, and dangerous wildlife. Critics argue the conditions are inhumane and the location poses a severe risk to the fragile Everglades ecosystem. The facility is part of the Trump administration's aggressive push to increase daily migrant arrests and detentions across the country.</p>

In one case, a judge ruled that training AI is 'transformative' fair use but noted the defendant's use of pirated books was infringing. In another case involving Meta, a different judge suggested training on copyrighted works is likely illegal as it undermines the market for human creators, but ruled for Meta because the plaintiffs failed to argue that specific point. These conflicting decisions indicate that the legal battle over AI and copyright is far from settled and will likely require future litigation to resolve.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that society is entering a new era of 'AI agents,' which can autonomously perform real-world tasks, moving beyond simply answering queries. The author expresses significant concern over the lack of regulatory guardrails, highlighting risks such as strategic deception, financial theft, and the potential for creators to manipulate agents without user knowledge. Citing safety tests from AI labs like Anthropic and OpenAI, the piece calls for immediate congressional action, including mandatory disclosure of safety tests and the formation of a House Select Committee to address the rapidly evolving technology before it becomes unmanageable.</p>

          <p>Following significant outcry from health organizations and Democratic lawmakers, the Trump administration has restored federal funding for HIV prevention and surveillance programs. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health confirmed it received its nearly $20 million award after the funds were initially frozen, a move critics called reckless and dangerous. Advocates had warned that cutting the funds would reverse years of progress and lead to a spike in new infections. While the funding has been restored for the current year, concerns remain as the President's future budget proposes eliminating it entirely.</p>

          <p>German federal prosecutors have indicted a Syrian national for his alleged role in supporting a foiled terrorist plot to attack Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna, Austria, last year. The suspect, identified as Mohammad A., is accused of supporting the Islamic State group by helping an accomplice in Austria plan the attack. His alleged assistance included translating bomb-making instructions from Arabic and organizing online contact with an IS member abroad. The plot was discovered in August 2024, leading to the cancellation of three concerts and several arrests in Austria.</p>

          <p>Profits for China's industrial firms fell by 9.1% in May compared to the same month last year, signaling persistent economic headwinds. The National Bureau of Statistics attributed the drop to insufficient domestic demand, falling prices, and the ongoing trade dispute with the United States. The decline was particularly steep in the mining and automotive sectors, which saw profits fall by 29% and 11.9% respectively over the first five months of the year. This data reflects the challenges Beijing faces in stimulating its economy and boosting consumer and business confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. solar manufacturing sector, which has seen tens of billions in investment since the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, faces a potential collapse if key federal incentives are rolled back. Industry leaders warn that repealing tax credits that encourage the use of American-made products would make it difficult to compete with cheaper panels from China and Southeast Asia. This could jeopardize nearly 60,000 potential manufacturing jobs and undermine the decade-long effort to build a domestic solar supply chain.

          <p>The UK's Labour government has confirmed it will make significant concessions on its controversial welfare reform bill following a large-scale backlash from its own backbench MPs. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall announced that planned cuts to disability benefits will now only apply to future claimants, protecting current recipients. The U-turn came after more than 100 Labour MPs threatened to vote against the bill, which originally aimed to save Â£5 billion annually by tightening eligibility for sickness and disability payments. The government now appears confident the revised bill will pass in Parliament.</p>

Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh emphasized the need for a structured roadmap of engagement and de-escalation to solve complex issues along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The talks, held on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting, acknowledged efforts to normalize relations but stressed the importance of demarcating the border through established mechanisms.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Labour government's decision to backtrack on its welfare reform plans is estimated to cost between Â£2.5 billion and Â£3 billion, more than half of the originally projected Â£5 billion in savings. By applying cuts only to new claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and Universal Credit health element, the government has spared millions of current recipients. This analysis suggests the move creates a significant hole in the chancellor's budget, which relied on these savings to meet borrowing rules. The unfunded commitment will likely require either tax increases or cuts in other areas. (not investment advice)</p>

The domestic price surge is attributed to a supply shortage and an auction system for government stockpiles.
