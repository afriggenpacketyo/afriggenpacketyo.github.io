          <p>Mark Zuckerberg is aggressively investing in artificial intelligence by acquiring talent and technology for Meta. The company recently invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI, hiring its founder Alexandr Wang, and plans to bring on Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, formerly of GitHub and Safe Superintelligence, respectively. Meta is embedding AI across its operations, from online advertising to the metaverse, aiming to enhance ad targeting and reduce costs. However, Meta's open-source approach with the Llama family of models has faced criticism, prompting the CEO to revamp the AI organization to compete with industry leaders like Google and OpenAI. The intense competition for AI talent has led to bidding wars, with Meta reportedly offering substantial signing bonuses to lure experts from rival companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama, once a disciple of George Soros, is facing criticism for alleged corruption and autocratic tendencies, earning him the nickname "Ramaduro." Critics accuse him of transforming into a political chameleon, aligning with global elites and regional strongmen to maintain power. Despite claiming to champion European values, Rama's leadership is described as a narco-state built on organized crime and electoral manipulation. Some observers are calling on the United States to hold Europe accountable for tolerating such regimes in the Balkans, even if their critics are conservatives or aligned with President Trump.</p>

          <p>China's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, is reportedly developing the ability to carry out "deck load strikes," enabling rapid launches of numerous aircraft simultaneously. This tactic, reminiscent of the US Navy's approach during the Vietnam War, could provide China's navy with a first-mover advantage in combat. State media has highlighted the Fujian's progress in sea trials since its first test in May of last year, anticipating its commissioning by the end of the year.

          <p>Tucker Carlson's interview with Ted Cruz exposed a growing divide within the Maga movement, particularly on the issue of potential war with Iran. Cruz faced criticism for his lack of knowledge about Iran and his reliance on religious justifications for political stances. The interview highlighted contradictions within the Maga world, as Trump's base shows reluctance towards another Middle Eastern war, while some leaders push for intervention. The Democratic party is also divided on the issue, reflecting widespread unease about entering another conflict. The potential for the US to enter Israel's war with Iran is massively disliked across the political spectrum.</p>

Anti-plastic advocates are dismayed by this perceived hypocrisy, especially considering Newsom's previous strong stance against plastic pollution. The governor's office has defended the presence of the bottle, but environmental groups remain concerned about the mixed messaging.</p>

          <p>As the war between Israel and Iran continues, the balance between Iran's missile supply and Israel's interceptor capacity is a critical factor. Israel has been shooting down most of the missiles, but its interceptors are being used faster than they can be replenished. Experts worry about the potential depletion of Israel's missile interceptors, which would create a dangerous situation. The longer the war continues, Israel may need to prioritize defending key military targets over civilian infrastructure, which is what Iran wants.</p>

          <p>Investigators are exploring possible motives behind the Minnesota rampage, focusing on the suspect's religious background and views on abortion. The suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, had notebooks detailing potential targets, including Democratic officials and abortion rights supporters. Some scholars suggest examining the rampage within the context of anti-abortion violence and its ties to conservative Evangelical Christian movements. Boelter's apparent connection with the New Apostolic Reformation, which uses war-like terminology regarding political and spiritual enemies, may shed light on his motivations, given the movement's rhetoric about abortion as a "demonic enterprise."</p>

          <p>Reporters for Voice of America and other U.S.-funded networks are expressing concerns about their safety and job security following mass layoffs and the imprisonment of a colleague in Azerbaijan. The Trump administration's actions to cut funding and eliminate positions at the U.S. Agency for Global Media have raised doubts about the government's commitment to protecting journalists working for these networks. The case of Farid Mehralizada, a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reporter sentenced to nine years in jail, highlights the risks faced by these journalists.</p>

The country's population decline is projected to worsen, impacting home demand by hundreds of thousands of units annually. Efforts to incentivize child-bearing have had limited effect due to stagnant incomes, job instability, and a weak social security system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan has been proactively addressing supply chain resilience, particularly in rare earth minerals. Following China's 2010 export ban targeting Tokyo, Japan diversified its sources, invested in non-China projects like Australia's Lynas, and implemented stockpiling and recycling measures. As a result, Japan's dependence on Chinese rare earths has significantly decreased. This experience provides a template for Western nations seeking to reduce their reliance on China's dominance in critical minerals.</p>

The decision follows increased safety concerns and recent attacks between the two countries, prompting Japan to raise its travel alert for Iran to the highest level.

          <p>Recent criticisms of celebrities like Sabrina Carpenter, Sydney Sweeney, and Addison Rae for their expressions of sexuality are examined in the context of feminist history. The article argues that these criticisms often lack meaningful critique and instead revert to puritanical tellings-off. It draws on the "sex wars" of the 1970s to highlight the complexities of discussing power, sex, and capitalism in relation to women's expression. The author suggests that the current discourse is driven by sexist algorithms and paternalistic concerns, ultimately restricting women's freedom of expression.</p>
