          <p>Hong Kong, Macau, and China’s Guangdong province are preparing for Super Typhoon Ragasa, one of the strongest storms in years, leading to the closure of schools, businesses, and cancellation of hundreds of flights. The typhoon is moving over the South China Sea with sustained winds of 220 kilometers per hour, prompting mass evacuations and warnings of severe storm surges. The storm has already caused at least three fatalities and displaced thousands in the Philippines, while also bringing heavy rain and injuries to Taiwan.</p>

          <p>The article explores the challenge facing the United States in reviving its shipbuilding industry, which has been dwarfed by the capacity of East Asian nations like China, Japan, and South Korea, who collectively hold over 90% of the global market. While the Trump administration has engaged in trade talks with China, it simultaneously imposes new port fees on Chinese-linked ships, creating a contradictory policy environment. The US is reportedly looking to Japan and South Korea for investment to help rebuild its domestic shipbuilding capabilities, mirroring the industrial policies that propelled Asia's maritime dominance.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's assertion that Tylenol is a cause of autism, scientific experts are emphasizing that the claim is not supported by evidence. Medical professionals state that complex neurodevelopmental disorders like autism are linked to a combination of thousands of genetic variants and environmental factors, not a single medication ingredient. The rise in autism diagnoses is largely attributed to increased awareness, broader diagnostic criteria, and improved screening methods, particularly for girls. Experts reiterate that extensive research has consistently debunked any causal link between vaccines and autism.</p>

The deal will eliminate most tariffs on EU exports to Indonesia, such as car parts and pharmaceuticals, while opening up investment opportunities in key sectors like electric vehicles. For Indonesia, the agreement provides tariff-free access for approximately 80% of its exports to the EU, including palm oil and textiles, strengthening its position as the EU's fifth-largest trading partner.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has announced that its factory production will remain suspended until at least October 1st due to a significant cyber attack that occurred in late August. The prolonged shutdown has crippled the company's ability to manufacture vehicles and is raising serious concerns about the financial stability of its supply chain partners. Government officials, including the business secretary and industry minister, are meeting with JLR and its suppliers to discuss support measures and strategies to get production back online as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p>NHS England is launching a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a diagnosis if a patient's symptoms persist or worsen after three visits. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid over five months and more than 20 GP contacts. This guidance aims to improve patient safety by prompting doctors to conduct further tests, seek second opinions, or make specialist referrals to catch serious illnesses like cancer earlier, particularly in younger patients.</p>

The announcement, made alongside Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was met with strong pushback from medical experts, who called the claims dangerous and not supported by scientific evidence. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reiterated that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, is considered one of the only safe pain relievers for pregnant women, and that no clear evidence proves a direct link to fetal developmental issues.</p>

          <p>The military-led governments of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger have jointly announced their decision to withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC). In a shared statement, the three West African nations accused the court of being an instrument of "neocolonial repression" and an example of selective justice. This move further distances the Alliance of Sahel States from Western influence and institutions, following their earlier withdrawal from the regional ECOWAS bloc and a pivot towards closer military cooperation with Russia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order officially designating the left-wing Antifa movement as a domestic terrorist organization. The White House stated the classification is due to a "pattern of political violence" intended to suppress lawful political activity. The order directs federal agencies to investigate the movement, which it describes as a "militarist, anarchist enterprise." This action follows the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which the president has blamed on left-wing rhetoric, although investigators have not linked the suspect to any specific group.</p>

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to China David Perdue has indicated that a much-anticipated meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is more likely to occur early next year rather than during the upcoming APEC summit. Speaking at a press conference in Beijing, Perdue stated that while the relationship between the two leaders is currently "very good," the timing points towards a 2026 meeting. The comments were made during a rare visit by a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation aimed at improving communication between the two countries, particularly on military matters.</p>

          <p>Week three of the NFL season was marked by thrilling finishes, with five games decided on the final play, often by kickers.

In a significant upset, the Cleveland Browns defeated the Green Bay Packers with a 55-yard field goal as time expired. Backup quarterbacks also made headlines, with Mac Jones leading the 49ers to a 3-0 start and Carson Wentz guiding the Vikings to a blowout win.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Australian pediatrician Dr. Mike Freelander addresses the recent comments by US President Donald Trump linking paracetamol to autism, calling them "very worrying." He emphasizes that there is no scientific evidence of a causal link and that major studies have disproven such a connection, reassuring the public that medicine regulators worldwide consider paracetamol a safe and important medication for pregnant women. Dr. Freelander warns that such unsubstantiated claims from political figures can cause significant public anxiety and lead to poor health outcomes by undermining trust in scientific and regulatory bodies.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has highlighted the industrial-scale black market for Premier League tickets, where unauthorized resale websites sell tickets for vastly inflated prices, often leaving fans out of pocket with invalid entries. The issue was demonstrated at a Brighton vs. Tottenham match, where a fan from South Korea was denied entry after paying £900 for a ticket that had been deactivated. Brighton and Hove Albion is using new technology to combat the problem, having blocked hundreds of touted tickets for that single match and cancelled season ticket accounts identified as being used by touts.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate $500 million in federal grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), that had been frozen. U.S. District Judge Rita Lin ruled that the government likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act by not providing specific explanations for the funding cuts, which were related to allegations of civil rights violations. The suspended grants, primarily from the National Institutes of Health, support critical medical research into conditions like Parkinson's disease and cancer, and UCLA argued their loss would be devastating.</p>

          <p>The article explores how modern football seems to be re-embracing tactics once championed and criticized in Sam Allardyce's management style, such as an emphasis on set-pieces and a more direct, long-ball approach. Top teams are increasingly using tall strikers and forgoing a possession-based game, a strategy Allardyce used effectively at clubs like Bolton Wanderers over two decades ago. Allardyce comments that his methods were "ahead of the game" and that the current trend reflects a more sensible use of a team's skills, moving away from the "pandemic" of playing out from the back.</p>

Russian forces are reportedly using infiltration tactics and heavy use of drones and glide bombs to flank these strongholds, aiming to sever supply lines rather than engage in costly urban assaults.
