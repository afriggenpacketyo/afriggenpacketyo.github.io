        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon has launched a new private-label grocery brand aimed at price-conscious consumers, with the majority of its products priced under five dollars. The brand, named Amazon Grocery, consolidates the company's existing Happy Belly and Amazon Fresh labels into a single offering of over 1,000 items. This strategic move comes as Amazon's grocery business undergoes significant changes and consumers increasingly seek value amid economic pressures. The announcement caused a slight downturn in the stock prices of competing grocery retailers like Walmart and Kroger, signaling a competitive disruption in the sector.</p>

          <p>Afghans celebrated in the streets after the Taliban government restored internet and telecommunication services following a 48-hour nationwide blackout. The shutdown had severely disrupted daily life, halting businesses, flights, and access to emergency services, which drew widespread international condemnation. For many, especially women and girls whose rights have been curtailed, the internet serves as a crucial link to the outside world for education and communication. The restoration of connectivity brought a palpable sense of relief and joy across the country, with people eagerly contacting relatives and resuming digital activities.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade negotiations, the Trump administration is reportedly comfortable with the current high tariffs on Chinese imports and is unlikely to ease them soon. Sources familiar with the talks indicate that discussions have focused on broader issues like TikTok and export controls, with the US prioritizing the revenue generated from tariffs to address the fiscal deficit. The average US tariff on Chinese goods remains around 55%, a significant point of contention. Beijing has been pushing for the removal of fentanyl-related levies, but Washington has so far refused to concede on this issue.</p>

          <p>Following the Cleveland Browns' decision to bench veteran quarterback Joe Flacco in favor of rookie Dillon Gabriel, Shedeur Sanders remains in the third-string position. ESPN analyst Louis Riddick suggested that this shake-up presents a significant opportunity for Sanders to secure more practice repetitions and potentially challenge for a higher spot on the depth chart. Sanders recently expressed confidence in his ability to perform at the NFL level, stating he is prepared to play whenever called upon. The change comes as the Browns seek to improve their offensive performance after Flacco struggled in recent games.</p>

          <p>A corner of a 20-story residential building in the Bronx partially collapsed, an incident authorities believe may have been caused by an explosion in a boiler room ventilation shaft. Remarkably, no injuries were reported, and emergency crews conducted thorough searches of the rubble to ensure no one was trapped. The building, part of a public housing development, has several open safety and maintenance violations, including some related to its facade and plumbing. This event has heightened concerns among residents and officials about the structural integrity and safety of public housing in the city.</p>

          <p>The recent decision by the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark rate has led to a drop in mortgage rates, making homeownership more affordable for many. For a $450,000 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the average monthly principal and interest payment is now approximately $2,736, down from over $3,000 when rates were higher earlier in the year. This reduction translates to annual savings of several thousand dollars, potentially enabling more buyers to enter the market. The article also explores refinancing options for existing homeowners, highlighting the potential for significant long-term interest savings at the current lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A secret BBC Panorama investigation has revealed a deeply ingrained culture of misogyny and racism at London's Charing Cross police station. An undercover reporter, working as a civilian staff member for seven months, filmed serving officers making graphic sexual comments, expressing violent and racist views about immigrants, and being dismissive of a pregnant woman's sexual assault allegations. The evidence challenges the Metropolitan Police's claims of reform following previous scandals, suggesting that toxic attitudes have merely been driven underground. In response, the Met has suspended nine staff members and removed two officers from frontline duties.</p>

          <p>A military court in the Democratic Republic of Congo has sentenced former President Joseph Kabila to death in absentia, convicting him of treason and war crimes for his alleged support of the M23 rebel group. The ruling has intensified political tensions and raised fears that it could undermine fragile peace efforts in the country's conflict-ridden eastern region. Supporters of Kabila have condemned the verdict as politically motivated and part of a broader crackdown on the opposition by the current government. The sentence highlights the deep-seated rivalry between Kabila and incumbent President Felix Tshisekedi, adding another layer of instability.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup player Tyrrell Hatton has called on home supporters to refrain from retaliatory behavior when the tournament is held in Ireland in 2027. His comments follow an event at Bethpage in the US where European players, notably Rory McIlroy and his wife, were subjected to hostile and abusive comments from American fans. Hatton, who secured the victory for Europe, emphasized his preference for a respectful atmosphere where the competition is decided by play rather than by attempts to intimidate players. The PGA of America's CEO has since stated he plans to apologize to the European team.</p>

          <p>Reform UK's head of policy has claimed that Nigel Farage's publicly funded security detail was reduced by 75% by parliamentary officials for what he called "inexplicable reasons." As a result, the party says private donors have stepped in to fund his security arrangements. The claim emerges during a period of escalating political tension, with Reform UK accusing the Labour Party of inciting violence against Farage during its recent conference. Parliamentary authorities have declined to comment on the specific case but stated that security for MPs is determined by a rigorous, risk-based assessment process.</p>

          <p>Amid the ongoing government shutdown, the Trump administration has put a hold on approximately $18 billion in federal funding for two major New York infrastructure projects: the Hudson River rail tunnel and the Second Avenue subway expansion. While an administration official cited the furlough of necessary transportation department staff as the reason, the move is widely interpreted as a political tactic to pressure Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Governor Kathy Hochul condemned the decision, stating the administration was prioritizing "culture wars" over the nation's critical infrastructure needs.</p>

This data is a key factor in the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. The job losses were spread across several sectors, including leisure and hospitality, though education and health services saw gains. (not investment advice)</p>
