          <p>Magic Eden, an NFT marketplace, has partnered with the $TRUMP meme token team to launch an official $TRUMP-branded cryptocurrency wallet, featuring President Donald Trump's name and likeness, supporting the trading of $TRUMP and other digital assets, including Bitcoin. A waitlist for the wallet opened on Tuesday, with a broader launch planned for later this summer, but Eric Trump claimed to have no knowledge of the project. Magic Eden pointed to the TrumpMeme X account's repost of the wallet announcement when asked for clarification on Eric Trump's denial. The project is promoted as "the first and only crypto wallet for true Trump fans," promising a share in $1 million in $TRUMP rewards for users who sign up and refer friends.</p>

          <p>The US Navy is reportedly renaming the USNS Harvey Milk, a ship named after the gay rights activist, following Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's order, aligning with the goal of "reestablishing a warrior culture" in the US armed forces. Other ships named after Thurgood Marshall and Ruth Bader Ginsburg may also be renamed, according to reports, with the Trump administration seeking to end diversity programs in the military. Nancy Pelosi condemned the reported move, calling it a shameful erasure of those who fought to break down barriers, as Harvey Milk served as a US Navy diver and was one of the first openly gay politicians in America. Milk's murder helped cement his reputation as a civil rights icon, and he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p>

          <p>England's Lionesses faced a week of mixed fortunes as they prepare for Euro 2025, with manager Wiegman dealing with Mary Earps' retirement and Millie Bright's withdrawal. Despite these challenges, England produced a strong performance against Portugal, showcasing attacking depth, though they later lost to Spain in the Nations League. Former players emphasize the importance of getting key players fit and prepared for the Euros, and Wiegman considers the Spain loss a valuable learning opportunity. The England boss expressed satisfaction with the week overall, highlighting players returning from injuries and competing for positions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has privately expressed frustration with some of his Supreme Court appointees, particularly Justice Amy Coney Barrett, believing they could do more to support his agenda. Some Trump allies have labeled Barrett as "weak," and conservative lawyer Mike Davis has publicly criticized her. Trump is reportedly seeking to nominate judges in the mold of Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and the late Antonin Scalia. Despite the private complaints, Trump has not publicly attacked Barrett and defended her after she sided with liberal justices on a foreign aid payment ruling.</p>

          <p>Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill aimed at preventing China from buying land near strategic assets, such as military bases, drawing criticism from Republicans. Hobbs stated that the bill was ineffective at counter-espionage and lacked clear implementation criteria. Proponents of the bill argue that it would safeguard citizens from threats, citing concerns over Chinese investment near military facilities. The bill, which can still pass if the Arizona legislature overrides Hobbs' veto, would have prohibited the People's Republic of China from having a 30% or more stake in Arizona property.</p>

A White House spokesperson said the Trump administration expects to prevail in the legal dispute, while the ACLU hailed the ruling as a critical reminder that trans people have constitutional rights. The judge stated that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their lawsuit because the bureau did not perform any analysis before cutting off treatment.</p>

The FBI says the fungus causes "head blight," a disease of wheat, barley, maize, and rice, responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide.

His warning reflects Washington's concerns that China could leverage reconstruction aid to gain influence in Kyiv while avoiding accountability for supporting Russia's war efforts.

While Musk's accomplishments during his time in government were limited, his actions, such as decimating US foreign aid, have had significant consequences.

The proposed rule would suspend the issuance of new work permits until USCIS decides all asylum claims within an average of 180 days, a difficult timeframe to meet. The changes would also require asylum-seekers to wait one year after filing their application to be eligible for a work permit, instead of six months.
