          <p>President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador ordered the arrest of five bus company heads after they refused to comply with his mandate for free transport following a highway closure. Bukele announced via social media platform X that all bus fares would be free for a week due to government construction, which led to chaos and overcrowded buses. He accused the bus company heads of sabotaging the country, despite claiming the government was covering their income. This move is another example of Bukele's authoritarian tactics, criticized for undermining democratic institutions and due process. The incident occurs amidst international scrutiny over Bukele's detention of Venezuelan deportees in a mega-prison, further raising concerns about human rights.</p>

          <p>According to this New York Times article, Gaza is facing a catastrophic humanitarian emergency due to the prolonged blockade of humanitarian aid and commercial supplies by Israel. Two million Palestinians, nearly half of them children, are surviving on a single meal every two or three days. Signs of starvation are increasing, with lab tests indicating starvation in a significant number of urine samples. The article asserts that Israel is exploiting aid as a tool of war to pressure Hamas, violating international law. The author calls for open and secure humanitarian corridors, a cease-fire, and a political agreement that guarantees Palestinian presence, security, and self-determination.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to this New York Times article, President Xi Jinping's ongoing purge of top military officials in China raises concerns about the competence and reliability of his commanders, potentially weakening his appetite for war with Taiwan. Over the past two years, several high-ranking officers, including leaders of the Rocket Force, have been removed from their positions. While the reasons for these dismissals are unclear, the turmoil suggests that Xi may not have a firm grip on the army, which could delay or deter a potential invasion of Taiwan. The article emphasizes that hardware and logistics alone do not ensure victory, and the lack of battlefield experience among Chinese officers is a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>Tourists visiting Alcatraz Island expressed disbelief and concern over Donald Trump's proposal to rebuild and reopen the former federal prison. Many visitors viewed the idea as absurd and unfeasible, citing the island's crumbling infrastructure and high operating costs. Some tourists recognized the island's history as a site of Indigenous resistance, with activists having occupied Alcatraz in 1969 to protest broken treaties. Indigenous leaders also expressed concern that reopening the prison would erase this history and reinforce violent legacies. While some Trump supporters favored the idea, most visitors seemed to agree that Alcatraz should remain a national monument and museum.</p>

The country has transformed its garment sector, improving safety and environmental standards after the Rana Plaza disaster.

          <p>According to this New York Times article, President Trump's decision to close a tariff loophole on inexpensive goods from China is expected to significantly impact delivery companies like UPS, FedEx, and DHL. The loophole, known as the de minimis exemption, allowed goods worth $800 or less to enter the U.S. without tariffs. With the exemption now gone, American shoppers will face tariffs as high as 145 percent on Chinese goods, and companies may struggle to make up for lost sales in other markets. This change could result in reduced revenue for logistics companies and airlines that rely on the high volume of shipments from China.</p>

          <p>According to this New York Times article, the City Parks Foundation canceled Kehlani's scheduled Central Park performance, "Pride With Kehlani," after the Adams administration raised security concerns related to the singer's pro-Palestinian views. This follows a similar cancellation by Cornell University, citing Kehlani's alleged antisemitism. The city official, First Deputy Mayor Randy M. Mastro, warned that the foundation's license to stage concerts could be at risk if it did not address the concerns. The cancellation has sparked debate over free expression and the influence of political pressure on artistic events.</p>

The cuts come as Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary touts plans to expand foreign surprise inspections, despite the agency struggling to maintain current inspection levels due to staff shortages. Officials warn of a decline in morale and question the feasibility of increasing foreign inspections while reducing the length of inspection trips.</p>

          <p>Major delays and cancellations at Newark Liberty International Airport are expected to persist due to staffing shortages and equipment malfunctions. The FAA has issued ground delays and stops, attributing the issues to problems at the Philadelphia air traffic control center, which oversees Newark's airspace, and runway construction. The main problem stemmed from system outages that caused controllers to temporarily lose radar contact with aircraft. The FAA is implementing flow control measures to manage traffic, but the issues are part of a broader nationwide air traffic control staffing shortage.</p>

          <p>According to this New York Times article, a newly declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the criminal gang Tren de Aragua. Trump used this claim to justify invoking the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. The memo states that while Venezuela provides a permissive environment for the gang, the Maduro regime does not cooperate with or direct its operations in the United States. The release of the memo raises questions about the administration's rationale for using the wartime statute and its criticism of media coverage.</p>
