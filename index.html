          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 12:56:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and the European Union have finalized a trade agreement establishing a 15% tariff on most EU goods, a reduction from an earlier 30% threat. While presented as a major deal, economists warn it could lead to higher prices for American consumers on items like European cars, alcohol, and even gasoline. This is because domestic companies importing these goods may pass the additional tariff costs on to customers. The agreement also includes exemptions for certain products and provisions for the EU to purchase more American energy, potentially altering global energy trade dynamics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of the Interior, under Secretary Doug Burgum, has authorized the reopening of the Santa Ynez Unit, a significant oil reserve in the Pacific that has been dormant since 2015. This move, part of the Trump administration's 'energy dominance' agenda, is expected to bring three oil platforms online, tapping into an estimated 190 million barrels of recoverable oil. The decision faced strong opposition from Democratic California Senator Adam Schiff and Representative Salud Carbajal, who cited environmental risks and the region's history with oil spills. The administration proceeded despite these concerns, navigating numerous state-level regulatory hurdles to grant the approval.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals reducing their red meat consumption due to associated health risks like Type 2 diabetes and cancer, nutrition experts highlight numerous alternative sources of iron. Plant-based options such as lentils, beans, tofu, pumpkin seeds, and spinach are highly recommended. Additionally, certain seafood like oysters, clams, and sardines provide excellent sources of this vital mineral. Dietitians note that pairing plant-based iron with vitamin C-rich foods enhances the body's absorption. Fortified breads and cereals also contribute significantly to iron intake in the American diet.</p>

          <p>Behind the England Lionesses' Euro 2025 victory was a carefully cultivated team environment that fostered calm and camaraderie. At their hotel, players engaged in various hobbies to relax, from building Lego castles and playing the piano to doing jigsaw puzzles and playing Monopoly. The Football Association provided a 'home away from home' atmosphere, complete with a team barista and his cavapoo, Reggie, who became a beloved mascot. This focus on team bonding and maintaining normality, supported by family visits, was crucial to their on-pitch success under manager Sarina Wiegman.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has significantly shortened his deadline for Russia to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine, reducing it from 50 days to just 10 or 12 days. He warned that if no progress is made, the U.S. will impose massive 'secondary tariffs' on countries that trade with Moscow. Expressing disappointment with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump cited the ongoing conflict and civilian casualties as the reason for the accelerated timeline. This marks a shift in Trump's rhetoric, as he has become more openly critical of Russia's actions in Ukraine in recent months.</p>

The sites, which housed millions of illicit files, were taken down in what a top DOJ official called one of the most successful prosecutions of its kind, dismantling a sophisticated and sadistic online community.</p>

          <p>As extreme heat becomes more frequent globally, health experts offer crucial advice for staying safe, especially for vulnerable populations like children and the elderly. The primary recommendations are to stay in air-conditioned environments and remain well-hydrated by drinking plenty of water and electrolyte-rich fluids. It is important to avoid strenuous outdoor activities during peak sun hours, wear light-colored, loose-fitting clothing, and take cool showers. Recognizing the signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke is critical, as heat stroke requires immediate emergency medical attention by calling 911.</p>

While some perks are now more widely available, the dedicated lanes and reduced hassle of not having to remove laptops or liquids remain compelling benefits for frequent travelers.

The president provided this explanation when asked about the history of their relationship, which has faced renewed scrutiny. Epstein, who was arrested on child sex trafficking charges in 2019, died by suicide in a federal jail shortly after.</p>
