          <p>Bryan Kohberger was sentenced to four consecutive life terms without parole after pleading guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. The sentencing hearing featured emotional victim impact statements from families and surviving roommates, who confronted Kohberger, though he declined to speak. This plea deal spared him the death penalty, bringing a legal conclusion to the tragic case.</p>

          <p>The Hershey Company confirmed it will implement a low double-digit price increase across its confection portfolio, citing unprecedented rising cocoa costs. This surge is attributed to a global cocoa shortage, driven by unfavorable weather conditions in major producing regions and chronic underinvestment in cocoa farms. Hershey plans to mitigate impacts by focusing on less cocoa-intensive products and expanding its snacking portfolio.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida denied the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury records related to Jeffrey Epstein's investigations from 2005 and 2007.
