          <p>The market for "functional beverages" promising relaxation and health benefits is rapidly growing, with sales jumping significantly in the UK. However, nutritionists and dietitians express skepticism, noting the small quantities of active ingredients like L-theanine and Lion's Mane are unlikely to have a noticeable physiological effect. One brand, Trip, had an advertisement banned for making unproven health claims about stress and anxiety relief. Psychologists suggest any calming effect may be a placebo, stemming from the ritual of taking a moment for oneself with a special drink rather than the ingredients themselves.</p>

          <p>Ali Akbar, a 72-year-old man from Pakistan, is being awarded the Order of Merit, one of France's highest honors, for his 50-year career selling newspapers on the streets of Paris. He is believed to be the last newspaper hawker in the country, a profession decimated by the shift to digital news. Despite a dramatic decline in sales from his heyday, Mr. Akbar continues his work for the joy and independence it brings, becoming a beloved local figure. President Emmanuel Macron, who once bought papers from him as a student, will present the award.</p>

          <p>The village of Pampa Clemesí in Peru is located next to the country's largest solar complex, yet its 150 residents have no connection to the national power grid. Villagers use torches and cook over fires fueled by discarded cardboard from the solar panel installations they can see from their homes. The plant's operator states it has invested to build a power line for the village, but the final connection is a governmental responsibility that has stalled. Residents struggle daily without electricity for basic needs, highlighting a stark paradox of energy poverty amid renewable energy abundance.</p>

The long-running event, which has taken place for nearly 50 years, celebrates unique and unconventionally beautiful dogs, emphasizing that a pet's value is not defined by its pedigree. Organizers highlight that the contest also promotes animal adoption, as many of the participating dogs have been rescued from shelters and puppy mills. The event is described as a wonderful display of pageantry and pride for beloved pets.</p>

Perez Gomez faces serious charges, including patronizing a minor for commercial sexual activity and indecent solicitation of a child. ICE officials stated that the Portsmouth Police Department did not honor the detainer, releasing him just hours after his initial arrest. An ICE spokesperson criticized the local authorities' decision, emphasizing the threat the suspect poses and highlighting the agency's role in removing him from the community.</p>

Meanwhile, families of hostages are increasing pressure on the Israeli government, fearing the planned offensive will endanger their loved ones.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly dismissed the upcoming summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating that any peace deal made without Ukraine's involvement would be a "dead solution." He emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and that Ukrainians will not cede land to the occupier. His comments address anxieties in Kyiv and Europe that a bilateral U.S.-Russia meeting could marginalize their interests, particularly after Trump suggested a deal might involve "swapping of territories." Several European leaders issued a joint statement echoing that peace cannot be decided without Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A man in Leicestershire, UK, was wrongly issued a £165 parking penalty after an automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system confused his car with another vehicle. Richard Lynn had paid for 30 minutes of parking, but the system's photographic evidence showed his Hyundai entering and a different car, a Kia with a nearly identical plate, leaving nine hours later. Despite the clear error, he received a threatening letter from solicitors demanding payment. The private parking firm stated the issue was rectified, but Mr. Lynn had not received confirmation, raising concerns that others are unfairly pressured into paying incorrect fines.</p>

          <p>A recent statement by musician Ed Sheeran, who was born and raised in England, describing himself as "culturally Irish" has ignited a debate about identity and heritage. Sheeran, who has Irish grandparents and an Irish passport, defended his connection but faced some criticism online. The article explores the evolving and complex nature of what it means to be Irish in 2025, moving beyond simple definitions of birthplace or citizenship. It touches upon the blended identities common in the UK, the historical context of Irish immigration, and how various figures represent a wide spectrum of "Irishness" that defies narrow labels.</p>

          <p>The government of Niger is investigating the sale of the largest Martian meteorite ever found on Earth, which was auctioned by Sotheby's in New York for $4.3 million. The 24.7kg rock was discovered in Niger in November 2023 and subsequently sold to an international dealer before appearing at auction. Nigerien officials and heritage advocates argue its export was illegal under laws protecting the nation's natural and cultural heritage, comparing the situation to colonial-era exploitation. Sotheby's maintains that all relevant documentation was in order, but the controversy highlights ambiguous international laws governing the trade of such artifacts.</p>

          <p>The recent release of a new "War of the Worlds" adaptation, which received a 0% initial score on Rotten Tomatoes, has sparked a conversation about the appeal of "so bad they're good" films. Some viewers and critics argue that truly terrible movies can be more memorable and entertaining than bland, forgettable blockbusters. Experts suggest that films failing with earnest ambition, like "The Room" or "Samurai Cop," often build cult followings. The charm lies in their unintentional humor, visible production flaws, and lack of polish, which provides a unique viewing experience that stands out in a crowded content landscape.</p>

The app claimed to rival leading models at a fraction of the development cost, challenging the "bigger is better" approach of US firms. While initial hype has faded, DeepSeek has left a lasting impact by demonstrating the potential of smaller, more efficient models, influencing companies like OpenAI. However, concerns about data security and the company's ties to the Chinese government persist, and American tech giants have since doubled down on massive spending.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Proposes Immediate Deportation for Foreign Criminals After Sentencing</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced new plans to immediately deport foreign national criminals after they receive a custodial sentence, rather than after serving part of their time in prison. Under the proposal, those with fixed-term sentences could be removed right away, with their home country deciding if they serve any remaining time. The Ministry of Justice states this would save British taxpayers money and protect the public, as foreign offenders constitute about 12% of the prison population. Those serving life sentences for the most serious crimes would still serve their full term in the UK before deportation is considered.</p>

          <p>Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has publicly questioned UEFA on social media for a tribute it posted about Palestinian footballer Suleiman al-Obeid that omitted the circumstances of his death. The Palestinian Football Association reported that Obeid, known as the "Pele of Palestinian football," was killed in an Israeli attack while waiting for humanitarian aid in Gaza. UEFA's post on X celebrated Obeid as a talent who gave hope, prompting Salah to respond, "Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?" The incident highlights the ongoing conflict and the sensitive nature of public statements by major organizations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A board-certified neurologist is advising people over 50 to eat more pomegranates to support healthy brain aging. Dr. Mill Etienne highlights that pomegranates are rich in polyphenols, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that can enhance learning and memory. These properties may also help protect the brain from amyloid, the protein that accumulates in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. While beneficial, the article notes that pomegranates can be costly and may interact with certain medications, so consulting a doctor before making significant dietary changes is recommended. Other brain-healthy fruits include blueberries, dark grapes, and avocados.</p>

          <p>Police in London arrested 474 people at a demonstration in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a group proscribed under the Terrorism Act in July. Protesters intentionally courted arrest by displaying signs with messages like "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action" to challenge the ban. The government outlawed the group after activists vandalized military aircraft to protest UK support for Israel. While the Home Secretary defended the ban as necessary for national security, human rights groups like Amnesty International called the mass arrests disproportionate and a threat to freedom of expression.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent dismissal of IRS Commissioner Billy Long was reportedly preceded by a clash with the White House over a request for confidential taxpayer data. The administration sought to use IRS information to help locate undocumented immigrants, but the agency declined to release the data, citing taxpayer privacy rights. The Department of Homeland Security had sent a list of 40,000 names to the IRS for address verification, but the agency could only verify a small fraction. This conflict underscores the administration's pressure on federal agencies to align with its immigration crackdown, a policy that has also impacted the Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>

          <p>In The Hundred cricket competition, Jonny Bairstow's spectacular unbeaten 86 runs from 50 balls was not enough to secure a victory for Welsh Fire against London Spirit. Despite Bairstow's late-game heroics, which included back-to-back sixes, Welsh Fire fell short by eight runs in their pursuit of 164. A top-order collapse left the team struggling at 55-6, leaving Bairstow with too much to do in the final overs. London Spirit's total was anchored by David Warner's unbeaten 70, securing their first win of the competition and leaving both the Welsh Fire men's and women's teams winless.</p>

          <p>Uruguayan striker Darwin Nunez has ended his time at Liverpool, joining Saudi Pro League team Al-Hilal in a deal worth €53 million (£46.3m). Nunez arrived at Liverpool in 2022 for a large fee with high expectations but struggled to maintain a consistent starting role, scoring 40 goals in 143 appearances. Despite memorable moments, including several late game-winning goals, his inconsistency led the club to seek other options under new head coach Arne Slot. The departure comes as Liverpool rebuilds its squad, having recently made significant signings in its forward and midfield positions.</p>

The proposal, approved by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet, has been widely criticized internationally and has reportedly been warned against even by Israel's own army chief.

          <p>A wildfire in Southern California, named the Canyon Fire, has burned nearly 5,400 acres and prompted evacuation orders for thousands of residents near the border of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. The blaze spread rapidly due to extreme heat and dry conditions, though favorable overnight weather allowed firefighters to achieve 28% containment by Saturday morning. A Kern County firefighter suffered serious injuries when his truck rolled over a steep hillside while battling the fire. With temperatures forecast to remain high, officials are urging residents to stay on alert as crews continue to work on strengthening control lines around the active fire.</p>
