          <p>Norway faces pressure to allow its sovereign wealth fund to invest in defense companies, a move opposed by some due to ethical concerns.  The ban, in place since the early 2000s, prevents investment in firms producing nuclear weapons components and other controversial items.

          <p>In a first for China's Communist Party, Politburo members Li Ganjie and Shi Taifeng swapped their positions as heads of the personnel and United Front Work departments.  Li Ganjie now leads the United Front Work Department, responsible for propaganda and outreach to non-party members.  Shi Taifeng takes over the Organisation Department, overseeing the appointment and promotion of senior officials. This unusual move suggests potential shifts in power dynamics within the party.</p>

          <p>Susan Crawford, a liberal judge backed by Democrats, won the Wisconsin Supreme Court election, defeating conservative Brad Schimel despite significant funding from Elon Musk and an endorsement from President Trump.  The race was the most expensive judicial election in US history.  Crawford's victory maintains the court's 4-3 liberal majority and has significant implications for upcoming cases on abortion and other key issues. This highlights the increasing politicization of judicial elections and the influence of wealthy donors.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that Mahmoud Khalil's deportation case will remain in New Jersey, rejecting the government's attempt to move it to Louisiana.  The decision prevents the case from potentially being heard by a more conservative appeals court.  Khalil's attorneys argue the government's actions are politically motivated and violate his rights. This case highlights concerns about the use of immigration law for political purposes and the importance of due process.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans plan to use a controversial budget maneuver to pass their $5 trillion tax cut package, potentially breaking Senate rules.  Their strategy involves using a "current policy" baseline, which assumes the 2017 tax cuts will be extended indefinitely.  Democrats criticize this approach as "going nuclear" and violating established norms. This highlights the intense political battles surrounding fiscal policy and the potential for partisan gridlock.</p>
