          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israeli forces recovered the bodies of two Israeli-American hostages, Judy Weinstein-Hagi and Gadi Hagi, from the Khan Younis area in Gaza. The couple, dual U.S.-Israeli citizens, were killed during Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack and their bodies were subsequently abducted. Netanyahu stated that efforts to return all abductees, both living and deceased, will continue relentlessly. Currently, 56 hostages remain in Gaza, with 20 believed to be alive, including two Americans, Itay Chen and Omer Neutra, presumed dead.</p>

Germany aims to adapt its military posture to align with NATO's collective defense plans, reinforcing its eastern flank following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Pistorius has proposed a voluntary service model that allows for compulsory conscription if needed, where 18-year-olds would receive a questionnaire about their interest in the army, and some would be recruited for an initial six-month period.</p>

          <p>The government announced that free school meals will be extended to an additional 500,000 children in England from September 2026, benefiting families receiving Universal Credit regardless of their income. This change, expected to save parents £500 annually, aims to lift 100,000 children out of poverty. While Labour faces scrutiny over child poverty plans, the Education Secretary stated that ministers are working quickly on next year's plans to further extend free school meals. The Department for Education has allocated £1 billion to fund the changes up to 2029, alongside £13 million for food charities to combat food poverty.</p>

Members of the House Armed Services Committee voiced concerns that the Defense Department is reallocating approximately $1 billion from various accounts, including base housing, to enhance border security. While the Army has met its recruiting goals for the year, officials believe the parade will inspire a new generation to serve.

          <p>Burundi held parliamentary elections with the ruling CNDD-FDD party expected to maintain its dominance due to the sidelining of the main opposition. The National Freedom Council (CNL), the primary rival, was suspended in 2023 and its leader ousted in a move seen as government orchestrated. Critics say the ruling party is leaving nothing to chance amid a deep socio-economic crisis, with the country grappling with shortages, inflation, and rising public anger. The election is likely to reinforce the ruling party's grip on power as it faces internal pressure over economic mismanagement and political repression.</p>

          <p>The UK's medicines regulator has warned women using weight-loss injections to use effective contraception, as it's unknown if the medicines could harm an unborn baby. Weight-loss jabs may reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill, especially in overweight or obese women, due to side effects like vomiting and diarrhea. The MHRA advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward, and those using Mounjaro with oral contraceptives should use condoms for four weeks after starting the drug. The safety body emphasizes that these injections must not be taken during pregnancy, while trying to conceive, or during breastfeeding.</p>

The evacuation included homes, hotels, schools, a hospital, nursing homes, museums, office buildings, and the Messe/Deutz train station, as well as three bridges across the Rhine.</p>

The writers discuss what each team needs to do to win, with the Thunder needing to maintain their defensive intensity and the Pacers needing to protect the ball and get strong performances from their stars. They also debate whether having two small-market teams in the finals is a problem, with most arguing that it is not. Ultimately, the writers are split on who will win, with some predicting the Thunder in five games and others predicting the Pacers in seven.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the generational divide in views on sex and gender in Britain, noting that younger people are more likely to support transgender rights activism and disagree with the legal definition of "woman" being based on biological sex. The author suggests that this divide may be due to a cohort effect, where younger generations are more relaxed about sex and sexuality and committed to personal freedoms. However, the author argues that valuing inclusion over bodily privacy or fairness is sexist, as it disadvantages women, and sees the emphasis on individual self-definition as congruent with consumer capitalism.</p>

This drop-off coincides with both platforms reducing their U.S. advertising spending since the tariff announcements.

Retired police dogs face risks in the line of duty, and without financial support, there are concerns they may struggle to find homes, especially older dogs.

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan has publicly appealed to WWE legend Paul "Triple H" Levesque to bring WrestleMania to London. Khan stated that London would host a "festival" of wrestling legends, current stars, and future stars if WrestleMania were to come to the city. The event, dubbed the "Super Bowl of Wrestling," has never been held outside of North America. Speculation about London as a host destination has been growing since 2023, with John Cena backing the idea.</p>
