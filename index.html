            <p>Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Shenzhen stock indexes experienced gains following interventions by Chinese state funds aimed at stabilizing the market amid a global sell-off. The Hang Seng Index rose 1.7%, while the CSI 300 index also saw an increase. This intervention signals an effort to mitigate investor panic and support market confidence in the face of economic uncertainties. Japan's Nikkei 225 index also saw a rise at the open, reflecting a broader trend of stabilization in Asian markets.</p>

            <p>Amidst increasing trade tensions instigated by the U.S., Sino-European relations have seen increased engagement, evidenced by softened tones from European leaders and diplomatic visits to Beijing. This shift suggests a potential 'US plus one' strategy where Europe seeks to maintain ties with both the U.S. and China. Hong Kong plays a crucial role as a gateway between the world and mainland China, facilitating increased interest in China from various sectors. The article suggests that this European engagement could serve as a contingency plan given the current adversarial transatlantic relationship.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can continue using the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members, but clarified that deportees must be given an opportunity to challenge their removal. The 5-4 ruling specifies that challenges must be raised in Texas, where the migrants are confined, and not in Washington D.C. The court emphasized that judicial review is required, ensuring detainees receive notice and can seek habeas relief before deportation, although critics warn of potential human rights abuses.</p>

            <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has begun redeploying staff to respond to the measles outbreak in Texas, following layoffs that impacted the agency's response. This action follows the death of another unvaccinated child in the outbreak. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. emphasized the importance of the MMR vaccine in preventing the spread of measles, despite his previous controversial statements on vaccine safety.</p>

            <p>Jenna Ortega revealed that her departure from 'Scream VII' was due to production issues, not pay or scheduling conflicts. The decision followed the firing of Melissa Barrera and the subsequent resignation of director Christopher Landon. Ortega stated that if the film was not going to be with the original team, it didn't seem like the right move for her career. The screenwriter Kevin Williamson will now be directing the seventh installment of 'Scream'.</p>

            <p>Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has stated that President Trumpâ€™s decision to extend the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTokâ€™s US assets may violate the law. Warner also expressed concerns that the reported deal under consideration would not meet legal requirements for eliminating ByteDanceâ€™s influence over TikTokâ€™s US operations under a 2024 law. The deal would spin off TikTokâ€™s US operations into a new company majority-owned and operated by US investors.</p>

            <p>President Trump's decision to launch a trade war with China is a historic and daring move, despite not being reciprocal. While most politicians are condemned for not fulfilling their election promises, Trump has followed through on his campaign pledge. From Trumpâ€™s perspective, these actions are necessary to pull the US back from the precipice of decline. The new tariffs imposed during his second term caught financial markets off guard because they did not believe the president would have the audacity to follow through.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume deportations of migrants claimed to be members of a Venezuelan gang, using a wartime authority, but with the requirement of judicial review. The high court split 5-4, granting the Justice Department's request for emergency relief, while critics argue it disregards the rule of law. The decision confirms that detainees have the right to challenge their deportation, though the venue for their case is confined to Texas.</p>
