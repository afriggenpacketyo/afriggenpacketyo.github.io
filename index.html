          <p>Car buyers are flocking to dealerships to capitalize on federal tax credits for electric vehicles before they expire on September 30th. The credits, offering $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used EVs, were introduced under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act but are being phased out. This impending deadline has spurred a significant surge in EV demand, with sales reaching record highs in August and dealers offering additional incentives to clear inventory. While some experts predict a potential sales drop-off in October, others believe the impact will be minimal due to initially modest sales figures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump expressed a new perspective on the war in Ukraine, stating on social media that he believes the country is now in a position to win back all its territory from a weakened Russia. This marks a shift from his previous calls for Ukraine to make concessions. In separate developments, Senate Judiciary Democrats have launched an investigation into White House border czar Tom Homan, following the Justice Department's decision to close a probe into his activities. Additionally, Trump affirmed that NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that violate their airspace.</p>

          <p>Disney is raising the subscription prices for its Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN streaming packages, with most plans increasing by $2 to $3 per month starting October 21st. The company had previously indicated these hikes were coming and expects a modest increase in subscribers for its fourth fiscal quarter. This announcement comes as Disney faces public scrutiny over its handling of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," which was temporarily pulled off the air following controversial comments by the host. Some viewers had called for canceling their Disney+ subscriptions in response to the show's initial suspension.</p>

          <p>A recent monsoon in Southern California caused severe mudslides and flash floods, particularly impacting areas with previous burn scars like Oak Glen and Forest Falls. The storm resulted in the destruction of three homes, damage to over a dozen other properties, and the indefinite closure of a portion of Highway 38. Tragically, the flash flooding also led to the death of a two-year-old child in Barstow when the vehicle he was in was washed away by the torrent of water.</p>

          <p>Aakash Singh, an Associate Deputy Attorney General at the Department of Justice, pleaded guilty to a driving under the influence charge in North Carolina four years ago. Since his 2021 arrest, Singh has been promoted and is reportedly directing aggressive prosecutions of minor crimes and protesters in Washington D.C. Legal experts interviewed for the article expressed that promoting an official with such a criminal history to a high-ranking post is unusual for the DOJ, which typically maintains strict standards regarding the background of its attorneys. The Justice Department defended Singh as a valued member of the department.</p>

          <p>Recent statements by President Trump warning against the use of acetaminophen (Tylenol) during pregnancy due to a purported link to autism have created confusion for parents. The article examines the scientific research, noting that while some studies suggest an association, they do not prove causation, and larger, more controlled studies have found no such causal link. Medical experts emphasize that untreated fever and pain during pregnancy pose known risks to both mother and fetus, and acetaminophen remains one of the few safe options available. They advise parents to consult their medical providers rather than making decisions based on political discourse.</p>

The piece also contrasts fixed-rate home equity loans with variable-rate Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), which currently offer slightly lower initial payments but carry the risk of future rate increases.

          <p>This article analyzes the recent threats by FCC Chair Brendan Carr against Disney and its affiliates over Jimmy Kimmel's show, suggesting that revoking a broadcast license is legally and historically improbable. The FCC has rarely taken such an extreme step for content-related issues due to First Amendment protections. Instead, the author argues Carr's real leverage lies in the FCC's power to approve or deny mergers and acquisitions, creating a coercive environment for media companies like Nexstar and Sinclair, who have business pending before the agency. These companies' decisions to preempt Kimmel's show may be driven more by business incentives than by a real fear of losing their licenses.</p>

          <p>England has named its squad for the upcoming Ashes tour in Australia, featuring what is being described as its most hostile group of fast bowlers in decades. The attack, including Mark Wood, Jofra Archer, and Josh Tongue, is designed to counter Australia's pace on their home pitches. The article notes the absence of veteran James Anderson for the first time in over 20 years, signaling a strategic shift. While the pace attack is promising, concerns remain about the durability of several key bowlers and the fitness of captain Ben Stokes, whose presence is considered crucial for England's chances.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has ruled that Rex Heuermann, the man accused in the Gilgo Beach serial killings, will face a single trial for all seven murders he is charged with. Heuermann's defense team had argued for separate trials, citing disparities in the evidence across the different cases, but the judge denied their motion. Prosecutors successfully argued that the cases were linked by Heuermann's alleged modus operandi and his familiarity with the locations where the victims' remains were discovered.

          <p>Major League Baseball will implement an automated ball-strike (ABS) system, often called "robot umpires," starting in the 2026 season. The system will function as a challenge mechanism, with human umpires still making the initial calls on the field. Each team will be allowed to challenge two ball or strike calls per game, with the ABS technology making the final determination. The move, which has been tested extensively in the minor leagues, is expected to increase accuracy and potentially reduce on-field arguments and ejections related to disputed calls at the plate.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has reiterated his positive outlook on Boeing, citing reports that the U.S. and China are in the final stages of negotiating a massive aircraft order. Cramer's investment thesis is that countries looking to reduce their trade deficits with the U.S. can do so by purchasing Boeing planes, a pattern observed with recent deals involving Japan, Korea, and Middle Eastern nations. The potential China deal, along with other recent orders from Turkey and Uzbekistan, is seen as a significant catalyst for the aircraft manufacturer's stock, reinforcing the bull case for the company.

The remarks come amid a campaign by the White House to increase its influence over the independent agency. Powell reiterated that the Fed's recent rate cut was driven by economic data indicating rising risks to employment alongside persistent inflation concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a new report from CDC researchers, U.S. infection rates from highly drug-resistant bacteria, known as "nightmare bacteria," increased by nearly 70% between 2019 and 2023. The rise was primarily driven by bacteria containing the NDM gene, which makes them resistant to most antibiotics, including last-resort carbapenems. Researchers suggest the surge may be linked to increased antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic. The report warns of the grave danger of community spread, which could make common infections like urinary tract infections increasingly difficult to treat.</p>
