          <p>A severe storm system is causing significant travel disruptions across the U.S. East Coast, complicating plans for millions traveling for the July 4th holiday. The Federal Aviation Administration has issued ground stops and delays at major airports, including those in New York City, Boston, and Washington D.C. On Monday alone, Newark Liberty Airport experienced four-hour delays, contributing to nearly 600 cancellations and 1,900 delays across five major airports. The disruptions are expected to continue as the National Weather Service forecasts more heavy rain and potential flooding along the coast.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government experienced a significant political humiliation after being forced into a U-turn on a key welfare reform bill. Despite having a large majority, a substantial rebellion from his own Labour MPs nearly defeated the legislation, forcing a last-minute concession. The chaotic episode has been compared to the turbulent Brexit-era parliamentary battles, weakening the Prime Minister's authority and raising questions about his control over the party. The event has led to internal anger and speculation about inevitable tax rises to cover the policy change.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the Miccosukee Tribe in Florida are protesting the construction of a new migrant detention facility, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," located near their ancestral homes in the Everglades. The tribe raises serious concerns about the facility's proximity to their villages, the lack of an environmental impact study, and the potential for ecological damage to the sensitive Everglades ecosystem. Tribal Chairman Talbert Cypress emphasized the safety risks and the disruption from increased traffic and flights. The administration, however, views the surrounding treacherous swampland as a natural deterrent for the facility.</p>

The Broward Sheriff's Office is investigating the incident but has clarified that, contrary to some social media reports, the girl was not being held over the railing by her father before the fall. A passenger and a crew member reported that the girl had climbed the railing while her parents were nearby.

          <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to prematurely end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 521,000 Haitian immigrants. The ruling states that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted unlawfully by not following the congressionally mandated process for reconsidering Haiti's TPS designation. The judge found that the interests of the Haitian immigrants, who rely on the status to live and work in the U.S., far outweigh potential harm to the government. This decision provides temporary relief to thousands facing deportation amid ongoing instability in Haiti.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants apprehended for crossing the U.S. southern border illegally dropped to a historic monthly low in June, with just over 6,000 recorded apprehensions. Preliminary government data shows this continues an exceptional decline in illegal immigration, which the Trump administration attributes to its aggressive enforcement and deportation policies. This figure is a stark contrast to the peak levels under the previous administration, where daily crossings sometimes exceeded 10,000. For the second consecutive month, Border Patrol reportedly did not release any migrants into the U.S. interior, instead processing them for swift deportation.</p>

The conflict centers on Trump's major spending bill, which Musk criticized for increasing the national debt and cutting support for renewable energy and EV tax credits. These changes could negatively impact Tesla's sales and its energy division. In response, Trump suggested Musk could lose more than just his "EV mandate," alluding to the billions in federal contracts and credits his companies have received. (not investment advice)</p>

The legislation, known as HR 1, extends the 2017 tax cuts and funds the administration's agenda but is criticized for potentially adding over $2.4 trillion to the national debt over a decade. The bill's passage has been contentious, narrowly clearing the House and requiring a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President in the Senate.

          <p>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Fresno has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing the financial strain of managing 153 clergy sexual abuse claims. Bishop Joseph V. Brennan stated that bankruptcy is the only way to fairly compensate survivors while allowing the diocese to continue its ministry. However, attorneys for the victims have condemned the filing as a delay tactic designed to shield the church from accountability and force survivors into a lengthy, impersonal legal process. The claims emerged after a 2020 California law temporarily lifted the statute of limitations for civil sexual assault cases.</p>

          <p>A new study in The Lancet medical journal estimates that programs from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) have saved over 90 million lives in the past two decades. The research warns that the Trump administration's decision to shut down the agency could lead to approximately 14 million preventable deaths by 2030 if the cuts become permanent. The administration has disputed the findings, arguing the agency was inefficient and that life-saving work will continue more effectively under a new model.

          <p>Parts of England are now in an official state of drought, and other regions could soon follow if dry conditions persist. The UK experienced its sixth driest spring since 1836, leading to significantly low levels in rivers and reservoirs, particularly in northern England. While June brought some rain to western areas, central and eastern England remained dry, exacerbating the problem. The conditions are already impacting farmers, who face higher irrigation costs, and threatening wetland wildlife habitats, raising concerns about the country's resilience to climate change.</p>

However, economists warn of significant challenges ahead, particularly a potential slowdown in export growth. While increased trade with other partners has offset some of the decline in U.S. shipments, analysts forecast that exports could contract in the latter half of the year due to a front-loading of orders and an expected slowdown in American consumer spending. This creates an uphill climb for Beijing to sustain its economic momentum. (not investment advice)</p>
