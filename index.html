          <p>A panga-style fishing boat capsized off the coast of San Diego, resulting in the deaths of three people and leaving seven others missing. At least sixteen people, including two children, were aboard the vessel when it overturned near Torrey Pines State Beach. The U.S. Coast Guard is treating the incident as a suspected human smuggling operation. Four individuals were hospitalized, and the search for the missing continues, with uncertainty surrounding the total number of victims who may have been in the water.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested reopening Alcatraz as a federal prison, prompting reactions from tourists visiting the island, now a historical site. Many visitors expressed disbelief and questioned the practicality of the idea, citing the prison's deteriorated condition and high maintenance costs. While the Bureau of Prisons stated it would assess the feasibility of restoring Alcatraz, California officials dismissed the proposal as a distraction. Alcatraz, which closed in 1963 due to high costs, currently serves as a popular tourist attraction and historical landmark.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to trim the IRS workforce has resulted in almost one-third of its tax auditors leaving the agency through March, according to a report from the U.S. Treasury Department's watchdog. The report found that 31% of revenue agents, or about 3,600 auditors, took either the deferred resignation plan or were fired in the first three months of 2025. This reduction in auditors could negatively impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue, as these agents handle cases involving wealthy taxpayers and corporations.</p>
