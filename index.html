          <p>Recent polls indicate a decline in American faith in Donald Trump's performance across various key issues, including the economy and immigration policy. A majority of respondents described Trump's second term as "scary," and a significant portion, including some Republicans, question whether he is focused on the right priorities. Trump's approval ratings are historically low for this stage of a presidency, with disapproval of his trade policies and workforce cuts. The surveys suggest growing public fatigue with his administration's direction, especially among independent and younger voters.</p>
