            <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has signed bills to officially rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America in Florida state law, following President Trump's directive. The bills mandate changes in state laws, require state agencies to update geographic materials, and ensure school instructional materials include the new name. Senator Nick DiCeglie stated that Florida is proud to follow Trump's lead in recognizing the Gulf of America, emphasizing American exceptionalism and prioritizing America first. This action signifies Florida's alignment with the Trump administration's vision and its commitment to promoting a strong national identity.</p>

            <p>An American college student, Owen Ray, detained in Denmark for nearly two weeks over an alleged assault on an Uber driver, maintains his innocence and expresses shock at his arrest. Ray claims that a dispute arose when he and his friend entered the wrong address, and the Uber driver allegedly became aggressive after they canceled the ride. After being detained at the airport, Ray was initially imprisoned for 10 days, during which he struggled to contact his family. Ray hopes the Danish authorities will drop the case, allowing him to return home by Easter.</p>

            <p>Following the ouster of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, efforts to investigate war crimes and locate missing persons are being hampered by cuts to U.S. foreign aid. Groups like the White Helmets, who are crucial for excavating mass graves and providing first response, have lost significant funding from USAID. This reduction in aid is slowing down the process of gathering evidence for possible war crimes trials and hindering the ability to support survivors and families of the missing. Despite the end of the civil war, the need for resources to clear mines and document atrocities remains critical for transitional justice in Syria.</p>

            <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance expressed optimism regarding a potential trade deal between the U.K. and the U.S., citing President Trump's fondness for the United Kingdom and its cultural affinity with America. Vance stated that the administration is actively working with Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government to secure an agreement. The U.K. was relatively spared from Trump's tariff regime, which imposed a 10% duty on imports compared to the 20% tariff on EU neighbors. British officials are actively pursuing a trade deal with the U.S., though the scope of the agreement remains uncertain.</p>

            <p>According to a CNBC Supply Chain Survey, President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to result in a reshoring boom, as most companies find the costs prohibitive. Instead, companies are more likely to relocate supply chains to lower-tariffed countries. Over half of the respondents cited cost as the primary reason for not reshoring, while others mentioned the challenge of finding skilled labor. The majority of respondents believe that building a new domestic supply chain would at least double current costs, and many feel that the Trump administration is bullying corporate America.</p>

CEO Brian Moynihan cited the resilience of consumers and the strong performance of business clients.

            <p>US Vice-President JD Vance expressed optimism about a UK-US trade deal, but the key question is what the term "deal" actually means. The US has now levied a 10% tax on UK imports as part of its "reciprocal tariffs," but there is no general problem with this trading relationship. The mood music from Washington is that this 10% tariff is not for negotiation with anyone, making an exception for one country would simply invite significant trade diversion.</p>

The CSIS report warns that this will likely result in a pause in exports as Beijing establishes the licensing system, and cause disruptions in supply to some U.S. firms.</p>
