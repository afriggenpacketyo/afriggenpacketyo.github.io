        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy anticipates that AI agents will soon replace some human employees in the company's corporate offices. In a memo to employees, Jassy stated that the company expects to reduce its corporate workforce in the coming years as it increasingly utilizes generative AI tools. This move towards AI is expected to improve efficiency across the company, ultimately leading to a smaller corporate workforce, although some employees have expressed concerns about the intensified work environment and routine tasks associated with AI implementation. The company currently has 1,000 generative AI services in development or already built. Optimism is tempered by concerns about job displacement and the changing nature of work. </p>

          <p>Republican Sen. Mike Lee removed social media posts referencing the assassination of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband after facing backlash for his comments. Lee's posts, which blamed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for the shootings, were criticized as politicizing the tragedy and inciting violence. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar confirmed she spoke with Lee before he took down the posts. Democrats and Republicans alike condemned Lee's initial posts, urging elected officials to reduce heated rhetoric in the wake of the attacks. The incident has prompted widespread calls for political leaders to avoid inflammatory language. </p>

          <p>JetBlue Airways is implementing additional cost-cutting measures as weaker-than-expected travel demand makes achieving break-even operating margins in 2025 unlikely. CEO Joanna Geraghty informed staff that the airline is relying on borrowed cash and needs to find ways to increase revenue and cut costs. These measures include further reductions in off-peak flights, trimming unprofitable routes, and pausing plans to retrofit older Airbus A320 jets. The airline is also assessing its hiring plans and considering combining leadership roles to reduce spending. These cuts come after federal judges blocked JetBlue's planned acquisition of Spirit Airlines and its Northeast U.S. alliance with American Airlines. </p>

          <p>LIV Golf star Phil Mickelson criticized San Francisco's leadership in response to a report ranking the city as the worst-run in the U.S. Mickelson stated that the city is being ruined by poor leadership, reacting to a WalletHub study that measured the effectiveness of local leadership. The study cited financial stability, education, health, safety, economy, and infrastructure as key metrics. San Francisco ranked low in total budget per capita, reflecting ongoing issues with homelessness and open-air drug use. The ranking comes after a recent election that signaled a shift away from soft-on-crime policies, with voters hoping for improvements in the city's management. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump warned Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that he is an "easy target" and demanded Tehran's unconditional surrender amid escalating tensions with Israel. Trump declared "total control" over Iran's airspace and cautioned against missile attacks on civilians or American soldiers. The U.S. president held a meeting in the Situation Room with his national security advisors to discuss the Israel-Iran conflict. Trump's remarks followed reports that he vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Khamenei, although he is now weighing whether to help Israel destroy Iran's underground uranium enrichment facility. These events have led to increased geopolitical tensions and market volatility. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met with his national security team in the Situation Room to discuss the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. This meeting occurred after Trump returned early from the G7 summit in Canada, citing Middle East tensions. Trump denied having contacted Iranian leaders about a potential ceasefire, stating he was not in the mood to negotiate. He also dismissed an assessment from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who had stated that Iran was not working on a nuclear weapon. Trump warned Iran not to target U.S. troops, as the U.S. has remained on the sidelines of the conflict so far. </p>

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion for women, marking the most significant change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, put forward by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, passed with a majority of 242 votes. While the law will still penalize those who assist a woman in obtaining an abortion outside the legal framework, women who terminate their pregnancies outside the rules will no longer face police investigation. This decision was welcomed by abortion providers and organizations, although some groups expressed concerns about the implications for unborn children. </p>

Working with Loyola Project for the Innocent, Dorotik persistently fought for a new examination of the evidence, maintaining her innocence. The District Attorney's Office ultimately dismissed the charges due to insufficient evidence, though the case could be reopened if new evidence surfaces.

          <p>Jane Dorotik, whose murder conviction was recently overturned, maintains that her bedroom was not a crime scene, despite investigators finding spots of blood throughout the room. Dorotik explained that her husband had a nosebleed and their dogs had bled, but authorities dismissed her explanations. According to the appeal, not every spot believed to be blood was tested, and some stains turned out not to be blood at all. Dorotik spent years seeking a new examination of the evidence, arguing that authorities focused on her from the beginning and failed to follow other leads.

          <p>The Justice Department experienced a reduction of 4,000 employees due to the Trump administration's government downsizing initiative, raising concerns about the impact on community safety. The "fork in the road" deferred resignation program resulted in an estimated savings of $470 million. Further reductions are planned, including 1,500 positions in the FBI. Former officials and law enforcement analysts worry that these cuts will drain the agency of experienced agents and leaders. The budget summary also revealed plans to close the agency's Community Relations Service. </p>
