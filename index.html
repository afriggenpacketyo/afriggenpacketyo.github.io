        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran has stated it will not resume nuclear talks while under attack, following warnings from Israel's defense minister about a potential prolonged conflict. This announcement came after Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European diplomats urging the revival of diplomatic efforts with the U.S. regarding Iran's nuclear program. Israel's ambassador to the UN accused Iran of pursuing a "genocidal agenda" and posing a continuous threat, vowing to target nuclear facilities until they are dismantled. US President Donald Trump has given Iran a "maximum" of two weeks to avoid potential American air strikes, aiming to prompt them to "come to their senses."</p>

          <p>The United States' failure to secure a tariff deal with Japan and threats to impose new duties on imports from multiple countries could embolden China in trade negotiations. Analysts suggest these developments make the U.S. appear weak, giving Beijing's negotiators more leverage. China was significantly impacted by U.S. President Donald Trump's increased duties on Chinese imports earlier this year. A finance professor at the University of Hong Kong argues that these threats signal desperation from the U.S. and should encourage Chinese negotiators to take a firmer stance.</p>

Personal stylists note that wearing shorts to the office is still a gray area, often deemed too casual for client-facing roles.

The attack occurred as diplomatic efforts to negotiate a settlement began in Geneva between European foreign ministers and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. President Trump stated that the U.S. is "ready, willing and able" and has been speaking to Iran, while also indicating it would be "very hard right now" to request Israel pause its offensive. Israel's military reported conducting strikes on multiple military and nuclear targets in Iran.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew, the husband of Suzanne Morphew, has been rearrested for first-degree murder in connection with her death more than five years ago. This marks the second time Barry Morphew has faced murder charges in this case, after the initial charges were dismissed in April 2022. Suzanne's remains were discovered in September 2023, and her death was ruled a homicide. The indictment reveals that drugs typically used as tranquilizers for wildlife were detected in her remains, with the cause of death attributed to "Homicide by unspecified means in the setting of butorphanol, azaperone, and medetomidine intoxication."</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has allowed a University of Texas at Austin student to continue his free speech case against the school after he was arrested during a pro-Palestinian protest last year. Ammer Qaddumi filed a lawsuit claiming the university violated his First Amendment rights when he was arrested during an April 2024 protest on campus. Judge Robert Pitman dismissed the case against former President Jay Hartzell and Vice President Sharon Wood but ruled that it may continue against interim UT-Austin President James E. Davis. Qaddumi argues that the university's attempt to cancel the event before the students expressed themselves violates their First Amendment rights.</p>
