          <p>Amazon's second-quarter performance surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue growing 13% year-over-year to $167.7 billion, driven by strong results in its advertising and cloud divisions. However, the company's shares declined in extended trading due to a weaker-than-expected operating income forecast for the third quarter. This cautious guidance overshadowed the otherwise positive results, signaling potential challenges ahead despite the current growth acceleration. The report indicates a mixed financial picture for the e-commerce and cloud computing giant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) reported second-quarter revenue of $30.87 billion, marking an 18% year-over-year increase and slightly beating analyst forecasts. While the cloud division remains a significant profit center for Amazon, its growth rate is currently slower than that of its main competitors, Microsoft and Google. The article notes that AWS continues to lead the cloud infrastructure market but faces intensifying pressure as all three tech giants heavily invest in artificial intelligence to capture booming demand. AWS now accounts for 18% of Amazon's total revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study published in the journal Cell has revealed that the modern potato's ancestor is the tomato, with the potato evolving from it around 9 million years ago. Scientists solved this long-standing puzzle by discovering that a hybridization event between an ancient tomato and a wild, non-tuber-producing potato species led to the modern vegetable. The ancient tomato provided a crucial gene for tuber formation, while the wild potato species contributed a gene that controls stem growth. This research was based on the analysis of hundreds of potato genomes.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh addressed the increasing use of the court's emergency docket, defending its handling of urgent appeals, particularly from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, he suggested that as presidents rely more on executive orders, a rise in legal challenges requiring swift court intervention is a natural consequence. Kavanaugh acknowledged public criticism but asserted that the court has adapted its processes and maintained strong collegiality among the justices, even amid sharp disagreements on contentious issues.</p>

          <h2>Federal Appeals Court Scrutinizes Trump's Use of Emergency Powers for Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court sharply questioned the Trump administration's legal basis for using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose widespread tariffs. During arguments, judges probed why the administration used a law that does not mention tariffs, bypassing other trade statutes with specific constraints, and expressed concern over the seemingly unbounded authority the president was claiming. The case, brought by a coalition of states and small businesses, represents a major legal challenge to a cornerstone of the administration's economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a rare public forum, three federal judges detailed the "daunting" and "frightening" threats and harassment they have received, including death threats and schemes like "pizza doxxing." The judges linked the surge in hostility directly to inflammatory rhetoric from political leaders who attack the judiciary after unfavorable rulings. They warned that such personal attacks undermine the rule of law by emboldening individuals to threaten judges and their families. The judges called on political figures to cease the rhetoric and respect the judicial process.</p>

          <p>Germany's Foreign Minister, Johann Wadephul, warned that Israel is in danger of becoming internationally isolated due to its actions in Gaza and that Germany has a responsibility to help prevent this. During a trip to Jerusalem, he described the humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territory as "beyond imagination" and stressed that Israel must allow sufficient aid to enter. The diplomatic visit was marked by tension, as a far-right Israeli minister accused the German government of supporting Nazism, underscoring the growing friction over the conflict.</p>

          <p>Tata Steel has been ordered to pay a £1.5 million fine for health and safety failures that resulted in the 2019 death of contractor Justin Day at its Port Talbot facility in Wales. Day was crushed by a large steel beam when he re-entered a work area that had been partially reactivated without his knowledge. The court found that the company's safety protocols were not adequately followed. The victim's family described their lives as "shattered" and criticized the company for a lack of support following the tragedy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proceeding with a long-discussed plan to construct a new, 90,000-square-foot ballroom at the White House, with construction set to begin in September. The project, estimated to cost $200 million and be funded by President Trump and private donors, will replace the current East Wing. The new venue will have a seating capacity of 650, addressing Trump's long-standing complaint about using what he considers unsightly and costly tents for large state dinners and other major events. The design will reportedly mirror the architectural heritage of the main building.</p>
