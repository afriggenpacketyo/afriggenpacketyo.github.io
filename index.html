          <p>A shooting at a Catholic school in Minneapolis has resulted in the deaths of two children, aged eight and ten, with seventeen other people injured during a morning worship service. The suspected attacker, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, is also deceased. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics. Authorities discovered a manifesto the suspect had timed to publish online, which was subsequently taken down.</p>

          <p>A US Open match between Taylor Townsend and Jelena Ostapenko concluded with a tense verbal confrontation at the net after Townsend's straight-sets victory. Ostapenko later claimed on social media that Townsend had been disrespectful during the match, while Townsend stated that Ostapenko insulted her education and class during the post-match handshake. The incident highlights the competitive tension at the tournament, with Townsend suggesting the 25th seed was simply upset about losing to a lower-ranked opponent.</p>

          <p>Hollywood producer David Brown has been indicted on 21 federal counts, including wire fraud and money laundering, for allegedly defrauding film partners and investors out of more than $12 million.

          <p>A new NATO report indicates that all 32 member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of their GDP this year. This marks a significant increase in military investment across the alliance, particularly since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. However, the report also highlights that only three countries—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently meeting the new, more ambitious target of 3.5% of GDP.</p>

          <p>In response to a significant rise in threats against members of Congress, a new pilot program has been launched to bolster security for lawmakers. The initiative provides a temporary increase of up to $20,000 for security upgrades at their homes and an additional $5,000 per month for hiring personal security. This move follows a wave of politically motivated violence, including an assassination attempt on President Trump and shootings targeting Minnesota lawmakers, reflecting bipartisan concern over the increasingly volatile political climate.</p>

          <p>A woman arrested for spitting at a police officer at the National Zoo was mistakenly held in a D.C. jail for a week due to a series of bureaucratic errors. Although prosecutors had decided not to seek pretrial detention, Kristal Rios Esquivel remained incarcerated because of a failure to bring her to court promptly and an erroneous warrant flag in the system. A federal judge called the incident "false imprisonment," highlighting systemic issues that required significant intervention from a prosecutor and a defense lawyer to resolve.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed that convicted serial sex offender Zhenhao Zou committed sexual assaults against two different women within a 24-hour period in China. One of the women, who reported the attack to UK police after Zou's conviction, expressed guilt for not coming forward sooner, realizing another attack occurred shortly after hers. The close timing of the offenses highlights the offender's confidence, with police sources noting he was "getting away with it" and escalating his attacks.</p>

          <p>The charity Greater Change is tackling homelessness by providing direct cash grants to individuals at risk of losing their homes, an approach it says is proving effective. The organization has paid out nearly £700,000 this year, allowing recipients to cover essential costs like rent deposits and utility debts, thereby preventing eviction. The charity reports that 86% of the people it has supported have moved into stable housing, arguing the model saves taxpayer money in the long run by providing timely, dignified assistance.</p>

          <p>Author Jacqueline Wilson is releasing "Picture Imperfect," an adult sequel to her acclaimed 1999 children's book, "The Illustrated Mum." The new novel revisits the characters Dolphin and Star as adults, exploring the long-term impact of growing up with their mother Marigold's bipolar disorder. Wilson describes the book as both the easiest and hardest she has written, as she felt a deep connection to the characters but also a responsibility to portray their lives realistically, acknowledging that real life doesn't always have perfect endings.</p>

          <p>Documents released by the UK's data regulator show that Ministry of Defence (MoD) staff had been explicitly warned about the risks of sharing spreadsheets with hidden data before a major leak occurred. Last month, it was revealed that the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghan resettlement applicants were exposed via a hidden tab in an emailed file. The leak is estimated to cost around £850 million, and internal emails show regulator staff questioned why the MoD was not fined for the breach.</p>

This ascent is causing concern in Western markets, leading to new tariffs in the U.S. and EU to protect domestic automakers from what they see as anti-competitive practices.

Cramer asserted that the major tech firms investing heavily in AI have strong leadership and solid fundamentals, justifying their significant capital expenditures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a provocative move, California's Assembly Republican leader has proposed a resolution to split the state in two, separating the liberal coastal areas from the more conservative inland regions. This "two-state solution" is a direct response to a Democratic-led ballot initiative that seeks to redraw congressional district maps, which Republicans argue would silence rural and conservative voices. While the proposal to divide California is a political longshot, it highlights the intense partisan battle over redistricting ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

The article contextualizes this as part of an ongoing feud, tracing back to Meyers' jokes at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner. It highlights late-night television as one of the few platforms consistently challenging the president's policies.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Conservative party is facing a potential existential threat from the rise of Reform UK, which has now attracted its third Member of Scottish Parliament (MSP) defector in four months. With Reform consistently leading the Tories in recent Holyrood opinion polls, leader Russell Findlay is grappling with a fractured party and a challenging political landscape. The defections to different parties—Reform, the Liberal Democrats, and an independent—underscore the difficulty of balancing the party's traditional moderate base with the need to counter a right-wing surge.</p>
