          <p>The World Bank has cleared Syria's $15.5 million debt after Saudi Arabia and Qatar made the payments, allowing the bank to re-engage with Syria to address the nation's development needs following years of conflict. This move follows President Trump's surprise announcement to lift sanctions on Syria, signaling a shift in U.S. policy and easing Syria's diplomatic isolation. DP World, a Dubai-based port operator, has also signed an $800-million memorandum of understanding to develop the Mediterranean port of Tartus, indicating growing confidence in Syria among international investors. Despite these positive developments, Syria faces significant challenges, including damaged infrastructure, displaced populations, and sectarian violence that threatens long-term stability.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed novelist Yiyun Li has written a memoir, "Things in Nature Merely Grow," to confront the suicides of her two sons, James and Vincent, who both died by train strikes years apart.

Li reflects on the different personalities of her sons and the impact their deaths had on her life, including her own past suicide attempts. Despite the immense pain, Li finds moments of joy and fulfillment in her work, friendships, and marriage, maintaining a routine of writing, gardening, and spending time with her husband.</p>

          <p>Calligraphy created by Ahn Jung-geun, a South Korean independence activist who assassinated Japan's first prime minister, Ito Hirobumi, while awaiting execution, is fetching record prices at auction in Seoul. Ahn, revered for his efforts against Japanese encroachment, created the calligraphy in his prison cell, often at the request of Japanese officials. Despite assassinating Ito, some Japanese officials preserved his calligraphy, reflecting the cultural and political contradictions of early 20th-century East Asia. The piece "Green Bamboo" was sold last month for $674,098 to the family of South Korea's LS Group, who intend to share it with the public.</p>

          <p>Eleven inmates, considered "armed and dangerous," escaped from the Orleans Parish Jail in New Orleans, prompting a massive manhunt involving local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. One inmate was quickly apprehended, but the remaining ten are still at large; police believe the escapees had assistance and have likely changed out of their jail attire. Authorities have removed potential victims from their homes and urged witnesses to come forward. The Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office has launched a full investigation into the escape, reviewing facility protocols and security measures to determine how it occurred.</p>

          <p>Mark Cuban, along with veteran sports executives Rashaun Williams and Steve Cannon, has launched Harbinger Sports Partners (HSP), a $750 million private equity fund focused on acquiring minority stakes in U.S. sports franchises. HSP will use a data-driven approach to identify undervalued sports assets, seeking positions of 1% to 5% in 92 franchises with deal sizes ranging from $50 million to $150 million. The move comes as professional sports leagues increasingly open the door to private equity investment, with the NFL recently approving stakes of up to 10% by select firms. Cuban sold his majority stake in the Dallas Mavericks in December 2023 but retains a 27% minority stake.</p>

          <p>Direct peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators in Istanbul resulted in an agreement to conduct a prisoner swap of 1,000 prisoners each. However, the two sides failed to broker a temporary cease-fire or arrange a meeting between Presidents Putin and Zelensky, highlighting the significant differences remaining in ending the conflict. Russia demanded Ukraine withdraw from the four eastern regions annexed in 2022 as a condition for a cease-fire, while Ukraine seeks new sanctions against Russia's energy sector and banks. Despite the limited progress, both sides agreed to present detailed visions of a possible cease-fire and meet again, with Turkey offering to facilitate further discussions.</p>

Judge Hannah Duncan stated that the defendants caused no actual harm or disruption but criticized them for treating their trial as an "extension of the protest" and showing "no remorse."

          <p>Proposed cuts to Medicaid to fund President Trump's agenda are causing concern among Americans who rely on the program for health insurance. An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that these cuts could increase the number of uninsured by at least 8.6 million by 2034. While some Republicans insist the cuts will only eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse, individuals and families who depend on Medicaid worry about reduced access to care and having to choose between healthcare and necessities. Some Republicans are expressing grievances, some because they don't believe the bill does enough to protect vulnerable Americans and others because it does not include some of the most drastic cuts that Republican hardliners were pushing for.</p>

The agreement would represent a reversal in the yearslong effort to hold Boeing accountable for the crashes.

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' defense team is planning to argue "mutual violence" in his trial, suggesting that his relationship with accuser Cassie Ventura involved hitting on both sides. This strategy, similar to the one used in the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard trial, aims to reframe the alleged abuse as consensual. However, legal experts argue that "mutual abuse" is not a legal defense, as abuse is about power and control, not just physical violence. The defense may attempt to portray the violence as a consensual part of the sexual relationship, a strategy seen in other cases involving celebrities.</p>

          <p>Wall Street is wrapping up a strong week, fueled by an agreement between the U.S. and China to reduce tariffs and major investment commitments from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. Technology and consumer discretionary sectors have seen significant gains, with Nvidia and Broadcom being top performers. However, the health care sector lagged behind due to issues with health-insurance stocks and concerns about drug pricing. Earnings reports from Home Depot, Palo Alto Networks, and TJX Companies are expected next week, along with a new era beginning for Capital One Financial as it closes its acquisition of Discover Financial (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>US prosecutors are considering dropping a criminal charge against Boeing, linked to two crashes involving its bestselling 737 Max aircraft. The Department of Justice (DOJ) officials said they were considering allowing the company to sign a non-prosecution agreement to settle the case. This move would avoid a trial over the criminal fraud charge that is due to begin in June, after a judge rejected an earlier settlement in which Boeing had agreed to plead guilty. Lawyers representing families of the crash victims said they were "deeply disappointed" by the new plan.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent trip to the Middle East focused on securing financial agreements and deals, with less emphasis on democracy or human rights. Trump secured investment commitments from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, including Boeing jet purchases and arms deals. Qatar's gift of a 747 to replace Air Force One has drawn criticism, raising ethical concerns and potential violations of the Emoluments Clause. The trip highlighted Trump's transactional approach to foreign policy, prioritizing deals over American moral leadership and downplaying human rights issues in the region.</p>

Mexico's ambassador to the U.S., Esteban Moctezuma Barragán, urged the House Ways and Means Committee to reconsider the proposal, arguing it would harm the economy of both nations. The proposed 5% excise tax on remittances would affect over 40 million people and could lead to double taxation and drive migrants to use informal channels. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the proposal would generate $1 billion in tax revenue in fiscal year 2026.</p>
