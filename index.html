          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 4.3% year-over-year in the second quarter, exceeding economists' predictions of 3.5% growth and accelerating from the previous quarter. This growth was primarily driven by a 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector. Despite the strong performance, the Ministry of Trade and Industry maintains a cautious outlook for the second half of 2025, citing significant global economic uncertainty, particularly regarding U.S. tariff policies. The government has already downgraded its full-year GDP forecast and is rolling out grants to help businesses manage the impacts of trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following deadly flash floods that claimed over 120 lives in central Texas, communities gathered at Sunday church services to process the tragedy and look toward the future. KERA reporter James Hartley observed these services, noting how residents came together to find solace and support in the aftermath of the disaster. The gatherings served as a moment for collective mourning and reflection, providing a space for people to take stock of the immense loss while seeking a path forward. These moments of community solidarity highlight the emotional and spiritual response to the catastrophic natural event.</p>

          <p>At least 37 people, including two children, were killed in southern Syria during violent clashes between Bedouin Sunni tribes and the Druze community. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported the fighting occurred in the predominantly Druze city of Sweida, leaving about 50 others wounded. The violence, which followed a series of kidnappings, represents the deadliest sectarian strife in the area since the new post-Assad government took power. The unrest has forced school closures and highlights the ongoing struggle to maintain security and protect minority rights in the deeply divided country.</p>

          <p>Australia is navigating a complex geopolitical landscape by enhancing its defense and maritime cooperation with the Philippines while managing its significant trade relationship with China. As part of a broader civil maritime program, Australia recently donated equipment to the Philippines and plans to double its investment in related initiatives to A$11.5 million by 2029. This strategic partnership is set to deepen as the two nations approach their 80th anniversary of diplomatic relations in 2026. The move reflects a shared motivation to bolster regional security amidst increasing tensions and strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

          <p>A significant shift is occurring in Chinese higher education, with students increasingly favoring technology and engineering disciplines for their university studies. Fields like information technology and vehicle engineering are now top choices, reflecting a belief that these areas represent the future of industrial development. This trend marks a departure from two decades ago when international trade and urban planning were popular, driven by China's entry into the WTO and its property boom. The current focus is heavily influenced by China's state-driven push to excel in technology amid intensified competition with the United States.</p>

          <p>Prosecutions for fare evasion on the London Underground have climbed to their highest level in six years, with Transport for London (TfL) taking legal action against 3,691 people in 2024-25. In addition to prosecutions, TfL issued over 13,000 penalty fare notices on the Tube during the same period. The transport authority states that fare evasion costs Londoners vital investment and has committed to reducing the evasion rate. TfL spent nearly £14.2 million on Tube fare dodging enforcement in 2023-24, part of a broader effort to tackle the issue across its network.</p>

          <p>The Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland is celebrating a remarkable milestone: 230 years of uninterrupted, handwritten weather observations. This tradition makes it the longest continuous weather data sequence in the UK and Ireland, providing an invaluable record of climate history since July 14, 1795. Despite the prevalence of automated stations, a human observer continues to manually record daily readings, a practice maintained through generations. The records have chronicled major weather events, like the 'Night of the Big Wind' in 1839, and have contributed to the science of meteorology, including the development of the cup anemometer.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, known for his "illiberal democracy" and admired by some global conservative figures, is facing a significant political challenge at home. While his playbook of targeting liberal values has been effective for years, a new challenger from the center-right, Peter Magyar, is gaining traction by focusing on domestic issues like the poor state of hospitals and schools. This shift comes after a scandal weakened Orban's standing on family values. Although Orban's influence is strong abroad, polls suggest his party, Fidesz, is losing ground to Magyar's Tisza party ahead of the 2026 election.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee report has identified a "cascade of preventable failures" by the U.S. Secret Service leading up to the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. The report, released by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, highlights poor communication as a primary issue, noting that a warning about a suspicious person was not relayed effectively. It also found organizational mistakes, such as an obstructed view for a countersniper team, and alleged that the agency's former director provided false testimony to Congress.
