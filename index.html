          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily paused a lower court's decision that had blocked President Trump's tariffs, allowing them to remain in effect for now. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted the stay and scheduled an expedited review of the case, which challenges Trump's authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The Liberty Justice Center, representing the businesses challenging the tariffs, expressed disappointment but welcomed the accelerated review. The White House defended the administration's use of executive powers to address trade deficits and drug trafficking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States Men's National Team (USMNT) experienced a significant setback, losing 4-0 to Switzerland in a friendly match, with all goals conceded in the first half. The loss marks the fourth consecutive defeat for the USMNT, a streak not seen since 2007, and raises concerns about their readiness for the upcoming World Cup. The match, played a year before the 2026 World Cup co-hosted by the US, saw Switzerland dominate, extending the US winless streak against European opponents to eight games since 2021. The team was missing several key players due to various reasons, contributing to their poor performance on the field, but the team will need to regroup and address their deficiencies before the World Cup.</p>

The move aims to honor military history while avoiding formal recognition of Confederate leaders. Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscoll will oversee the renaming of seven bases to reflect this change.

The ruling has divided Argentines, with Kirchner denouncing it as politically motivated and accusing the judges of restricting the popular vote.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has accused President Trump of intentionally escalating the Los Angeles protests and endangering peaceful protesters by deploying federal troops. Newsom stated that the Trump administration's actions are traumatizing communities and undermining local law enforcement efforts. He criticized Trump's deployment of the National Guard as an illegal abuse of power that inflamed the situation. Newsom has also filed a request for a restraining order against the Department of Defense's actions and compared the Trump administration to an authoritarian regime.</p>

Chris Newman, representing Abrego Garcia's family, stated that the case should not be viewed solely as a referendum on immigration but as a core constitutional matter. Abrego Garcia faces charges of human smuggling, which his family and attorneys strongly deny. Newman accuses the Trump administration of defying court orders and disparaging Abrego Garcia, while the administration maintains it has complied with court orders.</p>
