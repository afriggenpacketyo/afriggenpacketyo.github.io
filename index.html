        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southwest Airlines is ending its long-standing "bags fly free" policy by implementing a $35 fee for the first checked bag and $45 for the second, effective for flights booked on or after May 28th. Certain customers, including Business Select/Choice Extra and A-List Preferred members, will receive two free checked bags, while A-List and Chase Rapid Reward credit card members will get one free bag. The airline is also changing its flight credit policy, with credits issued on or after May 28th expiring in six months to a year, depending on the fare type, ending the previous policy of never-expiring credits. This decision was announced in March following pressure from activist investors to improve financial performance, and the airline's stock price increased by 2.1% in pre-trading.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that the Colorado River basin has lost 27.8 million acre-feet of groundwater in the last 20 years, nearly equivalent to the full capacity of Lake Mead. NASA satellite imagery indicates that groundwater is disappearing 2.4 times faster than surface water, raising concerns about food production and the support of data centers vital to the U.S. economy. The basin provides water to 40 million people across seven states, with most groundwater losses occurring in Arizona, Nevada, and California. The study highlights the need for better groundwater management, particularly in Arizona, where usage remains largely unregulated, and the depletion rate has accelerated since 2015 due to expanding agriculture.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump is reportedly planning to pardon Todd and Julie Chrisley, stars of the reality TV show "Chrisley Knows Best," who were convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud in 2022. The White House announced Trump's intention to pardon the couple, who gained fame for showcasing their luxurious lifestyle on their USA Network series. Savannah Chrisley, their daughter, shared news of the pardon on Instagram, expressing gratitude to Trump for his administration's support, while claiming her family was persecuted by rogue prosecutors due to their public profile and conservative beliefs. The Chrisleys were convicted on charges stemming from a scheme to submit fake financial statements to obtain millions of dollars in loans.</p>

Duplessie is the business partner of John Woeltz, who was arrested earlier, and the alleged victim reported the attack after escaping the SoHo home where he was held.

City and state officials have cited multiple security lapses, including a maintenance worker allegedly disabling the toilet water supply under duress.

          <p>Tesco's introduction of AI technology at self-checkouts, which uses overhead cameras to identify unscanned items and replays the attempt, has sparked mockery and complaints from shoppers. The technology aims to reduce shoplifting, which hit a record high in the UK in 2024, by showing customers a video of their attempt if an item fails to scan properly. While some customers joked about the tech resembling Video Assistant Referee (VAR) from football, others expressed concerns about increased surveillance and vowed to avoid self-checkouts altogether. Sainsbury's has also rolled out similar AI recognition technology at some of its stores to improve the checkout experience.</p>

While Trump issued pardons to most individuals convicted for the riot during his second term, some Proud Boys and Oath Keepers members received commutations, allowing them to leave prison but leaving their criminal convictions intact. The pardon process involves consulting with Alice Johnson, Trump's "pardon czar," and it is uncertain whether the pardons will be granted.</p>

U.S. nationals are cautioned that even being near the Venezuelan border can lead to detention, as happened to a dual American and French citizen windsurfing in Colombia.

Ambila was moved to a Massachusetts jail before the judge issued the emergency ruling, preventing his deportation. The ACLU filed a habeas corpus petition on Ambila's behalf, arguing that ICE had held him illegally without providing information about their plans. The judge cited the lack of evidence that the Democratic Republic of Congo would accept Ambila, as previous attempts to deport him have failed since 2007.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem publicly endorsed Karol Nawrocki for president of Poland at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Warsaw, criticizing his opponent as a "train wreck." Noem also attacked "weak" European leaders for allowing in migrants and "destroyed their civilizations," while praising Poland for enforcing its borders. She urged the Polish people to elect Nawrocki to ensure continued U.S. support and strong borders, while claiming America "lived through four years of hell" under the previous administration. The Polish runoff election is scheduled for June 1, with Nawrocki facing Rafal Trzaskowski.</p>

The payouts apply to customers at eight suppliers, and investigations are continuing for British Gas, Utilita and Ovo, representing tens of thousands more customers.</p>

          <p>U.S. companies are reporting a surge in trade crime, such as undervaluation, misclassification, and transshipment, as President Trump's tariffs incentivize fraud. Shipping companies, particularly those based in China, are offering ways to avoid tariffs, leading to billions of dollars in lost tariff revenue and frustration among honest companies. The Trump administration plans to combat trade fraud and is urging other countries to increase enforcement, but many American companies believe the scale of illicit activity far outweighs these efforts. The U.S. government charges tariffs based on the item, its declared dollar value, and its country of origin, with schemes existing to evade tariffs by altering these factors.</p>

The divorce paperwork was filed in New York, and only a judge's signature is required to finalize the proceedings.

Jackman has since been linked with his "Music Man" co-star Sutton Foster, and the pair's last public appearance together was at the Wimbledon men's final in July 2023.</p>

          <p>Homelessness among elderly Americans has surged to a record high, driven by the loss of parental aid for late baby boomers facing economic vulnerability. This generation has experienced uniquely high rates of homelessness due to fierce competition for housing and jobs, recessions, and the decline of low-skilled work. As parents in their 80s and beyond pass away, many adult children are left without a safety net, resulting in a growing number of older individuals on the streets. The article highlights the story of Anthony Forrest, a 70-year-old who became homeless after his mother's move to a nursing home, and examines the structural forces contributing to this trend.</p>

This shift has intensified following Russiaâ€™s aggressive attacks, with bipartisan support growing for legislation imposing sweeping sanctions on Moscow. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, is leading the push for the sanctions bill, emphasizing that Putin is not serious about peace. While Trump has hinted at a change in posture and accused Putin of "playing with fire," his broader desire to move beyond the war contrasts with the views of many Republicans in Congress.</p>
