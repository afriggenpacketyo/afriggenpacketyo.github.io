          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis followed reports of increasing urinary symptoms and the discovery of a nodule during a routine physical exam. While the cancer is aggressive, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians, amidst scrutiny over his health since before he left the presidential race in 2024.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is underway for seven inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail by fleeing through a hole behind a toilet, with at least a dozen law enforcement agencies involved in the search. Three jail staff members have been suspended without pay pending an internal investigation, and the reward for information leading to the capture of inmates still at large has been increased. The inmates, ranging from 19 to 42 years old, face various charges including aggravated assault, domestic abuse battery, and murder. Authorities believe the inmates were able to get out of the Orleans Justice Center because of defective locks and possible outside help.</p>

          <p>Israel has announced it will allow a "basic amount of food" to enter Gaza after a 10-week blockade, citing the need to prevent a famine crisis as it expands its military operations against Hamas. This decision comes as the Israeli military begins "extensive ground operations" throughout Gaza, with strikes hitting various locations, including a hospital in northern Gaza. Negotiators from Israel and Hamas are continuing ceasefire discussions in Qatar, but a senior Hamas source reports no significant progress due to Israeli intransigence. The conflict has resulted in numerous casualties and warnings from aid agencies about the risk of famine among Gaza's population.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is evaluating Trump v CASA, a case that could redefine American citizenship based on the 14th Amendment. The central question is whether the amendment's citizenship clause applies to children of undocumented immigrants and temporary visa-holders. This case challenges the long-standing interpretation that birthright citizenship extends to almost everyone born on American soil. The court's decision could reshape the limits of judicial power and redefine who qualifies as an American citizen.</p>
