            <p>The Trump administration announced new fees on Chinese-built vessels docking at U.S. ports, responding to a U.S. Trade Representative investigation that found China's shipbuilding industry had an unfair advantage. The fees, which will be charged based on net tonnage and container capacity, aim to reverse Chinese dominance in the shipping sector and incentivize the use of U.S.-built ships. Initially set at zero for the first 180 days, the fees will increase incrementally over the next few years. Vessel owners can receive fee remissions by providing proof of a U.S. shipbuilding order, but restrictions on LNG vessels will increase incrementally over 22 years.</p>

            <p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro gave an exclusive interview to ABC News' George Stephanopoulos from his fire-damaged residence following an arson attack. The attack, which occurred early Sunday, involved Molotov cocktails thrown by a suspect later identified as Cody Balmer, who allegedly targeted the residence due to perceived injustices to the Palestinian people. Shapiro and his family were safely evacuated, and the governor condemned the rise of politically motivated threats and attacks.

Eli Lilly plans to seek FDA approval for orforglipron as a Type 2 diabetes treatment in 2026 and for weight management by the end of this year, confident in its ability to meet global supply demands.</p>

            <p>Fire services in England are facing a significant funding shortfall after the government allocated them 50% less than police forces to cover increases in employer's National Insurance contributions. While police forces received an extra £230m to fully cover the costs, fire services will only receive top-up funds covering half of the increase, which equates to the cost of a fully-staffed fire engine for some services. The National Fire Chiefs Council estimates a £20m shortfall across fire services, urging the government to treat them equally with the police in funding.</p>

            <p>A pilot project called SeaCURE has begun operating on England's south coast to explore the feasibility of removing carbon from seawater as a means to combat climate change. The project, funded by the UK government, aims to test whether it is more efficient to extract carbon from the sea, where it is present in greater concentrations than in the air. SeaCURE processes seawater to remove carbon, which is then concentrated and stored, before pumping the low-carbon water back into the sea to absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere. While still in its early stages, the project aims to explore the potential for large-scale carbon removal from the world's oceans.</p>

            <p>E-commerce giants Temu and Shein are planning to raise prices for US customers due to the impact of President Trump's tariffs on goods shipped from China. The companies cited "recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs" as the reason for the price adjustments, which will begin on April 25. The increased tariffs and the end of a customs exemption have affected the business models of these ultra-low-price retailers.</p>
