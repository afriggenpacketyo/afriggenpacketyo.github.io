          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 16:55:02 EDT</div>

          <p>Google is collaborating with marine researchers to develop an AI model, DolphinGemma, designed to analyze dolphin vocalizations and potentially decode their communication. Leveraging 40 years of dolphin sound recordings, the AI aims to identify patterns and structures within dolphin communications, essentially creating a dolphin 'vocabulary.' This initiative uses Google's Pixel phone technology for high-quality audio recordings, filtering out background noise to improve data clarity. The ultimate goal is to establish a shared vocabulary for interactive communication with dolphins, enhancing our understanding of these intelligent marine mammals. The open-source model will be released this summer for global research use.</p>

          <p>Liverpool clinched the Premier League title, marking their 20th overall title and equaling Manchester United's record, after defeating Tottenham Hotspur. The victory ends a 35-year wait for a title celebration at Anfield, a moment amplified by the presence of fans in the stadium, unlike their 2020 win during the pandemic. New head coach Arne Slot, succeeding Jurgen Klopp, was central to the win. Captain Virgil van Dijk expressed that no one thought they would be Premier League champions, and that Slot deserves credit for the victory.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion and fire at the Shaid Rajaei port in southern Iran, reportedly involving a shipment of missile propellant ingredients, resulted in at least 40 deaths and approximately 1,000 injuries. The incident occurred amidst ongoing nuclear program negotiations between Iran and the United States in Oman. While Iranian officials haven't directly attributed the explosion to an attack, heightened security concerns have been acknowledged. Initial reports suggest the fire was caused by improper handling of solid missile fuel, though this has been denied by Iran's defense ministry.</p>

A reunion would see Ramsey rejoin a revitalized defensive front and be overseen by Aubrey Pleasant, who coached Ramsey during his initial stint with the Rams.</p>

          <p>Sen. Jeanne Shaheen has accused Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth of creating chaos at the Pentagon, citing staffing shakeups and the sharing of sensitive information over Signal. Shaheen argued that Hegseth was unqualified for the role and has not taken responsibility for his actions. She pointed to the Signal leak, in which Hegseth shared details about airstrikes in Yemen. A Defense Department spokesperson responded by criticizing the previous administration and praising Hegseth for bringing accountability back to the Pentagon.</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, survivors and families gathered to commemorate the horrors of the concentration camp. British and Canadian troops liberated the camp in April 1945, discovering thousands of unburied corpses and emaciated survivors. Survivors recounted the extreme suffering, disease, and death that permeated the camp. The event served as a reminder of the atrocities committed during the Holocaust.</p>
