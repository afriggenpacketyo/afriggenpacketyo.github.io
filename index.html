          <p>Baroness Anne Longfield, the former children's commissioner for England, has testified at the UK Covid Inquiry that the government should formally apologize to children for its "avoidable mistakes" during the pandemic. She argued that adults were consistently prioritized over children, citing the chaotic closure of schools while pubs and shops reopened. The inquiry also heard about the "systemic shock" to children's mental health, with a significant increase in mental health conditions and eating disorders observed during the period.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues, the Trump administration has indicated that mass firings of federal workers are a "very real" possibility, with thousands of layoffs expected. President Trump stated he would meet with OMB Director Russ Vought to identify "Democrat Agencies" for potential cuts, framing the shutdown as an "unprecedented opportunity." Meanwhile, the OMB reportedly encouraged furloughed employees to use out-of-office messages blaming "Democrat Senators" for the shutdown, raising concerns about potential Hatch Act violations.</p>

          <p>Nearly one million foreign residents in Taiwan, including a large contingent of migrant workers from countries like the Philippines, are living with the constant threat of a potential military attack from mainland China. Many of these workers feel they have no choice but to remain, as the economic opportunities in Taiwan far exceed what is available in their home countries, despite the geopolitical risks. Their situation is compounded by existing vulnerabilities, as they often face second-class treatment under Taiwanese labor laws and are susceptible to abuse.</p>

          <p>Disney's public perception has fallen to multi-year lows following its handling of a controversy involving late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, according to analysis from investment bank Jefferies. The company's decision to temporarily pull Kimmel's show after his comments about a conservative activist, and then reinstate it, alienated both Democrats and Republicans. This public relations issue was compounded by a recent price hike for the Disney+ streaming service, contributing to a significant decline in brand sentiment across the political spectrum.</p>

This acquisition is Berkshire's largest since 2022 and comes as the conglomerate holds a near-record cash reserve of $344 billion. Occidental Petroleum, in which Berkshire already holds a significant stake, plans to use a majority of the proceeds to pay down its debt, a move its CEO says will unlock shareholder value and allow the company to resume its stock buyback program.</p>

          <h2>Investment Analysis Explains Why High-Priced Stocks Can Offer Significant Upside</h2>

          <p>This article challenges the common misconception, known as "low-price bias," that stocks with lower share prices have greater potential for growth than more expensive ones. It argues that a stock's nominal price is not an indicator of its value and that investment decisions should be based on fundamental analysis of a company's growth outlook. Using the example of Nvidia versus International Paper, it demonstrates how a focus on valuation and future earnings potential, rather than share price, is a more effective strategy for identifying high-growth opportunities.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the S&P 500 index reaching new all-time highs, some financial experts are advising investors to reconsider the popular "set-it-and-forget-it" strategy. They warn that the market capitalization-weighted index has become heavily concentrated in a few large technology companies, reducing its diversification benefits and increasing volatility risk. Advisors suggest investors could better diversify by considering total market index funds, which include small- and mid-cap stocks, or by adding allocations to international stocks and bonds to create a more balanced portfolio.

Essential civilian Defense Department personnel will also continue to work without immediate pay, while non-essential civilians are furloughed, impacting the military's operational readiness and financial stability of service members' families.</p>

          <p>Beyond her groundbreaking primatology research, Jane Goodall's most radical legacy may be her unwavering advocacy for animal rights, a stance rare among scientists of her stature. Her work led her to oppose factory farming and invasive animal experimentation, putting her at odds with scientific orthodoxy but making her a beloved figure in the animal rights movement. Goodall used her global platform to argue that humanity's exploitation of animals lacks a moral basis, pushing for a re-evaluation of both the ethics and scientific value of animal testing.</p>
