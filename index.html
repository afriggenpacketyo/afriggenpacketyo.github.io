          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, fulfilling weeks of predictions. Ward is the third consecutive quarterback to be drafted first overall, highlighting the position's importance in the league. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded with the Cleveland Browns to select Travis Hunter from Colorado as the second pick, making Hunter the first two-way player since the 1990s. The draft, held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, is considered less talent-laden than previous years, leading to unpredictable forecasts for later rounds.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked with cutting bureaucratic fat, now estimates savings of only $150 billion, far short of initial projections. Errors in DOGE's savings claims are well-documented, while costs incurred through firings, agency lockouts, and legal battles are substantial. The Partnership for Public Service estimates firings, re-hirings, and lost productivity will cost $135 billion this fiscal year. The IRS could lose $8.5 billion in revenue in 2026 due to a DOGE-driven exodus of employees.</p>

          <p>The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up with the Cleveland Browns to select Travis Hunter, the Heisman Trophy winner, as the second overall pick in the NFL Draft. Hunter, a two-way player who excels as both a wide receiver and cornerback, is expected to contribute on both sides of the ball. Some analysts suggest Hunter should prioritize cornerback, but Hunter insists on playing both positions. Ed McCaffrey believes Hunter provides greater value at cornerback, while Hunter has said he would "never play football again" if he was told by coaches to only focus on playing either cornerback or wide receiver.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's administration faced a series of legal setbacks in federal courts across the country, challenging the implementation of his agenda. Judges blocked the government from withholding funds to schools with DEI programs and sanctuary jurisdictions. A judge also barred the government from requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration, citing congressional authority. The DOJ accidentally revealed shortcomings in its congestion pricing plan in New York, and a hearing is set on the legality of dismantling the Department of Education.</p>

          <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that the Kremlin is "ready to reach a deal" with the U.S. on Ukraine, while acknowledging that some elements require further refinement. This announcement followed a deadly Russian strike on Kyiv, which killed at least eight people and injured over 70. President Trump issued a rare rebuke of Putin, calling for an end to the strikes, but also criticized Zelenskyy for prolonging the conflict. The U.S. has proposed a freeze of military conflict along existing lines, but European partners are concerned about the pressure on Ukraine.</p>

Crimo was absent during the sentencing hearing, and his attorneys did not present any mitigating factors.

          <p>The Trump administration, via the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is dismantling the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), a foreign aid agency started during the George W. Bush administration. DOGE has directed major cuts to MCC's staff and the termination of all existing grants, potentially reducing the workforce from 320 to a few dozen. The MCC, which invests in private sector initiatives to reduce poverty, has garnered bipartisan support and is ranked as one of the most transparent development organizations. Critics argue that cutting MCC would harm both recipient countries and U.S. influence.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued a memorandum directing the attorney general to investigate allegations of foreign contributions to U.S. political candidates through online fundraising platforms, specifically targeting ActBlue. ActBlue's CEO responded by affirming the organization's commitment to enabling American participation in democracy. Republicans have previously called for investigations into ActBlue, alleging connections to terror-linked organizations. Democrats have denounced the memo as an attempt to undermine democratic participation and block grassroots donations.</p>

          <p>A massive Russian strike on Kyiv killed at least 12 people and injured dozens, marking the deadliest assault on the Ukrainian capital in months. The attack occurred as peace talks appeared to stall, with President Trump criticizing Zelenskyy for refusing to surrender Crimea. Zelenskyy stated that the future of negotiations depends on Russia's intentions. The EU's foreign policy chief condemned the attack, while senior U.S. officials warned that the Trump administration could abandon its efforts if the sides don't compromise.</p>

Declining Chinese freight vessel bookings and sailings to the U.S. indicate an approaching tipping point, and the risk of retail shortages will depend on the duration of high tariff levels.
