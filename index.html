          <p>Temu and Shein are increasingly targeting Europe and the UK for growth as they encounter trade policy challenges in the U.S., including new tariffs. Both companies have increased ad spending and expanded operations in Europe, but they are facing regulatory headwinds similar to those in the U.S. The EU is considering a two-euro customs fee on small packages, which could significantly impact their business model. Experts suggest that stricter regulations on product safety and consumer protection in Europe will require Temu and Shein to invest more in compliance and transparency.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' ex-girlfriend, identified as "Jane Doe," testified in his federal trial, alleging instances of abuse and coercion during their relationship. Legal experts suggest her testimony could corroborate allegations made by Cassie Ventura, particularly if the jury finds their experiences similar. Texts between Diddy and Jane Doe revealed emotional manipulation and requests for monetary income, while Jane Doe also testified about witnessing Diddy assaulting Cassie Ventura in 2016. The trial is expected to conclude by July 4, with Diddy facing charges including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles in response to anti-immigration protests has been criticized as an authoritarian overreach. California Governor Gavin Newsom has accused Trump of intentionally causing chaos and endangering democracy by bypassing state authority. Legal experts like Philippe Sands warn that Trump's actions are part of a broader effort to test the limits of public tolerance and normalize the use of military force against citizens. The ACLU has condemned the troop deployment as akin to a declaration of war on California.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing increasing deflationary pressures, leading to changing consumer behavior and price wars across various sectors. Consumer prices fell 0.1% in May, with businesses targeting penny-pinchers and offering deep discounts. The second-hand luxury market has grown due to consumer price sensitivities, but this has also led to a spike in available items and larger discounts. Economists are concerned that these price wars are unsustainable and could lead to business closures and job losses, further fueling deflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Smugglers are exploiting loopholes in Europe's drug classification system to traffic ketamine, with some gangs earning more from ketamine than cocaine. Ketamine, a legal medicine in some countries, is transported across multiple borders before being diverted into the black market. One method involves swapping ketamine for salt during transit, while another involves setting up front companies to import ketamine under false pretenses. This illegal activity has led to increased ketamine consumption and related deaths in the UK.</p>

The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, addressing shortages and suspected hoarding by wholesalers and farmers.

          <p>President Trump has defended his decision to send National Guard troops to Los Angeles, claiming the city was under siege, while Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom maintain the situation is manageable with local resources. Trump has described Los Angeles as being "invaded" by illegal aliens and criminals, prompting accusations from Newsom that he is intentionally inflaming tensions. The protests, triggered by immigration raids, have been largely concentrated in downtown Los Angeles, with the rest of the city operating normally.</p>

          <p>More than 300 Foreign Office staff who raised concerns about the UK's potential complicity in Israel's conduct in Gaza were told they could consider resigning if they profoundly disagreed with government policy. The staff had questioned the UK's continued arms sales and what they termed a disregard for international law. Senior civil servants responded that while they welcomed healthy challenge, resignation was an 'honourable course' for those with profound disagreements. This response has been met with frustration and disappointment, with some officials feeling the space for dissent is being further restricted.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has issued a warning about an 'unprecedented decline' in world fertility rates, citing the prohibitive cost of parenthood and lack of suitable partners as key factors. A survey of 14,000 people in 14 countries revealed that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. Financial limitations were cited by 39% of people as a reason for not having more children, while infertility was cited by 12%. This marks a shift in focus for the UN, which has historically emphasized issues related to women having more children than desired.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have plummeted, with a massive reduction in fatal overdoses among Gen Z. Data from the CDC shows a 47% reduction in overdose risk for those aged 20-29. This shift is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl, more addiction healthcare, and less risky drug use among teens. While the trend is promising, experts caution that many still struggle with addiction and that cuts in funding for addiction services could reverse the progress.</p>
