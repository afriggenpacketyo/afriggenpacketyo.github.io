            <p>Despite escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday, marking a strong end to a turbulent week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all experienced significant gains, with the S&P 500 posting its best weekly performance since November 2023. However, economists caution that the ongoing trade war could negatively impact the nation's growth, as China retaliated with increased tariffs on U.S. goods. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, warned that the U.S. economy is nearing or already in a recession. (not investment advice)</p>

Khalil, a vocal participant in protests at Columbia University over the war in Gaza, was arrested by ICE in early March.
