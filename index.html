          <p>Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil giant, Aramco, announced a 5% decrease in net profit for the first quarter of 2025, primarily attributed to lower crude oil prices and reduced production. Despite the drop, net income reached $26 billion, surpassing analyst expectations. The company's free cash flow also decreased to $19.2 billion from $22.8 billion in the same period last year, reflecting the impact of market fluctuations on the world's largest oil producer.

          <p>The newly elected German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's cabinet is under scrutiny for potential conflicts of interest due to the appointment of several ministers directly from the business world. Critics are raising concerns about lobbying and the influence of corporate interests on government decisions. While experts acknowledge the value of expertise from the private sector, they emphasize the need for strict regulations to prevent conflicts of interest, as Germany currently lacks effective rules in this area.

          <p>President Vladimir Putin has called for direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine to take place in Turkey on May 15, without preconditions, while brushing aside calls for a 30-day cease-fire from European leaders. The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland, during a joint visit to Kyiv, stated that Russia would face ‚Äúnew and massive‚Äù sanctions if Putin does not agree to the cease-fire. The United States, through President Trump, has signaled support for the European proposal, but the competing proposals from Kyiv and Moscow highlight ongoing efforts to position themselves as seeking peace amid continued conflict.</p>

          <p>Significant cuts to USAID funding are having a severe impact on healthcare programs in Africa, particularly in the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The reduction in US aid is leading to medication shortages, clinic closures, and canceled programs, potentially resulting in hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths. While some African countries are stepping up with domestic funding, experts fear the cuts could undo years of progress in disease prevention and treatment.
