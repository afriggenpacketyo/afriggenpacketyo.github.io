          <p>Five days of severe rainfall in South Korea have led to a significant natural disaster, causing at least 14 fatalities and leaving 12 individuals missing. The government reported that the deaths resulted from landslides, house collapses, and flash floods, particularly in the southern town of Sancheong and the Gapyeong area northeast of Seoul. While the rain has subsided and alerts have been lifted, approximately 3,840 people remain evacuated from their homes. Southern regions received up to 800 millimeters of rain, highlighting the extreme nature of the weather event.</p>

          <p>A new mural honoring the late Dodgers pitcher Fernando Valenzuela was unveiled at Dodger Stadium, celebrating his legacy and impact on the Latino community. Painted by artist Robert Vargas, the artwork depicts Valenzuela in his iconic pitching motion and is intended to symbolize unity. Valenzuela, who played for the Dodgers from 1980 to 1990, became a cultural icon, sparking "Fernandomania" and inspiring a generation of Latino fans. The tribute has been met with emotional reactions from fans who see him as a symbol of hope and representation.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, announced a significant development in the aftermath of the deadly July 4th floods, with the number of missing persons dropping from nearly 100 to just three. This reduction is attributed to extensive search and rescue operations and investigative work that successfully accounted for previously missing individuals. The flash floods along the Guadalupe River claimed at least 135 lives in Texas, with most fatalities occurring in Kerr County. The event has drawn scrutiny over the adequacy of local warning systems in a region known as "flash flood alley."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense demonstrated signs of improvement but was ultimately not enough to overcome pitching struggles in an 8-7 defeat to the Milwaukee Brewers. Despite a four-run third inning and late home runs from Tommy Edman and Miguel Rojas, the Dodgers could not secure a win, marking their ninth loss in the last 11 games. Starter Emmet Sheehan had a difficult outing, and the bullpen allowed three crucial late runs. The loss highlights the team's ongoing challenge to synchronize its offensive and pitching performances consistently.</p>

These stations often serve as the primary source of daily local information, from public service announcements to obituaries, in areas with limited internet and cell service.

          <p>An opinion article posits that the pursuit of peace in conflicts like those in Gaza and Ukraine is failing due to a fractured global moral order, not just political roadblocks. The author contends that a rise in moral relativism has eroded universally accepted standards, making it difficult to condemn atrocities and mediate disputes effectively. The piece notes a record number of state-based conflicts and the routine targeting of civilians, questioning why such violence is allowed to persist. It suggests this modern failure to uphold shared ethical standards, defined by international law and social contracts, is a reversible but significant obstacle to achieving lasting peace.</p>
