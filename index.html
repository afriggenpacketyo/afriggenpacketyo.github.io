          <p>Two Chinese nationals, Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu, have been charged by the Justice Department for allegedly smuggling a fungus, Fusarium graminearum, into the United States, which is classified as a potential agroterrorism weapon. The pair allegedly received Chinese government funding for their research, some of which took place at the University of Michigan. Liu initially lied to authorities about the materials, which were discovered at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. The FBI has identified the fungus as the cause of "head blight," a disease affecting wheat, barley, maize, and rice, resulting in billions of dollars in economic losses annually. The authorities believe that the pair intended to use a University of Michigan laboratory to further their scheme.</p>

          <p>The family of Mohamed Soliman, the suspect charged in connection with the Boulder, Colorado attack on demonstrators, has been taken into custody by ICE. Soliman, an Egyptian national, faces multiple counts of attempted murder and a federal hate crimes charge after allegedly attacking a march supporting Israeli hostages. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that authorities are investigating the extent to which Soliman's family was aware of or supported the attack. Soliman, who arrived in the U.S. in 2022 on an expired visa and filed for asylum, is accused of using Molotov cocktails and a makeshift flamethrower, injuring 12 people. The family is now being processed for expedited removal, which allows the government to deport migrants in the U.S. illegally without a court hearing.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has denounced President Donald Trump's tax-and-spending-cut bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" on his social media platform, X. Musk argues that the bill will drastically increase the federal budget deficit to $2.5 trillion, burdening American citizens with unsustainable debt. The White House dismissed Musk's criticism, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt affirming the president's support for the bill. Despite the White House's stance, some Republican lawmakers, like Rep. Thomas Massie and Sen. Mike Lee, have echoed Musk's concerns about the bill's impact on the national debt, pointing out that Congress has hollowed out America's middle class through reckless deficit spending and the inflation it causes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy is reportedly considering renaming several naval ships, including the USNS Harvey Milk, a fleet replenishment oiler named after the gay rights leader and Navy veteran. Documents obtained by CBS News indicate that the renaming is part of an effort to realign the U.S. military with the Trump administration's priorities of "reestablishing the warrior culture." Other vessels under consideration for renaming include the USNS Thurgood Marshall, USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and USNS Harriet Tubman. The potential renaming has drawn criticism, with Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi calling it a "shameful, vindictive erasure" of those who fought to break down barriers.</p>

          <p>Antonio McDowell, 49, has been exonerated after spending 28 years in prison for a wrongful conviction linked to former Chicago Police Detective Reynaldo Guevara. McDowell was sentenced to 103 years in prison after Guevara allegedly framed him for murder. McDowell walked into CPD headquarters in 1997 after being shot, but was then framed as the perpetrator in an unrelated murder after refusing to falsely identify Guevara's chosen suspect. McDowell is the 51st person to be exonerated in a case investigated by Guevara, and he was granted clemency in 2020. In 2023, DNA evidence excluded McDowell as the source of DNA found on the murder victim's clothes, leading to the dismissal of the murder charges and, subsequently, the carjacking conviction.</p>

In 2024, this new strain caused an unusually early start to the norovirus season, beginning in October instead of the usual December. Researchers are unsure if GII.17 will continue to dominate and cause earlier onsets of the norovirus season.

          <p>A U.S. judge dismissed California's challenge to Donald Trump's tariffs, ruling that the dispute should have been filed in a specialized trade court in New York. California plans to appeal the decision. The lawsuit challenges Trump's tariffs on imports from most U.S. trading partners and a separate set of tariffs levied on China, Mexico, and Canada. California argues that Trump does not have the authority to impose these tariffs and that the case raises constitutional objections to his use of tariff powers.</p>
