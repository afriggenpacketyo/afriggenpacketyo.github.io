          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rejected new talks with the U.S., signaling a commitment to the nation's nuclear program as a show of strength. However, this strategy presents a dilemma, as Tehran must balance projecting power with avoiding a direct military conflict with the United States or Israel, especially as its regional proxies have been weakened. Despite the confrontational rhetoric, experts suggest that indirect communication channels with the West remain open, indicating a complex crisis management approach aimed at buying time while navigating severe international pressure.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim suggesting that Germany has canceled its Christmas markets for 2025 has been fact-checked and proven false. The narrative originated from a single, questionable source and lacks official confirmation. While a few small, local markets have been canceled for isolated reasons like renovations or low vendor turnout, the vast majority of Germany's over 2,500 iconic markets are scheduled to open as planned. The article clarifies that rising security costs are a concern for organizers but have not led to widespread closures.</p>

This article explores the symptoms of SAD and highlights a proactive initiative in Scotland's Orkney islands, where residents are offered "Wintering Well" boxes containing therapeutic lamps and activity guides. The project aims to help people develop positive light routines and adopt a more positive psychological mindset toward the winter months, drawing inspiration from Scandinavian cultures.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre's posthumously released memoir, "Nobody's Girl," details her experience of being sexually exploited by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. The book recounts a brutal sexual assault by an unnamed former prime minister and describes non-criminal encounters with powerful figures like former President Bill Clinton and President Donald Trump, whom she met while working at Mar-a-Lago. The memoir provides a harrowing first-person account of the abuse she endured and sheds further light on the high-profile social circles in which her abusers operated.</p>

          <p>The process of counting votes is now underway in the Republic of Ireland to determine the country's 10th president, who will succeed the incumbent, Michael D Higgins. The primary contenders for the office are independent politician Catherine Connolly, who is backed by several left-wing parties, and Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys. A third candidate's name remains on the ballot paper despite his withdrawal from the race. Early indications suggest that voter turnout for this election might struggle to surpass the record low set in 2018.</p>

          <p>The Jeffrey Epstein scandal remains a significant political issue for President Donald Trump, stemming from his well-documented friendship with Epstein in the 1990s. There are bipartisan calls in Congress for the Department of Justice to release all unclassified records related to the investigation, known as the "Epstein files." The recent posthumous publication of survivor Virginia Giuffre's memoir has intensified public scrutiny, though the article notes that many of Trump's supporters appear to apply a different standard to him compared to other political figures implicated in the scandal.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of provoking a conflict by deploying the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, to the Caribbean. The U.S. government states the military buildup is part of an enhanced counter-narcotics operation in the region. However, the move has intensified fears within Venezuela that Washington's true intention is to facilitate regime change, given that the U.S. does not recognize Maduro's legitimacy as president.

          <p>A new report is examining the corporate donors who are privately financing the controversial $300 million White House ballroom project, which involves the demolition of the East Wing. The list of funders includes major players from the tech, defense, and cryptocurrency sectors, such as Google, Lockheed Martin, and Coinbase. This has raised significant conflict-of-interest concerns, as many of these companies are concurrently lobbying the Trump administration for favorable regulatory decisions, government contracts, and policy outcomes, creating questions about the nature of their contributions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has entered its 25th day, with no apparent progress toward a resolution on Capitol Hill.

The House of Representatives has canceled votes for the fifth consecutive week, signaling that the legislative impasse and its impact on government functions and employees are likely to persist into the next month.</p>

          <p>In a significant development for the New York City mayoral race, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has officially endorsed Democratic assemblyman Zohran Mamdani. This endorsement provides a major boost to Mamdani, the current frontrunner, just as early voting is set to begin. Jeffries' support helps to consolidate the Democratic Party establishment behind the progressive candidate, who is competing against former Governor Andrew Cuomo. The move is seen as a key strategic moment in the high-profile municipal election.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Pew Research Center reveals that the Latino population in the United States has surged to 68 million, nearly doubling since the year 2000. Latinos now represent one in five Americans and accounted for over half of the nation's total population growth during this period. The demographic is also notably young, with a median age of 31, and increasingly composed of U.S.-born citizens. This rapid growth underscores the expanding cultural, economic, and political influence of the Latino community across the country.</p>
