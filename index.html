          <p>An attack by Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels on a Catholic church in Komanda, Democratic Republic of Congo, resulted in the deaths of at least 43 people, including nine children. The insurgent group, which has ties to the "Islamic State," also set fire to nearby houses and shops during the Sunday service. The UN peacekeeping mission condemned the targeting of civilians, and the Congolese army described it as a "large-scale massacre" intended to spread terror in the resource-rich but volatile eastern region of the country.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have brokered a framework deal, establishing a 15% US tariff on many European goods, a figure lower than the threatened 30% but higher than previous rates. The Trump administration is claiming a significant victory, as the agreement is expected to generate substantial tariff revenue and includes EU commitments to purchase US energy and arms. While Brussels avoided a worse outcome and secured zero tariffs for some sectors like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, the deal is seen by some as a major concession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following their dramatic Euro 2025 final victory against Spain, England's women's football team, the Lionesses, will be celebrated with a reception at Downing Street and a public parade in London. The team secured their title after a tense penalty shootout, prompting widespread praise. Despite calls to mark the historic win with a national day off, the government is not expected to announce a bank holiday, a decision consistent with previous major tournament victories and influenced by the potential economic cost.</p>

          <p>A growing number of students in China are choosing universities and majors based on immediate job prospects rather than institutional prestige, reflecting anxieties about the current job market. In this trend, fields like computer science have seen a surge in demand, fueled further by the rise of artificial intelligence and its perceived employment opportunities. This shift indicates that for many young people, securing stable employment has become a more critical consideration than long-term aspirations when making educational choices.</p>

According to the Financial Times, the Commerce Department's industry and security bureau has been instructed to refrain from imposing harsh measures on Beijing. This move, which follows Nvidia's plan to resume some advanced chip sales to China, has drawn criticism from some national security experts who fear it could compromise America's technological edge.

          <h2>Shenzhen Introduces Leniency Policy for Failed State-Funded Innovation Projects</h2>

          <p>To foster a culture of bold experimentation, authorities in the Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen have mandated leniency for researchers whose government-funded projects fail. The new rules state that if mistakes are made without misconduct or abuse of power, innovators should not be punished or have their future funding applications hindered. This policy applies to failures caused by unforeseen technical difficulties or market changes, aiming to encourage scientists and entrepreneurs to explore new frontiers without the fear of being penalized for unsuccessful outcomes.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 20:45:42 EDT</div>

          <p>Japan's normally stable political landscape has been disrupted by the surge of the far-right Sanseito party, which grew from one to fifteen seats in recent elections. The party's "Japanese First" slogan, influenced by Donald Trump's populism, has capitalized on public frustration with inflation, stagnant wages, and a sluggish economy. Analysts suggest the party's rise is also fueled by anti-immigrant and anti-tourist sentiment, as it blames foreigners for social and economic problems, resonating with a segment of voters who feel the ruling party has failed them.</p>

          <h2>OMB Director Downplays Project 2025's Fed Chapter, Says Trump Seeks Lower Interest Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 20:41:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House budget director Russell Vought, a key author of Project 2025, stated that President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve is driven by a desire for lower interest rates, not a plan to overhaul the institution as detailed in the conservative blueprint. When asked about the Project 2025 chapter on the Fed, Vought claimed, "I don't even know what that chapter says," distancing the administration's current focus from the document's broader proposals. The administration has recently criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell over both interest rate policy and the cost of a building renovation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>House Republicans Divided Over Push to Release Jeffrey Epstein Files</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 20:39:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A sharp division has emerged within the House Republican conference over a bipartisan effort to force a vote on releasing federal files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The measure's sponsors, Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, are criticizing Speaker Mike Johnson's leadership for blocking the vote, arguing that victims' identities are protected in their bill. Johnson has called the push "reckless," while Massie warns that failing to hold a vote could become a political liability for the GOP and potentially cost them their majority in the midterms.</p>
