          <p>China's defense industry is attempting to gain traction in the European fighter jet market, showcasing advanced military aircraft like the J-20, J-35A, and J-10CE at the Paris Air Show. Despite increasing military spending in Europe and growing friction with the U.S., China faces political skepticism that hinders its ability to secure major sales on the continent. Observers believe the United States will likely maintain its dominance in fighter jet sales in Europe, encouraging further local investment in the European aerospace industry. China's presence at the air show indicates its ambition to compete globally, but geopolitical factors present significant obstacles in the European market.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A regulation that took effect in 2021, focused on organ procurement organizations (OPOs), led to a significant increase in pancreata collected for research purposes. This surge is attributed to a rule that allowed pancreata used for research to count towards OPO recertification, creating a "pancreas loophole." While this has increased the number of pancreata available for research, critics argue that it incentivizes OPOs to prioritize research pancreata over those needed for transplants. Congress is now considering whether to modify the 2004 law that led to this unintended consequence, possibly by clarifying the status of islet cells for transplantation.</p>

          <p>Iran's threat to close the Strait of Hormuz after U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites carries significant risks, potentially alienating neighbors and trade partners, particularly China. Experts suggest that closing the strait, a vital oil transit route, could provoke regional hostilities and harm Iran's own oil exports. While the decision rests with Iran's national security council, analysts believe the possibility of closure remains minimal due to the potential for self-inflicted harm. The U.S. has called on China to intervene, highlighting the importance of maintaining stable oil flows through the strait.</p>

          <p>A new study in Nature Communications reveals that climate change is increasing the risk of sleep apnea, with the likelihood of sleep apnea problems rising by almost 50% when temperatures reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit or warmer. Severe cases of sleep apnea, where breathing stops more than 30 times per hour, also increase by 40%. The study analyzed sleep data from over 125,000 people across 41 countries, finding that as temperatures rise, sleep apnea worsens, particularly in northern countries with less access to air conditioning. These findings highlight the broader impact of climate change on human health, emphasizing the need to address rising temperatures to improve sleep quality.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police chief expressed shock and frustration over a planned protest in London supporting Palestine Action, an "organised extremist criminal group." The protest, supported by 35 groups, follows Palestine Action activists breaking into RAF Brize Norton and spraying military planes. While the Met cannot legally prevent the protest until the group is proscribed, conditions have been imposed to prevent disorder, damage, and serious disruption. Palestine Action confirmed the protest will take place in Trafalgar Square, outside the exclusion zone, arguing that the government is enacting crimes against humanity.</p>

          <p>The government's new 10-year industrial strategy includes measures to lower energy costs for thousands of businesses by exempting them from green energy levies. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to Â£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for over 7,000 manufacturing firms. The plan also aims to speed up connections to the energy grid, upskill Britons, attract global talent, and boost research and development spending. The strategy focuses on eight specific sectors, including advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and digital technologies, with the goal of creating over one million new jobs.</p>

          <p>A recent poll revealed that nearly two-thirds of Germans support a European nuclear deterrent independent of the United States, reflecting concerns over the unpredictability of President Donald Trump. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz intends to discuss a joint European nuclear strategy with the United Kingdom and France, aiming to reduce reliance on the U.S. nuclear umbrella. Support for a European deterrent was consistent across demographic and political lines, indicating a rare consensus on foreign policy in Germany. The poll was conducted before the latest escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict involving direct U.S. military action.</p>

The bill would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture, or sell consumable THC products, a move criticized for restricting access to goods that provide similar relief to marijuana. Critics argued that the ban would disproportionately affect those unable to access marijuana through the state's limited medical program. The veto allows the market to continue operating under existing regulations, which lack federal oversight but provide access to legal alternatives to marijuana.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar surged in early trading following U.S. military strikes on Iran, benefiting from its safe-haven status, but analysts warn that these gains may be temporary. Concerns over U.S. fiscal policy, trade wars, and weakening international demand for U.S. assets could regain focus once the immediate crisis-driven demand fades. While the dollar's immediate strength is tied to fears of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, analysts caution that Iran has asymmetric capabilities to raise the economic cost of the conflict. The U.S. Treasury market's muted reaction suggests that the situation is complex, with trade deficits and tariffs compounding fiscal concerns. (not investment advice)</p>
