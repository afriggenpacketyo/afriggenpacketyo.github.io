          <p>A CNBC investigation reveals the growing problem of AI-powered "nudify" applications, which allow users to create nonconsensual explicit images of people from their social media photos. The article focuses on a group of women in Minnesota who were targeted, highlighting their emotional trauma and the legal loopholes that prevent prosecution since the images were not distributed. This has spurred local legislative efforts to hold the creators of such services accountable, shedding light on the urgent need for laws to catch up with rapidly advancing AI technology.</p>

          <p>Self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi outlines three limiting money beliefs that prevent people from increasing their income. These include the false notion that one should already know how to manage money, the expectation that success should come easily if one is talented, and the tendency to procrastinate by telling oneself they will start later. Sethi argues that earning more is a skill that requires learning, patience, and immediate, consistent action rather than waiting for a perfect moment. Overcoming these mental blocks is the first crucial step toward achieving financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour party has committed to starting the construction of three new towns before the next general election as part of its plan to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced the initiative, identifying Tempsford, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill as the most promising initial sites for development. The plan emulates the post-war Labour government's strategy of creating new towns to address housing shortages. However, the proposal faces challenges, including industry warnings about rising costs and criticism from some local communities who feel uninformed about the project's scale.</p>

          <p>The master of ceremonies hired to entertain the crowd at the Ryder Cup has resigned and apologized after being recorded leading a profane chant targeting golfer Rory McIlroy. The incident occurred on the first tee at Bethpage, contributing to what was described as a toxic and ugly atmosphere where McIlroy faced repeated personal abuse from spectators. The hostility became so intense that state police were brought in to escort McIlroy's group, and several fans were ejected from the event. Despite the challenging environment, McIlroy won both of his matches that day.</p>

          <p>A popular trend on TikTok suggests that applying magnesium lotion to the bottoms of one's feet at bedtime can significantly improve sleep quality and balance hormone levels. However, health experts interviewed for the article express skepticism, noting there is limited scientific evidence to support these claims, especially regarding topical absorption through the thick skin of the feet. They suggest that any perceived benefits might be due to the placebo effect or the relaxing nature of a nightly foot massage routine. Experts recommend focusing on evidence-based sleep hygiene practices rather than unproven social media hacks.</p>

          <p>A proposed California ballot measure, Proposition 50, aims to redraw the state's congressional districts to create five new Democratic-leaning seats, potentially unseating Republican incumbent Doug LaMalfa. The proposal has ignited a fierce political battle in LaMalfa's conservative northern California district, with Democrats seeing it as a crucial move to counter gerrymandering in other states and impede a potential Trump agenda. Republicans, however, argue the measure is an unfair power grab by Sacramento Democrats that would dilute the representation of rural communities. The outcome of the November special election could have significant implications for control of the U.S. House.</p>

This progress is attributed to an accumulation of small but significant improvements in safety standards.

          <p>Following the Pentagon's decision to take an equity stake and provide a price floor for rare earth miner MP Materials, industry leaders believe the U.S. government must strike more deals to secure the nation's supply chain against Chinese dominance. The move signals a shift towards strategic capitalism to counter China's market manipulation of critical minerals like rare earths and lithium, which are vital for defense and technology. Other mining companies, including Energy Fuels and Lithium Americas, have seen their stocks surge on speculation that they could be the next targets for similar federal investment and support.

          <p>China is expecting a significant surge in travel during its upcoming eight-day "golden week" holiday, which authorities hope will provide a substantial boost to the country's consumer economy. Officials predict a total of 2.4 billion inter-regional journeys will be made, with the vast majority, around 1.87 billion, being road trips by car. The holiday period, which combines National Day and the Mid-Autumn Festival, is one of China's most important travel seasons. The peak travel day is expected to be Wednesday, with an estimated 340 million journeys anticipated, surpassing even this year's Lunar New Year traffic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is guaranteeing a £1.5 billion loan for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to help the carmaker and its supply chain weather a nearly month-long production shutdown caused by a cyber-attack. Production at JLR's UK facilities is not expected to resume until at least October 1st, raising concerns about the stability of smaller suppliers. A local MP and chair of a Commons committee suggested that further government assistance might be necessary to protect the thousands of jobs at risk. The incident has also been described as a "wake-up call" for UK businesses to bolster their cybersecurity defenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that jury nullification, the power of a jury to acquit a defendant despite evidence of guilt, may become a necessary tool for ordinary Americans to resist tyranny. The author suggests that as the Justice Department is increasingly used for political persecution, jurors have the right and duty to refuse to convict in cases where the law is being applied unjustly. Citing historical examples, the article frames nullification as a moral, neutral tool that can protect citizens from an overreaching executive. It is presented as a last line of defense for the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has rapidly intensified into a powerful Category 5 storm in the Atlantic Ocean, with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph. While there are no immediate watches or warnings for land, forecasters are urging residents of Bermuda to closely monitor its progress as it could bring hazardous conditions within a few days. The storm is expected to remain a major hurricane for several days. Swells generated by Humberto are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast starting Monday, even as the storm's center remains far offshore.</p>

          <p>A 17-year-old from Texas, Benjamin Elliott, is on trial for the murder of his twin sister, Meghan, whom he stabbed in the neck while she slept. The case is shrouded in mystery as there was no apparent motive and the twins were known to have a very close and loving relationship. Benjamin's defense argues that he committed the act unintentionally while sleepwalking, a condition with a documented history in his family. A sleep disorder expert who studied Benjamin supports this claim, but prosecutors remain skeptical, leaving a jury to decide the tragic case.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has offered strong backing for Argentine President Javier Milei's radical, Thatcher-inspired economic "shock therapy," with the U.S. Treasury indicating readiness to provide significant financial support to stave off a crisis. Milei's policies, including deep public spending cuts and privatization, have won praise from the IMF but have led to rising unemployment and a recession at home. The U.S. support is seen as a move to prop up an ideological ally and is consistent with a foreign policy that uses economic tools for political ends, possibly also motivated by a desire to counter China's growing influence in Latin America.

These comments come as the court prepares to begin a new term where it may consider overturning major decisions, including the 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.

          <p>An ancient wooden canoe, discovered by a Fort Myers resident during the cleanup after Hurricane Ian in 2022, has been preserved by Florida state archeologists. The 9-foot log boat is unique among the 450 ancient canoes found in the state because it is made of mahogany, suggesting it may have originated outside Florida, possibly in the Caribbean. Tool marks indicate it was crafted with iron tools, placing it in the historical period after European contact. While radiocarbon dating is ongoing, the discovery adds another fascinating piece to Florida's rich history as a global leader in ancient watercraft finds.</p>

The program is a key part of a broader effort to significantly reduce the federal workforce. Departing employees have described a climate of "fear and intimidation" and a loss of mission that prompted them to leave. This exodus, combined with potential large-scale firings if a government shutdown occurs, is expected to have vast consequences for the functioning of federal agencies.</p>

          <p>England's recent dominance in women's rugby, culminating in their World Cup victory, is the result of strategic decisions made nearly a decade ago. The establishment of a new, professionally supported domestic league in 2016 and the introduction of full-time central contracts for players in 2018 were pivotal. These investments, initially met with financial concerns, dramatically raised the standard of play and created significant depth in the national squad. This long-term planning and financial commitment, partly driven by sponsor interest in the women's game, transformed the Red Roses from a major force into the undisputed world leader.</p>
