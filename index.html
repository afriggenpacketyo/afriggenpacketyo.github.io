          <p>Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell was granted limited immunity to answer questions from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. Sources indicate the meetings, which Maxwell reportedly initiated, lasted for approximately nine hours over two days. This form of "proffer immunity" allowed her to speak freely without her statements being used against her, a common practice when prosecutors seek cooperation. Her lawyer stated that no promises were made in exchange for her testimony, though Maxwell would welcome any potential relief from her 20-year sentence.</p>

          <p>A dating advice app called Tea, which allows women to review and share information about men they have dated, has become the most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store. The app aims to provide a layer of security not found on traditional dating platforms by centralizing user experiences and offering background checks. While praised for prioritizing safety, it has also raised concerns about the potential for false information and user privacy. Recently, the company confirmed it suffered a data breach, exposing some user-uploaded information and messages.</p>

          <p>A New Orleans jail, already under scrutiny for a recent mass escape, has mistakenly released another detainee due to a clerical error. Officials stated that deputies failed to properly verify an inmate's identity while processing a bond, leading to the release of Khalil Bryan, who was held on serious charges. The sheriff's office has taken full responsibility, attributing the incident to human error involving two inmates with a shared last name. This event compounds criticism of the facility, which saw 10 inmates escape in May and has been under federal monitoring for years.</p>

          <p>Despite rising US-China tensions, Chinese students continue to pursue higher education in the United States, but they are becoming more discerning in their choices. Applicants are now prioritizing well-known schools, highly-ranked programs, and the safety of the campus city more than before. For many, the appeal of greater academic freedom and the unique culture of American life still outweighs concerns about political instability or personal risk. This shift indicates a more calculated approach from students weighing the significant opportunities against potential downsides.</p>

The 9th Circuit Court found the order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The Trump administration had argued that the amendment's jurisdiction clause does not apply to children of undocumented immigrants, an interpretation the court rejected as unmoored from legal principles. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's policy, which remains on hold due to multiple court injunctions.</p>

          <p>The Palm Coast City Council has formally requested that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suspend or remove Mayor Mike Norris from office. In a letter, four council members accused the mayor of misconduct, including malfeasance, neglect of duty, and incompetence, which they claim has cost taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars. The request follows an external investigation that found Norris violated the city charter and interfered with employees. This drastic measure highlights a deep and public rift within the city's leadership, escalating a period of significant local political turmoil.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order on homelessness that has sparked both outrage and cautious hope among officials and advocates. The order calls for enforcing rules against urban camping and diverting funds away from "housing first" and "harm reduction" strategies, which critics view as a move toward criminalization. However, the order also mentions making funds available for encampment removal efforts, which could potentially support programs like Los Angeles's Inside Safe. The ambiguous language and harsh tone have left many uncertain about whether the policy will offer genuine support or simply punitive measures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has announced a new grant program of over $600 million for state and local governments to detain undocumented migrants. The funding is intended to relieve overcrowding at federal facilities and increase local detention capacity as the Trump administration pursues mass deportations. This marks a significant shift for the agency, which previously administered a program to support migrants after their release. The new policy aligns with the administration's efforts to enlist states in federal immigration enforcement, a move that has been both embraced by some Republican governors and criticized by opponents.</p>

It argues that while replicating a true holiday is impossible, actively seeking out these small pleasures can genuinely improve one's daily happiness and well-being.</p>

          <p>As President Trump visits Scotland, his neighbors near the Trump International Golf Links in Aberdeenshire hold divided opinions about his presence. Some residents, like David Milne, whose property is now surrounded by the course, remain critical of the development, lamenting the loss of the original landscape and recalling past disputes with Trump. Others in the local community acknowledge the economic benefits and jobs the golf course has brought to the area. The differing views reflect a broader sentiment across Scotland, where polls show an unfavorable opinion of the president, even as his business ventures impact the local economy.</p>

          <p>An Arizona woman, Christina Chapman, has been sentenced to over eight years in prison for her part in a major fraud scheme that helped North Korean IT workers secure remote jobs at U.S. companies. Chapman operated a "laptop farm," allowing the workers to appear as if they were on U.S. soil, thereby circumventing international sanctions. The scheme generated millions of dollars for North Korea's weapons programs by using stolen American identities to infiltrate hundreds of companies. Chapman's lawyers said she was initially unaware of the illegality but continued in order to pay for her mother's medical care.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he is considering a plan to issue rebate checks to Americans, funded by the billions of dollars in revenue collected from his administration's new tariffs. Speaking to reporters, he suggested the rebates could be targeted toward people below a certain income level, though he did not specify a threshold. The president also stated that paying down the national debt was a major priority for the tariff revenue. The proposal for direct payments would likely require new legislation from Congress to be enacted through the tax code. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic presents a fictional, first-person narrative from Donald Trump's perspective, humorously explaining his presence in the Epstein files. In the tale, a mysterious Barack Obama introduces him to Jeffrey Epstein in 1987, leading to a decades-long, miserable association where Trump is oblivious to everything except his obsession with tariffs. He is dragged to parties and on the "Lolita Express," all while trying to read a biography of William McKinley to understand trade policy.

When asked about a potential pardon for Maxwell, Trump said it was not the time to discuss it. The ongoing scandal, fueled by new reports and a controversial birthday book, threatens to overshadow his official trade talks with UK and EU leaders during the trip.</p>
