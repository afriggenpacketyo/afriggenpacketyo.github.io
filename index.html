          <p>The United States and Iran are set to resume high-level discussions in Oman to address disputes over Tehran's nuclear program, with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and US President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff leading the talks. Both sides express a preference for diplomacy but have identified non-negotiable red lines, including Iran's insistence on its right to enrich uranium for civilian purposes and the US demand to halt uranium enrichment entirely and dismantle Iranian facilities. Trump has indicated a desire for a diplomatic solution, while also threatening military action if necessary, setting the stage for critical negotiations.</p>

          <p>Former workers warn that mass terminations and budget cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Trump administration, led by RFK Jr, are creating a "real danger" of missed disease outbreaks and negatively impacting essential services. Grant cuts have led to layoffs at state public health agencies, reducing disease surveillance capabilities. The President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) program has also been affected, with federal experts on HIV prevention in children overseas being terminated, potentially dismantling successful global health initiatives. Additionally, reductions in force at the Administration for Children and Families are increasing workloads and threatening child-support programs, while workers at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services claim illegal firings.</p>

          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America's annual report identifies Wichita, Kansas, as the most challenging city for seasonal allergies for the third consecutive year, considering tree, grass, and weed pollen counts, allergy medicine use, and allergist availability. Dr. Purvi Parikh recommends starting allergy medications early, such as 24-hour antihistamines, eye drops, and nasal sprays, and also advises washing clothes, showering after outdoor activities, and washing bedsheets weekly to minimize allergen exposure. The article also suggests staying indoors during peak pollen times in the morning and late afternoon, and consulting a doctor if symptoms persist or breathing issues arise, as colds, viruses, and allergies share similar symptoms.</p>

          <p>While Chinese electric vehicle exports to the UK have decreased, exports of plug-in hybrid vehicles have experienced a significant surge, nearly 600% in the first quarter of the year. This trend is driven by factors such as affordability and the UK's standard 10% import tariff on non-EU rivals, in contrast to the higher tariffs imposed by the European Union. The UK has become China's second-largest export destination for EVs and the fifth-largest for hybrid electric vehicles. The article highlights the growing acceptance of Chinese car brands among British consumers.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in first-quarter net profit due to reduced oil prices and production, with net income at $26 billion, slightly above analyst expectations. Free cash flow also declined from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion, signaling financial strain amid slowing global demand and trade pressures. The company reduced its performance-linked dividend payout, impacting revenue for the Saudi government, which faces deficits and debt. Despite OPEC+ production cuts, banks and energy agencies have downgraded oil price outlooks, anticipating supply gluts and weak demand, projecting Brent crude to average around $65 per barrel this year.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mathilde Ross, a senior staff psychiatrist, argues that the pursuit of perfect motherhood is harmful and unrealistic, emphasizing that flaws are essential for children to learn acceptance and resilience. Mothers often receive messages implying they aren't doing enough, partly due to historical biases in psychiatry that blamed mothers for children's issues. Ross encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack and recognize that their imperfections contribute to their children's development of healthy relationships and self-acceptance. The article concludes that mothers are already good enough.</p>

          <p>Dr. James Ryan, an oral surgeon, is accused of providing his much younger girlfriend, Sarah Harris, with habit-forming anesthesia drugs, eventually leading to her death from an overdose. Sarah's mother, Tina Harris, became suspicious of Ryan after he admitted to noticing Sarah when she was only 14 and later providing her with drugs. Texts revealed Sarah asking for ketamine and propofol, and Ryan administering them, even while she was asleep. Ryan was found guilty of drug distribution, intent to distribute, and depraved heart murder, receiving a 45-year prison sentence.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States remained steady at 6.76%, close to its highest levels this year but below the rate from a year ago. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors including global demand for Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policy decisions, and investor expectations about the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a lackluster spring home-buying season. Sales of previously occupied homes in the US have declined, marking the largest monthly drop since November 2022.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish PhD student at Tufts University, has returned to Boston after being released from immigration detention, vowing to continue her legal battle. She was detained for over six weeks after co-authoring an op-ed critical of Tufts' response to the war in Gaza. Ozturk's lawyers argue her arrest was unlawful, designed to punish her for exercising her First Amendment rights. Senator Edward Markey welcomed her back, praising her fight, while Ozturk expressed gratitude for the support and faith in the American justice system.</p>

          <p>Germany's new government under Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing scrutiny over potential lobbying influences due to the appointment of business figures to top cabinet positions. Critics, including the Left Party, have raised concerns about conflicts of interest, particularly regarding the new ministers for economic affairs and digitalization. While Germany has a Lobby Register, anti-corruption groups argue for stricter regulations and transparency, including documenting how federal bills come into being.

          <p>President Vladimir Putin called for direct talks between Russia and Ukraine to be held in Turkey, brushing aside demands from European leaders for a 30-day ceasefire. The call came after Britain, France, Germany, and Poland threatened “new and massive” sanctions if Putin refused to agree to a ceasefire. Putin proposed a meeting in Istanbul on May 15, stating Russia was “prepared for serious negotiations with Ukraine” and “without any preconditions.” The competing proposals from Kyiv and Moscow are the latest instance in which both Russia and Ukraine have sought to position themselves as seeking peace amid efforts to end the war.</p>

          <p>Cuts to USAID funding by the Trump administration are significantly impacting healthcare in Africa, leading to a reduction in access to medication for HIV patients and the halt of essential healthcare programs. Experts warn of potentially catastrophic consequences, including up to 4 million additional deaths from treatable diseases and a reversal of progress in fighting HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Despite the setbacks, some African countries are stepping up with domestic funding, and there is hope that other nations will not follow the US in cutting aid.</p>

Conservative leader Robert Alden and Independent MP Ayoub Khan allege that bin lorries have stalled again, leading to rubbish build-up. Labour MP Rachel Taylor accuses them of political point-scoring, while the council reports clearing most of the waste and urges residents to put out bins for collection.
