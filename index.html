          <p>Pete DeJoy, the interim CEO of tech startup Astronomer, has issued his first public statement after his predecessor resigned over a viral video. The former CEO, Andy Byron, was filmed in an intimate moment with the company's head of human resources at a concert, leading to his departure and a formal investigation. The scandal generated over $7 million in bets on prediction markets regarding his ouster. DeJoy acknowledged the 'unusual and surreal' media attention, expressing a commitment to move the company forward and focus on its mission in the data and AI sector.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has stated he will not support a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in D.C. unless the team reverts to its former name. In social media posts, Trump called the current name 'ridiculous' and urged the team to change it back, also suggesting the Cleveland Guardians do the same. Team leadership has previously stated they will not change the name, which was dropped in 2020 due to its racist connotations. Native American advocacy groups criticized Trump's remarks as a political distraction that ignores the dehumanizing nature of such mascots.</p>

          <p>Amid recent shark sightings on the U.S. East Coast, a survivor is sharing safety tips for beachgoers. Paul de Gelder, who lost a hand and leg in a 2009 shark attack, advises people to remain calm and avoid splashing, as panic can attract sharks who are often just curious. He recommends maintaining eye contact with the shark, as they prefer an easy, unseen target, and only as a last resort, pushing the shark away by its nose. De Gelder is featured in a new Discovery Channel special where he demonstrates these survival techniques to educate the public.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest flight approaching Minot, North Dakota, was forced into an 'aggressive maneuver' to avoid a potential collision with a B-52 bomber. The pilot informed passengers that the military aircraft was on a converging path and that air traffic control, which operates visually without radar, had not warned them. The B-52 was reportedly conducting a low-altitude flyover for the North Dakota State Fair at the time of the incident. The Federal Aviation Administration, the Air Force, and the airline have all launched investigations into the harrowing close call.</p>

The aggregate lifetime limit for undergraduates is $31,000 for dependents and $57,500 for independents.

          <p>A county coroner has ruled the death of Phillip Reeder, a 52-year-old unarmed man, a homicide after an Alabama police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest. An autopsy concluded Reeder died of heart failure associated with cocaine use and restraint. Family attorneys, who have viewed unreleased body camera footage, say Reeder can be heard saying 'I can't breathe' as an officer's knee was on his neck for over three minutes. The incident occurred after police responded to a call about Reeder wandering in traffic, leading to a confrontation where he was tased and restrained.</p>

The company, which trades under the ticker DJT, has effectively redefined itself as a crypto and financial services firm since its initial launch of the Truth Social platform. The move aligns with Trump's vow to make the U.S. a global crypto capital. (not investment advice)</p>

Ray, who had been an assistant in the room, ran after him, embraced him, and wept with him, providing a moment of shared humanity.</p>

          <p>Rich's Ice Cream Co. has recalled more than 110,000 cases of various ice cream bars due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. The recall, initiated in late June, affects products sold across 23 states and The Bahamas. The recalled items include Chocolate Crunch Cake Bars, Strawberry Shortcake Bars, and Orange Cream Bars, among others. The FDA has classified this as a Class II recall, indicating that exposure may cause temporary or medically reversible health issues, with a remote probability of serious consequences. Listeria infection can be particularly dangerous for pregnant women, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems.</p>

          <p>Marcus Rashford is leaving Manchester United to join Barcelona on a loan deal, marking a significant change for the 27-year-old forward who has been with the English club since childhood. The move follows a difficult period for Rashford, whose form has been inconsistent, leading to a strained relationship with the club's new management. The deal with Barcelona includes an option to buy for a set fee of €35 million. While his departure is seen as a necessary reset for both the player and the club, it also raises questions about why the relationship between the academy graduate and his boyhood team deteriorated.</p>

          <p>Author Joseph Lee, a member of the Aquinnah Wampanoag tribe, explores the rich indigenous history of Martha's Vineyard in his debut book, 'Nothing More of This Land.' The book moves beyond the island's modern image as an affluent vacation spot to tell the story of Noepe, the name his people have used for centuries. Lee discusses the complexities of belonging to a sacred land that is also a luxury tourist destination, where high property taxes threaten to displace the very community that has been there for generations. He also recounts the tribe's long fight for federal recognition of its sovereignty.</p>

The 10-track LP follows his October album 'Chromakopia' and features a funky, club-oriented sound produced entirely by Tyler himself. In a social media post, he explained the album was inspired by a conversation about the fear of being filmed while dancing, which he feels has killed a part of the human spirit. He stated the album was made for movement and encourages listeners to dance, drive, or run while listening.</p>

          <p>Brett Hankison, the former Louisville police officer convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights, is scheduled to be sentenced in federal court. Hankison was found guilty of using excessive force by blindly firing shots into Taylor's apartment during the botched 2020 drug raid that resulted in her death. Although his shots did not strike Taylor, the jury found his actions involved an attempt to kill. The Justice Department's recommendation of only one day in prison has drawn sharp criticism from Taylor's family attorney, who called it an insult and a betrayal of the jury's decision.</p>

          <p>In recent congressional testimony, leaders from UC Berkeley, CUNY, and Georgetown affirmed that denying the Jewish people's right to self-determination is a form of antisemitism. This commentary argues that their clear stance helps cut through the long-standing debate over whether anti-Zionism is antisemitic. The author contends that because anti-Zionism singles out the Jewish state for elimination and denies a right afforded to other peoples, it is inherently discriminatory. This recognition is presented as a crucial step toward focusing campus debates on Israel's policies rather than its right to exist, thereby protecting Jewish students from ostracism.</p>

The process of launching a nuclear weapon is deliberately complex, involving no single 'big red button.' Instead, it requires multiple officers in at least two separate locations to decrypt orders, verify codes, and simultaneously turn keys and levers. This system of redundancies is designed to ensure that no single individual or crew can initiate a launch on their own or prevent a legitimate one from occurring, ensuring strict command and control.</p>

Some researchers and patients report that the drugs, by improving insulin sensitivity and promoting weight loss, can help regulate hormones, restore menstrual cycles, and alleviate other symptoms.
