            <p>Lina, a woman in Spain, was killed by her ex-partner after reporting threats to the police. The VioGén algorithm, used to assess the risk of repeat domestic violence, categorized her case as "medium" risk, leading to a delayed police follow-up. Critics suggest the algorithm may have influenced the court's decision to deny her a restraining order. While police defend the tool, experts highlight the lack of independent audits and potential for algorithmic bias, raising questions about its effectiveness in protecting women at risk.</p>

He has equalled Aston Villa's all-time Premier League goalscoring record. Despite this, Watkins has started only two of the club's past six games.

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen alleges that El Salvador officials staged a meeting with wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, including placing margarita glasses on the table to defame him. Van Hollen asserts that neither he nor Abrego Garcia touched the drinks, and the incident was a setup by President Bukele and President Trump's allies. Trump criticized Van Hollen and repeated disputed claims about Abrego Garcia's gang affiliation. Van Hollen emphasized the U.S. government's failure to comply with the Supreme Court's order to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return.</p>
