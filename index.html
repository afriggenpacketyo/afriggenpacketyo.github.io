          <p>Despite much of the world moving past the pandemic, some Japanese hospitals continue strict visitation policies, causing distress for families, especially those with terminally ill relatives. A group of doctors and social workers is now protesting these restrictions, deeming them human rights violations. They argue that these policies lack scientific basis and prioritize hospital convenience over patient well-being. The health ministry suggests balancing visitations with infection control, but leaves policy decisions to individual facilities, resulting in inconsistent rules across the country; some hospitals even permit pets while restricting grandchildren. Optimism score.</p>

During this time, he was reportedly shocked with electric wires, cut with a saw, and forced to smoke crack cocaine; Woeltz and an accomplice allegedly threatened to kill him if he didn't hand over his Bitcoin password.

          <p>A recent study reveals that dog owners who frequently ruminate about work stress may transmit anxiety to their dogs. The research found that dogs of stressed owners exhibited more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and pacing. This crossover effect occurs because dogs are sensitive to their owners' moods and can pick up on stress cues. The article suggests that employed dog owners could improve their pet's well-being by avoiding work-related thoughts when at home. Optimism score.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto's timely double in the fourth inning helped the New York Mets secure a 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers' overworked bullpen and Tony Gonsolin's command issues in the fourth created an opportunity for Soto, who had been underperforming recently, to deliver the decisive blow. Gonsolin struggled with walks, loading the bases before Soto's hit changed the game, while Mets starter David Peterson pitched effectively, going 7 ⅔ innings. The game highlighted the Dodgers' reliance on their starting pitcher due to bullpen fatigue.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, marking the first train company to transfer to public ownership under Labour. The service will now be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), overseeing railway infrastructure. While the government hails this as a "new dawn for rail," Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander refrained from promising lower fares, emphasizing improvements to services and infrastructure reinvestment. Unions voiced concerns over outsourcing, and the Conservatives urged Labour to deliver on its promises. Alexander described the nationalization as a "real watershed moment," focusing on providing "great value for money" to passengers. Optimism score.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has implemented new restrictions on press access at the Pentagon, citing national security concerns. The new policies limit media access to many areas without an approved government escort, including the offices of Hegseth and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Pentagon Press Association has expressed deep concern, calling the memo a direct attack on freedom of the press, while the National Press Club urges a swift reversal.

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has pledged to reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and scrap the two-child benefit cap if the party gains power. The party intends to fund these policies by cutting net-zero projects and eliminating hotels for asylum seekers. This commitment intensifies the policy divisions within the Labour party, as Prime Minister Keir Starmer has already announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments, while privately considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap. The winter fuel payment provides a lump sum to households with pensioners, and the two-child benefit cap restricts benefits for families with more than two children. Optimism score.</p>

The city is working to address this shortage by offering incentives and streamlining the recruitment process, including holding qualifying exams in multiple boroughs. The Parks Department has also improved lifeguard stations to make the job more appealing. While beachgoers expressed relief at seeing lifeguards, some noted they have grown accustomed to being more cautious due to the shortage.

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author of "Against Our Will: Men, Women and sexual assault," has died at the age of 90. Her groundbreaking book, published in 1975, redefined sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion, leading to significant legal and social changes. Brownmiller's work sparked both praise and controversy, challenging myths and sparking debates about the role of men and women in perpetuating sexual assault. While she faced criticism for some of her views, her work remains influential in shaping modern understanding and attitudes toward sexual assault. Optimism score.</p>

The player's involvement in the drugs underworld is believed to have begun during his time playing in Thailand, which led to his arrest and sacking from his club.
