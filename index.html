          <p>Shohei Ohtani, the Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star, struck out six batters in three simulated innings during a practice session, marking a significant step in his return to pitching. Ohtani has been sidelined from the mound since undergoing right elbow surgery in September 2023. Manager Dave Roberts indicated a possibility, albeit small, of Ohtani pitching before the All-Star break, noting the temptation to expedite his return. During the practice, Ohtani's fastest pitch reached 96 miles per hour, and he demonstrated command over all his pitches, according to the Dodgers' pitching coach Mark Prior, and he is attempting to get into the 60-70 pitch range to envision being in the game for multiple innings.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has declared a curfew for downtown Los Angeles in response to ongoing anti-ICE protests. The curfew, effective from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., covers a one-square-mile area and aims to prevent vandalism and looting. The protests, triggered by recent immigration raids, have led to numerous arrests and property damage, prompting the mayor to take action to maintain order.

Rentschler stated that a 15 mph collision with Read's car would not have caused the skull fracture O'Keefe sustained. Read has stated that she will not testify in her own defense.</p>

The legislation, which passed the House, would shift costs to states, require more recipients to work, and potentially reduce future food aid amounts.
