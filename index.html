          <p>Hurricane Erin has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm but continues to expand in size as it moves toward the Caribbean. The first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, Erin is not expected to make landfall on the U.S. mainland but will bring significant hazards like flash flooding and landslides to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The U.S. National Hurricane Center warns that the storm will generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along nearly the entire U.S. east coast, with Florida and the mid-Atlantic states facing the most dangerous conditions.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska framed the recent summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin as a preliminary step toward achieving a ceasefire in Ukraine. He emphasized that the meeting was a result of U.S. strength and sanctions pressure on Russia, highlighting Alaska's strategic military and energy significance as a backdrop for the talks. Sullivan also discussed his support for the administration's policies on unleashing Alaska's natural resources, contrasting them with what he described as the restrictive approach of the previous administration. He asserted Alaska's ability to balance resource development with environmental protection.</p>

          <p>A shooting inside a crowded Brooklyn hookah lounge early Sunday resulted in the deaths of three men and injuries to eight other people. New York police reported that multiple gunmen opened fire inside the Taste of the City lounge in Crown Heights, with at least 36 shell casings recovered from the scene. While one weapon was found nearby, no suspects have been identified or detained in connection with the incident. The police commissioner described the event as a "terrible shooting," noting it occurred despite a statistical decrease in shooting incidents in the city this year.</p>

          <p>West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio are deploying hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington D.C. to support the Trump administration's federalized policing effort in the city. This move follows the president's executive order that placed the D.C. police force under federal control and activated local Guard units, citing a need to address crime and homelessness. The deployment of out-of-state troops signifies an expansion of federal control over the capital, a decision that has drawn protests and legal challenges from local officials who contest the administration's justification for the emergency action.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that Russian President Vladimir Putin emerged from the Anchorage summit in a stronger position, having conceded nothing while advancing his own diplomatic framework. The analysis suggests President Trump returned empty-handed, failing to secure his primary objective of a ceasefire and instead accepting Putin's terms that a comprehensive peace deal must precede any halt in fighting. By engaging in bilateral talks and securing future meetings, Putin successfully undermined Western efforts to isolate him and increased distrust between the U.S. and its European allies, placing Ukraine in a more precarious situation.</p>

          <p>For over four decades, glaciologist Mauri Pelto has been meticulously measuring the retreat of glaciers in Washington's North Cascade Mountains, documenting a 40% reduction in their size.

          <h2>D.C. Police Union Alleged Crime Stat Manipulation Weeks Before Federal Takeover</h2>

          <p>Weeks before President Trump federalized the Washington, D.C. police force, the city's police union accused the department's leadership of manipulating crime statistics to present a more favorable picture. The union chairman claimed that senior officers would direct members to downgrade felony offenses to lesser charges, an allegation that surfaced after a police commander was suspended for similar conduct. These accusations provided context for the administration's subsequent takeover, with the president citing unreliable statistics and out-of-control crime as justification for the emergency federal intervention. The department has not commented on the ongoing internal investigation.</p>

They argue the administration is using crime as a pretext to create chaos and distract from other issues, while ignoring the progress many cities have made in reducing violent crime through community-based partnerships.</p>

          <p>A legal analyst argues that the Trump administration's proposed budget for the Department of Education would have devastating consequences for countless students. The plan calls for a $12 billion cut, consolidating numerous grant programs that serve English learners, migrant students, and other vulnerable populations into a single, drastically reduced fund. The author, drawing from personal experience overcoming educational challenges, contends that gutting these programs and dismantling diversity initiatives will strip away critical support systems. This will leave disenfranchised students with fewer resources and pathways to overcome systemic barriers, particularly affecting low-income and rural communities.</p>

In response to an inquiry from the opposition Green Party, the government argued that the legal concept of reparations does not apply because international obligations against such acts did not exist at the time the atrocities were committed. This position stands in contrast to Germany's 2021 offer to pay Namibia €1.1 billion over 30 years as compensation for the Herero and Nama genocide, which the government framed as development aid rather than legal reparations.</p>

          <p>Thorne Island, a derelict Napoleonic-era fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has undergone a massive five-year renovation to become a luxury party destination, now on the market for £3 million. The new owner, Mike Conner, purchased the abandoned property in 2017 and invested heavily to overcome immense logistical challenges, including having no running water or electricity. The historic fort, originally built in the 1850s to defend against French attacks, is now equipped with 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and its own nightclub, reviving its past life as a unique hotel and event space.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Sparks forward Cameron Brink has revealed that creating vision boards was a crucial tool in her mental and emotional recovery from a torn ACL. The practice, suggested by a veteran teammate, helped her maintain a positive outlook and focus on her long-term goals during the arduous 13-month rehabilitation process. Brink used the collages to manifest her aspirations, from returning to the court to her personal life, which she believes helped her manage the anxiety and pressure of her comeback. This mental rehearsal proved effective, as she made an immediate impact in her return to the court.</p>

          <p>The German government has suspended its humanitarian visa program, leaving approximately 300 Russian and Belarusian nationals, many of whom are critics of their home governments, in limbo. According to the refugee support group The Ark, these individuals had already been approved by the German Foreign Office but are now blocked from receiving their visas due to a halt by the Interior Ministry. This policy shift, part of a broader move toward stricter migration rules, creates a precarious situation for dissidents who fled persecution and now face risks of extradition or abduction in the post-Soviet countries where they are currently staying.</p>

          <p>Germany's ruling coalition is at odds over how to expand the country's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, to meet NATO targets. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius of the Social Democrats (SPD) has proposed a plan to make voluntary service more attractive, which includes mandatory questionnaires and medical checks for all 18-year-old men. However, members of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) argue this is insufficient and that some form of compulsory service is necessary to guarantee personnel numbers amid a tense security situation. The debate highlights a fundamental disagreement within the government on balancing national security needs with individual liberties.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued in a dramatic helicopter operation after being trapped for two days behind a waterfall in California's Tulare County. Ryan Wardwell was rappelling down the Seven Teacups waterfalls when extreme water pressure pushed him off his lines and into a cave behind the cascade. After he was reported missing, search teams used a drone to locate him, finding him alive but soaked and dehydrated. A California Highway Patrol helicopter crew successfully hoisted him to safety, concluding what the local sheriff's office called a "stunning survival story."</p>

          <p>As the cost of higher education approaches $100,000 per year at some institutions, a small number of U.S. colleges offer a completely tuition-free education to all admitted students. These nine schools, which include Berea College, College of the Ozarks, and all five U.S. military service academies, typically have high academic standards and unique requirements. In exchange for the free education, students at some schools must participate in work programs, while those at service academies commit to several years of active military duty after graduation.

          <p>A new trend in vlogging features creators documenting their "5-to-9" routines, the hours outside of the traditional workday, with a focus on hyper-productivity and self-optimization. These videos showcase meticulously scheduled evenings filled with workouts, meal-prepping, and cleaning, leaving little room for unstructured rest. The article suggests this phenomenon reflects a broader cultural truth where the pressure to be productive, driven by a work-centric society, now permeates personal time. This transforms leisure from a period of relaxation into another form of labor to be performed and perfected for an online audience.</p>

          <p>Within the span of a single undergraduate cohort's time on campus, generative AI has transformed from a novelty into an indispensable tool for a vast majority of students. The article suggests that for students who entered college in 2022, using tools like ChatGPT for tasks ranging from summarizing readings to completing assignments has become a normalized habit, driven by academic pressure and a desire for efficiency. While many professors seem unaware of the extent of this shift, students are adapting to a new reality where AI is a constant presence, raising fundamental questions about learning, academic integrity, and the purpose of a college education.</p>

          <p>Following the Supreme Court's 2023 decision ending race-based affirmative action, attention is turning to class-based alternatives as a way to achieve diversity in higher education. Richard Kahlenberg, who testified against Harvard in the case, advocates for giving a leg up to economically disadvantaged students of all races, arguing this will create both racial and economic diversity. He expresses concern that the Trump administration, while scrutinizing universities for compliance, may now oppose class-based programs if they result in increased racial diversity. Kahlenberg believes such a move would be politically unwise and inconsistent with the court's ruling.</p>

Coaches shared their anxieties and life lessons, encouraging players to open up in smaller group settings. Foster believes this process of building trust and letting guards down has brought the team closer together, fostering a "we over me" mentality heading into the new season.</p>

Social media users highlighted Longarino's past posts on X that were critical of Beijing's policies in the Xinjiang region, leading to a backlash against the institutions. In response, Central South University and at least two other schools have removed online announcements about lectures he delivered on unrelated topics, such as sexual harassment in Chinese courts. The incident illustrates the growing pressure on Chinese academic institutions to align with nationalist sentiment and avoid association with foreign scholars perceived as critical of the government.</p>

Officers who have been investigated by Lloyd claim he operates with a presumption of guilt and uses intimidating tactics.
