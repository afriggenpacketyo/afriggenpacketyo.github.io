          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that many tariffs imposed by President Trump exceed his authority under federal economic emergency laws. While the ruling does not immediately block the tariffs, it represents a significant challenge to his trade policies, which have been a cornerstone of his economic strategy. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant unlimited tariff power to the president, calling it a core congressional function. The administration has vowed to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration's Chief Data Officer, Charles Borges, has resigned after filing a whistleblower complaint alleging a major data security breach. Borges claimed that employees from the Department of Government Efficiency uploaded the entire country's Social Security information to a "vulnerable cloud environment." The SSA has refuted the claim, stating the data was secure and not compromised. Borges cited a hostile work environment and retaliation as reasons for his "constructive discharge," making it impossible to perform his duties ethically.</p>

          <p>China's equity markets are experiencing a significant rally, drawing renewed interest from both overseas and domestic retail investors. With an estimated US$22 trillion in savings, Chinese investors are rotating out of low-yield fixed-income products and into stocks, providing a powerful catalyst for the market. Global asset managers are turning positive on Chinese equities, citing "undervalued innovation" in sectors like advanced manufacturing and AI. This shift suggests potential for continued growth as international capital returns to the nation's combined US$20 trillion markets. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data obtained by the BBC reveals that live-fire military training has caused hundreds of wildfires across the UK since 2023. Firefighting efforts are often complicated by the presence of unexploded ordnance, some dating back to World War II, making it too dangerous for crews to access the areas. Of the 439 wildfires on Ministry of Defence land since January 2023, 385 were directly caused by army maneuvers. While the MoD states it has a robust wildfire policy, some local residents are calling for a ban on live-fire training during the driest months due to health and environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has unanimously blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's ruling, stating that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the administration's actions were unlawful. The judges found that the Department of Homeland Security secretary lacked the authority to vacate a prior extension of TPS. This decision provides temporary relief for individuals who were facing the loss of their permission to live and work in the country.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned a reported plan by the Trump administration to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the potential action an "invasion." Pritzker stated that his office has not been contacted about the plan, which he believes is politically motivated rather than a genuine effort to combat crime. The criticism comes amid President Trump's recent deployments of federal agents and National Guard forces to other major cities. A White House spokesperson dismissed Pritzker's accusations, criticizing the city's handling of its violent crime rate.</p>

The trial has featured unusual lines of questioning from lawyers, including inquiries about her wigs and fingernails, which have baffled and amused online observers. The plaintiff, Emani Ellis, alleges the rapper cut her cheek and spit on her, while Cardi B maintains the confrontation was only verbal after her privacy was invaded.</p>

          <p>Millions of dollars in television ads are set to air in California ahead of a November special election on Proposition 50, a measure to redraw the state's congressional districts. This rare mid-decade redistricting effort, initiated by Democrats to counter Republican gains in other states, has become a high-stakes battle for control of the U.S. House. Opponents of the measure, including a bipartisan coalition, have already booked over $10 million in airtime to argue against putting redistricting power back in the hands of politicians.

          <p>The White House has announced the cancellation of $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding that had been previously approved by Congress. President Trump utilized a rarely used procedure known as a "pocket rescission" to withhold funds from 15 international programs, including significant cuts to USAID and peacekeeping missions. The move has drawn strong opposition from Democratic lawmakers, who warn it could increase the likelihood of a federal government shutdown later in the year. Some moderate Republicans have also criticized the action, with Senator Susan Collins calling it a clear violation of the law.</p>

          <p>A new study from Stanford Medicine indicates that preschool-aged children diagnosed with ADHD are frequently prescribed medication too soon after diagnosis. The research, which examined nearly 10,000 health records, found that 68% of children aged 3 to 5 with ADHD were medicated before age 7, with 42% receiving a prescription within just 30 days. Clinical guidelines recommend starting with behavioral intervention first, as medication can have side effects like irritability and emotional problems in young children.

Despite concerns from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, a White House official called Kennedy a "crown jewel" of the administration.

          <p>China is streamlining its State Key Laboratories (SKLs), including those in Hong Kong, to better serve its national strategic agenda and competition in the global technology race. The restructuring moves away from loosely defined research towards a model with clear mandates, centralized funding, and direct accountability to Beijing's goals for scientific supremacy. During a recent ceremony in Hong Kong, China's Science and Technology Minister emphasized the city's role in supporting national development through innovation. This new approach aims to transform the labs into more focused and efficient engines for technological advancement.</p>

          <p>Low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection again, just months after a previous reorganization. The airline plans to continue normal operations during the restructuring, honoring tickets and loyalty points. Spirit's CEO stated that more work is needed to position the company for the future, citing adverse market conditions and weak demand for domestic leisure travel. The airline, known for its no-frills model, has struggled with rising costs and debt since the pandemic and recently announced plans to furlough hundreds of pilots.</p>

          <p>Missouri's Governor, Mike Kehoe, has called a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional districts, a move aimed at helping Republicans gain an additional seat in the U.S. House. The decision follows a public pressure campaign from President Trump, who has been encouraging Republican-led states to create more favorable maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. This mid-decade redistricting is highly unusual and is part of a broader national strategy that has seen similar efforts in Texas. Democrats have condemned the move as a partisan gerrymander intended to silence voters' voices.</p>

          <p>A UK Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court ruling that would have forced 138 asylum seekers to leave The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. The initial injunction was granted to the local council, which argued the hotel's owner breached planning rules. However, the appellate court found the original ruling was "seriously flawed," failing to consider the difficulty of relocating the migrants. The hotel has been the site of numerous protests and counter-demonstrations following the arrest of an asylum seeker housed there, with the court warning that rewarding protests with legal victories risks encouraging further lawlessness.</p>

          <p>Singer Sabrina Carpenter has addressed the backlash surrounding the cover art for her new album, "Man's Best Friend," which depicts her on her knees at a man's feet. In an interview, Carpenter expressed shock at the controversy, stating that her artistic intention was to explore themes of control and the lack of it from a woman's perspective. After the initial criticism, she released an alternative cover that she humorously noted was "approved by God." Carpenter defended her original vision, emphasizing that it's about the humanity of making mistakes and learning from them.</p>

          <p>The new crime comedy "Caught Stealing," directed by Darren Aronofsky, attempts to capture the gritty, anything-goes atmosphere of late-1990s New York City. The film stars Austin Butler as a bartender who becomes entangled in the city's criminal underworld, but the review argues that Butler is too charming to convincingly portray his down-and-out character. While the movie successfully evokes a nostalgic, scruffy aesthetic reminiscent of Aronofsky's early work, its plot and characters are described as cartoonish and underdeveloped. The film is ultimately seen as a disposable thriller that prioritizes style over compelling action or depth.</p>

          <p>Texas has enacted a new congressional map, signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott, as part of a mid-decade redistricting effort to increase the Republican majority in the U.S. House. The map creates five new districts expected to be safe for the GOP, four of which are Hispanic-majority, putting the party's recent gains with Latino voters to a critical test. While Republicans are confident they can lock in this support, some Democrats and pollsters suggest that issues like the economy and immigration could make these districts riskier for the GOP than anticipated, potentially turning the gerrymander against them.</p>

Raducanu is focused on closing the gap, working with new coach Francisco Roig to improve key areas of her game, particularly her serve and the shot that follows it.

The funding crisis has already led to service cuts affecting thousands of commuters, students, and elderly residents.

The arrest involved a pre-dawn raid with an armored vehicle and numerous armed agents. His attorneys call the tactics an act of intimidation and punishment for publicizing the initial incident, where Longoria drove away from masked officers he feared were a threat. While DHS claims officers were injured, surveillance video appears to contradict this, and Longoria's lawyers argue the charges are baseless and intended to facilitate his deportation.</p>
