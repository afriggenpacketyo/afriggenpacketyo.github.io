          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has filed a second criminal referral with the Department of Justice against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The referral concerns alleged misrepresentations on mortgage and ethics documents for a condominium she owns.

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court is set to rule on whether to remove Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office, a decision that could create a leadership vacuum and political instability. The case stems from a petition by senators accusing her of ethical breaches over a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader, Hun Sen. The ruling is highly anticipated as it could destabilize the government just weeks after deadly border clashes with Cambodia.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia have asked a federal court to order Trump administration officials to stop making "prejudicial, inflammatory, and false statements" about their client. They argue that public comments from officials, including President Trump and the DHS Secretary, have vilified Abrego Garcia and could taint the jury pool, violating his right to a fair trial. The request follows his release from custody in Tennessee and subsequent detention in Baltimore, amid administration efforts to deport him.</p>

The ousting of Director Susan Monarez and the subsequent resignation of four other senior officials mark the latest chapter in the agency's instability.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed an international network of spammers who are creating and posting AI-generated images of fictional Holocaust victims on Facebook to make money. These "AI slop" accounts, many based in Pakistan, exploit Meta's content monetization program by generating high-engagement posts with fabricated, emotional stories. Holocaust memorial organizations have condemned the practice as a "dangerous distortion" that disrespects victims and causes distress to survivors and their families.</p>

          <p>The superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District has overruled a school board decision to display Israeli flags on all campuses during Jewish American Heritage Month. Superintendent Alex Cherniss cited "heightened safety concerns" and the need to protect students, stating that only the U.S. and California flags will be displayed until further notice. The board's initial 3-2 vote in favor of the display had sparked controversy, with supporters seeing it as a stand against antisemitism and critics calling it an inappropriate political statement for a public school.</p>

          <p>The UK government did not conduct its own cost-benefit analysis before proceeding with a major reorganization to merge local councils in 21 areas of England, a BBC investigation found. The ministry based its savings estimates on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN), which claimed £2.9 billion could be saved. However, the CCN has since revised its analysis, now suggesting the mergers could result in no savings or even cost money, raising concerns about the financial viability of the reforms.</p>
