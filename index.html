        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study challenges the conventional wisdom that Democratic candidates benefit from moving to the center. While moderation may increase support among swing voters, particularly in high-profile races, the study suggests this benefit might be offset by decreased voter turnout among the Democratic base.  The overall impact of moderation appears to be small, and further research is needed to definitively establish a causal relationship between moderation and turnout.</p>
