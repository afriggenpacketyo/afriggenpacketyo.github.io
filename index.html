          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 20:24:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court appears divided on whether a Maryland school board must allow parents to opt their children out of instruction using storybooks addressing gender identity and sexual orientation. The case centers on whether the school's policy infringes on parents' First Amendment rights to direct their children's religious upbringing. Conservative justices expressed skepticism about the school board's refusal to grant opt-outs, questioning the burden on religious freedom. The outcome could have significant implications for parental rights and LGBTQ+ inclusive education in public schools.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported a 20% drop in automotive revenue for the first quarter, falling short of Wall Street estimates due to factory updates for the Model Y and lower average selling prices. Net income also plummeted by 71% compared to the previous year. CEO Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's administration, particularly with tariff plans, has raised concerns about increased costs for electric vehicle production. Tesla refrained from promising growth this year and will revisit its 2025 guidance in the next quarter (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Archaeologists are puzzled by a medieval cemetery near Cardiff Airport, where nearly all the skeletons found are women buried with signs of both hard labor and wealth. The site, dating back to the 6th or 7th century, contains unusual burial positions and artifacts, including imported glass. Researchers are investigating why one woman was found tossed in a ditch, unlike the others who were carefully buried. Analysis of the skeletons' teeth reveals a consistent diet low in meat and devoid of fish, adding another layer to the enigma of this community.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already convicted of murdering two of her children, has been found guilty of conspiring to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow. Prosecutors argued that Daybell orchestrated the shooting to obtain a $1 million life insurance policy and be with her current husband, Chad Daybell. The prosecution presented text messages revealing Daybell's "twisted" religious beliefs as justification for the murder. She faces sentencing in this case and is also accused of conspiring to murder her niece's ex-husband.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the restoration of Voice of America (VoA), reversing the Trump administration's decision to dismantle the federally-funded news network. President Trump had claimed VoA promoted biased reporting and dismantled it through an executive order in March. The lawsuit filed by VoA employees argued that the dismantling deprived the world of a crucial source of objective news. The ruling allows VoA to resume its operations, although the Trump administration can appeal the decision.</p>
