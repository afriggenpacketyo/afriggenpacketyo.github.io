          <p>During a speech at an investment conference in Riyadh, President Trump criticized decades of American policy in the Middle East, denouncing nation-building and interventionism. He urged the people of the region to chart their own destinies and expressed a desire for Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel and for a nuclear deal with Iran. Reactions to his speech were mixed, with some praising his emphasis on sovereignty and others questioning the potential impact on human rights. The article also notes Trump's meeting with Syrian leader Ahmed al-Shara, a former jihadist, sparking controversy in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed pausing the enrollment of low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded healthcare benefits starting in 2026, citing a $12 billion budget deficit. The freeze, driven by higher-than-expected program costs and economic uncertainty, will not affect those already enrolled or children. Additionally, starting in 2027, adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" on Medi-Cal will have to pay a $100 monthly premium. Newsom attributed the shortfalls to President Trump's tariff policies, estimating a $16 billion loss in tax revenues for the state.</p>

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber will take a voluntary 25% pay cut following the Trump administration's decision to cut $450 million in grants to the institution. The move comes after dozens of tenured professors pledged to donate 10% of their salaries to support the university's legal challenge against the funding freeze. The Trump administration cites Harvard's alleged failure to address race discrimination and antisemitism as justification for the funding cuts, while Harvard argues the cuts could impair research and staffing, rejecting conditions like halting diversity policies for resuming funding.</p>

          <p>Nearly half a million people in Gaza face starvation due to the halting of humanitarian aid by Israel for over ten weeks. The UN says hundreds of truckloads of lifesaving supplies are waiting at the border, while inside Gaza, food is scarce. Humanitarian groups have exhausted supplies, forcing them to shut down kitchens and bakeries, and Palestinians are grinding up pasta and lentils to make flour for bread. Wheat flour is selling for $10 a pound in Gaza.</p>

The decision shuts off a route to Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act through a federal civil rights law known as Section 1983, limiting who can file lawsuits over voting rights in the affected states.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed halting enrollment in the state's healthcare program for low-income immigrants without legal status starting in 2026 and charging monthly premiums to those already enrolled. The decision is driven by higher-than-expected program costs and economic uncertainty stemming from President Trump's tariff policies. Newsom estimates that Trump's policies would cut revenue to the state by $16 billion. The plan also includes budget cuts to public universities, long-term care, and environmental protections.</p>

          <p>Despite a tariff reduction deal between Washington and Beijing, the costs of broad-based tariffs on Chinese imports remain too high, according to the head of an American soybean industry group. US soybeans exported to China now face levies of 34 per cent, reflecting Beijing’s retaliatory duties, the most favoured nation rate, and China’s value added tax. While US soybean farmers have searched for years for alternatives to the Chinese market, the sheer volume of China's demand cannot be completely replaced.</p>
