        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has altered his approach to the Russia-Ukraine war, now advocating for a direct peace agreement rather than a preliminary ceasefire after meeting with Vladimir Putin. He announced on Truth Social that this is the best path to end the conflict, a significant change from his earlier calls for a rapid ceasefire. Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington and has urged him to "make a deal," reportedly relaying a Russian offer that involves Ukraine ceding territory in the Donbas region. European leaders have expressed concern that Trump might pressure Zelenskyy into accepting terms discussed with Putin.</p>

          <p>A White House official has confirmed that National Guard members deployed in Washington, D.C., may be armed, marking a shift from previous guidance. This deployment is part of President Trump's initiative to address crime by placing the city's police under federal control. While the troops may carry weapons to protect federal assets and support law enforcement, the official stated they will not be making arrests. The move has drawn some protest from D.C. residents, who note that violent crime in the city reached a 30-year low in 2024.</p>

          <p>Following his meeting with Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin described the summit as "timely and very useful," stating it brought them closer to resolving the Ukraine crisis. Meanwhile, the White House dismissed an NPR report about summit documents being found on a hotel printer as "hilarious," denying it constituted a security breach. The article also reveals that First Lady Melania Trump sent a personal letter to Putin, delivered by the president, concerning Ukrainian children abducted during the war. This adds a layer of personal diplomacy to the high-stakes international discussions.</p>

          <p>The governors of West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio have announced the deployment of hundreds of their state's National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. This move supports the Trump administration's federal takeover of the city's policing to address crime and homelessness. These additional troops will join the 800 D.C. National Guard members already activated by the president's executive order. The decision to bring in outside forces escalates the federal presence in the city, drawing protests from some residents and criticism from local leaders who feel their limited self-governance is being tested.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of the Interior has announced a new "no-tolerance" policy for homeless encampments on federal land in Washington, D.C., aligning with the Trump administration's "beautification" efforts. The policy shift means individuals in these encampments must either accept placement in a shelter or face potential arrest. U.S. Park Police have already cleared 70 encampments, with the remaining few scheduled for removal by multi-agency teams. The new directive also includes prosecuting damage to federal property "to the fullest extent," representing a significant crackdown on homelessness and public order in the capital.</p>

While the storm is forecast to remain offshore from the U.S. East Coast, it is projected to generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents from North Carolina to Virginia next week. The National Hurricane Center had previously predicted an above-normal hurricane season, with activity typically peaking from August through October.</p>

          <p>A new surge in COVID-19 cases is affecting the United States, with the Southwest experiencing the nation's highest positivity rates at 12.5%. The spike is attributed to the highly contagious "Stratus" variant and coincides with students returning to school. This rise in infections comes after the CDC, under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., removed the COVID vaccine from its recommended schedule for healthy children, a decision criticized by many public health experts. While the nationwide positivity rate has surpassed the winter surge, weekly deaths have so far remained low.</p>

The historic property, originally built to defend against French naval attacks, is now back on the market for £3 million, with potential to be a unique tourist attraction or private party destination.</p>

          <p>With food prices rising, parents in the UK are sharing creative strategies to manage the extra cost of feeding children during the six-week summer holidays. Many families who rely on subsidized or free school meals during term time face increased financial pressure. Tactics include meticulous planning, freezing reduced "yellow-sticker" items, batch cooking, and organizing daily food rations to prevent snacks from disappearing too quickly. Charities report a significant increase in demand for meal support, highlighting the widespread financial strain many households are experiencing despite nominal wage growth being offset by rising living expenses.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has abruptly stopped issuing visitor visas for children from Gaza seeking urgent medical care, following an online pressure campaign by far-right activist Laura Loomer. Loomer, who is close to Donald Trump, posted videos of injured Palestinian children arriving in the U.S., falsely labeling them as security threats and demanding the program be shut down. In response to her posts, the State Department announced a full review of the medical-humanitarian visa process for individuals from Gaza.

Experts explain this phenomenon, sometimes called a "false autumn," is not a true seasonal shift but a stress response from nature due to the prolonged hot and dry conditions. The drought-like weather is causing trees to conserve water by dropping leaves and is disrupting the natural cycles for wildlife. This chaotic seasonal timing highlights the tangible impact of extreme weather on the UK's ecosystems.</p>

          <p>A new wave of restaurant chains from China is expanding internationally, introducing global diners to the vast diversity of the country's regional cuisines beyond familiar Cantonese fare. Brands specializing in fiery Hunan dishes, spicy Chongqing grilled fish, and Xinjiang lamb skewers are using Singapore as a launchpad for global expansion. These modern eateries aim to challenge outdated Western stereotypes of Chinese food by offering authentic, sophisticated dining experiences. This culinary push reflects a form of soft power, potentially helping to reshape perceptions of China through its rich and varied gastronomic culture.</p>

          <p>A new box set titled “Sunset Boulevard” chronicles the final burst of studio creativity from Elvis Presley, compiling music he recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975. This period includes his last Top 10 hit, “Burning Love,” and soulful ballads recorded as his marriage was ending. The article revisits this era through the eyes of his friend Jerry Schilling, who believes Presley's career faltered after he was passed over for a role in the 1976 film “A Star Is Born.” The collection offers a poignant look at the King of Rock and Roll's later work, when he was a pioneer grappling with a culture that had evolved beyond him.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced a plan to move Palestinians to the southern part of the Gaza Strip in preparation for a renewed military offensive, days after stating its intent to take control of northern Gaza City. The military's civilian affairs agency, COGAT, said it would resume the supply of tents to the region to facilitate the relocation. This move comes as Israeli forces have intensified operations on the outskirts of Gaza City, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described as the final stronghold of Hamas. The plan signals a new phase of military operations and further mass displacement of the civilian population.</p>

Her death from cardiac arrest highlights the severe humanitarian crisis and widespread malnutrition in Gaza, which UN-backed experts have warned is reaching famine levels.

          <p>Samsung is regaining ground against Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined. This renewed competition is driven by Samsung's innovation in screen technology, particularly its popular Z series of foldable phones, which offer a new form factor compared to the standard iPhone design. While Apple still leads the U.S. market, Samsung's wider range of price points and novel designs are attracting consumers. Analysts suggest Apple may release its own foldable iPhone by 2026 to compete in this growing segment of the premium market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that crucial environmental laws like the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 are facing unprecedented attacks from the Trump administration and its allies. The author refutes the argument that the act should be weakened because it has been successful, pointing out that many species like the North Atlantic right whale remain critically endangered. The article stresses that threats from climate change, pollution, and ship strikes are intensifying, making these protections more vital than ever. It concludes that the declining health of marine mammal populations is an indicator of the declining health of the oceans.</p>

The mother, Sarah Shaw, who has been living legally in the U.S. since 2021, was detained when re-entering from Canada after discovering her travel permit had expired due to a paperwork mistake. Despite her son's valid documents, both were taken into custody and transported 2,000 miles from their home in Washington state.

          <p>This article explains the key factors behind the Air Canada flight attendants' strike that has grounded the airline's fleet. The union, representing 10,000 attendants, initiated the strike after eight months of failed negotiations, citing inadequate wage offers that fall below inflation and issues with unpaid work hours. In response to the immediate and widespread travel disruption, the Canadian government invoked its authority to force both the airline and the union into binding arbitration. This move aims to end the strike quickly but has been criticized by the union as a violation of their right to collective bargaining.</p>
