            <p>The Federal Trade Commission is suing Uber, alleging deceptive billing and cancellation practices related to its Uber One subscription service. The FTC claims Uber misled consumers about savings, made cancellations difficult, and charged users without consent, violating the FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act. Uber disputes the claims, stating its sign-up and cancellation processes are clear and simple, and that users are not charged without their consent. The lawsuit marks the first FTC action against a major tech company since President Trump's second term began. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court is considering a case impacting whether Americans will have to pay out-of-pocket for preventive care services under the Affordable Care Act. The dispute centers on classifying members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. A lower court found the task force's structure unconstitutional, potentially limiting access to life-saving medical care. The Biden and Trump administrations have defended the board's structure, arguing that its members are subject to ample supervision.</p>
