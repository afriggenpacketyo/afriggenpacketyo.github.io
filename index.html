          <p>During her Las Vegas Studio Sessions residency, Kelly Clarkson delighted fans by bringing her 11-year-old daughter, River Rose, onto the stage to perform "Heartbeat Song." This marks River Rose's second time joining her mother for a duet in Las Vegas, showcasing the family's musical talent. The article also notes Clarkson's earlier decision to postpone the residency's start due to vocal strain, and a previous public performance by her 8-year-old son, Remington, singing Frank Sinatra. The event highlights a sweet, family-oriented moment in the singer's career, emphasizing her children's comfort in the spotlight.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has voiced significant apprehension regarding the Trump administration's immigration enforcement in the city, highlighting the pervasive fear among its large immigrant population. She strongly criticized the tactics employed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, such as masked personnel and unmarked vehicles, arguing these methods sow distrust and resemble kidnappings rather than legitimate law enforcement. Bass also condemned the ongoing presence of federal troops in Los Angeles, deeming their deployment unnecessary for addressing local protests. Despite her strong opposition to the administration's immigration agenda, she did commend their support during the city's January wildfires.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has affirmed his commitment to staying in power despite projections that his ruling coalition will lose its majority in the upper house election. This anticipated electoral setback, following a previous loss in the more powerful lower house, is attributed to public discontent over rising prices, the threat of US tariffs, and a series of political scandals. Ishiba stated his focus remains on crucial trade negotiations with the United States. The article notes that this outcome could destabilize Japan's government and highlights the growing influence of right-wing parties, which are attracting conservative voters disillusioned with the LDP.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Tim Burchett of Tennessee has renewed his demand for the release of the Department of Justice's evidence related to Jeffrey Epstein, stressing the importance of transparency while also cautioning against revealing victim identities. Burchett openly criticized President Trump's earlier characterization of the Epstein files as a hoax, though he acknowledged Trump's subsequent directive to Attorney General Pam Bondi to unseal grand jury evidence as a "start." He expressed skepticism about fully uncovering all secrets in Washington, but underscored the ongoing push for public disclosure regarding the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo government and the AFC/M23 rebellion have signed a declaration in Doha, committing to a permanent ceasefire and negotiations for a comprehensive peace agreement. Despite this, experts express skepticism, citing a history of failed agreements and immediate disagreements, such as the rebels denying a commitment to withdraw from occupied areas. Challenges include defining modalities for restoring state authority and establishing effective monitoring mechanisms. The lack of penalties for breaches and unresolved justice issues further complicate the path to lasting peace, raising doubts about the political will for sustained implementation.</p>

The government plans a record £104 billion investment over the next five years to upgrade infrastructure, which is projected to increase consumer bills.

Experts emphasize that AI can automate a significant portion of tasks, but the crucial "last mile" often still requires human judgment. The article points out that freelancers were among the first to experience direct AI-related job cuts and forecasts an accelerated pace of AI-linked workforce changes in the future.

          <p>Former Obama speechwriter David Litt, in his new book "It's Only Drowning," discusses the importance of finding "neutral ground" to foster connection and dialogue across political divides. He illustrates this concept with his personal experience of learning to surf with his brother-in-law, a Joe Rogan superfan, despite their stark political and lifestyle differences. Litt argues that while "common ground" may be hard to find, engaging in shared activities can create spaces where people can spend time together focused on something other than their disagreements. This approach, he suggests, allows for genuine friendship and more meaningful discussions, embodying the principle of "disagreeing without being disagreeable."</p>

This potential high-level engagement follows a recent face-to-face meeting between their foreign ministers, indicating a move towards stabilizing the often-fluctuating US-China relations. Despite President Trump's earlier threats of substantial tariffs on Chinese imports upon his return to the White House, both nations have since worked to ease tensions, reaching a preliminary trade agreement. This prospective summit is viewed as a significant step in managing the intricate dynamics between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>Gene Marks contends that the conventional methods for measuring the U.S. labor market, such as job growth and unemployment rates, are increasingly outdated given contemporary workforce dynamics. He points to the emergence of the "over-employed"—individuals holding multiple jobs, often remotely—and the significant increase in new business applications as evidence of a more complex economic landscape. Marks advocates for a paradigm shift, suggesting that the focus should move from counting "jobs" to measuring total income, drawing data from comprehensive sources like tax returns and various private platforms. This article argues for a more accurate and relevant assessment of the labor market's true health. (not investment advice)</p>
