          <p>Microsoft reported a robust fiscal third quarter, surpassing expectations with strong revenue and earnings.

The company's overall revenue increased by 13% to approximately $70 billion, and earnings per share rose by 17% to $3.46, leading to a nearly 7% surge in after-hours trading.

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has revised its economic and inflation projections downward for the current fiscal year, citing concerns over the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on the Japanese economy. The central bank now expects the economy to grow by 0.5% and core consumer prices to rise by 2.2% in fiscal 2025. Despite these revisions, the BOJ maintained its benchmark interest rate at around 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, signaling a commitment to raising rates further if economic conditions align with its expectations. The BOJ anticipates reaching its 2% inflation goal in the latter half of the three years through March 2028.</p>

          <p>In her first major speech since leaving office, Kamala Harris delivered a strong critique of Donald Trump's initial 100 days, accusing him of undermining American ideals. Speaking to a Democratic audience in San Francisco, Harris argued that Trump is deliberately creating fear and chaos to consolidate executive power, following a conservative policy blueprint. She praised leaders and institutions pushing back against Trump's agenda and encouraged Americans to organize and stand up for fundamental rights. Harris, who has maintained a low profile since her election loss, marked her return to the political stage with this forceful address.</p>

While Trump has moved to ease car tariffs, analysts warn that the fast-changing nature of these policies will likely keep long-term corporate investment decisions at bay.

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that there is "a very good chance" of reaching a trade deal with China, even as his own Trade Representative Jamieson Greer indicated that no official negotiations are currently underway. Trump reiterated his openness to renewed trade talks with Beijing, emphasizing the need for a fair deal. Greer, however, clarified that while Washington seeks a fair trade relationship with China, no official talks are taking place. This divergence in messaging highlights the complex dynamics of the U.S.-China trade relationship.</p>

          <p>A survey by the Asian American Foundation reveals that one in four non-Asian Americans consider Chinese-Americans a potential threat, particularly regarding national security. Additionally, four in ten fear that Asian-Americans have greater allegiance to their countries of origin than to the United States. These findings underscore concerns about the ability of Asian-Americans to assimilate amid rising social tension and plummeting US-China relations. The poll highlights a troubling disconnect between perceptions of Asian-Americans and their lived experiences.</p>

          <p>People who fled authoritarian regimes are drawing parallels between tactics used by those regimes and those employed by the Trump administration. They cite instances of government agents aggressively questioning citizens, universities facing pressure to self-censor, and news organizations being targeted for critical coverage. Some immigrants say Trump is the victim, but others express fear and unease, noting similarities to the tactics used by autocratic leaders like Viktor Orbán in Hungary and Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey. A survey found that a majority of scholars feel more pressure to self-censor when discussing Israeli-Palestinian issues.</p>

          <p>India's developing trade deal with the United States and its intensifying conflict with Pakistan could complicate a recovery in ties between New Delhi and Beijing, according to analysts. The Trump administration announced a 26 per cent tariff rate on Indian imports, prompting India to move quickly on an economic deal with Washington. This development could hinder China's broader push to win over the developing world, as India has long been viewed as an important player in China’s efforts to woo Global South economies.</p>

          <p>A California Assembly committee has amended a controversial bill that aimed to end solar credits for rooftop solar system owners, limiting its application to those who sell their homes. The bill, originally proposed to reduce the incentive period from 20 years to 10 years, now only affects those who sell their homes. The change came after strong opposition from solar owners, schools, and environmental groups, who argued the bill would reduce home values and undermine investments in green energy. Major utilities and electrical worker unions supported the bill, arguing the credits were unfairly raising electricity bills for non-solar owners.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained its policy rate at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing concerns about the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on the country's economy. While headline inflation has remained above the BOJ's 2% target, providing room to raise rates, the central bank highlighted that Japan's growth is likely to moderate due to a slowdown in other economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits. The BOJ indicated that it will continue to raise its policy rate "if our economic and price forecasts are realised."</p>

Meta's advertising sales in the Asia-Pacific region reached $8.22 billion for the first quarter, falling short of Wall Street projections.
