          <p>Former President Donald Trump expressed skepticism about Vladimir Putin's intentions regarding the war in Ukraine, suggesting that the Russian leader might not be genuinely interested in ending the conflict. Trump voiced his frustration on Truth Social following a deadly Russian missile attack on Kyiv, which resulted in multiple casualties. He speculated that Putin might be prolonging the situation and hinted at employing financial measures or secondary sanctions as a potential response. This comes after Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Vatican.</p>

          <p>The United States and Iran held discussions in Oman concerning Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, focusing on uranium enrichment. These talks were described as serious and productive by both sides, with agreements to meet again soon in Europe, mediated by Omani officials. Simultaneously, a major explosion rocked a port in southern Iran, causing fatalities and injuries, though authorities have ruled out oil and gas involvement, but the blast is suspected to be linked to missile propellant materials. The ongoing negotiations aim to limit Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for lifting economic sanctions.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has recently deported a Cuban-born mother, separating her from her 1-year-old daughter, and a 2-year-old U.S. citizen along with her Honduran-born mother. These cases raise questions about deportation practices and come amid legal battles over immigration enforcement. Lawyers argue that their clients were arrested during routine check-ins and deported quickly, with limited access to legal counsel, prompting a federal judge to question the legality of the 2-year-old's deportation.</p>

          <p>Recent polls reveal a decline in Americans' faith in Donald Trump across various issues, with a majority describing his second term as "scary". Low ratings on the economy and immigration policy contribute to his historically low popularity for a leader early in their term. Even Republicans express doubts about Trump's priorities, and independent voters show particularly weak support. The polls highlight concerns about Trump's handling of the economy, trade, and presidential powers.</p>
