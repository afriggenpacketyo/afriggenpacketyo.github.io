          <p>Richard Tillman, the 44-year-old brother of the late NFL player and U.S. Army Ranger Pat Tillman, was arrested following a destructive fire at a San Jose post office. Authorities report that a vehicle crashed into the building and caught fire in what officials suspect may have been an intentional act. The incident required a significant firefighter response and has resulted in the post office being considered a total loss. Pat Tillman famously left his NFL career to enlist in the Army after 9/11 and was killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan in 2004.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament, a significant political setback following a similar defeat in the lower house last year. Public discontent over inflation, political scandals, and the rise of the right-wing populist Sanseito party contributed to the loss. Despite the defeat, which historically leads to resignation, Ishiba has vowed to remain in office to manage critical trade negotiations with the United States. This marks the first time since 1955 that the LDP has lost its majority in both houses.</p>

Macias was recaptured in June after a high-profile prison escape in January that prompted Ecuador's president to declare a state of "internal armed conflict."

          <p>President Trump has stated he may intervene to block a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in D.C. unless the NFL team reverts to its former name, the "Redskins."

The team dropped the name in 2020 after decades of criticism that it was a racist slur.

Experts point to a rise in vaccine hesitancy and misinformation following the COVID-19 pandemic as a key driver.

The project's initial ambition for world-leading speed and frequency also drove up costs and complexity.

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it will hold a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The 1984 incident involved thousands of police officers and striking miners clashing outside a coking plant in Rotherham, leading to numerous injuries and 95 arrests. The subsequent criminal cases against the miners collapsed amid allegations that police falsified evidence. Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for decades, expressed cautious elation at the announcement, which aims to finally address unanswered questions about the event and its aftermath.</p>

          <p>Following his victory at The Open, Scottie Scheffler is drawing comparisons to Tiger Woods for his dominant run in men's golf. Analysts and fellow players note his machine-like consistency and ability to win, with his peers calling him "the bar that we're all trying to get to." Since 2021, Scheffler has won four major championships and has shown an unerring ability to close out tournaments from a leading position. A key factor in his recent success has been a significant improvement in his putting after working with a new coach, transforming a previous weakness into a reliable strength.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to close the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's main scientific research arm. The ORD is responsible for analyzing environmental hazards and providing the scientific foundation for regulations on toxins, pollution, and climate change. The EPA stated the move is part of a broader downsizing to save money and will be accompanied by the creation of a new "Office of Applied Science." Critics, however, condemned the decision as a "travesty" that will cripple the agency's ability to use science to protect public health and the environment.</p>

          <p>Coldplay frontman Chris Martin jokingly advised concertgoers to "do your makeup now" before the band's "Jumbotron Song," during which cameras feature audience members on the big screens.

The two individuals were later identified as the CEO and chief people officer of the tech company Astronomer. In the fallout from the incident, the CEO has resigned from his position.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert, drawing on studies of over 200 parent-child relationships, argues that the most crucial skill to teach a child is "self-connection"—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and inner voice. The article suggests that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's fears or sadness, can inadvertently teach them not to trust their feelings. Fostering self-connection through validating emotions and allowing autonomy builds resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. This skill is presented as a powerful buffer against anxiety and a foundation for lifelong mental health.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller's nonprofit, Better Angels, is pioneering a new model to tackle the affordable housing crisis by building units without public subsidies. The initiative uses a for-profit investment fund to provide upfront capital, aiming to attract private developers by demonstrating that affordable housing can be profitable. By avoiding the slow, complex process of securing tax credits and government grants, this model can build faster and at a fraction of the typical cost. The goal is to prove that market-based solutions can significantly increase the supply of affordable housing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The long-delayed 9/11 trials have faced a major setback with the cancellation of plea deals that had been reached with the defendants, including alleged mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. The deals would have averted a death penalty trial in exchange for guilty pleas and life sentences. Legal experts suggest the manner in which the deals were overruled will spark new, lengthy litigation, further delaying any resolution. With the case now likely returning to years of pre-trial hearings, the prospect of achieving justice or closure for the victims' families remains distant and uncertain.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died from a "medical episode" after his heavy metallic necklace caused him to be violently pulled into a running MRI machine at a facility on New York's Long Island. The man's wife stated he was wearing a 20-pound chain used for weight training when she called him into the room for assistance after her scan. MRI machines use powerful magnets, and patients are strictly warned to remove all metal objects before entering the scanning room. This tragic incident highlights the extreme dangers associated with bringing magnetic materials near the powerful machines.</p>
