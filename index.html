        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump publicly pressured Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates following a disappointing ADP jobs report showing only 37,000 private-sector jobs added in May. Trump, posting on Truth Social, insisted Powell was "too late" and criticized his decision to keep rates steady, contrasting it with Europe's multiple rate cuts. This public urging follows previous confrontations, including a recent White House meeting where Trump voiced concerns about the U.S. being at an economic disadvantage compared to countries with lower interest rates. Powell has maintained that monetary policy decisions should be based on economic data, not political pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article discusses the importance of saving money and using savings accounts to build a financial safety net. The national average savings account interest rate is currently 0.42%, but high-yield savings accounts offer significantly higher rates, ranging from 4.10% to 4.40%. The article advises readers to choose high-yield savings accounts, especially those offered by online banks, and to compare different accounts to find the best rates and terms. The article emphasizes the benefits of online banks, which often have lower overhead costs and can offer better interest rates and lower fees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a policy reversal regarding the winter fuel payment, stating that more people will be eligible this year. The previous policy, which limited the payment to those receiving pension credit, was widely criticized for excluding millions of pensioners. While details of the changes and eligibility criteria remain unclear, the government intends to widen the threshold. This decision comes after Labour's poor local election results were partly attributed to the unpopular policy. The government plans to provide further clarity on the expanded payments soon, but a full announcement is expected later in the year.</p>

Stephen Witt, who interviewed Huang for his book, suggests that this anxiety and paranoia about competition drive Huang to work harder. Huang's constant drive contrasts with other CEOs, who Witt describes as more traditionally upbeat and optimistic. Witt notes that Huang becomes uncomfortable when things are going well, suggesting a deep-seated need to constantly push himself.</p>

The court also heard that Monzo broke into a home, attacked the residents while shouting about God, and later clashed with police while brandishing a sword.

Some MAGA voices, like Laura Loomer, accuse Trump of elevating Barrett as a "DEI Hire," while others express concerns about her conservative stance.

          <p>A recent attack in Boulder, Colorado, targeting a group supporting the release of hostages in Gaza, has heightened safety concerns among Jewish communities in the US. The incident, where the suspect allegedly planned to "kill all Zionist people," follows other attacks against Jewish individuals and institutions. Jewish organizations are expressing increased fear and anxiety, emphasizing that these hate crimes do not distinguish between political viewpoints on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Community leaders are calling for condemnation of antisemitism and emphasizing the need for safety and security.</p>
