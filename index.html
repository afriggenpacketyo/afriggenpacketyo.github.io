          <p>Following his death at age 91, industry experts are highlighting Giorgio Armani's dual legacy as both a revolutionary designer and a masterful business leader. Armani was celebrated for creating the "power suit," which redefined professional attire for both men and women, and for pioneering the use of celebrity endorsements on the red carpet. By maintaining full ownership of his multibillion-dollar empire, he ensured a consistent and sophisticated vision across all his brand extensions, from haute couture to home furnishings.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Newsmax's antitrust lawsuit against Fox News, labeling it an impermissible "shotgun complaint" for its structure. The suit alleged that Fox News engaged in monopolistic practices to suppress conservative media competitors. Judge Aileen Cannon's ruling allows Newsmax to refile an amended complaint by next week, making the dismissal a procedural setback rather than a final judgment on the merits of the case.</p>

The report also highlighted a widening unemployment gap for Black Americans and increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider further interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An employment tribunal in the UK has ruled that spending less than an hour of work time on personal online shopping is not a valid reason for dismissal. An accountancy administrator, who was fired after spyware tracked her browsing on sites like Amazon, was awarded over £14,000. The judge determined her personal use was not "excessive" and noted that the employer had no clear policy against it and that the business owner also used work computers for personal reasons.</p>

Norris expressed that the field was "a bit close for my liking," indicating a tight competition for the weekend's race.

          <p>A multi-agency federal operation resulted in the detention of 475 workers at a Hyundai electric vehicle battery plant construction site in Georgia. The raid, described as the largest single-site enforcement action in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, was part of an investigation into unlawful employment practices. The majority of those detained were Korean nationals, prompting concern from the South Korean government and criticism from labor groups who called the raid a politically motivated act that terrorizes immigrant workers.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has swelled to an estimated $1.8 billion, the second-largest in U.S. history, sparking a frenzy of ticket buying. This has provided a significant business boost for DraftKings, which owns the lottery courier app Jackpocket. The company reported that 15 million tickets have been ordered through the app during the current jackpot run, with sales increasing 130% in a single day this week. DraftKings views the acquisition of Jackpocket as a key strategy for cross-selling customers to its sports betting and gaming platforms.</p>

          <p>Following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly to 6.29%, its lowest point since October of the previous year. This 16-basis-point drop is the largest one-day decrease since August 2024, providing some relief to prospective homebuyers facing high property prices. A lower rate can reduce a monthly mortgage payment by a notable amount, though it remains uncertain if this decline will be substantial enough to reinvigorate housing market demand.
