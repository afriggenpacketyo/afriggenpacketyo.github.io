          <h2>IRS Clarifies That Churches Can Make Political Endorsements Without Losing Tax-Exempt Status</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 10:57:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant policy shift, the Internal Revenue Service has stated in a federal court filing that churches can endorse political candidates without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. This move effectively reinterprets the 70-year-old Johnson Amendment, which has historically barred such endorsements from non-profit organizations. The clarification came as part of a settlement in a lawsuit brought by religious broadcasters and churches who argued the amendment violated their First Amendment rights. A judge must still approve the settlement, which would permanently prevent the IRS from enforcing the rule against the plaintiff churches.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has nominated U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, highlighting their joint operation involving strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The nomination occurred during a meeting in Washington where the two leaders also discussed a potential 60-day ceasefire in the ongoing Gaza conflict. While both leaders expressed optimism that the Iran operation could stabilize the Middle East, Netanyahu also reiterated that a future Palestinian state must not have the power to threaten Israel. The nomination process is open, but the actual candidates remain secret for 50 years.</p>

The Football Association of Wales confirmed that all players and staff on the bus were unharmed. An ambulance attended to the driver of the other vehicle involved in the collision. As a result of the incident, the team's scheduled training session was cancelled, though head coach Rhian Wilkinson stated their priority was ensuring the well-being of everyone involved before reassessing their preparations for the upcoming match against France.</p>

          <p>The UK's state pension triple lock policy is projected to cost £15.5 billion annually by 2030, a figure three times higher than originally anticipated, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The triple lock guarantees the state pension rises each year by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%. The OBR's report highlights the UK's vulnerable public finances, noting that rising pension costs and recent reversals on spending cuts contribute to increasing government debt. Despite these warnings, the Labour government has committed to maintaining the policy for the current Parliament. (not investment advice)</p>

The academy will offer workshops, online courses, and hands-on training, with the goal of reaching 400,000 educators over the next five years.

Higher education experts warn this increased tax burden could force affected institutions, particularly top research universities, to raise tuition, cut financial aid, or implement other cost-saving measures.

          <p>The deadly Texas flash floods were caused by a confluence of factors, including the region's geography and a powerful weather system. The Texas Hill Country is naturally prone to flash flooding due to its rocky soil and steep terrain, which causes water to run off quickly. Meteorologists explain that remnant moisture from a tropical system combined with other weather patterns, dumping massive amounts of rain over a stationary area. This deluge caused the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes, leading to scrutiny over the adequacy and timing of emergency warnings.</p>

          <p>Nearly 600 tech industry figures have signed an open letter demanding that venture capital firm Sequoia Capital denounce controversial comments made by one of its partners, Shaun Maguire. Maguire posted on social media that Zohran Mamdani, a Muslim Democratic mayoral candidate in New York, comes from a "culture that lies" and is advancing an "Islamist agenda." The letter calls for Sequoia to condemn the remarks, apologize, and launch an investigation into Maguire's behavior. The incident highlights ongoing political tensions within the tech and venture capital community, where prominent figures hold sharply differing views.</p>

          <p>A memo from the Department of Justice and the FBI stating that no "client list" was found in the Jeffrey Epstein case has sparked indignation among right-wing influencers. For years, many have promoted the conspiracy theory that such a list existed and was being used for blackmail. The memo clarified that while the government holds extensive evidence, none of it constitutes a client list or could be used to prosecute uncharged third parties. This finding has led to accusations from some conservative figures that the federal government is protecting powerful individuals, fueling further distrust.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court order in Department of Homeland Security v. D. V. D. has drawn sharp criticism for its lack of any written justification. The 6-3 decision lifted a lower court's injunction, allowing the Trump administration to deport individuals to third countries without a hearing to assess their fear of torture. Justice Sonia Sotomayor's dissent condemned the majority for rewarding the administration's defiance of a court order and eroding the rule of law. Critics argue that by failing to provide reasoning, the Court is acting more like a political body than a judicial one, undermining its own legitimacy.</p>

          <p>The R&A, organizers of The Open Championship, are considering moving up the tee times for the third round to mitigate disruption from a large loyalist parade planned in Portrush. The parade, involving over 60 bands, is scheduled to start shortly after play would typically conclude, raising concerns about significant congestion for the thousands of spectators leaving Royal Portrush. Organizers had previously requested the parade be rescheduled, but the request was denied. Any change to the schedule would be notable, though it may be limited by live television broadcast commitments in the United States.</p>

          <p>A Harvard study published in Nature Medicine suggests that adopting a plant-based diet in middle age can significantly increase the likelihood of healthy aging. The 30-year study followed over 100,000 participants and found that those who closely followed the Alternative Healthy Eating Index—which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts—had up to an 86% greater chance of being free of chronic diseases at age 70. The research indicates that dietary patterns rich in plant-based foods, with moderate inclusion of healthy animal products, are key to enhancing long-term wellness and cognitive health.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of articles has raised alarms about a "literacy crisis" among American youth, but the reality is nuanced. While every generation tends to complain about the next, data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) does show a decade-long decline in reading scores, particularly among lower-achieving students, a trend that predates the pandemic. However, experts are divided on the cause and solution, with some pointing to flawed teaching methods and others to the rise of screen time. Critics also argue that standardized tests fail to capture the complex digital literacy skills today's students possess.</p>

It will scrutinize his history, including previous threats, weapon purchases, and referrals to the counter-extremism program.

          <p>President Donald Trump is intensifying his stance against the BRICS economic bloc, viewing its efforts to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar as a threat to American economic supremacy. He has threatened additional tariffs on nations supporting the group's "anti-American policies." While the bloc, which has expanded to include new members like Indonesia, is actively promoting trade in local currencies, ambitions for a common currency have stalled due to internal divisions. Analysts note that while BRICS is growing, its institutional cohesion and ability to truly challenge the dollar's dominance remain limited for now. (not investment advice)</p>

Officials attribute this surge in volunteerism partly to the ongoing war in Ukraine, which has motivated many young people to serve. Despite the increase, the Bundeswehr faces a personnel shortage and is aiming to recruit up to 60,000 additional soldiers to meet NATO demands. To boost numbers, the defense minister plans to make military service more attractive and will soon require all 18-year-old men to complete a questionnaire about their willingness to serve.</p>
