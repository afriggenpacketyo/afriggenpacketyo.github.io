        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security, under the Trump administration, has intensified its conflict with sanctuary states like California, New York, and Illinois. The agency sent letters demanding these states honor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainers, which request local jails hold undocumented migrants for federal custody. Following non-compliance, the administration is threatening to involve the Department of Justice to sue the states and potentially cut off federal funding. Supporters of sanctuary policies argue they foster trust between police and immigrant communities, while the administration claims they endanger public safety by releasing criminals.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial planning experts are advising car buyers to use the "20-4-10" rule as a guideline to ensure their vehicle purchase is affordable and financially sound. This framework suggests making a down payment of at least 20% of the car's price, financing the vehicle with a loan term no longer than four years, and keeping total monthly transportation costs under 10% of one's income. Following this rule helps reduce overall interest payments, prevents consumers from owing more than the car is worth, and maintains a healthy budget for other financial goals. The article notes that while the rule is a strong guideline, it can be challenging to meet in the current market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her upcoming book, former Vice President Kamala Harris recounts a phone call from then-President Joe Biden just before her pivotal debate with Donald Trump. Harris describes feeling 'angry and disappointed' as Biden reportedly expressed concern that powerful figures in Philadelphia might not support her due to her perceived criticism of him. She writes that the call felt self-centered and distracted her at a critical moment, adding to the tensions within their political relationship. The book also reveals her initial preference for Pete Buttigieg as a running mate and reflects on the 'recklessness' of leaving the 2024 nomination decision solely to Biden's personal ambition.</p>

          <p>Israeli airstrikes in Gaza City have resulted in the deaths of at least 14 people overnight, according to Palestinian health officials. One strike on a home killed six members of a single family, who were relatives of a local hospital's director. The attacks come as Israel continues its offensive and urges civilians to evacuate to a southern humanitarian zone, exacerbating an already dire situation with widespread displacement and famine conditions. Aid organizations are pleading for a ceasefire, a need highlighted by a recent incident where armed individuals stole a UNICEF shipment of therapeutic food intended for malnourished children.</p>

          <p>Sacramento police have arrested a 64-year-old man in connection with a drive-by shooting that targeted the ABC10 television station building. The incident occurred Friday afternoon when multiple rounds were fired at the building, striking a window but causing no injuries to employees. Authorities identified the suspect after locating the vehicle believed to be involved in the shooting and arrested him on charges including assault with a deadly weapon and shooting into an occupied building. The motive remains under investigation, and the event has drawn condemnation from public officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, as an attack on democracy and journalism.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece draws a historical parallel between the Nazi's use of the 1933 Reichstag fire and the Trump administration's reaction to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The author argues that just as the Nazis blamed communists for the fire to justify a massive crackdown on civil liberties, the Trump administration immediately blamed the 'Radical left' to instigate repression against political opponents. The article details actions taken by the administration, such as threatening media outlets and vowing to dismantle non-profit networks it deems hostile. While acknowledging significant differences between Weimar Germany and the modern U.S., the author warns that the event is being used as a pretext to consolidate power and suppress dissent.</p>

          <p>In his new book, "Breakneck," analyst Dan Wang presents a provocative paradigm for understanding the dynamics between the United States and China, contrasting America's 'lawyerly society' with China's 'engineering state.' He argues that while China's system, dominated by engineers, has led to rapid infrastructure development and manufacturing prowess, it often prioritizes national power over individual happiness. Wang suggests the U.S. could learn from China's physical dynamism to address its own stagnation in areas like housing and clean technology. However, he also criticizes the engineering state's role in creating high youth unemployment by cracking down on service-oriented tech industries.</p>

Sultana, who alleges she was sidelined by a 'sexist boys' club,' maintains the portal's creation was aligned with the party's agreed-upon roadmap.

          <p>Estonia has formally requested Article 4 consultations with its NATO allies after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace over the Gulf of Finland. The Russian aircraft, which had their transponders off and no flight plan, remained in Estonian airspace for 12 minutes before being escorted out by Italian F-35s. Russia has denied the incursion, but the incident marks the second time this month a NATO member has invoked Article 4 due to Russian actions.

Kershaw is credited with being the franchise's guiding light, leading the team through a period of turmoil and bankruptcy to an era of sustained excellence and multiple championships. His career, marked by three Cy Young Awards and one of the lowest ERAs in modern baseball history, bridged the gap between the team's difficult years and its current superstar-laden roster. On the night following his announcement, the Dodgers clinched their 13th consecutive postseason berth, a testament to the winning culture Kershaw was instrumental in building.</p>

Scientists collected and analyzed fungi from dying buckthorn plants, identifying 46 species as potential candidates for a mycoherbicide, a fungus-based biological control agent. This represents an important first step toward developing a targeted method to eliminate buckthorn without the negative consequences of chemical herbicides or the difficulty of manual removal. Further studies are needed to test the pathogenicity of these fungi and select the most effective species for widespread use.</p>

The port argues that raising the bridge by 26 feet, at an additional cost of $1.5 billion, is necessary to accommodate the next generation of larger cargo ships and maintain competitiveness. However, this would extend the bridge's closure from 16 months to 28 months, rerouting truck traffic through residential areas and impacting local businesses and tourism in San Pedro and Long Beach.

          <h2>Data Shows Significant Drop in Calls to Los Angeles Police Following Summer ICE Raids</h2>

          <p>An analysis of emergency dispatch data reveals that calls for service to the Los Angeles Police Department fell sharply during the summer, coinciding with a period of intensified federal immigration enforcement. In the two weeks after the raids began, calls dropped by 28% compared to the previous year, with a notable decrease in reports of domestic violence. This decline fuels long-standing concerns among advocates that aggressive immigration policies deter immigrant communities from reporting crimes for fear of deportation. Despite LAPD's efforts to reassure the public that it does not enforce civil immigration laws, the data suggests a crisis of trust is impacting public safety.</p>

          <p>Angel Minguela Palacios, a strawberry delivery driver, was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents in Los Angeles after he was caught in a show of force surrounding a political news conference. Detained for overstaying a tourist visa, he spent six days in a temporary processing center under harsh conditions before being transferred to a facility in Arizona. His lawyer described him as 'political, collateral damage' in the heightened immigration enforcement environment. After his employer paid a $1,500 bond, Minguela was released and emotionally reunited with his family, though he still faces a legal battle to avoid removal from the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion column expresses concern that ongoing media consolidation, exemplified by recent acquisitions like Skydance buying Paramount, threatens the foundation of free speech and a competitive market. The author draws a parallel to the pre-1984 AT&T monopoly, which stifled innovation in telecommunications until it was broken up. The piece argues that when a few conglomerates control the flow of information, the public is left with an illusion of choice, similar to how ancient Rome's republic declined into a repressive empire. This centralization of power in the hands of a few private citizens undermines the vigorous debate necessary for a healthy democracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the Democratic Republic of Congo, edible insects like caterpillars and palm weevil larvae are not just a traditional delicacy but also a vital source of protein for millions. Sold in bustling markets in the capital, Kinshasa, these insects are consumed fried, spiced, or with staple foods, and are valued for being organic and rich in nutrients. As conventional meat is often unaffordable, insects provide a sustainable alternative, with some research suggesting their consumption has increased due to economic hardship and environmental degradation. NGOs are now working to commercialize insect farming to improve food security for vulnerable populations, such as orphans.</p>

          <p>Massive protests, largely organized and led by Gen Z activists, have forced the resignation of Nepal's prime minister and led to the appointment of the country's first female leader, Sushila Karki. The turmoil was ignited by public anger over systemic government corruption and high unemployment, which was amplified by a social media campaign exposing the lavish lifestyles of politicians' families. When the government suspended most social media platforms, thousands took to the streets, resulting in violent clashes that left over 70 people dead. The upheaval reflects a broader trend of youth-driven movements across South Asia challenging established political orders.</p>

          <p>Athletes competing at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, including British 800m champion Keely Hodgkinson, have raised concerns about the logistical challenges posed by the event's warm-up facilities. The main warm-up area is located two and a half kilometers from the main stadium, requiring a 15-minute bus journey about an hour before competition, which some athletes find 'draining.' World Athletics President Lord Coe acknowledged the situation is 'not perfect,' explaining that the track used during the Olympics was no longer available. Organizers maintain they have done everything possible to manage the transport and logistics under the circumstances.</p>

          <p>Syria is conducting its first parliamentary elections following decades of dictatorship, but the process is indirect and fraught with controversy. Instead of a public vote, members of an 'electoral college' will choose 121 parliamentarians, with these electors themselves being appointed by sub-committees. Critics, including minority groups and civil society organizations, have called the process a 'charade' designed to legitimize the transitional government. A major point of contention is that the interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, will directly appoint an additional 70 members, giving him significant control over the new assembly and making it difficult for any opposition to challenge his decrees.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is set to implement a significant change in its media policy, requiring journalists to sign a pledge that restricts their information-gathering activities. Under the new rule, reporters must agree not to collect any information, even unclassified material, unless it has been officially authorized for release by the Department of Defense. According to U.S. officials, journalists who refuse to sign the pledge or violate its terms will have their press credentials revoked. This would effectively cut off their access to the Pentagon, the headquarters of the largest department within the U.S. government, raising concerns about press freedom and transparency.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing a new $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers. The administration cited 'abuse' of the program as the reason for the drastic fee increase, which is intended to compel companies to hire American workers first. The move has been criticized by immigration lawyers and business groups, who argue it will price out small businesses and startups, harming U.S. competitiveness in the tech sector and other industries. Major tech companies, which are the largest beneficiaries of the program, have advised employees currently abroad to return to the U.S. before the order takes effect.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is facing class-action lawsuits in multiple states from employees who claim the company's new, stricter dress code has forced them to purchase new clothing without reimbursement. The policy, implemented in May, requires specific solid-colored shirts and bottoms, effectively making much of the workers' previous wardrobes unusable for their shifts. While the company provided two free shirts, employees argue this was insufficient and that forcing them to bear the cost violates state labor laws. The lawsuits in Illinois and Colorado, along with a formal complaint in California, seek repayment for these out-of-pocket expenses.</p>

          <p>The death of a young pygmy sperm whale off the coast of Honduras is being highlighted by conservationists as a tragic example of plastic pollution's impact on marine life. The whale, which was the first of its species confirmed in the area, was found in distress after repeatedly beaching itself. A necropsy revealed an 11-inch plastic bag lodged in its stomach, which likely contributed to a fatal digestive blockage. The incident is particularly concerning because pygmy sperm whales are rarely sighted, making the loss of even a single animal a significant event that underscores the widespread and deadly threat plastic waste poses to ocean ecosystems.</p>

To break free, he advises strategies such as limiting contact, reframing positive daydreams into negative 'daymares,' and focusing on new personal goals. The key is to recognize the obsession is an internal mental state that can be managed and overcome.</p>
