          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's claims of fighting antisemitism are insincere and merely a pretext to attack liberal institutions. The author points to Trump's history of associating with antisemites, such as Kanye West and Nick Fuentes, and his administration's attacks on academia. The author suggests that some people are being deceived by Trump's claims, despite his administration's mainstreaming of antisemitism.</p>
