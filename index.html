          <p>Bitcoin experienced a slight price increase, moving back above the $111,000 mark, while the broader stock market faced a downturn. This occurred as gold prices surged to a new all-time high of around $3,500, driven by its traditional role as a safe-haven asset during times of geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Market analysts suggest that while Bitcoin benefits from similar themes, its recent performance has been partially dampened by a significant rotation of investment into Ethereum.

          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction preventing the Trump administration from deploying military forces, including the National Guard, for domestic law enforcement activities in California. The ruling by Judge Charles Breyer found that the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a law that restricts the military's involvement in civilian affairs. While the decision is currently limited to California and has been temporarily stayed to allow for an appeal, the judge warned that such actions could lead to the creation of a "national police force with the President as its chief."</p>

          <p>Elias Morgan, an armed robber, has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 45 years for the murder of prison officer Lenny Scott. The court determined the killing was a "revenge execution" planned for four years after Scott confiscated a mobile phone from Morgan's cell, which exposed an illicit relationship with a female officer. The judge described the crime as a cold-blooded assassination of a man who was performing his lawful duty, causing profound grief to his family and young children.</p>

This move aligns with a growing consumer trend toward protein-fortified foods and drinks, a market that has seen significant expansion in recent years as major brands seek to capitalize on the demand for perceived health benefits.</p>

          <p>Graham Linehan, co-creator of the comedy series "Father Ted," was arrested at Heathrow Airport upon his arrival from the United States on suspicion of inciting violence through his posts on the social media platform X. After his arrest, he was taken to a hospital due to health concerns but has since been bailed with the condition that he does not use X. The arrest is reportedly related to three posts from April concerning his views on transgender individuals in female-only spaces, and he faces a separate charge of harassment.</p>

The 30-year bond yield surpassed 4.97%, and the 10-year yield rose to 4.275%, contributing to a substantial downturn in the stock market as investors weighed the economic implications.

          <p>A booster and gambler named Brett Steigh has publicly admitted to paying parents to transfer their children to play for the football programs at three Southern California high schools: Narbonne, St. Bernard, and Bishop Montgomery. In a podcast interview, Steigh claimed responsibility for the recruiting violations that led to sanctions against Narbonne and the shutdown of St. Bernard's program. His admission comes as Bishop Montgomery faces an investigation from the Southern Section and the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, with Steigh stating, "It was all me."</p>

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a prominent New York Democrat, has announced he will not seek re-election in 2026, ending a 34-year career in Congress. The 78-year-old lawmaker stated his decision was influenced by the need for generational change within the Democratic party, a lesson he said was highlighted by Joe Biden's unsuccessful presidential bid. Nadler, who played a key role in both of Donald Trump's impeachments as chair of the House Judiciary Committee, suggested other aging Democrats should also consider stepping aside for new leadership.</p>

          <p>In her upcoming memoir, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett defends the court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, arguing that the ruling "respected the choice" of the American people by returning the issue of abortion to the states. Barrett, a key conservative vote in the landmark case, writes that the court's role is not to dictate what people should agree on but to uphold the choices they have made through their elected representatives. Her comments are expected to generate significant public debate, as polling indicates a majority of Americans support legal abortion access.</p>

          <p>The Utah Supreme Court has issued a stay of execution for Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old death row inmate who was scheduled to be executed by firing squad. The court's decision came after Menzies' attorneys argued that his severe dementia renders him incompetent and unable to understand the reason for his punishment, which would make his execution unconstitutional. The case has been sent back to a lower court to reevaluate his mental fitness, a ruling that acknowledges the suffering of the victim's family but emphasizes adherence to the rule of law.</p>

Polanski, a 42-year-old London Assembly member, defeated two of the party's sitting MPs with a platform focused on more confrontational communication and a decisive shift to the left. His unconventional background and support for radical policies like a Universal Basic Income signal a new direction for the party as it aims to build on its recent electoral successes and connect with a broader range of voters.</p>

          <p>Researchers with the USDA are experimenting with an unconventional method to protect cattle from gray wolves: drones equipped with loudspeakers that blast sounds like AC/DC music and clips from films. The project, taking place near the California-Oregon border, aims to haze the predators by using novel and startling noises to interrupt their hunts without causing physical harm. While the technique has shown initial success in scaring wolves away, questions remain about its long-term effectiveness and practicality for ranchers, given the high cost and operational challenges of the technology.</p>

The new maps are already facing legal challenges, with civil rights groups in Texas alleging racial bias and California's plan requiring voter approval.</p>
