        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary magnitude 4.1 earthquake struck parts of Tennessee, Georgia, and North Carolina on Saturday morning, centered near Greenback, Tennessee. Residents in Atlanta and western North Carolina reported feeling the tremors, with over 23,000 reports received by the USGS within the first hour. While there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries, the event served as a reminder of earthquake preparedness for residents in the Eastern Tennessee seismic zone. The article notes that earthquakes are not uncommon in this region, and seismic waves travel more efficiently in the Eastern U.S. due to its geology, allowing the earthquake to be felt over a larger distance.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his memoir "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller discusses his career and the importance of instinct over data in decision-making. Diller recounts his time at ABC, where he popularized the made-for-TV "Movie of the Week," emphasizing that predicting the public's appetite is impossible and that data can harm instinct. He shares stories of greenlighting successful projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker" based on gut feeling, highlighting the value of simple human instinct overreliance on structured information and MBA-style analysis. Diller argues that too much information can obscure the essence of a good idea.</p>

          <p>At least seven people died in Mogadishu, Somalia, after heavy rains overwhelmed the city's drainage system, leading to severe flooding. Major roads were cut off, and nine houses collapsed due to the intense rainfall, which lasted about eight hours. Rescue efforts are ongoing, with concerns that the death toll could rise, and some residents were trapped, while others were forced to move to higher ground. The floodwaters also damaged key infrastructure, temporarily disrupting operations at Aden Abdulle International Airport, and warnings of flash floods have been issued for other regions outside the capital.</p>

          <p>After an escalation of their most expansive conflict in decades, India and Pakistan agreed on Saturday to halt the fighting, but reports of violence continued. The cease-fire agreement, which came after four days of missile, drone, and artillery strikes, was first announced by President Trump, who cited the role of the United States as a mediator, but India disputed that claim. The conflict began after militants killed 26 people in a tourist area on the Indian side of Kashmir last month, with India accusing Pakistan of involvement, which Pakistan denied.

          <p>In "The Afterlife of Malcolm X," journalist Mark Whitaker examines the lasting influence of Malcolm X, focusing on Spike Lee's 1992 biopic. The excerpt details the artistic choices made during the film's production, such as recreating Roxbury in Brooklyn and filming the assassination scene with haunting dialogue, music, and camera work. Denzel Washington's portrayal aimed to convey Malcolm's premonition of his death, using techniques like the "double dolly shot" and a subtle expression of relief upon seeing his assassin. The article highlights Lee's efforts to capture Malcolm's fatalistic state of mind and the impact of his martyrdom.</p>

He stated that he would rather donate to HBCUs and rebuild houses in his hometown than contribute to the "cesspool" of college athletics, questioning the return on investment for NIL funds given the short tenure of players at colleges.</p>

          <p>Climate change is altering bird migration by affecting their food sources and resting places, leading to shorter routes or abandonment of original habitats. Rising sea levels and ocean acidification impact crustaceans, a vital food source, while extreme weather events pose direct threats to migratory birds. Warmer temperatures reduce food scarcity, prompting changes in migration behavior, potentially causing conflicts with resident animals. The article emphasizes the importance of protected areas and bird-friendly environments to mitigate these effects and preserve the crucial role migratory birds play in maintaining ecosystem health and food security.</p>

          <p>A Soviet space probe launched in 1972, Kosmos 482, reentered Earth's atmosphere and crashed into the Indian Ocean after failing to reach Venus. The probe, part of the Venera program, was intended to deliver a lander to study Venus's surface and atmosphere, but a technical mishap prevented it from leaving Earth's orbit. Roscosmos reported that the spacecraft reentered the atmosphere and hit the ocean west of Jakarta, Indonesia. Russia plans to launch a new mission to Venus, Venera-D, continuing the Soviet-era program.</p>

Miran stated that the president has acted with historic scope and speed to put American workers on fairer ground vis-Ã -vis trading partners. He also discussed the administration's deregulation drive to encourage firms to produce more and address the housing shortage. Miran believes that higher growth will make up revenue, supporting the administration's commitment to lowering deficits while also implementing tax cuts and a robust defense budget.</p>
