          <p>The UK government plans to end the recruitment of care workers from abroad, aiming to reduce net migration by up to 50,000 lower-skilled workers over the next year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that firms will be required to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country. The government also intends to raise the threshold for skilled visas and introduce new training commitments to boost domestic labor participation. The new rules will require care companies to prove they attempted to recruit a worker from within England first before hiring from abroad.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed reservations about cutting the consumption tax to alleviate inflation, citing concerns about the significant reduction in state revenue. While senior officials in his administration and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have been hesitant about lowering the consumption tax, currently at 8% for food and beverages and 10% for other items, the coalition government is considering an economic package in anticipation of the House of Councillors election this summer. The government is trying to balance addressing inflation with maintaining fiscal stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration promotes expanding consumer choices while simultaneously restricting political liberties, marking a shift in the traditional understanding of freedom. While advocating for deregulation to offer more consumer options, Trump limits options in the political sphere, such as imposing restrictions on academic curricula and personal expression. This approach, also seen in other illiberal democracies, creates a disconnect between economic and political life, with consumer choice being prioritized over other forms of freedom. The article suggests this trend represents a new form of authoritarianism that emphasizes consumerism while curtailing civil and political rights.</p>

Her nomination highlights the influence of health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr in the administration, who champions the "Make America Health Again" movement.

His bullying and lack of remorse while slashing federal spending eroded his popularity, and a failed political donation in Wisconsin further diminished his standing.

          <p>The Trump administration is significantly reducing American efforts to promote democracy abroad by dismantling the Agency for Global Media, restructuring the State Department, and cutting funding to USAID. This shift marks a departure from decades of bipartisan foreign policy aimed at spreading democratic ideals and countering authoritarian governments. Experts warn that these actions will create a vacuum, embolden U.S. competitors like Russia and China, and accelerate anti-democratic trends worldwide.

This anti-Ukrainian stance also serves as a declaration of loyalty to Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump, as Orban has close economic and financial ties with Russia.

          <p>Pakistan's Chinese-made weapons have demonstrated strength against India's Western and Russian arms in their conflict over Kashmir, but analysts caution that it is too early to determine which side's technology will ultimately prevail in combat. Tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors escalated following India's military strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered parts of Kashmir in response to a terrorist attack. India reportedly deployed its fighter jet fleets, including French-made Rafale jets, while Pakistan claimed to have shot down several Indian aircraft, including Rafales, though India has not confirmed these claims.</p>

          <p>A family who lost their home in the Palisades Fire decided to relocate to Spain due to their growing dismay with the political climate in the United States under the Trump administration. The couple, who had planned to rebuild their dream home, reconsidered their decision, citing concerns about the country's increasing authoritarianism and the vision of America promoted by the ruling party. Despite the privilege of having the option to move, the family felt it was more prudent to leave and watch the chaos from abroad, hoping to return to rebuild their home when the political climate improves.</p>

          <p>A growing number of American parents are building their family lives around friendships, seeking support and community in a country that lacks structural support for families. This involves creating villages of chosen families, where friends live close to one another and share child-care responsibilities. While it requires coordination and can lead to conflicts, this approach offers much-needed support and deeper friendships, challenging the traditional notion of isolated nuclear families. By embracing alloparenting and remixing tradition, these families are finding innovative ways to navigate the challenges of parenthood.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that nearly half of Americans engage in disaster preparedness, driven by a combination of self-reliance and distrust in government response. This trend, extending beyond extreme preppers, reflects a deep-seated American ethos of self-sufficiency, particularly in the face of extreme weather events and potential societal collapse. While the ultra-wealthy invest in elaborate bunkers and escapes, middle-class Americans increasingly turn to shelf-stable food and preparedness kits, highlighting the growing market for disaster readiness and the shifting dynamics of personal responsibility in a changing world.</p>
