          <p>The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to its second-lowest level on record, driven by rising inflation expectations linked to tariffs. The index dropped to 50.8 in May, reflecting growing consumer worries about the impact of trade policies on prices. Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 7.3%, while long-term expectations increased to 4.6%. The survey indicated that tariffs were a significant concern for consumers, although a subsequent pause on tariffs between the U.S. and China may improve sentiment when the final index is released.</p>

President Sheinbaum has also criticized the plan, warning that it would damage both nations' economies.

          <p>Hadi Matar, the man convicted of stabbing Salman Rushdie in 2022, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison. The attack left Rushdie with severe injuries, including blindness in one eye. Matar, who was found guilty of attempted murder and assault, made a statement before sentencing calling Rushdie a hypocrite. The District Attorney emphasized the premeditated nature of the attack, while the defense argued for a lesser sentence. Matar still faces a federal trial on terrorism-related charges.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have approved changes to a bill that would allow terminally ill adults to seek help to end their own lives, specifically allowing health staff to opt out of the assisted dying process. The legislation has undergone scrutiny and amendments, including preventing medical staff from initially raising the option of assisted dying with patients. Supporters argue the bill has been strengthened, while opponents express concerns about potential coercion and the need for improved end-of-life care. Further debate and voting on additional changes are scheduled for June 13.</p>

          <p>A rare clue at a 1993 Minneapolis crime sceneâ€”bloody, bare footprintsâ€”helped solve the murder of Jeanie Childs. The footprints, along with DNA evidence, eventually led investigators to Jerry Westrom, who was convicted of the crime. Forensic scientists used investigative genetic genealogy to identify Westrom as a suspect. Despite Westrom's denial of involvement, his DNA and footprints matched those found at the scene. The case highlights the importance of forensic evidence in solving cold cases.</p>

The Penn Wharton Budget Model found that many Americans making less than $51,000 a year would see their after-tax income fall as a result of the Republican proposal beginning in 2026, due to spending cuts on programs like Medicaid and food stamps. The top 0.1 percent, however, would gain significantly. The legislation would extend tax cuts passed in 2017.</p>
