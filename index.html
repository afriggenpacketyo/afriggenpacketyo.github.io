        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate Finance Committee's version of the "big, beautiful bill" has set the stage for a potential clash with the House, as several Senate Republicans are raising concerns about the legislation. Key sticking points include the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, Medicaid provisions, and the debt limit increase. While the Senate bill keeps the SALT cap at $10,000, the House bill offers deductions up to $40,000 for those making less than $500,000 annually. The Senate legislation would also lower healthcare provider taxes in states that expanded Medicaid, potentially increasing the burden on those states. (not investment advice) The legislative process could be difficult, given the narrow margins in both chambers. The current environment appears to be relatively stable, but the possibility of increased conflict is present. The current state of affairs indicates a need for careful negotiation and compromise to ensure the bill's passage.</p>

          <p>Israel attacked Iranian state television and warned residents of Tehran to evacuate, marking an escalation in the conflict between the two nations. The strike followed another wave of Iranian missiles targeting Israel, resulting in civilian casualties. President Trump stated that Iran "should have signed the 'deal' I told them to sign" and urged the evacuation of Tehran, while the U.S. State Department raised its travel advisory for Israel to the highest level. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the deployment of additional capabilities to the United States Central Command Area of Responsibility to enhance defensive posture. The ongoing conflict has led to the cancellation of nuclear program talks and heightened tensions in the region. The current situation is highly volatile, with potential for further escalation.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump made little progress in bridging gaps over tariffs at their summit, casting doubt on a quick trade deal. Ishiba emphasized that any potential agreement should serve the interests of both nations, and ministerial talks will continue. The auto sector, critical to the Japanese economy, is a major point of contention due to a 25% tariff on autos. Trump's "America First" agenda and use of tariffs have raised concerns about imbalanced trade and the impact on Japan's export-driven economy. (not investment advice) Despite ongoing negotiations, the two leaders remain apart on key aspects of a comprehensive trade package, and the summit offered little indication of an imminent resolution. The economic outlook seems uncertain, with potential impacts on both nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump is cutting short his trip to Canada for the G7 summit due to escalating tensions in the Middle East, specifically the conflict between Israel and Iran. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt cited "what's going on in the Middle East" as the reason for the president's early return to Washington. During his time at the summit, Trump stated he had "spoken to everybody" regarding Israel and Iran and affirmed awareness of messages from Iran indicating a desire to de-escalate. The president's decision to return early underscores the gravity of the situation in the Middle East, even as diplomatic efforts continue. The geopolitical landscape is unstable and rapidly evolving.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has incurred nearly $20 million in police costs and other expenses in response to protests over federal immigration raids, according to the city's top budget analyst. The Los Angeles Police Department has spent $16.9 million, including $11.7 million for overtime, while repairs to City Hall and other city buildings cost $780,601. Protests have been ongoing since immigration agents raided a fast-fashion warehouse on June 6, with some demonstrations turning violent. The additional costs from the protests will further strain L.A.'s already-shaky finances. A group representing reporters has also sued the LAPD over its treatment of media during the protests, alleging violations of constitutional and state rights.</p>

          <p>In response to immigration raids by masked federal officers, California lawmakers have proposed a bill to ban law enforcement from concealing their faces while on duty. The bill aims to increase transparency and accountability by requiring officers to wear visible identification, with exceptions for SWAT teams and medical reasons. Critics argue that the bill would endanger law enforcement officers by making them easily identifiable and vulnerable to retaliation. Supporters, however, assert that the bill is necessary to prevent law enforcement from resembling an "occupying army" disconnected from the community. The debate highlights the ongoing tension between law enforcement tactics and community trust. The bill seeks to strike a balance between transparency and officer safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is increasing its focus on arms exports, driven by security concerns and a desire to deepen ties with allies. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has signaled a sharper focus on the defense sector, aiming to improve interoperability with allies and develop Japan's defense industrial base. By exporting arms, Japan can standardize maintenance processes and create joint training opportunities, strengthening cooperation with Western countries. The move also aims to revitalize the domestic defense industry, which has suffered from limited demand and reliance on U.S. weapons purchases. Japan's shift reflects a broader trend of rising global defense spending and a need to ensure its own security in a changing geopolitical landscape. This development suggests a move towards a more assertive role in international security.</p>

          <p>The Church of England has apologized to three sisters who reported historical child sexual assault claims, acknowledging its failure to take action. The sisters reported being abused by their father, a female church warden, and a male curate in "sadistic rituals" at a church. An independent review found that the Church's inaction "compounded" the women's trauma, and Cleveland Police "missed opportunities" to investigate. The Church acknowledged that its response "fell short of today's standards," and the police apologized for missed opportunities. The findings are deeply disturbing and reflect a systemic failure to protect vulnerable individuals. The Church is committed to implementing changes to ensure a safer environment.</p>

          <p>Social media and video networks have become the primary source of news in the US, surpassing traditional TV channels and news websites, according to research from the Reuters Institute. More than half (54%) of people now get their news from platforms like Facebook, X, and YouTube. The rise of social media and personality-based news presents a challenge for traditional publishers. The report also highlighted a trend for some politicians to give their time to sympathetic online hosts rather than mainstream interviewers. While online influencers and personalities are popular, they are also named as a major source of false or misleading information. The shift towards social media as a news source has both positive and negative implications for the dissemination of information.</p>

          <p>A coalition of press rights organizations is suing the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) over its treatment of journalists during protests related to President Trump's immigration crackdown. The lawsuit alleges that officers have been firing foam projectiles at members of the media and violating state laws protecting journalists covering unrest. The suit cites instances of journalists being shot with less-lethal rounds, tear-gassed, and detained without cause. The plaintiffs seek a court order to stop the "continuing abuse" of journalists and ensure their constitutional and statutory rights are respected. The legal action underscores the importance of press freedom and the need for law enforcement to respect the rights of journalists.</p>

Several cities across the Southeast were counting on BRIC funds to avoid a repeat of past storm destruction. The Trump administration's decision to cancel the BRIC program has left projects in flux, with cities struggling to find backup funding sources. FEMA said it would coordinate with applicants whose projects were underway, but some cities have not received any communication from the agency. The cuts to the storm prep program have raised concerns about the ability of communities to protect themselves from future disasters. The impact on these communities is a cause for concern.</p>

However, the meeting appears unlikely to go ahead after the White House said Trump was leaving the summit early due to developments in the Middle East.

The Justice Department emphasizes that threatening elected officials undermines democracy. The legal system will take its course.</p>

          <p>Eduardo Sarabia was sentenced to more than 25 years in prison for sexual assaults that took place in Angeles National Forest. Sarabia lured women with the promise of a camping trip to the forest, then assaulted them in a van that he had specially outfitted for sexual crimes. The van contained a stained mattress, condoms, children's toys, ropes and miscellaneous household items. Multiple victims were prepared to testify against Sarabia before he pleaded no contest to all charges. The sentencing brings closure to the victims and ensures that Sarabia will be held accountable for his crimes. The justice system has done its part.</p>
