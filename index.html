          <p>Federal immigration enforcement operations took place across Los Angeles, resulting in the arrest of approximately 44 individuals and sparking citywide protests. The raids targeted locations in the Westlake District, downtown L.A., and South L.A., with federal agents executing search warrants related to harboring undocumented immigrants. Protesters gathered in downtown Los Angeles, leading to clashes with law enforcement and the use of less-than-lethal rounds to disperse the crowd. City officials and community leaders have condemned the operations, expressing concerns about the impact on immigrant communities and vowing to resist such actions.</p>

          <p>Arrests for illegal work in the UK have doubled in the past year as police target employers exploiting undocumented migrants. Immigration officers arrested over 6,400 people during raids at more than 9,000 businesses, including restaurants, nail bars, and construction sites. These businesses often subject migrants to poor conditions, illegal working hours, and below-minimum wages. The government aims to tighten work visas and address overstaying to crack down on illegal migration, while also claiming to have returned nearly 30,000 people who did not have the right to be in the UK.</p>

Rivera was rushed to the hospital, but died after the police vehicle caught fire due to a mechanical issue, requiring her transfer to another vehicle. The incident is under investigation by CPD and the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, and the officer's partner is facing the loss of a fellow CPD family member.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow US colleges to pay athletes millions of dollars, marking a significant shift in college sports history. The agreement allows schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and provides $2.7 billion to former players barred from revenue sharing. The agreement brings a seismic shift to hundreds of schools that were forced to reckon with the reality that their players are the ones producing the billions in TV and other revenue, mostly through football and basketball, that keep this machine humming. This settlement is expected to professionalize college athletics, impacting recruitment and potentially leading to program cuts, while also raising concerns about the future of Olympic sports.

          <p>Former Osceola County Sheriff Marcos Lopez was arrested on racketeering and conspiracy charges for allegedly running an illegal gambling operation that generated millions. Prosecutors allege that Lopez pocketed as much as $700,000 while operating the business, which included slot machines, a lottery, and a "gambling house" out of a business called the Fusion Social Club in Kissimmee. The illegal gambling operation allegedly generated more than $21.6 million over the years, and four others face the same charges. Florida Gov.

Abrego Garcia's attorney claims the charges are an abuse of power and that his client is not the leader of an international MS-13 smuggling conspiracy.</p>

          <p>The monster character "Labubu," a rabbit-like plush toy created by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung and produced by Chinese maker Pop Mart, has become a global sensation. Its popularity is fueled by celebrity endorsements, savvy marketing, and the blind box sales strategy. Limited-edition Labubu items are resold online at high prices, reflecting the character's high demand. This success highlights China's transformation from a subcontractor to a creator of original products in the toy market.</p>

          <p>Three residents have filed a lawsuit against Sonoma County, alleging that code enforcement is using drones to conduct warrantless surveillance of their properties. The ACLU claims the county has used drones over 700 times to find code violations without warrants, violating the California Constitution's privacy protections. Residents report concerns about privacy and loss of enjoyment of their property due to the drone surveillance. The lawsuit raises questions about the balance between law enforcement and individual privacy expectations.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines is canceling over a dozen flights daily due to tariffs hindering its ability to accept delivery of new aircraft. The airline is delaying the acceptance of two Embraer 175 regional jets to avoid extra tariff-related costs. These aircraft were meant to serve Horizon Air, a regional subsidiary of Alaska Airlines, but are now delayed because of tariffs on Brazilian imports. Without the new aircraft, Alaska must cancel 14 flights a day through the end of July.</p>

Musk posted a poll on X asking his followers if it's time to create a new political party representing the 80% in the middle, and endorsed the name "America Party." Starting a new political party is challenging, but Musk's actions signal his intent to stay engaged in politics and challenge Trump's influence.

CEO Elon Musk officially concluded his term with the Trump administration at the end of May, hitting the 130-day mark, the maximum time allowed for a "special government employee." A senior White House official told NBC News on Friday that the president was "not interested" in having a call with Musk to resolve their feud. After Musk called the "one, big beautiful bill" an "abomination" and rallied his followers on X to "kill the bill," Trump said Musk had gone "CRAZY" and threatened to end government contracts and cut off subsidies for Musk's companies.</p>

New figures released quietly by ministers in recent days show the Home Office plans to spend £2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year - that is only marginally less than the £2.3bn it spent in 2024/25. The money is largely used to cover the accommodation costs of thousands of asylum seekers who have recently arrived in the UK.

          <p>A group of deported migrants is living in a converted shipping container at a U.S. military base in Djibouti, a country in East Africa, where they are guarded around the clock by a small team of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, according to a Thursday court filing. Several migrants have been stuck at the base for more than two weeks, after the airplane they were on, which was originally bound for South Sudan, was rerouted mid-trip due to a federal judge's ruling. Since the flight landed in Djibouti, ICE officers have been left with limited resources, and the migrants have been held with very limited communication with their families and no communication with their lawyers, according to the court filings.</p>
