          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and subsequently released on bail. Ozturk expressed gratitude for the support she received from her community and emphasized her faith in the American justice system. Her lawyers argued that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated when she was detained for co-authoring an op-ed critical of Israel's war with Hamas. A federal judge ordered her release, stating there was no evidence to justify her detainment besides the op-ed, and leaders in Massachusetts celebrated her return, with Governor Healey denouncing the Trump administration's attempt to silence dissent.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for "direct talks" with Ukraine to begin as early as May 15 in Istanbul, aiming to address the root causes of the conflict and move towards a lasting peace. This announcement follows a visit by European leaders, including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron, to Ukraine, where they urged Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. Putin indicated he would discuss details with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, while Kyiv has not yet responded to the proposal. The European leaders had also threatened new sanctions if Russia did not agree to the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>As tensions escalated between India and Pakistan following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, the Trump administration grew concerned about a potential nuclear conflict. Vice President JD Vance initially dismissed the conflict as not America's problem, but the administration quickly mobilized after evidence of intensifying military engagements, including strikes near Pakistan's nuclear command headquarters. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio engaged in direct diplomacy with leaders from both countries, urging de-escalation and proposing alternatives to continued strikes. President Trump then announced a cease-fire, crediting U.S. leadership, though India did not acknowledge U.S. involvement in the resolution.</p>

          <p>Farmer David Thornley is pursuing legal action against East Midlands Airport, alleging that a leaking pipe caused pollution in Diseworth Brook, resulting in the loss of pedigree lambs from his breeding ewes in 2022. Thornley noticed a strong odor and brown substance in the brook, later identified as sewage fungus, and traced it back to an outlet pipe from the airport's holding ponds. Although the airport acknowledged a small leak, they deny a link between the discharge and bacterial pollution. Environmental studies indicate that de-icing chemicals from airports can degrade water quality, promoting sewage fungus growth.</p>

The meetings, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, aimed to de-escalate trade tensions, although initial discussions focused on "de-escalation, not about the big trade deal." Trump suggested the U.S. could lower tariffs on China, potentially to 80%, while Chinese officials have called for the U.S. to drop its "unilateral" tariffs first.

          <p>India accused Pakistan of violating a recently brokered ceasefire after explosions in Kashmir, with Indian officials claiming a "border intrusion" and Pakistan denying the violations. The truce, announced by U.S. President Trump, aimed to end the worst military confrontation between the two nations in decades, following weeks of clashes triggered by a tourist massacre. Despite the agreement, cross-border shelling and gunfire were reported, with both sides accusing the other of initiating the attacks. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he engaged with Indian and Pakistani officials to facilitate the ceasefire.</p>

Sims, who was an Army private at the time of the murder, had a prior conviction for attempted murder and robbery. Investigators used DNA from the crime scene to confirm his involvement, bringing closure to Ralston's family after nearly 50 years.</p>

Clark, acting administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, expressed doubt about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.
