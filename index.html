        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New league tables have been published, ranking NHS trusts across England for the first time, with specialist hospitals such as Moorfields Eye Hospital securing the top positions. Conversely, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn, ranked lowest due to significant structural weaknesses requiring building supports. Health Secretary Wes Streeting emphasized that these rankings will highlight areas needing urgent support and aim to eliminate regional disparities in healthcare quality. However, organizations like NHS Providers and the Nuffield Trust caution that focusing solely on metrics might lead trusts to prioritize rankings over genuine patient care. They also noted that the inclusion of financial performance in the metrics could distort the overall assessment, potentially undermining public trust and demoralizing staff.</p>

          <p>A 30-year-old woman, Hanna S., is facing a nine-year prison sentence in Germany for her alleged involvement in attacking a group of neo-Nazis in Budapest in February 2023. Prosecutors in Munich have charged her with attempted murder, grievous bodily harm, and membership in a criminal organization, asserting she belongs to a "militant left-wing extremist ideology" group. This trial evokes Germany's past struggles with extremist violence, including the unsolved murders by the far-right National Socialist Underground (NSU) over a decade ago. The defense argues that the Budapest event was a "neo-Nazi show" and disputes the clarity of the evidence against S. The case highlights the ongoing complexities and sensitivities surrounding extremist groups and justice in Germany.</p>

          <p>David Liao Yi-chien, HSBC's co-CEO, reported that multinational companies are significantly increasing their investments in China's burgeoning new-economy sectors, specifically high-end manufacturing, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals. He also noted continued optimism for consumption-related industries like fast-moving consumer goods. This strategic reorientation reflects global firms' view of China as a crucial market for driving innovation, consumption, and overall growth, as evidenced by HSBC's Global Trade Pulse Survey. The article emphasizes China's enduring appeal to international investors, citing its immense market size, robust industrial infrastructure, vibrant innovation ecosystem, and abundant skilled workforce. Its capital markets are also deemed essential for global investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Ishiba has announced his resignation, attributing his decision to the successful conclusion of trade negotiations with the United States, which resulted in reduced tariffs on Japanese car imports. The incoming Japanese leader will now face the challenge of navigating the country's complex relationship with China. Analysts anticipate that Tokyo will continue to perceive Beijing as a significant strategic competitor, irrespective of who takes office. While China's foreign ministry has refrained from commenting on Ishiba's resignation, deeming it an internal Japanese matter, the broader expectation is that Japan's foreign policy will maintain its current trajectory. The article implies that the fundamental geopolitical tensions between the two nations are set to persist.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the populist right in both the US and UK is actively attempting to rewrite history and dismantle democratic achievements to consolidate power. Examples include the Trump administration's efforts to remove "divisive" exhibits from the Smithsonian and Reform UK's call for a "patriotic" British history curriculum. The author contends these actions are not mere distractions but ideological justifications for policies that erode rights for vulnerable communities and undermine the social contract of the 20th century. Resisting this trend requires building cross-communal solidarities to defend the democratic gains of civil rights and decolonization movements. The article emphasizes that ignoring this historical revisionism risks losing fundamental protections.</p>

          <p>The resignation of Angela Rayner as Labour Party deputy leader has opened a contested election, seen as a crucial indicator of the party's future direction following a recent reshuffle perceived as a tilt to the right. Candidates need significant MP and party backing within a tight timetable, leading to accusations of a "stitch up" from the left wing. The party leadership aims for a quick, quiet contest, but many members and veterans anticipate a desire for a "constructive critic" to emerge, reflecting internal jitters. The outcome will shape the dynamic between the Prime Minister and the new deputy, with implications for government policy and party unity.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has expressed serious concern that the UK could face a 1976-style International Monetary Fund bailout unless the government implements a robust plan for economic growth and welfare cuts. She warned of a "doom loop" of rising taxes and precarious public finances, offering to collaborate with Labour on welfare spending in the national interest. While some economists see "eerie parallels" with 1976, others dismiss the bailout prospect as hyperbole. Labour criticized Badenoch's advice, attributing current economic woes to Conservative policies.

The author recounts watching a Chinese film based on true events from the 1937 massacre, which depicted civilians risking their lives to expose Japanese atrocities. The powerful emotional response in the theater, contrasted with international media interpretations of Chinese parades as a show of force, highlights a disconnect in historical understanding. The article implies that a stronger "motherland" is seen by Chinese citizens as essential for their well-being, influencing their national sentiment and historical narrative.</p>
