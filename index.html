          <p>Executives from major Chinese energy firms, including State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC), have publicly called on Brazil to establish a stable and predictable regulatory framework to support green energy investments. They warned that the lack of clear rules, particularly for energy storage, is jeopardizing billions of dollars in potential projects. China has become a primary investor in Brazil's energy sector, with investments rising 33% to $1.73 billion in 2023, largely focused on clean technologies. The firms emphasized that while they have the capital and technology, regulatory uncertainty is a significant barrier to deploying these resources effectively.</p>

          <p>A tragic collision in Gary, Indiana, resulted in the deaths of five people when their vehicle was struck by a South Shore Line train. According to officials, the vehicle drove around the lowered crossing gates and directly into the path of the eastbound train. None of the 32 passengers or the crew members aboard the train were injured in the incident. The Gary Police Department has not yet released the identities of the victims. The National Transportation Safety Board has stated that it will not be investigating the crash.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled in *Medina v. Planned Parenthood* that Medicaid patients and providers cannot sue states in federal court to enforce the 'free choice of provider' provision in the Medicaid Act. The 6-3 decision, authored by Justice Neil Gorsuch, effectively allows South Carolina to exclude Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program. Critics, including the dissenting justices, argue the ruling radically reorders federal Medicaid law by removing a key enforcement mechanism for patient rights, potentially rendering many federal healthcare coverage and quality-of-care mandates unenforceable and setting a dangerous precedent for low-income Americans' access to healthcare.</p>

          <p>Following Zohran Mamdani's victory in the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, some Republican groups and figures are demanding the Trump administration revoke his citizenship and deport him. The New York Young Republican Club urged the president to use the 1954 Communist Control Act to justify the action against the 33-year-old progressive. Mamdani, who was born in Uganda and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2018, has run on a platform focused on the city's affordability crisis. He has denounced the calls for his deportation as attacks on his immigrant background.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from TransUnion reveals that 31% of federal student loan borrowers are in late-stage delinquency, the highest rate ever recorded by the credit bureau. This situation creates a 'default cliff,' with millions at risk of defaulting as involuntary collections resume. Borrowers who fall behind face significant consequences, including severe damage to their credit scores and potential wage garnishment. The report suggests the number of defaults will continue to rise in the coming months, posing a major financial risk to millions of Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two Metropolitan Police officers have been dismissed for gross misconduct following their involvement in the 2020 strip-search of a 15-year-old Black schoolgirl, known as Child Q. A disciplinary panel found the search, conducted at her school while she was menstruating and without an appropriate adult present, was unjustified and humiliating. A third officer received a final written warning. While the panel acknowledged that Black children are often perceived as older, it did not find that race was a factor in this specific case, a conclusion that has drawn further scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Debt settlement offers a potential solution for consumers overwhelmed by credit card debt, allowing them to negotiate with creditors to pay less than the total amount owed. The primary advantages include significant debt reduction and providing a faster resolution than making minimum payments, serving as a viable alternative to bankruptcy. However, the process carries substantial risks, such as severe and long-lasting damage to one's credit score, as it requires halting payments. There is also no guarantee of success, and any forgiven debt over $600 is typically considered taxable income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's latest financial disclosure reveals over $630 million in income last year, sourced from a wide array of ventures beyond his traditional real estate holdings. The report details significant earnings from hotels and golf courses, alongside millions from licensing his name for products like watches and Bibles, and over $57 million from cryptocurrency sales. These new business avenues, particularly in the crypto space, have raised conflict-of-interest concerns among ethics watchdogs, who question whether he is profiting from the presidency while new industry regulations are being debated.</p>

          <p>A protest outside the Manhattan offices of data-mining firm Palantir Technologies resulted in the arrest of six demonstrators. Organized by climate and immigrant rights groups, the protest aimed to highlight Palantir's controversial contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to build surveillance and deportation software for the Trump administration. Protestors linked arms to block the building's entrance, holding signs that read 'Palantir powers ICE.' The company, founded by Trump backer Peter Thiel, has faced increasing scrutiny for its work with government agencies.</p>

Over 120 Labour MPs have backed an amendment to block the bill, which aims to save Â£5 billion by tightening eligibility for disability and sickness benefits. The internal opposition centers on concerns about the fairness of the changes, forcing the Prime Minister to personally engage with rebels to find a compromise ahead of a crucial vote.</p>

          <p>Didier Dubreucq, one of the men convicted for the 2016 multi-million dollar jewelry heist targeting Kim Kardashian in Paris, has died at age 69. His death comes just one month after he and seven accomplices, nicknamed the 'grandpa robbers' due to their age, were found guilty. Dubreucq, who was battling lung cancer, had been sentenced to a seven-year term but did not return to prison due to his health and time already served. The high-profile robbery was described by Kardashian as the most terrifying experience of her life.</p>
