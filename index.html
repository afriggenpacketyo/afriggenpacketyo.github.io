          <p>American Eagle experienced a significant drop in shares after withdrawing its full-year guidance and writing off $75 million in spring and summer inventory. The apparel retailer cited slow sales, steep discounting, and economic uncertainty as contributing factors. First-quarter revenue is expected to decline by about 5% year-over-year, with comparable sales also dropping. CEO Jay Schottenstein expressed disappointment with the company's execution in the first quarter, noting that merchandising strategies did not drive anticipated results, leading to higher promotions and excess inventory.

          <p>Deep within the American Museum of Natural History, a hidden "Bug Colony" houses thousands of dermestid beetles that meticulously clean animal skeletons. These six-legged staffers consume the flesh off specimens, leaving behind pristine bones that are too delicate to be cleaned by human hands. The beetles, descendants of a colony brought from Africa in the 1930s, work around the clock in specialized boxes, creating a soft, crackling sound as they gnaw on carcasses. The museum relies on these beetles to prepare skeletons for research and display, processing everything from songbirds to flamingos.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reinstated Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, along with 15 other players, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame. The decision changes the league's policy on permanent ineligibility, stating bans expire at death. Rose was banned for betting on baseball, while Jackson was implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The Hall of Fame will now consider their candidacies, though voters are also told to consider a player's "integrity, sportsmanship, character and contribution to the game."</p>

This narrative strategy aims to position China and Russia as inheritors of the true anti-fascist tradition, challenging the post-1989 world order and US hegemony.

          <h2>Republicans' Response to Trump's Ethics Under Scrutiny</h2>

          <p>Republicans on Capitol Hill are facing criticism for their muted response to President Trump's actions, which are pushing ethics guardrails around profiting from the presidency. While past presidents, like Bill Clinton, faced intense scrutiny for inviting campaign donors to the White House, Trump's actions, such as considering a luxury jet from Qatar and promoting his crypto coin, have drawn less criticism from within his party. Democrats, led by Senator Chuck Schumer, have voiced strong concerns, but most Republicans remain hesitant to question the president or amplify the criticism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amgen Inc. is being assessed as a potentially strong pharmaceutical stock amidst a push for domestic manufacturing incentives. President Trump signed an executive order incentivizing prescription drug manufacturing in the United States, streamlining the approval process for new production sites and increasing inspection fees for foreign plants. This initiative aims to reverse the trend of pharmaceutical production moving overseas, particularly to China. The FDA commissioner, Marty Makary, said the order would allow the agency to conduct more inspections with the same resources, enhancing oversight of both domestic and foreign facilities.

          <p>Three key House committees are meeting to advance President Trump's budget package, which addresses defense, energy, and tax priorities, but faces significant Republican divisions.

The Agriculture Committee seeks cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Republicans must resolve differences over Medicaid and tax deductions, with a self-imposed deadline to send the package to the Senate by Memorial Day.</p>

          <p>President Trump's repeated vows not to cut Medicaid are in conflict with a House Republican bill that proposes significant cuts to the program. Despite his promises, the bill aims to slash Medicaid spending through work requirements, more frequent eligibility checks, and penalties for states offering Medicaid to undocumented immigrants. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would reduce deficits by $715 billion over the next decade but result in at least 8.6 million more Americans going uninsured. Trump has defended the bill by citing the need to address fraud and abuse in the program.</p>
