          <p>Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka was excluded from England's squad to face Andorra in a World Cup qualifier, raising concerns about his fitness. Head coach Thomas Tuchel indicated Saka had limited training during the week, suggesting a link between his omission and physical condition. Saka, who has 43 caps for England, previously missed three months due to a hamstring injury, and his participation in the friendly against Senegal remains uncertain. Conor Gallagher and Ollie Watkins were also left out of the squad, with Watkins returning home due to a minor injury, while the reason for Gallagher's exclusion is not yet clear. The Three Lions are currently unbeaten in World Cup qualifying, having won both of their opening matches against Latvia and Albania.</p>

          <p>The Norwegian Refugee Council reports that Cameroon is facing the world's most neglected refugee crisis, marked by a significant disparity between the gravity of the situation and the political and media attention it receives. More than 1.1 million people are internally displaced in Cameroon, along with 480,000 refugees from other countries, mainly the Central African Republic. The country is grappling with two major conflicts: a civil war in the western region and destabilization in the Lake Chad region due to Islamist militants. The NRC highlights that Cameroon scores poorly in media attention, political will to resolve the conflict, and the provision of required aid funding, with only 45% of the necessary aid being granted.</p>

Donald Trump signed an executive order reviving restrictions justified on national security grounds, following a firebomb attack at a pro-Israel rally. An Iranian foreign ministry official stated that the ban indicates deep hostility towards the Iranian and Muslim people and violates fundamental principles of international law. The US ban targets nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, with a partial ban on travelers from seven other countries.</p>

          <p>A major furniture fraud has rocked the French antiques world, with several pieces claimed to be from the 18th century discovered to be fakes. The scam involved expert Georges "Bill" Pallot and cabinetmaker Bruno Desnoues, who replicated royal furniture and sold them to galleries and auction houses, including Versailles. The fraud began as a "joke" and eventually led to profits of over €3 million. Pallot and Desnoues have admitted to their crimes and are facing charges of fraud and money laundering, while Galerie Kraemer is accused of deception by gross negligence.</p>
