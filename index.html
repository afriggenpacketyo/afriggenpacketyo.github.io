          <p>This article presents a timeline of events surrounding the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native living in Maryland, to El Salvador. Despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution, the Trump administration deported him in March 2025, claiming he was a member of MS-13. The timeline details the administrative error, court orders for his return, and the legal battles that ensued, including Supreme Court involvement and diplomatic tensions. Ultimately, Abrego Garcia is returned to the United States to face criminal charges related to transporting undocumented migrants. The article highlights the complexities and controversies surrounding immigration enforcement and due process. </p>

          <p>This article examines the concept of time limits on federal rental assistance, focusing on a program in Delaware that requires recipients to work and save money. The Delaware program provides a savings account that recipients can access when they move out, creating an incentive for self-sufficiency. While some argue that time limits encourage turnover and upward mobility, others worry about the potential for homelessness, especially in areas with skyrocketing rent. The article provides examples of programs where time limits have both succeeded and failed, underscoring the importance of additional support services. </p>

          <p>This article discusses how the evolving tastes of China's Gen Z are reshaping the liquor industry, with a shift away from traditional baijiu towards lighter, fruit-flavored beverages. In Baisha, a town famous for its liquor production, farmers are increasingly growing green plums instead of sorghum grain to meet the demand for these new drinks. Liquor brands are innovating their products to appeal to younger consumers, who prioritize self-indulgent experiences over traditional social rituals. This trend could potentially upend China's alcohol market, where baijiu has long been the dominant choice. </p>

          <p>This New York Times opinion piece explores the evolving political motivations of Elon Musk, particularly his relationship with Donald Trump. The author initially believed Musk's shift towards the right was driven by cultural issues and his desire to advance space exploration.

          <p>This New York Times editorial asserts that Donald Trump's second term is characterized by a culture of corruption, particularly within the cryptocurrency industry.

The editorial claims that Trump's actions undermine public faith in government and damage the reputation of the United States. The piece argues that Trump's self-enrichment differs from traditional bribery, as he presides over a system where those who help him profit receive favorable treatment. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that Donald Trump's investigation into Joe Biden's cognitive decline and autopen use is a dangerous step towards expanding presidential immunity. The author contends that the investigation, likely encouraged by the Supreme Court's decision in *Trump v. United States*, could lead to extending immunity to presidential aides. This expansion would remove restraints on a president's team and enable further lawlessness. The author suggests that Biden's aides should defend themselves on the merits rather than procedural immunity grounds to prevent this outcome. </p>

          <p>The UK government is facing difficulties in reducing the amount of foreign aid spent on hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK. New figures show that the Home Office plans to spend Â£2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year, only marginally less than the Â£2.3bn spent in 2024/25. This spending has led to significant cuts in UK support for humanitarian and development priorities across the world. The article highlights concerns about the effectiveness and ethical implications of using foreign aid for domestic asylum accommodation. </p>

          <h2>German Government to Seek EU Court Ruling on Migrant Turnbacks</h2>

          <p>The German government plans to ask the EU court to rule on migrant turnbacks, following a court decision declaring Germany's new migration pushback policy illegal. The policy was deemed unlawful because it wasn't handled under the EU's Dublin Regulation. A lawmaker has accused asylum activists of staging an incident where three Somali asylum seekers were turned away at the border, which led to the court ruling. The incident and its aftermath have sparked controversy and debate over Germany's migration policies. </p>

          <p>Japan and the United States are aiming to reach a trade agreement by mid-June, despite remaining differences on tariff issues. Tokyo's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, said that while "further progress" was made, the two countries "yet to find common ground". Japan has demanded that the Trump administration remove additional tariffs, arguing that the measures are harming the Japanese economy.
