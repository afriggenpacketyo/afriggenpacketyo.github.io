        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid escalating trade tensions, the United States and China are presenting conflicting narratives regarding the status of trade talks. President Trump claims active discussions are underway, while Chinese officials deny any negotiations or agreements on tariffs. This disagreement underscores the complexities of resolving the trade war, which has seen both countries imposing hefty tariffs on each other's goods. Experts suggest China perceives itself as holding the upper hand, particularly as the U.S. faces economic vulnerabilities due to the tariffs. Optimism remains guarded as both sides navigate a delicate balance between negotiation and maintaining a firm stance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hamas has reportedly signaled its readiness to hand over governance of Gaza to a mutually agreed-upon Palestinian entity as part of ceasefire negotiations. This potential shift comes amid increasing pressure on Hamas within Gaza and a possible shift in Iran's support. However, skepticism remains regarding Hamas's willingness to disarm, a key demand from Israel. Experts suggest that the Palestinian Authority is the most viable alternative, but Israel has been blocking that for a year and a half, which makes it difficult to imagine Gaza and the West Bank being governed by different parties in the long term.</p>
