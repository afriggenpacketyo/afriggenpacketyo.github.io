        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Justice Department declared it would not defend a decades-old federal grant program for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), asserting the funding is unconstitutional. This stance supports a lawsuit by Tennessee and an anti-affirmative action organization, which cites the 2023 Supreme Court decision against affirmative action. Over 500 colleges, including flagship universities, receive approximately $350 million in grants for improvements and programs, with HSIs enrolling 67% of the nation's Latino undergraduate students. The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities plans to intervene, arguing the grants are constitutional and essential for ensuring equitable funding for their member institutions.</p>

          <p>Republican public safety advocate Gianno Caldwell is considering a bid for the open Illinois Senate seat in 2026, citing growing concerns over crime in American cities, particularly his hometown of Chicago. His decision is deeply influenced by the unsolved murder of his brother in 2022, fueling his commitment to public safety and a law-and-order platform. Caldwell, a Fox News contributor, applauds former President Trump's proposals for federal crackdowns on crime in cities like Chicago. With Senator Dick Durbin's retirement creating a wide-open race, Caldwell seeks to bring his mission to save lives and address violence to the forefront of national politics.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to experience temperatures of up to 30C on Bank Holiday Monday, marking another warm spell in what is projected to be one of the hottest summers on record. However, this will be short-lived, as the remnants of Hurricane Erin are expected to bring cooler, unsettled weather with wind and rain from Tuesday. Large crowds attending events like Notting Hill Carnival and major music festivals should prepare for travel disruptions due to ongoing rail strikes and engineering works. Prolonged dry periods this summer have already led to hosepipe bans and concerns for a poor harvest, with climate change contributing to more frequent and intense heatwaves.</p>

          <p>An Air Canada flight en route from Toronto to Las Vegas was forced to make an emergency landing at Chicago's O'Hare Airport after a passenger disturbance. The Federal Aviation Administration reported the incident occurred on Friday night, leading to the flight's diversion. Details of the passenger's actions were not provided, but authorities confirmed the situation was resolved without any arrests. The flight subsequently resumed its journey to Las Vegas, arriving three hours behind schedule. This incident contributes to the over 1,000 unruly passenger reports airlines have filed this year, with potential civil penalties reaching $37,000 per violation.</p>

          <p>Five people died and numerous others were injured after a tour bus carrying 54 passengers lost control and rolled over on the New York State Thruway. The bus was returning to New York City from Niagara Falls when it veered into the median, over-corrected, and landed in a ditch. Police have ruled out mechanical failure and operator impairment, with the cause of the accident remaining under investigation. Passengers, ranging from 1 to 74 years old and of various nationalities, were transported to multiple hospitals.

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered a halt to construction on the Revolution Wind project near Rhode Island, despite it being approximately 80% complete with 45 of 65 turbines installed. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management cited unspecified national security concerns for the stop-work order. This action aligns with President Trump's broader agenda to prioritize fossil fuels and impede renewable energy development, which he has publicly criticized as a "scam." Rhode Island and Connecticut officials, who view the project as crucial for their climate goals and capable of powering over 350,000 homes, have condemned the decision and are exploring legal avenues to reverse it.</p>

Arsenal's sporting director praised Eze as a "creative and explosive talent," while manager Mikel Arteta highlighted his strong mentality and ambition. Eze shared an emotional farewell message to Crystal Palace fans, expressing gratitude for their support throughout his career, including during his recovery from an Achilles injury.</p>

This comes after a High Court ruling blocked a hotel in Epping from accommodating asylum seekers, prompting other local authorities to consider legal challenges.

Senator Mark Warner criticized Kruse's sacking, warning it signals a dangerous habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test rather than a safeguard for the nation.

          <p>Transcripts of Ghislaine Maxwell's interview with US officials reveal her claims of not witnessing inappropriate conduct by Donald Trump or Bill Clinton, and her assertion that a purported Jeffrey Epstein "client list" does not exist. Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, is seeking a pardon from Trump and was recently moved to a new prison facility. She also called allegations against Prince Andrew "mind-blowingly not conceivable" and disputed introducing him to Epstein. The release comes amid pressure for transparency regarding Epstein's high-profile associates, with Maxwell maintaining Trump was a "gentleman" in her presence and expressing disbelief over Epstein's suicide.</p>

          <p>China's DF-31 series intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), though not the newest or most powerful in the PLA Rocket Force's arsenal, continue to serve as an effective deterrent. A recent full-range, trans-Pacific test in September 2024 demonstrated China's credible second-strike nuclear capability, sending a strong geopolitical signal to the United States and its allies. The launch, which saw a dummy warhead plunge into the southern Pacific Ocean, underscored the enduring strategic importance of these missiles. Despite their age, the DF-31s can still reach the US mainland, contributing significantly to China's national security and military confidence.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has erupted once more, marking its 31st display of molten rock since December, with lava arcing 100 feet into the air within its summit crater. The eruption, contained within Halemaumau Crater, poses no threat to homes, offering a spectacular view for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that magma is continuously supplied from a lower chamber, building pressure until it forces out through narrow vents, creating the towering fountains. While the current eruption pattern has featured shorter fountains lately, experts continue to monitor Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, noting its dynamic and unpredictable nature.</p>

Effective immediately or within days, services in Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, France, Austria, and the UK will halt commercial package deliveries. The new decree, effective August 29, subjects international goods valued under $800 to tariffs, a change from previous exemptions.

Israel has dismissed the famine declaration as false, while preparing for a major offensive on Gaza City, which it maintains is a Hamas stronghold.

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott is set to approve a contentious GOP redistricting bill, which cleared the state Senate after a weekslong standoff in the House. The Republican-backed proposal aims to redraw Texas's congressional map, creating five new GOP-leaning districts to bolster the party's majority in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, a move supported by former President Trump. Democrats have vowed legal challenges, arguing the new map undermines fair representation and dilutes minority voting power. The mid-decade redistricting effort has sparked a nationwide debate over political boundaries, with California also introducing a counter-redistricting plan.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez were both denied parole this week in California, decades after being convicted of killing their parents in 1989. Parole boards cited their behavior in prison, rather than solely the original crime, as a primary factor. Erik's denial highlighted involvement in fights, drug use, a tax-fraud scam, and stashing banned items, contradicting claims of being a "model prisoner." Lyle's denial acknowledged his remorse and positive changes but noted struggles with "anti-social personality traits" like deception and rule-breaking, including repeated mobile phone use. Both brothers expressed profound sorrow for their actions and the harm caused to their family.</p>

Despite Roblox's claims of 24/7 moderation and AI systems for reporting potential abuse, experts and law enforcement express concern that safeguards are easily overridden. Critics argue Roblox prioritizes growth and revenue over child safety, prompting legal action and calls for stronger regulation.</p>

Following a previous combative meeting where Trump criticized Zelenskyy's casual wear, this time Zelenskyy opted for a black canvas blazer over a collared shirt, conveying a more formal and serious tone. Both Trump and a right-wing reporter, who had previously panned his look, praised the change. This strategic sartorial shift, crafted with a Ukrainian designer, aimed to blend his wartime style with high-stakes diplomacy, contributing to what Zelenskyy described as his "best one" yet with the US president.</p>
