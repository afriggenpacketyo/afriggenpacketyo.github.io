          <p>Croatia recently celebrated the 30th anniversary of "Operation Storm," a pivotal military offensive from the 1990s Croatian War of Independence that secured its victory and territory. The event is viewed heroically in Croatia, marked by a large military parade, symbolizing national pride and the end of the conflict. Conversely, Serbia commemorates the anniversary as a "pogrom," mourning the expulsion of approximately 200,000 Serbs and the war crimes committed during the operation. This starkly different remembrance highlights the enduring and conflicting national narratives that persist three decades after the war.</p>

Separately, former BBC presenter Jay Blades has been charged with two counts of sexual assault. Other prominent news includes a police warning of mass detentions at a banned Palestine Action rally and a report that wealthy parents prepaid private school fees to avoid a new tax.</p>

          <p>A large-scale manhunt continues for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana. Authorities consider the suspect armed and dangerous, urging public caution as the search extends into the rugged wilderness he frequented. The small, tight-knit community is in mourning, with residents expressing shock and fear over the seemingly random act of violence. The suspect's family has indicated he struggled with mental illness and PTSD for years prior to the incident.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is implementing a 12-month pilot program requiring some business and leisure travelers to post bonds of up to $15,000 to enter the country. This policy targets visitors from nations with high rates of visa overstays or inadequate security screening protocols. The State Department states the program aims to test the feasibility of such bonds and to encourage foreign governments to improve compliance and vetting processes. While only an estimated 2,000 people are expected to be affected, it represents another step in the administration's efforts to tighten immigration rules. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Countries are meeting at a UN conference in Geneva to negotiate a legally binding global treaty aimed at curbing plastic pollution, a crisis that has seen nearly 200 trillion pieces of plastic accumulate in the world's oceans. Despite agreeing to develop a treaty in 2022, nations have failed to reach a consensus, with major disagreements over production limits. A coalition of nearly 100 countries supports capping plastic production, but oil-producing nations like Russia and Saudi Arabia are pushing to focus on recycling instead. The talks also address banning harmful chemicals and standardizing product design to improve recyclability.</p>

The authors suggest that Prime Minister Donald Tusk's government has failed to present a compelling future vision, instead getting bogged down in reversing its predecessors' policies and adopting some of their nationalist rhetoric. This has led to plummeting approval ratings and the victory of a populist-backed presidential candidate. The piece serves as a warning to other democracies that defeating populists at the polls is not a definitive victory.</p>

          <p>Recent social media footage has provided the first look at what is believed to be China's next-generation early warning and control aircraft, the KJ-3000. The prototype aircraft appears to be based on a modified Y-20B transport plane, distinguished by a large, saucer-shaped rotodome on its fuselage that houses advanced radar equipment. While some Western militaries have moved away from this type of aircraft, Beijing's development of the KJ-3000 signals a continued commitment to the strategy. The blurry images offer initial clues about the advanced surveillance and command capabilities the new plane will possess.</p>

          <p>India's foreign ministry has pushed back against U.S. and EU criticism of its Russian oil purchases, stating it was "targeted" after President Trump threatened to impose steeper tariffs. The ministry argued that India only began importing Russian oil after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe following the 2022 Ukraine conflict, a move it claims the U.S. initially encouraged to stabilize global energy markets. New Delhi pointed out that the EU's own trade with Russia is significantly larger, framing its own oil imports as a matter of national necessity to ensure affordable energy for its citizens.

He framed the potential move as a defensive response to what he called an existential threat to democracy.

          <h2>Nationwide Shortage of Volunteer Firefighters Puts Strain on Local Communities</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing shortage of volunteer firefighters across the U.S. is straining a system that protects many small communities and saves taxpayers an estimated $46.9 billion annually. The number of volunteers has dropped by over 20% since 1985, while emergency call volumes have more than tripled, leading to burnout. This decline could force more towns to switch to paid fire departments, a costly alternative for taxpayers. Lawmakers are considering incentives like student loan forgiveness to boost recruitment, an idea that young volunteers believe could significantly help attract new members.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest amid an ongoing trial over allegations that he plotted a coup. The judge, Alexandre de Moraes, cited Bolsonaro's failure to comply with previous restraining orders, which included a ban on using social media. The ruling referenced an incident where Bolsonaro addressed supporters via a speakerphone at a rally, an act seen as a deliberate violation of the court's restrictions. Bolsonaro's legal team denies any breach and plans to appeal the decision, which has drawn condemnation from the U.S. State Department.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley has declined an invitation to serve on President Trump's revitalized council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Barkley stated that due to his busy schedule, he and his family felt it was in his best interest not to accept the position on the council. The presidential council, which includes other prominent sports figures like Mariano Rivera and Lawrence Taylor, was reestablished via an executive order. Barkley, who has previously golfed with both President Trump and former President Barack Obama, said he respects the office but was surprised to be named.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists exploring a cave system near Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales have discovered the remains of an auroch, an extinct species of large wild cattle from the Bronze Age. The team, working in partnership with local cavers, also found evidence of the area being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. These discoveries provide new insights into how prehistoric humans lived, farmed, and used the landscape in the region. The project is part of a larger initiative aimed at preserving the history and traditions of upland common lands in England.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) concludes that Taiwan's energy reserves would be rapidly depleted during a full military blockade by China. The analysis of 26 war-gaming scenarios found that the island's natural gas supplies would last only 11 days, coal for seven weeks, and oil for 20 weeks. However, the report also suggests that a blockade would not be a low-risk option for Beijing. The war games indicated a high likelihood of the conflict escalating, potentially drawing in the United States and leading to significant casualties on all sides.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than £100 million in prizes from the UK's government-backed Premium Bonds savings program have gone unclaimed, sparking criticism that the operator, NS&I, is not doing enough to locate winners. The 2.5 million unclaimed prizes include eleven worth £100,000 each. Critics argue the tracing process is overly difficult, especially for those who were gifted bonds as children or only possess old paper records. NS&I states it has successfully paid over 99% of prize winners since 1957 and offers a tracing service, but some customers report a frustrating and bureaucratic experience.

          <p>President Donald Trump recently praised an American Eagle advertisement featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, calling it the "HOTTEST ad out there" and boosting the company's stock price. The ad had already sparked controversy online, with some critics accusing its wordplay on "genes" and "jeans" of echoing eugenicist rhetoric, given Sweeney is blonde and blue-eyed. Supporters dismissed the backlash as overblown. Trump's intervention amplified the debate, with him using it to criticize what he terms "woke" advertising while praising Sweeney, whom he described as a registered Republican.</p>

          <p>Wildlife officials in California are issuing a warning after multiple wild pigs in Monterey County were found to have blue-dyed muscle and fat tissue. The discoloration was caused by exposure to diphacinone, a blue-dyed anticoagulant rodenticide. The pigs likely consumed the pesticide bait directly or ate other animals that had ingested it. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is urging pesticide applicators to use bait stations inaccessible to non-target wildlife and is advising hunters to avoid consuming any animal with discolored tissue, as it could indicate contamination.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows that a rise in screenings among people aged 45-49 has led to a significant increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses. Following recommendations to lower the screening age from 50 to 45, screening rates in this younger group jumped 62% between 2019 and 2023. This corresponds with a sharp rise in the detection of localized cancers, which are more treatable. While researchers call the findings promising, they note that screening rates for this age group remain suboptimal and have not increased equitably across all demographics.</p>

In a draft letter to the president, the lawmakers argue that the current tragic moment highlights the overdue need for Palestinian self-determination. The letter adds that a viable Palestinian state would need to fully recognize Israel and guarantee its security, including the disarmament of Hamas. This move comes as several key U.S. allies have recently pledged to recognize a Palestinian state, a position the Trump administration has opposed.</p>
