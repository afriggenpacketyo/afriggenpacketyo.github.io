          <p>Charles B. Rangel, a prominent figure in New York politics and the first Black chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has died at the age of 94. Rangel served as a congressman for 46 years, representing Harlem and leaving an indelible mark on the city and the nation. He was instrumental in persuading Hillary Clinton to run for Senate in New York and played a significant role in various legislative efforts, including creating empowerment zones and expanding the earned-income tax credit. Despite facing ethics violations later in his career, Rangel remained a respected and influential voice in Congress, remembered for his political agility and commitment to his constituents.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, accompanied by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, marked Memorial Day at Arlington National Cemetery by laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns and delivering remarks at the Memorial Amphitheater. Trump honored the sacrifices of American service members, emphasizing their dedication to serving others and the nation's debt to them. However, following the ceremony, Trump posted controversial messages on social media, lashing out at political opponents and federal judges, which overshadowed the commemorative spirit of the day. The remarks made by Hegseth and Vance also drew attention, with Hegseth failing to acknowledge women's contributions in the military and Vance noting Arlington as the final resting place of both sons and daughters.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering redirecting $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools across the United States. This threat follows previous actions by Trump to block Harvard from enrolling international students and freeze billions in federal funding, alleging insufficient action against anti-semitism on campus. Harvard has filed lawsuits challenging these actions, arguing they are unlawful and retaliatory, infringing on academic independence. The White House has also targeted other universities, withdrawing federal funding from Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Cornell University, in an effort to exert control over their policies.</p>

          <p>This news analysis suggests that President Trump envisions a world order where the United States, China, and Russia each dominate their respective spheres of influence. Trump's actions, such as considering annexing Canada and taking Greenland from Denmark, reflect a desire to extend American dominance in the Western Hemisphere. He has also criticized allies and praised leaders like Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. However, attempts to establish these spheres of influence face resistance, and analysts caution against attributing strategic intent to all of Trump's actions, suggesting his approach may lack a coherent vision.</p>

          <p>Financial experts provide advice on escaping the payday loan debt cycle, which traps many in expensive debt. Strategies include negotiating with lenders, consulting with credit counseling agencies, and stopping reliance on high-interest loans by exploring alternatives such as personal loans or help from family. Building an emergency buffer through side gigs and exploring debt consolidation or debt management plans are also recommended. The key to overcoming payday loan debt involves changing spending habits and creating a sustainable financial plan, possibly with the assistance of a financial counselor (not investment advice).</p>

These developments follow similar interventions from Britain, Canada, and France, indicating a shift in tone and potential consequences for Israel.
