          <h2>Romance Novel Sales Surge Due to BookTok and Changing Attitudes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 19:10:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Romance and romantasy novels are experiencing a surge in popularity, driven by BookTok and a shift in attitudes towards the genre. A London bookshop owner highlights the "high-quality writing" in romance, challenging critics who dismiss it as mere smut. UK fiction revenue has surpassed £1bn, fueled by romance and fantasy sales, with women under 35 making up the majority of romantasy purchases. Despite commercial growth, some still hold derisive attitudes, especially towards "spicy" titles, but young people are embracing the genre unapologetically, attending conventions, and discussing it online, while critical appraisal of the genre remains lacking.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance visited Los Angeles to support federal law enforcement, asserting the continued necessity of the National Guard despite waning protests over ICE raids. He accused Governor Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass of inciting violence during the protests, while also alleging that Newsom is endangering law enforcement. Newsom's office responded by criticizing Vance's visit, including a moment where he mistakenly referred to Senator Alex Padilla as "Jose Padilla." Federal agents were also seen outside the Dodgers ballpark after the team reportedly blocked immigration authorities from entering.</p>

          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague will prioritize increased defense spending by European allies, fulfilling a key demand of President Donald Trump. Secretary General Mark Rutte has worked to appease Trump, who has been critical of NATO and its members' financial contributions. While European countries are increasing defense spending due to both Trump's pressure and concerns over Russia, many will struggle to meet the new targets. The summit also aims to address trade disputes, Russia, and the escalating conflict in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been arrested for the first-degree murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, more than five years after her disappearance.

Suzanne's remains were found in September 2023, and her death was ruled a homicide caused by intoxication from a drug combination used for wildlife tranquilization. Barry Morphew is currently in custody on a $3 million bond, and the case is now being prosecuted in the Twelfth Judicial District Attorney's Office.</p>

          <p>This satirical article humorously critiques the lack of clear uniforms for ICE agents, questioning how individuals are supposed to recognize them as law enforcement. It suggests that the absence of a uniform and the use of face coverings create confusion and undermine accountability. The piece mocks the idea that ICE agents should prioritize self-expression over presenting themselves as officials acting under the law. It sarcastically advises agents to avoid anything that might identify them as accountable to the people of the United States.</p>

Trump also contradicted his own intelligence community's assessment on Iran's nuclear program, raising concerns about distrust within his administration.
