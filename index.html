          <h2>New Law Overhauls Federal Student Loan Repayment System</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 12:25:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' significantly reforms the federal student loan system by reducing the number of repayment plans from seven to two: a standard 10-25 year plan and a new income-driven option. The legislation also tightens eligibility requirements for Pell Grants, introduces new borrowing caps for Parent and Grad PLUS loans, and will eliminate economic hardship deferments starting in 2026. While the White House promotes the changes as a simplification, some advocates worry the new structure will force borrowers into longer repayment periods.</p>

          <p>President Trump traveled to Kerr County, Texas, the site of catastrophic flash flooding where the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet, killing over 120 people and leaving more than 170 missing. The visit comes amid scrutiny of the local and federal response to the disaster. In a departure from his approach to other disasters, Trump has avoided criticizing Texas officials, instead highlighting his close relationship with Governor Greg Abbott and assuring full federal support for the recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>Emil Bove, a former Trump defense attorney nominated for a lifetime federal judgeship, declined to answer several key questions in a Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire. He characterized the January 6 Capitol attack as a matter of "significant political debate" and stated it would be inappropriate to opine on the constitutionality of a third presidential term. Democrats have heavily criticized Bove for his alleged politicization of the Justice Department, particularly his role in dropping a corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams.</p>

          <p>Virginia has fallen from first to fourth place in CNBC's annual "Top States for Business" rankings, a drop largely attributed to the economic impact of the Trump administration's plans to reduce the federal workforce. The state's economy is heavily dependent on federal employment, with over 144,000 direct jobs and numerous contractors. The resulting slowdown in federal hiring has contributed to job stagnation and a rising unemployment rate in the state, causing it to lose its top ranking for the first time since 2018.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has declared its intention to impose a 35% tariff on Canadian imports, effective August 1, escalating the ongoing trade dispute with its northern neighbor. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Trump cited Canada's own retaliatory tariffs and the cross-border flow of fentanyl as justifications for the new levy. Trump also warned that this duty, which adds to existing tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and autos, could be increased further if Canada retaliates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, emergency room visits for tick bites in the U.S. have reached their highest level in six years, with a significant increase observed in the Northeast. Experts attribute this rise to expanding tick populations and longer active seasons for ticks, both of which are linked to climate change causing milder winters and wetter springs. Health officials are urging the public to take preventative measures to avoid tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's focus on boosting the U.S. birth rate, including support for IVF, has revealed a conservative divide and largely ignored the significant issue of male infertility. Although infertility stems from male factors in about half of cases among heterosexual couples, men are frequently not evaluated, and treatments for them are less likely to be covered by insurance. The article proposes that expanding access to male-specific infertility care could be a politically viable way to increase birth rates without focusing solely on more invasive treatments for women.</p>
