          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 03:25:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has authorized Royal Mail to cease Saturday deliveries for second-class letters and reduce the frequency to every other weekday. This decision aims to help the postal service manage declining letter volumes and rising operational costs, ensuring its financial sustainability. While first-class mail will continue its six-day delivery schedule, Royal Mail has 12 to 18 months to implement the changes, which also include slightly relaxed delivery targets. The move has been met with criticism from consumer groups who argue it will degrade service without guaranteeing reliability.</p>

          <p>A massive overnight Russian aerial assault on Kyiv has resulted in at least two fatalities and numerous injuries, according to Ukrainian officials. The attack involved a combination of missiles and hundreds of drones, causing widespread fires and damage to residential and public buildings, including a healthcare center. This assault followed another major attack earlier in the week, highlighting an escalation in Russia's air campaign. The events underscore the grim reality of the ongoing conflict and the diminishing prospects for a near-term diplomatic resolution.</p>

          <p>The upcoming "Superman" film, directed by James Gunn, reportedly portrays the iconic hero as a symbol of universal kindness rather than just American ideals, sparking debate among cultural commentators. The director's focus on a "battered" but good-hearted Superman who protects the weak globally has drawn criticism from some right-wing figures. This article explores the historical context of Superman as a creation of Jewish immigrants defending the oppressed and examines the ongoing culture war polarization between the DC and Marvel cinematic universes, connecting the hero's alien origin to contemporary immigration debates.</p>

          <p>The FBI is actively searching for a 32-year-old U.S. Marine Corps reservist, identified as the 12th suspect in an organized ambush on an ICE detention center in Texas. The incident, which occurred on July 4th, involved a group dressed in military-style gear firing upon officers, resulting in an Alvarado police officer being shot in the neck. The suspect is accused of firing AR-15 style rifles and is considered armed and dangerous, with a $25,000 reward offered for information leading to his arrest. Ten other individuals have already been charged in connection with the violent attack.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has temporarily stopped delivering its ID.Buzz electric van to the United States, according to media reports citing company sources. The decision is reportedly influenced by the Trump administration's steep 27.5% tariffs on European-built cars, which represents a significant increase from the previous rate. An unrelated safety recall concerning the vehicle's third-row seating, which does not meet US federal standards, is also a contributing factor. This move highlights the tangible impact of trade policy on international corporations and their product rollouts in the American market. (not investment advice)</p>

He stated that "Trump was right" in the sense that protecting the border is a fundamental duty of a nation, a point he wished President Biden had emphasized more forcefully.

          <p>Vienna is frequently cited as a model for successful housing policy, largely due to its extensive and stable social-housing sector, which comprises 43% of the city's housing units. This system, which caters to a wide range of income levels, results in significantly lower rent and higher quality housing compared to the private market. The article explains that this success is rooted in a long-term political commitment dating back to the 1920s, funded by mechanisms like a levy on employee salaries. While not without challenges, such as accessibility for newcomers, Vienna's approach demonstrates that prioritizing housing as a basic need can create a more stable urban environment.</p>

The announcement caused a significant spike in U.S. copper prices, creating a wide premium over the global market.

Anthony Pierce, a former Bishop of Swansea and Brecon already jailed for other offenses, faces new claims, with one victim stating concerns about him were ignored by the Church as early as 1986. The report details multiple accounts of abuse and subsequent institutional failure to act, prompting calls from victims for a full independent inquiry. The Church in Wales has apologized for any failings and stated it is committed to improving its safeguarding processes.</p>

          <p>An investigation by Global Witness reveals that some of the world's least-developed countries, including Somalia, Haiti, and Yemen, are paying millions to lobbying firms linked to Donald Trump. This spending is an apparent effort to offset the severe impact of US foreign aid cuts and to secure favorable deals, sometimes involving crucial natural resources. Since the dismantling of USAID, contracts worth over $17 million have been signed with lobbyists connected to the president. The report highlights a dynamic where vulnerable nations are forced into potentially exploitative dealmaking to gain humanitarian or military support from the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>Sir Jake Berry, a former Conservative Party chairman and cabinet minister, has announced his defection to Reform UK, delivering another significant blow to the Tories. In a scathing statement, Sir Jake, who was knighted by Boris Johnson, claimed that two decades of Labour and Tory rule have been deeply damaging to the country. His move follows several other former Conservative MPs who have joined Nigel Farage's party. The defection signals a growing momentum for Reform UK and is forcing the ruling Labour party to shift its strategic focus to counter the rising challenge from the right.</p>

          <p>Poland has implemented spot border checks at its crossings with Germany, mirroring a move made by Germany in 2023 and further straining the principle of free movement within the Schengen Area.

Commuters, students, and local businesses are experiencing delays and difficulties, undermining years of cross-border cooperation.

This measure, funded by unemployment insurance reserves, will be in effect until the end of the year.

President Trump has frequently vowed to lower egg prices, a key consumer concern amid broader inflation.
