          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 15:31:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran executed six death-row inmates on Saturday, alleging they carried out attacks in the country's oil-rich southwest on behalf of Israel, marking a continuation of a concerning trend. This action follows a recent Iran-Israel conflict, with Tehran having vowed to target enemies both domestically and abroad, intensifying its crackdown. Human rights activists express profound concern, emphasizing Iran's history of relying on coerced confessions and conducting closed-door trials in death penalty cases, particularly those involving allegations of links to Israel. These executions are part of a broader, rapid increase in capital punishment in Iran, a pace not witnessed since 1988, prompting strong international criticism.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing government shutdown has already cost taxpayers an estimated $1.2 billion by Friday, primarily due to the payment of 750,000 furloughed federal employees who are not actively working. Senator Joni Ernst highlighted this substantial financial burden, attributing the shutdown to Democrats' alleged demands for taxpayer-funded healthcare for undocumented immigrants. Democrats, however, vehemently deny these accusations, instead blaming Republicans for the budget impasse and accusing them of a "political stunt." The Trump administration and Republicans have consistently pinned responsibility on Democrats, with thousands of federal layoffs now anticipated as the shutdown continues with no immediate resolution in sight, exacerbating public frustration.</p>

          <p>President Trump has urged Hamas to "move quickly" on the Gaza peace plan, warning that "all bets will be off" if there is any delay, following an apparent reduction in Israeli military strikes. US negotiators are currently in Cairo to finalize the technical details of the 20-point plan, which Hamas has partially accepted, including a provision for immediate hostage release. Israeli Prime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope for all hostages to return by October 13, and ordered a reduction in military activity to facilitate their location. This article highlights the delicate stage of negotiations and the intense international pressure for a swift and comprehensive resolution to the protracted conflict.</p>

          <p>Jay Jones, Virginia's Democratic nominee for attorney general, is facing widespread bipartisan condemnation after inflammatory text messages from 2022 recently resurfaced. In the messages, Jones used disturbing and violent language, including a hypothetical scenario where he stated he would shoot then-Republican Speaker of the House of Delegates Todd Gilbert. Jones has since issued a deep and public apology, taking full responsibility for his words and confirming he has reached out to Gilbert directly. Both Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger and Republican opponent Winsome Earle-Sears have denounced the remarks, with some prominent figures calling for Jones to withdraw from the race entirely.</p>

          <p>Political analysts on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" discussed the current government shutdown, noting its potential differences and unique political implications compared to previous impasses. Ashley Parker suggested President Trump, despite not explicitly choosing the shutdown, perceives significant political benefits from the ongoing conflict, viewing it as an "opportunity for the deconstruction of the administrative state." However, she also highlighted internal concerns within his administration about potential negative blowback and public disapproval if such a strategy were fully implemented.

          <p>A 30-year-old Rochester man sustained life-threatening injuries during an altercation outside Lush Resto Lounge in Irondequoit, New York, in the early hours of Saturday morning. Police responded to reports of multiple fights, and the man subsequently crashed through a front plate glass window of the building, suffering a serious laceration to his torso, including a liver injury. It remains unclear how the man sustained the injury – whether directly from an assault inside the building or as a direct result of the crash through the glass. The investigation is ongoing with no arrests made, and authorities are also investigating the lounge's operations due to an apparent lack of a valid New York State liquor license.</p>
