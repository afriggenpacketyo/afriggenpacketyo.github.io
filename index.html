          <p>A 16-year-old from Colchester, England, has fully immersed himself in the culture of the 1940s, a passion that began with his childhood interest in the world wars. For the past two years, he has exclusively worn clothing from the era, listens to its music, and even rides a 1939 bicycle. He works at a 1940s-themed tea room, where his knowledge and authentic appearance are admired by customers and his employer. His family supports his unique passion, helping him collect memorabilia, and he hopes to one day live in a home decorated entirely with period-appropriate items and antique appliances.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a bill to rescind $9 billion in federal funding, a key request from the Trump administration. The legislation, which now goes to the president, targets approximately $8 billion in foreign aid programs and $1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The vote of 216-213 was largely along party lines and occurred after hours of delay caused by debates over releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The Senate had previously passed a slightly amended version of the bill, securing a legislative victory for the administration on its fiscal priorities.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 00:17:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Congress has approved a $9 billion spending cut package that eliminates all federal support for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which funds NPR and PBS. The move rescinds $1.1 billion allocated for the next two years, a decision NPR's CEO called an "irreversible loss" that will dismantle local civic institutions. While NPR itself receives a small portion of its budget from federal funds, many of its member stations, particularly in rural and underserved communities, rely heavily on this support and may be forced to shut down. Proponents of the cut have long criticized public media for perceived political bias.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has strongly criticized U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods. Trump linked the tariffs to the demand that legal charges against former President Jair Bolsonaro be dropped, an action Lula described as a grave attack on Brazil's national sovereignty. In a televised address, Lula labeled the threat "unacceptable blackmail" and referred to Brazilian politicians supporting Trump as "traitors to the homeland." The diplomatic dispute unfolds as the Trump administration reportedly considers sanctions against a key Brazilian Supreme Court judge involved in the Bolsonaro case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on turning 35 and the realization that adulthood is a continuous process of 'becoming' rather than a destination. Using the French comedy series "Bref" as a cultural touchstone, he explores how life's pace and priorities shift from the chaotic energy of one's 20s to the deeper, more complex themes of middle age. The author, an American immigrant in France, discusses grappling with identity, regret, and the importance of chosen family. He concludes that while he doesn't have all the answers, life is about building a personal narrative, brick by brick, in a world that is often chaotic and troubling.</p>

Using 5,000 yuan (about $700), he purchased steel plates, an engine, and a battery, and secretly constructed the submarine.

          <p>CBS has announced that 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' will conclude its run in May 2025, when the host's contract expires. During a taping, Colbert informed his audience that the show is not being replaced but is simply ending its tenure on the network. The decision comes shortly after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount Global's $16 million settlement with Donald Trump. While the network stated the cancellation was a financial decision unrelated to the show's content, the timing has drawn skepticism from fans and political figures, who have called for more transparency regarding the move.</p>

          <p>President Trump has asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the unsealing of grand jury testimony related to the prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein, a move that requires court approval. The announcement came shortly after The Wall Street Journal reported on a lewd letter allegedly sent from Trump to Epstein in 2003, which the president has denied. While federal rules typically keep grand jury transcripts secret, the administration is responding to growing pressure from its base to release more information. Critics, however, argue that releasing only transcripts would be insufficient and that other evidence like witness interviews, emails, and videos should also be made public.</p>

          <p>A report from a Beijing-based think tank indicates that China's progress toward a market-based economy has declined, with its marketization index falling in 2023. The most significant drop was in the area of government-market relations, suggesting increased state intervention in the economy. Chinese economists are now urging for renewed pro-market reforms to address economic imbalances and intense domestic competition. The lead researcher highlighted the change as significant and stressed the need for action to reverse the trend, which marks a retreat from the peak level of marketization observed in 2021.</p>

Authorities state the man seized control of a small Cessna aircraft by threatening a flight instructor at Victoria International Airport and flew it to Vancouver. The event prompted the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) to scramble F-15 fighter jets before the plane landed safely.

          <p>Japan's core inflation, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a slight moderation in rice price increases after the government released stockpiles, though the overall inflation rate remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the 39th consecutive month. Despite the slowdown, economists note that persistent inflationary pressures and potential yen depreciation remain concerns for consumer spending and the broader economic outlook. The data adds complexity to the central bank's future policy decisions amid growth concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This analysis piece argues that the cancellation of 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' may be part of a pattern of CBS and its parent company, Paramount, capitulating to political pressure from the Trump administration. The author suggests that the network's stated "financial decision" is questionable, given Colbert's strong ratings and the timing relative to other events. The article cites Paramount's eagerness to secure federal approval for its merger with Skydance, its multi-million dollar settlement of a lawsuit from Trump, and the departure of the head of '60 Minutes' as evidence that the network is sacrificing its journalistic and editorial independence.</p>

          <p>China has debuted a new military drone capable of taking off and landing vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket, which gives it enhanced operational flexibility. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) transitions to horizontal flight after its vertical launch and can operate without a runway, making it ideal for remote or rugged terrain. Developed by a state-owned aerospace group, the drone was recently tested for reconnaissance and situational awareness in a mountainous region. Its intelligent control system demonstrated autonomous capabilities, including route planning and threat avoidance, which are crucial for controlling drone swarms in complex environments.</p>

He framed the technology as an opportunity to enhance creativity and enable high-quality effects for productions with smaller budgets.

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), described as a common and benign vein condition. The announcement followed public speculation prompted by images showing the president with swollen lower legs and a bruised hand. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that medical tests confirmed CVI, which occurs when leg veins have difficulty sending blood back to the heart, and ruled out more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis. A letter from the presidential physician affirmed that Trump remains in excellent health, as both he and his predecessor face scrutiny over their fitness for office.</p>

          <p>The state of California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following its decision to cancel $4 billion in federal funding for the state's high-speed rail project. The lawsuit, filed by the state's attorney general, claims the administration's action was "arbitrary and capricious" and motivated by President Trump's "personal animus" toward the project. Governor Gavin Newsom called the move a "political stunt" and a "heartless attack on the Central Valley" that will jeopardize jobs. The administration cited significant project failures, budget shortfalls, and missed deadlines as the basis for pulling the funds, a finding the California High-Speed Rail Authority disputes.</p>

          <p>In response to growing pressure from his political base, President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek court approval to unseal grand jury testimony from the Jeffrey Epstein case. Bondi confirmed she was prepared to file the motion, a move that comes as Trump attempts to manage the political fallout from the controversy. The president has shifted his narrative, now claiming without evidence that Democrats doctored the files and calling the entire saga a "hoax" intended to damage him. This has put him at odds with some supporters and Republican figures who continue to demand full transparency and the release of all documents.</p>

          <p>A former senior intelligence officer for the Defense Intelligence Agency has called China's experimentation with creating biologically enhanced soldiers a "disturbing" reality. The comments follow a U.S. senator's claim that China is attempting to create soldiers with modified physiology and behavior, a concept likened to science fiction. The former officer, Nicholas Eftimiades, noted that while the idea is not new, it is concerning that the research is being conducted by the People's Liberation Army. He emphasized that the full extent of China's efforts and any accomplishments in this area remain unknown, highlighting a significant intelligence gap for the United States.</p>

          <p>An Israeli military strike hit the Holy Family Church, the only Catholic parish in the Gaza Strip, resulting in at least three deaths and injuring ten others, including the parish priest. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem condemned the targeting of a sacred place sheltering hundreds of displaced civilians, including both Christians and Muslims. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged the strike was a mistake caused by "stray ammunition" and expressed deep regret for the loss of innocent life.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's public criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stems primarily from the central bank's decision to maintain relatively high interest rates to combat inflation. Trump, who has reportedly discussed firing Powell, argues that rates should be cut immediately to lower borrowing costs and stimulate economic growth. This article explains the role of the independent Federal Reserve, its dual mandate of controlling inflation and maximizing employment, and the legal complexities of removing a Fed chair. While a president can express displeasure, firing a chair "for cause" is legally untested and could destabilize financial markets, a risk Trump himself has acknowledged.</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted raids at a Home Depot and other sites in Sacramento, California, in what appeared to be a deliberate challenge to the state's sanctuary laws. A Border Patrol chief recorded a video in front of the state capitol, declaring there is "no such thing as a sanctuary state." The operation resulted in 11 arrests and was immediately condemned by Governor Gavin Newsom's office as illegal racial profiling. The raids occurred despite a recent federal court injunction blocking agents from using racial profiling for warrantless arrests, raising questions about whether the agency was violating the judge's order.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized Juul Labs to continue selling its tobacco- and menthol-flavored e-cigarette products. The agency concluded that the products could benefit public health by providing a less harmful alternative for adult smokers who switch completely from traditional cigarettes. This decision reverses a 2022 marketing denial order and comes after years of controversy in which Juul was blamed for fueling the teen vaping epidemic. Anti-tobacco groups heavily criticized the decision, calling it a step in the wrong direction, while Juul hailed it as an important milestone for providing regulated options for adult tobacco users.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna has stated that his department has "no choice" but to comply with federal judicial warrants from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He clarified that these warrants, which are signed by a judge and involve criminal charges, are distinct from civil detainer requests, which the department does not honor under sanctuary policies. Luna reassured the community that his deputies do not assist with ICE street operations, but must legally transfer inmates when presented with a valid judicial warrant for serious crimes like attempted murder or sexual assault. The remarks came amid community concerns over cooperation with federal immigration authorities.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on social media that he has secured an agreement with Coca-Cola to begin producing its signature soda with "REAL Cane Sugar" instead of high-fructose corn syrup. While the company has yet to officially confirm the specifics, the move is seen as a political win for Trump, aligning with the "Make America healthy again" movement championed by figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This article notes that while many consumers prefer the taste of cane sugar-sweetened Coke, public health experts point out that both sweeteners have nearly identical metabolic effects. The change is largely symbolic, as sugar-sweetened beverages remain a major health concern regardless of the sugar's source.</p>

The decision has sparked a significant backlash on Chinese social media, with many users questioning the university's right to police a student's private life and labeling the action as misogynistic and nationalistic. The incident is reportedly linked to videos posted online by a professional Ukrainian gamer showing him with an Asian woman.

This follows the recent, immediate removal of the requirement for passengers to take off their shoes during security screening.
