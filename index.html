          <p>A new book, "Chinese Encounters with America," profiles 12 individuals who were part of a more optimistic era of U.S.-China engagement. The book's editors argue that the rise of China as a major power has led to a climate of fear and distrust, replacing the previous focus on shared interests and cooperation. Through stories of academics, diplomats, and artists, the volume serves as a reminder of the mutual benefits that once defined the relationship. The editors hope these accounts will underscore the value of finding common ground despite the current geopolitical rivalry.</p>

          <p>Nikos Michaloliakos, the convicted leader of Greece's neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, has been granted early release from prison, now serving the rest of his 13-year sentence at home on health grounds. The decision has drawn condemnation from left-wing parties, who argue that the judiciary is showing undue clemency to the leader of an organization found guilty of murder and violent attacks. Michaloliakos, a known Holocaust denier, presided over a party that was legally designated a criminal enterprise. Critics are calling for the decision to be overturned, stating it sends a message of impunity for fascism and hatred.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel faced scrutiny for incorrectly announcing that a suspect in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk was in custody, only to retract the statement hours later. While the FBI successfully apprehended the actual suspect the following day, the initial misstep fueled criticism about Patel's leadership and apparent focus on social media. Some conservative figures questioned his fitness for the role, though sources suggest the error occurred in the "fog of war" of a rapidly evolving investigation. A spokesperson for Patel defended his actions, emphasizing that the ultimate mission to achieve justice was successful.</p>

          <p>Peter Mandelson, the United Kingdom's ambassador to the U.S., has been recalled from his post after emails revealed the depth of his supportive relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The correspondence, published after Epstein's 2008 conviction, showed Mandelson expressing fury over the situation and calling Epstein his "best pal." This revelation created a political crisis for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had initially defended the appointment.

          <p>The city of Santa Monica has declared itself in fiscal distress, facing a financial crisis driven by hundreds of millions of dollars in legal settlements for sexual abuse claims. The payouts, related to a former police dispatcher who preyed on children for decades, have already cost the city $229 million, with 180 claims still pending. This financial strain is compounded by a post-pandemic economic downturn, including declining tourism and retail revenues. While city officials have tried to reassure employees that layoffs are not planned, the declaration highlights the severe budget challenges Santa Monica faces.</p>

          <p>An American woman recently released from Taliban custody has issued a dire warning about the health of an elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, who remain imprisoned in Afghanistan. Faye Hall, who was arrested with the couple in February, stated they are "literally dying" and that their health has deteriorated rapidly due to poor conditions. The couple, aged 80 and 76, have lived in Afghanistan for years and do not know why they are being held. The UN has called their detention inhumane, while the UK Foreign Office says its ability to provide support is "severely limited."</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is set to undergo significant changes, starting with the elimination of all paper check payments by September 30, a move initiated by a presidential executive order to reduce costs and fraud. Beneficiaries will now need to use direct deposit or a Direct Express debit card. Furthermore, five additional changes are anticipated for January 1, including a projected 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for all recipients. Other adjustments include increases to the maximum taxable earnings cap for high earners and raised income thresholds for early filers and disability recipients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following an incursion of over a dozen Russian drones into Polish airspace, NATO has launched a new mission to bolster its eastern flank. Denmark, France, and Germany have committed fighter jets and a warship to support Poland's air defense, with other allies expected to join. The incident, which Warsaw called a deliberate act, has significantly heightened tensions, with Poland's Prime Minister stating it was "the closest we have been to open conflict since World War Two." The move signals the alliance's resolve to defend its territory amid Moscow's escalating actions in the region.</p>

          <p>The village of Kirants in Armenia has been divided by a concrete border wall following a border demarcation process with Azerbaijan based on old Soviet maps. The wall, erected in 2024, has resulted in some villagers losing their homes and farmers losing access to their land, leading to economic hardship. While the move sparked political protests in Armenia, residents of Kirants report that the area has been peaceful since the wall was built, a stark contrast to the frequent gunfire during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. However, despite the current calm, many villagers remain anxious about their long-term security.</p>

          <p>Two-time major champion John Daly has set an unfortunate PGA Tour Champions record by scoring a 19 on a single par-5 hole during the Sanford International. The incident occurred on the 12th hole at Minnehaha Country Club, where Daly reportedly hit seven consecutive shots into a water hazard. This score surpassed his previous personal high of 18, which he recorded at the 1998 Bay Hill Invitational after hitting six balls into the water. The disastrous hole contributed to a final round score of 88 for the 59-year-old golfer, marking a memorable but painful moment in his colorful career.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues Epstein's Culture of Exploitation Was Mainstream Before Modern Feminism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a commentary piece, writer Rebecca Solnit reflects on the cultural normalization of sexually exploiting teenage girls in the 1970s and 80s, arguing that the culture revealed by the Jeffrey Epstein scandal was once pervasive. The article cites examples from movies like "Manhattan" and "Taxi Driver," the "baby groupie" rock scene, and a general societal attitude that often blamed child victims. Solnit contends that the rise of feminism was crucial in challenging these norms by establishing the principles of consent, recognizing power imbalances, and denormalizing sexual abuse. The Epstein birthday album is presented as a late relic of this pre-feminist era.</p>

The e-commerce platform JD.com reported that sales in the first minute surpassed the entire first-day volume of last year's iPhone 16 series. The high demand caused Apple's official website to experience technical difficulties, with customers reporting slow payment processing.

          <p>U.S. health authorities are growing concerned as Chagas disease, a parasitic illness typically found in South America, is being detected more frequently across the country, with cases in at least eight states. The disease is spread by the "kissing bug," and the CDC is considering classifying it as endemic, meaning it is now a permanent health risk in the U.S. The infection can lead to serious, life-threatening cardiac and digestive problems years after the initial, often asymptomatic, phase. The WHO estimates over seven million people are infected worldwide, and its spread into the U.S. is prompting increased attention.</p>
