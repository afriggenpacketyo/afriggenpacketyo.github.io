CEO Sanjay Poonen stated the company aims for a valuation that could rival its competitor Rubrik, currently valued at around $17 billion. This move follows Cohesity's 2024 merger with Veritas's data protection unit, a strategic decision to become the market share leader before going public. The company's focus is on demonstrating a full financial year of combined performance to attract public market investors. (not investment advice)</p>

The iconic yellow railway car, known as the Gloria funicular, veered off its tracks and crashed into a building during the evening rush hour. Authorities have described it as one of the worst accidents in the city's recent history and have launched an investigation into the cause.

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has imposed significant anti-dumping tariffs on several American fiber-optic firms, including Corning and OFS Fitel. The duties, which range from 33.3% to 78.2%, took effect immediately and are a response to what Beijing describes as trade circumvention practices by U.S. exporters. This move was announced shortly after the United States sanctioned a Chinese chemical producer over allegations related to fentanyl. The action represents an escalation in the ongoing trade friction between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>The Nasdaq stock exchange has proposed new rules that would make it more difficult for small Chinese companies to list in the United States. The change would require companies operating primarily in China to raise at least $25 million from their initial public offering. This proposal aims to address compliance concerns and protect U.S. investors from the risks associated with microcap listings that have shown higher rates of manipulative trading. The move reflects growing regulatory scrutiny and the complex financial relationship between the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has reversed a lower court's decision, upholding an Illinois law that prohibits carrying firearms on public transportation. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the decade-old ban is constitutional and consistent with the historical tradition of regulating firearms in sensitive and crowded locations. The ruling cited the unique environment of public transit, such as buses and trains, as justification for the restriction. The case, which was brought by gun rights advocates, is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner faces a potential fine from tax authorities in addition to the £40,000 in underpaid stamp duty she has admitted to owing. Tax experts indicate that HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) could levy a penalty for "carelessness" if it is determined she did not take reasonable care, which could amount to an additional £12,000. The issue centers on the purchase of her flat in Hove and complex tax rules related to a trust for her son. The case has put Rayner under political pressure and prompted an inquiry by the prime minister's standards adviser.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France is facing increasing scrutiny over its fiscal health, with some economists now viewing its outlook as more concerning than that of Italy, a country historically known for economic instability. France's budget deficit, at 5.8% of GDP, is significantly higher than Italy's 3.4%, despite having a lower overall debt-to-GDP ratio. The political turmoil surrounding Prime Minister Francois Bayrou's attempt to pass a contentious 2026 budget has amplified these concerns. This situation marks a reversal of roles, as Italy under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has experienced a period of relative political and economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

The author questions a Taiwanese official's statement that the parade was a waste of money, suggesting the DPP should logically prefer China to spend on spectacle rather than on actual military drills aimed at the island. The piece frames the criticism as a sign of the DPP's political weakness following recent electoral setbacks. It characterizes the DPP's ideological attacks on Beijing as increasingly incoherent.</p>

          <h2>Notoriety of Angola Prison Was a Factor in its Selection for ICE Detainee Facility, DHS Secretary Says</h2>

          <p>Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that the notorious reputation of Louisiana's Angola prison was a deliberate factor in its selection as a new facility for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees. Speaking at the newly opened "Louisiana Lockup," Noem said the choice was intended to send a message and encourage self-deportation among those in the U.S. illegally. The facility, located within the infamous state penitentiary, will house those described as the "most dangerous" detainees. The move is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to expand detention capacity for its immigration enforcement operations.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: China's Military Display and Shifting Alliances Highlight Risks of Trump's Trade Policies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis suggests that President Trump's "America First" trade policy is creating significant geopolitical risks, as evidenced by recent events in China. The massive military parade in Beijing, attended by leaders from Russia and North Korea, is presented as a clear signal of a new, rising power center challenging the U.S.-led order. Furthermore, warming relations between China, Russia, and India, spurred by shared opposition to U.S. tariffs, illustrate how global alignments are shifting. The article posits that these developments, combined with domestic legal challenges to the tariffs, show the potential dangers of Trump's high-risk economic strategy.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Rules Trump Administration's Funding Cuts to Harvard Were Unconstitutional</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 23:30:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has overturned the Trump administration's decision to cut approximately $2 billion in research funding to Harvard University. Judge Allison Burroughs ruled that the government violated the university's First Amendment free speech rights by revoking the grants. The administration had frozen the funding in April, accusing the university of antisemitism and ideological bias. While the judge acknowledged that Harvard should have done more to combat antisemitism, she concluded the government's actions were an "ideologically-motivated assault" rather than a genuine effort to address the issue. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling.</p>

Speaking at the U.S. Capitol, the survivors shared emotional testimony and called on lawmakers to release all remaining government files related to the convicted sex offender's case.
