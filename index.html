          <p>A skydiving plane carrying 15 individuals crashed near Cross Keys Airport in New Jersey, resulting in injuries to all aboard, with three people remaining in critical condition. Officials noted it was remarkable that no fatalities occurred, attributing the effective emergency response in part to recent mass casualty training at the same airport. The aircraft, a Cessna 208B, had a history of incidents, including a 2023 crash in Virginia that the NTSB determined was due to an inadequate landing flare. The FAA and NTSB are now investigating the cause of this latest crash, which occurred just minutes after takeoff.</p>

          <p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries delivered a marathon speech lasting over seven hours to protest a major legislative package backed by the Trump administration. Speaking from the House floor, Jeffries sharply criticized the bill as an "immoral document," focusing on its projected cuts to Medicaid, which the CBO estimates could cause millions to lose health insurance. He argued the legislation prioritizes the wealthy at the expense of children, seniors, and working families, framing the Democratic opposition as a moral stand for the American people. The speech utilized a special procedure, delaying the final vote on the bill.</p>

          <p>As students and families prepare for the 2025-26 academic year, a key decision involves choosing between federal and private student loans. Federal loans for the upcoming year offer fixed rates of 6.39% for undergraduates, but private lenders are advertising rates as low as 3.2% for borrowers with excellent credit or a qualified co-signer. While private loans can offer substantial savings, they lack the robust borrower protections of federal loans, such as income-driven repayment plans and forgiveness programs. Experts suggest federal loans are a solid starting point, but comparing offers from private lenders is crucial for potentially lowering the overall cost of borrowing. (not investment advice)</p>

Lawmakers like Rep.

Despite their public pushback, these members were unable to secure immediate changes to the legislation but framed their eventual support as a win for conservative principles and a commitment to the president's agenda.</p>

The article alleges that Brennan pushed to include the discredited Steele dossier in the 2016 Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian election interference, despite internal warnings about its credibility, because it fit a desired narrative. Wright claims Brennan controlled the report's drafting, rushed its completion, and widely disseminated it to ensure leaks, constituting an attempt to subvert a democratically elected president.

The case emerged after an underwater archaeology expert spotted suspicious gold ingots for sale at a U.S. auction, which were later traced back to the couple.

          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated continued resilience by adding 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' expectations and signaling economic strength despite the ongoing trade war initiated by the Trump administration. The unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.1%, with notable job gains in state government and healthcare. While the robust numbers have surprised some economists who anticipated a slowdown due to tariffs, other data suggests some employers are showing hesitancy in creating new positions. The White House has downplayed the economic impact of the tariffs as a key deadline for their potential expansion approaches next week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's major tax and spending bill contains several provisions that will significantly benefit wealthy Americans, according to tax experts. The legislation is expected to increase the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions to $40,000 for those earning under $500,000 while preserving a popular workaround for business owners. It also expands benefits for investors in qualified small businesses and makes the higher estate tax exemption permanent. While most Americans will see some benefit from the extension of the 2017 tax cuts, high-income earners are projected to receive the largest boost in after-tax income. (not investment advice)</p>

The office is the only U.S. intelligence component specifically tasked with sharing threat information with state and local partners. Critics argue that weakening the agency will undermine the ability to detect and prevent threats from foreign extremists and transnational criminal organizations.</p>

The author argues that the committee chairman shielded Bove from questioning about his controversial past, including allegations of abusive behavior as a prosecutor and his role in politically charged decisions at the Justice Department. The presence of top DOJ officials at the hearing is framed as an act of intimidation to ensure Republican senators vote for the nominee, who the author portrays as a loyalist being rewarded for his service to Trump.</p>

          <p>Drawing on the wisdom of the Roman philosopher Cicero, this article explores the timeless argument that virtuous behavior is the most reliable path to both worldly success and personal happiness. In his work "On Duties," Cicero contended that there is no conflict between doing what is morally right and achieving what is personally beneficial in the long run. He argued that while unethical shortcuts might offer temporary gains, they ultimately harm one's character and reputation. Modern social science supports this view, showing that traits like loyalty, honesty, and generosity are consistently linked to higher life satisfaction and stronger relationships.</p>

          <p>Chelsea faces a significant setback ahead of its Club World Cup quarter-final against Palmeiras, as key midfielder MoisÃ©s Caicedo is suspended for the match. Caicedo received a yellow card for dissent in the previous game, triggering a one-game ban that leaves a major hole in the team's lineup. The durable Ecuadorian, who started every Premier League game last season, is considered the linchpin of Chelsea's midfield, and his absence forces manager Enzo Maresca into a difficult tactical decision. The team will now have to find a way to compensate for the loss of its best tackler against formidable Brazilian opposition.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is working to reassure markets and her party after she was seen in tears in the House of Commons, an event that caused a brief, unfavorable market reaction. While Reeves attributed the emotional moment to a personal issue and insisted she is fully capable of her job, the episode has highlighted underlying political tensions. A significant faction of Labour MPs is at odds with her commitment to fiscal restraint, particularly concerning welfare policy. This fundamental disagreement between the chancellor's market-focused approach and her party's spending desires presents a major ongoing challenge for the government.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has claimed a significant military success, reporting that a missile strike killed the deputy commander of Russia's navy, Major General Mikhail Gudkov, in the Russian city of Kursk. The morale boost for Kyiv comes at a difficult time, as the Trump administration announced a pause on some weapons deliveries to Ukraine, sparking alarm in Kyiv and uncertainty among NATO allies. Ukrainian officials are seeking clarification from the U.S. on the aid reduction, stressing that any delay in support only encourages further Russian aggression. The Kremlin, meanwhile, called the U.S. move a logical and overdue step.</p>

          <p>The legal and political fight over untraceable, self-assembled "ghost guns" is set to continue despite a Supreme Court decision that upheld a Biden-era rule requiring serial numbers and background checks for the kits. Gun rights groups see openings for future challenges, and the Trump administration has ordered a review of all Biden-era gun regulations, including the ghost gun rule. Activists like Cody Wilson are already marketing new products and filing motions to block the rule's enforcement, seeking to establish a Second Amendment right to build firearms. Gun control advocates worry this is part of a broader strategy to dismantle all firearm regulations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market's expansion in June was largely driven by the government sector, which added 73,000 jobs, accounting for about half of the total payroll growth for the month. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, hiring was particularly strong at the state and local levels, mostly in education. In contrast, the federal government continued to shrink, shedding another 7,000 jobs as part of the Trump administration's job-cutting initiatives. The healthcare and social assistance sector also saw significant growth, adding over 58,000 positions, making it the second-largest contributor to the month's job gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jimmy Swaggart, the prominent American televangelist known for his fiery preaching style, has died at the age of 90. His highly successful television ministry, which reached 140 countries and generated massive revenues, collapsed spectacularly in the late 1980s and early 1990s after two separate sex scandals involving prostitutes. Previously, Swaggart had been a harsh critic of other preachers' moral failings. After being defrocked by the Assemblies of God, he continued as an independent preacher, though his national influence was greatly diminished. He is survived by his wife and son, who took over his ministry.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing expectations and demonstrating the labor market's continued strength despite broader economic uncertainty. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February. Job growth was primarily driven by the government and health care sectors, while federal employment continued to decline due to significant agency cuts. While the report is a positive sign, economists expect growth to slow in the second half of the year, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell citing potential headwinds from the administration's tariff policies.

          <h2>Analysis: Which Savings Vehicle Earns More on a $10,000 Deposit?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 11:41:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comparison of current interest rates shows that a high-yield savings account would narrowly outperform a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) for a $10,000 deposit over various terms. For example, over 18 months, a savings account at 4.30% would earn slightly more than an 18-month CD at 4.26%. However, this calculation assumes interest rates remain constant, which is unlikely. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates soon, the fixed rate of a CD could prove more profitable in the long run than the variable rate of a savings account, making it a potentially smarter choice to lock in a high rate now.
