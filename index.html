        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has formally asked the Supreme Court to review a lower court's decision that deemed most of his "reciprocal tariffs" illegal. The appeal follows a federal appeals court ruling which found that the president overstepped his authority by using emergency economic powers, stating that the power to impose tariffs rests exclusively with Congress. The administration argues the lower court's ruling undermines the president's ability to conduct diplomacy and protect national security, setting the stage for a significant legal battle over executive power.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy has restored the retired rank of rear admiral for Rep. Ronny Jackson, a former White House physician who served under Presidents Obama and Trump. This decision overturns a 2022 demotion that followed a Pentagon inspector general's report detailing allegations of inappropriate behavior, including making denigrating comments and violating alcohol policies. Jackson, who has consistently denied the allegations and called them a "political hit job," celebrated the reinstatement of his one-star admiral rank.</p>

          <p>A bill has advanced to the Texas governor's desk that would permit state residents to file civil lawsuits against out-of-state providers who supply abortion-inducing drugs within Texas. The measure, which specifies that the pregnant woman herself cannot be sued, is designed to enforce the state's abortion ban by targeting the supply chain of medication abortion. Opponents argue the bill aims to intimidate providers in other states and is almost certain to face significant legal challenges if signed into law.</p>

          <p>Argentine authorities have successfully recovered 'Portrait of a Lady,' an 18th-century painting by Giuseppe Ghislandi that was looted by the Nazis during World War II. The artwork, which belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker, was discovered after it appeared in an online real estate listing for a home owned by the daughter of a senior Nazi lawyer. This recovery marks a significant step in the ongoing international effort to repatriate cultural artifacts stolen during the war.</p>

          <p>In an effort to stimulate its local economy, the Chinese city of Shaoxing is offering financial subsidies to residents who host large banquets. The policy provides up to 5,000 yuan to individuals who host events with five or more tables and spend over 10,000 yuan, targeting the catering sector to boost consumption. This initiative reflects the challenge faced by local governments in China to encourage spending while also adhering to national anti-corruption campaigns that discourage official extravagance.</p>

          <p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC), a federation representing most UK trade unions, is calling on the government to consider a range of wealth taxes in its upcoming budget. The TUC's general secretary proposed new levies on bank windfall profits, online gaming companies, and overall wealth to help fund public services. In response, the Treasury indicated that it believes the current tax system, which includes recent increases on private jets and second homes, already strikes the right balance.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates has issued a stark warning to Israel, declaring that any move to annex the occupied West Bank would be considered a "red line" and would severely damage the spirit of the Abraham Accords. A senior Emirati official stated that annexation would be the "death knell" for a two-state solution. The warning was delivered after Israel's far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, presented a proposal to apply Israeli sovereignty over approximately 82% of the West Bank.</p>
