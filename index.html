        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial analyst Jim Cramer has identified the upcoming week as pivotal for the market's direction for the rest of the summer. Investors are closely watching several key events, including a meeting of the Federal Reserve, the latest nonfarm payrolls report, and quarterly earnings from tech giants like Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. Cramer suggests that the outcomes of these events, particularly the Fed's stance on inflation and the performance of Big Tech, will be significant determinants of market trends. The analysis also touches on earnings from other sectors, which will provide insights into the broader economic impact of tariffs and consumer spending habits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former "MasterChef" presenter Gregg Wallace has been sacked following an investigation that upheld numerous allegations of inappropriate behavior, including unwelcome physical contact and crude language. In his first interview since the dismissal, Wallace apologized to anyone he hurt but insisted he is "not a groper, a sex pest or a flasher." He attributed some of his comments to his background but denied the more severe claims against him. Wallace also defended his former co-host, John Torode, who was also axed over a racism allegation, stating that Torode is not a racist despite their strained professional relationship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire talks has stalled, with the U.S. envoy recalling the negotiating team and blaming Hamas for a lack of good faith. The negotiations are deadlocked over Hamas's demand for a full Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war in exchange for hostages, a condition Israel rejects. Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached catastrophic levels, with the United Nations and other aid organizations reporting that children are starving to death. The U.N. states that aid entering the territory is only at 6% of pre-war levels, and access is severely hampered by Israeli restrictions and the breakdown of order.</p>

          <p>In a modern twist on civic duty, the U.S. Treasury Department is now allowing Americans to make contributions to pay down the national debt using the mobile payment app Venmo. This new, youth-friendly option is an addition to the long-standing "Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt" program, which accepts payments via PayPal, credit card, and other methods. The national debt currently stands at over $36 trillion, having increased every year since 2001. While public contributions have amounted to over $67 million since 1996, this represents only a tiny fraction of the government's annual spending, making the initiative more symbolic than impactful.</p>

He expressed gratitude for his time with the Dodgers and the warm reception he still receives from fans. While he showed interest in staying with the Dodgers, the team pursued other pitchers, leading to his one-year contract with Boston, a move neither side appears to regret as both have found their respective paths forward.</p>

The Trump administration has argued that such children are not "subject to the jurisdiction" of the United States and thus not entitled to citizenship under the 14th Amendment.

          <p>Twenty-five years after 'Big Brother' first aired, a genre once dismissed as superficial is now being re-evaluated by some psychologists and sociologists for its positive impacts. This article explores how reality TV, by casting a diverse range of ordinary people, can foster greater social understanding and empathy for perspectives outside one's own experience. The format has brought issues like disability awareness, mental health, and coercive control into mainstream conversation. Experts suggest that even constructed scenarios can be valuable, as they prompt viewers to test moral boundaries and reflect on complex social dynamics, potentially leading to broader societal discussions.</p>

          <p>The worldwide popularity of matcha, the powdered Japanese green tea, has exploded, leading to a significant strain on global supplies. Driven by social media trends and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, demand for matcha is outstripping production, causing prices to rise and retailers to limit purchases. The situation is worsened by smaller crop yields in Japan due to recent heatwaves and an aging population of tea farmers. This has sparked a movement for more mindful consumption, with advocates urging consumers to use lower-grade matcha for cooking and to savor high-grade tea in its pure form, respecting the centuries-old tradition behind its creation.</p>

Intense fighting between local Druze militias and Bedouin clans, which escalated with the involvement of government-aligned forces and Israeli airstrikes, has left an estimated 1,380 people dead and displaced over 120,000. The conflict, which reportedly began with tit-for-tat kidnappings, has turned the city into a slaughterhouse, with reports of summary executions and indiscriminate shelling.

After more than a year of sustained food insecurity, the population's physical resilience is exhausted, making them highly susceptible to death from hunger and opportunistic diseases. The current aid flow, managed primarily by the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, is described as wholly inadequate, with distribution models that force desperate people to risk their lives at Israeli military perimeters.

Since his appointment, Essayli has aggressively pursued the Trump administration's agenda, filing lawsuits challenging local sanctuary policies and protections for transgender athletes, and targeting pro-immigration protesters. His tenure has been marked by mass departures of career prosecutors, who cite a demoralizing and politically charged work environment. As his temporary appointment nears its end, his supporters praise his zealousness while critics warn of the dangers of his potential permanent confirmation.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight bound for Las Vegas experienced a sudden, sharp descent of nearly 500 feet shortly after taking off from Burbank Airport. The maneuver was reportedly executed to comply with onboard traffic alerts and avoid a potential mid-air collision with another jet flying at a similar altitude. The incident, which occurred over the Angeles National Forest, caused panic among passengers, with one describing it as a feeling of free fall. Two flight attendants who were not buckled in at the time sustained injuries, and the Federal Aviation Administration has launched an investigation into the near miss.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is holding a large-scale and controversial recall vote, known as the "dabamian," targeting more than 30 lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party. The vote was initiated by a civic movement, known as the Bluebird movement, which accuses the KMT of being too close to Beijing and using its legislative majority to obstruct the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The outcome has the potential to alter the balance of power in Taiwan's parliament and has deeply divided society. The KMT has denied the accusations, alleging the recall is a politically motivated attempt by the DPP to overturn January's election results.</p>

          <p>The New Orleans jail, already under scrutiny for a mass escape of 10 inmates in May, has mistakenly released another detainee. Officials stated that due to a clerical error and a failure to properly verify identity, 30-year-old Khalil Bryan was released instead of another inmate with the same last name. The sheriff's office took full responsibility for the "unacceptable lapse," which they attributed to human error, and pledged disciplinary action. The incident adds to the intense political pressure on Sheriff Susan Hutson, whose facility has been under a federal consent decree for years to improve its dangerous and deficient conditions.</p>

Factors like school reputation, program rankings, and financial aid are becoming more critical in their decision-making process.

Santos pleaded guilty to a host of federal charges, including wire fraud and identity theft, following revelations that he had fabricated large parts of his resume and personal history. An investigation found he had misused campaign funds to finance a lavish lifestyle and illegally claimed unemployment benefits. His case led to his expulsion from Congress in 2023, making him only the sixth member in U.S. history to be removed by his peers, marking a dramatic end to his short-lived political career.</p>

An Arizona court found her guilty of conspiring with her late brother to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, in 2019, and of conspiring to kill her niece's ex-husband in a separate failed shooting attempt. Prosecutors argued the motives were financial gain and her desire to be with her current husband, Chad Daybell, using their "twisted" religious beliefs as justification. During sentencing, the judge condemned her manipulative actions and the "wake of destruction" she left across multiple states.</p>
