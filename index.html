          <p>Charlie Javice, the founder of the student financial aid startup Frank, has been sentenced to over seven years in prison for fraud. She was found guilty of grossly inflating her company's user base to secure a $175 million acquisition by JPMorgan Chase in 2021. The bank later discovered that Frank had fewer than 300,000 actual customers, not the claimed five million. During the sentencing, Javice expressed deep remorse for her actions, which prosecutors described as a crime scene fueled by greed that embarrassed the major financial institution.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released a new proposal aimed at ending the war in Gaza, which has received support from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The plan outlines a gradual disarmament of Hamas and a phased withdrawal of the Israeli Defense Forces, which would retain control over key areas like the Philadelphi corridor. It also suggests a reformed Palestinian Authority could play a role in governing Gaza, leaving open the possibility for future statehood negotiations. President Trump urged Hamas to accept what he termed an 'extremely fair' proposal to end the violence.</p>

          <p>The Taliban has enforced a total internet and telecommunications shutdown across Afghanistan, citing the need to prevent what it deems 'immorality.' The blackout was implemented by severing fiber-optic cables, leading to a complete loss of connectivity that has impacted mobile services, banking, and international communication. Internet watchdog NetBlocks confirmed the nationwide outage, which follows weeks of regional internet disruptions by the Taliban. This measure is the latest in a series of severe restrictions imposed by the group since it regained power in 2021.</p>

          <p>A Chinese businesswoman, Qian Zhimin, has pleaded guilty in a London court to charges related to a massive bitcoin fraud scheme valued at approximately $7.4 billion. The case involves what is believed to be the world's largest single cryptocurrency seizure. According to London's Metropolitan Police, Qian orchestrated the fraud in China between 2014 and 2017, defrauding over 128,000 victims. She then fled to the UK using false documents and attempted to launder the illicitly obtained funds by purchasing property before her eventual arrest.</p>

          <p>During an interview for CBS's '60 Minutes,' UFC President Dana White engaged in a high-stakes baccarat session at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas. While being filmed, White initially went down $1.24 million while betting $400,000 per hand. However, his luck dramatically reversed, and he ultimately left the table with a profit of $700,000. The segment also touched on White's management of the UFC, including his staunch defense of free speech for his fighters and his opposition to 'cancel culture,' which he believes unfairly seeks to destroy people's lives over mistakes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A stress physiologist argues that the most effective way to manage stress is not through inward-focused self-care but by channeling stress-related energy outward to help others. This approach, termed 'stress springboarding,' leverages the hormone oxytocin, which is released during stress and motivates social connection. Research cited in the article indicates that workplace wellness programs encouraging charity or volunteer work are uniquely successful in improving well-being. By focusing on contributing to one's community, individuals can activate reward centers in the brain and reduce activity in stress-related regions.</p>

          <p>The gunman who attacked a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Michigan, killing four people, has been identified as Thomas Jacob Sanford, a 40-year-old Marine veteran.

An acquaintance who met Sanford while campaigning said the shooter expressed a strong dislike for the church's followers. Sanford, who served in Iraq, reportedly had a history of drug issues after returning from his deployment and drove his truck into the church before opening fire.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a $625 million investment in coal-fired power plants and is opening 13.1 million acres of public land to coal mining. This initiative aims to revive the struggling coal sector, which has seen its contribution to U.S. electricity generation fall from 50% in 2000 to about 15% in 2024 due to competition from natural gas and renewable energy. Critics argue the move is a wasteful subsidy for an outdated and polluting energy source, especially when cleaner alternatives are available to meet rising energy demands from sectors like artificial intelligence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has warned that Peru's economic progress is at risk due to increasing political uncertainty leading up to the 2026 general elections. In a new report, the OECD urged the country to implement reforms to restore investor confidence and maintain fiscal discipline. While acknowledging Peru's solid macroeconomic fundamentals and resilient growth over the past decade, the organization projects a moderation in GDP growth for the coming years. The deep political fragmentation is seen as a major obstacle to sustaining long-term growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines whether purchasing an annuity at age 55 is a feasible or advisable retirement strategy. It confirms that individuals at this age can indeed buy annuities, often opting for deferred annuities that allow funds to grow tax-deferred until retirement. The potential advantages include locking in rates and having a longer period for growth, which can provide peace of mind. However, it also cautions that annuities are illiquid investments with surrender periods, which could limit financial flexibility for unexpected expenses before retirement.</p>

          <p>As mortgage rates enter October at a three-year low, prospective homebuyers are presented with a significant opportunity for more affordable financing. The average rate for a 30-year term is now around 6.30%, a notable drop from earlier in the year. However, market volatility could cause rates to rise again, and the fall season typically presents challenges with lower housing inventory. With the Federal Reserve likely to cut rates again at the end of October, buyers must weigh the benefits of acting now against the potential for future changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has reiterated his proposal to impose a 100% tariff on all movies made outside the United States, arguing it would combat 'runaway production' and bring the industry back to America. The threat has been met with skepticism in Hollywood, with many industry leaders and California politicians advocating for a federal film tax incentive instead. Critics, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, argue that a tariff would have damaging consequences and increase costs for consumers, while a federal tax credit would create a more level playing field against international competition.</p>

          <p>The U.S. National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is facing a severe financial crisis, with its debt now exceeding $22.5 billion. The program is struggling to cover claims from increasingly frequent and devastating floods, which are exacerbated by climate change and development in high-risk areas. The article argues the system is trapped by conflicting mandates to provide affordable, widespread coverage while remaining fiscally sound, creating a moral hazard that encourages rebuilding in flood-prone zones. Without significant reform, the system that millions of homeowners rely on is at risk of collapse.</p>
