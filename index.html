          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, has arrived in New Jersey after a federal judge ordered his release from ICE detention in Louisiana. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained for months as the Trump administration sought his deportation for alleged anti-Israel activities. Judge Michael Fabiarz ruled that Khalil was neither a threat nor a flight risk, and his detention appeared to be a punishment for his political speech. Khalil's arrest sparked protests and discussions about free speech, with Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling his detainment a violation of his First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>The suspect in the Minnesota shootings that killed a lawmaker and her husband was described as a doomsday "prepper" by the FBI. Vance Boelter is charged with fatally shooting Democratic House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and seriously wounding Democratic State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. Boelter's wife told investigators the family prepared for major incidents, and Boelter had a "bailout plan" for her. Police found a list of about 70 targets, including Democratic politicians, in Boelter's possession, and evidence suggests he planned to target others.</p>

          <p>Steve Bannon played an outsized role in President Trump's decision-making process regarding potential strikes against Iran. Despite holding no official position, Bannon advised Trump against military action, citing concerns about Israeli intelligence and the effectiveness of bunker-buster bombs. This influence comes amid differing viewpoints from other conservatives, such as Senator Lindsey Graham, who support aiding Israel in eliminating Iran's nuclear threat. Ultimately, Trump decided to hold off on a strike, but the situation remains fluid, with potential deployments of additional military assets.</p>

          <p>The United States is reportedly moving B-2 bombers to Guam as President Trump considers potential involvement in Israeli strikes against Iran. The B-2 bombers can carry the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a bomb designed to destroy underground targets. It is unclear whether the deployment is directly tied to Middle East tensions, and officials declined to provide further details. Experts are monitoring whether the bombers will move to Diego Garcia, a U.S.-British military base in the Indian Ocean. Israel has stated that Iran is close to developing nuclear weapons, while Iran maintains its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.</p>
