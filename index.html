In corporate news, Zara's parent company, Inditex, saw its shares jump over 6% following a positive earnings report that indicated a significant acceleration in recent sales. This market activity reflects a cautious optimism as global economic indicators are closely watched by traders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Poland reported an "unprecedented" violation of its airspace by at least 19 Russian drones, prompting the scrambling of Polish and allied NATO fighter jets to intercept them. Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed that several drones posing a direct threat were shot down, marking a significant escalation and the first such event on NATO territory. In response, Warsaw has requested consultations under NATO's Article 4, which addresses threats to a member's security. European leaders have condemned the act as reckless aggression, while Russia has dismissed the accusations.</p>

          <p>Nepal's army is patrolling the capital, Kathmandu, following days of intense anti-corruption protests that resulted in significant violence, including arson at government buildings and the death of 29 people. The "Gen Z" groups that initiated the peaceful demonstrations claim their movement was hijacked by opportunistic elements responsible for the destruction. As a nationwide curfew is enforced, the military has invited protest leaders for talks, while some young people have begun cleaning up the city. The unrest reflects deep-seated public anger over corruption and nepotism.</p>

The article details Hotez's personal experiences with harassment and threats from anti-vaccine activists, including being targeted for his work developing a low-cost COVID-19 vaccine for developing nations. He argues that combating this disinformation is an existential threat, comparable to pandemics and climate change, and expresses concern for the future of the scientific community.</p>

The victims were on an overcrowded boat with 38 people and were likely crushed, according to the Prefect of Pas-de-Calais. This tragedy adds to the growing number of fatalities in the Channel this year, which has already been described as the deadliest on record by the International Organization for Migration. The incident highlights the ongoing dangers of these perilous journeys.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has conducted an airstrike in Doha, Qatar, targeting senior Hamas officials it holds responsible for the October 7th attack. This marks a significant escalation, as it is the first such Israeli attack on Qatar, a key U.S. ally and mediator in the conflict. The strike reportedly missed its primary targets but killed six people, including a Hamas official's son and a Qatari security officer. Qatar condemned the attack as "state terrorism," while former President Trump criticized it as a unilateral action that does not advance U.S. or Israeli interests.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has indicated the EU is preparing to tighten sanctions against Russia, focusing on accelerating the phase-out of Russian fossil fuels and targeting the "shadow fleet" used to circumvent oil sanctions. The statement also included a defense of the EU's relationship with the United States while issuing a warning regarding China. Diplomatic sources suggest that discussions are underway about potentially using secondary sanctions against companies in third countries that help Russia evade existing measures. This signals a move toward more stringent economic pressure.</p>

          <p>An investigation based on leaked flight records from charter airline Global Crossing Airlines (GlobalX) details how the Trump administration is systematically shuttling immigrants across the U.S. The data reveals numerous, multi-stop flights that move detainees, including hundreds of children, between facilities without notice, often far from their legal counsel and families. This practice effectively creates a "purgatory" that advocates argue violates constitutional due process rights and is designed to be prohibitively cruel. The report highlights specific cases, including the transfer of Venezuelan asylum seekers to a notorious prison in El Salvador.</p>

          <p>A 30-day period during which the Trump administration federalized Washington D.C.'s police force and deployed the National Guard has concluded, leaving a climate of fear among residents. The takeover, ostensibly to fight violent crime, resulted in over 2,100 arrests, many for low-level offenses, and has been criticized for enabling racial profiling and unconstitutional tactics like stop-and-frisks. Immigrant communities have been particularly affected, with reports of ICE checkpoints and targeted patrols creating widespread anxiety.

          <p>Millions of Americans face a potential "huge premium shock" for their Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance plans if Congress does not act. Enhanced subsidies, which have lowered costs for 22 million people since 2021, are set to expire after 2025, which could cause average premiums to rise by about 75%. This "subsidy cliff" threatens to reverse recent gains in health coverage, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating that over 4 million people could become uninsured.

Applications for home purchases rose by 7%, while refinancing applications saw a 12% increase.

The other, "Team Abnormal," argues that the current political climate is an emergency requiring confrontational resistance to stall authoritarian moves, even if it means disrupting government functions.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary block on President Donald Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, delivering a significant ruling on the central bank's independence from political interference. Trump had announced Cook's dismissal last month based on allegations of mortgage fraud from before her tenure, but the Fed maintained she was still a governor. The judge ruled that the legal standard for removal, "for cause," pertains to a governor's conduct while in office. The White House has indicated it will continue to challenge the ruling.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues for Renewed Federal Support to Revitalize America's Innovation Economy</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the foundation of the U.S. innovation economy, built on public-private partnerships and federal research funding, is being eroded by budget cuts and political interference. The authors contend that without robust government investment in deep science, which the private sector cannot replicate at scale, the U.S. risks losing its competitive edge to countries like China. They call on policymakers to restore research funding, support small businesses, and defend free inquiry at universities. The piece warns that America's status as a global leader in innovation cannot be taken for granted.</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in Washington has cautioned that a proposed U.S. policy to shorten visas for mainland Chinese journalists could escalate into a new round of "media warfare." The Department of Homeland Security has suggested capping the stay for these journalists at 90 days, a significant reduction from the previous policy tied to their employment duration. China has labeled the move discriminatory and a step back from prior commitments. This development is part of a broader pattern of deteriorating press relations and reciprocal restrictions between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at the Getty Villa, titled “The Kingdom of Pylos: Warrior-Princes of Ancient Greece,” explores the history of the late Bronze Age civilization through artifacts from the Palace of Nestor. A central feature is the treasure-filled tomb of the "Griffin Warrior," an unknown aristocrat discovered a decade ago. Among the finds is the Pylos Combat Agate, a minuscule yet exquisitely detailed seal stone depicting a battle scene, which challenges established timelines for ancient Greek art. The exhibition provides a rare look into the artistic production and burial practices of this powerful kingdom.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores the potential long-term damage of the Trump administration's policies, arguing that a return to the pre-Trump status quo may be difficult or impossible. Interviews with experts in science, medicine, and labor reveal deep concerns that funding cuts, the injection of ideology into research, and the undermining of federal agencies have demoralized the workforce. The article suggests that rebuilding institutions and trust after years of systemic attacks will be a monumental challenge for any future administration, potentially setting back progress for a generation.</p>

          <p>The first onshore wave power project in the United States has been launched at the Port of Los Angeles by Swedish company Eco Wave Power. The pilot project uses a series of steel floaters attached to a wharf to harness the ocean's movement, converting it into clean, 24/7 electricity. While the initial installation will generate enough power for about 100 homes, the company aims to scale up the technology along the port's breakwater. This innovative approach represents a milestone for marine renewable energy and could help Los Angeles achieve its climate goals.</p>

          <p>The issue of former Vice President Kamala Harris's security has become a point of political contention after President Trump revoked her extended Secret Service protection. While the standard six-month post-service detail had expired, the move was seen by critics as political retaliation. California Governor Gavin Newsom subsequently provided a CHP detail, but the temporary use of LAPD officers drew criticism from the police union. The article frames the debate as an example of extreme partisanship, where even the safety of a former high-ranking official is subject to political maneuvering.</p>

          <p>California's robust ban on non-medical exemptions for school vaccinations is under threat from a series of federal actions aimed at promoting religious and personal belief opt-outs. These include proposed legislation to withhold education funding from states without such exemptions and pressure from the Department of Health and Human Services. Public health experts warn that weakening the state's mandate, which has successfully raised vaccination rates, could lead to more disease outbreaks. The efforts reflect a growing anti-vaccine sentiment within the Trump administration and a larger national debate over public health.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that the rise of originalism, championed by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, has effectively killed the practice of amending the U.S. Constitution. As amending became politically impossible due to polarization, both conservatives and liberals turned to the Supreme Court to enact constitutional change, making judicial appointments the central battleground of American politics. The article traces how originalism evolved from a niche legal theory into a powerful political tool, particularly in debates over abortion and gun rights. This shift has led to a deeply divided and politicized court, with its legitimacy increasingly questioned.</p>
