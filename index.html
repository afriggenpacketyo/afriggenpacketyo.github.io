Governors of the Russian regions of Irkutsk and Murmansk confirmed drone attacks in their respective regions, with videos showing attacks on Olenya airbase in Murmansk and Belaya airfield in Irkutsk. Separately, in Russia's Bryansk region, a railway bridge collapsed, derailing a passenger train and resulting in casualties, while a second railway bridge collapsed in the Kursk region. Ukrainian intelligence services have claimed responsibility for attacks on Russia's railway networks in the past, intended to hamper Moscow's military logistics. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines gender disparities in work-from-home arrangements, drawing on personal experiences, literature, and research. It highlights a pattern where men are more likely to have dedicated workspaces in shared homes, while women often work in less suitable environments. The article references Helen Garner's diaries and Jessica Stanley's novel to illustrate this dynamic. It also cites research showing that women experience more interruptions and suffer professionally and emotionally when they lack dedicated workspaces. The author argues that these disparities reflect broader structural inequalities and the persistent undervaluing of women's work. </p>

          <p>The UK's upcoming defence review will send a "message to Moscow" and address growing Russian aggression, according to Defence Secretary John Healey. The review is expected to highlight the "immediate and pressing" danger posed by Russia and other countries, including China. The government plans to invest £1.5bn in building six new munitions factories to bolster Britain's industrial base. This investment aims to increase the UK's munitions spending to £6bn and create 1,800 jobs. </p>

          <p>A Chinese student's graduation speech at Harvard University, emphasizing "shared humanity" and calling for global unity, has gained attention amidst increasing US-China tensions. Yurong “Luanna” Jiang, the first Chinese woman selected as a student speaker, delivered her speech on the same day a federal judge blocked a Department of Homeland Security order preventing Harvard from enrolling international students. This event occurs against the backdrop of the Trump administration's intensified screening and potential visa revocations for Chinese nationals, particularly those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. The move stems from concerns over espionage activities and national security threats. </p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed an infrared contact lens that allows humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lens combines conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred, the lenses enable users to recognize patterns, letters, and flashing infrared signals in the dark. The technology could potentially be used in surgical procedures, cryptography, and rescue operations, though some critics argue that existing night vision devices are more effective. </p>

The series centers on Rabbi Léa Schmoll, who grapples with making ancient rituals meaningful in a secular world. The article discusses Léa's struggles against both nihilism and rigid Orthodoxy, and how she interprets religious traditions to provide comfort and guidance.
