          <p>A United Nations commission has released a report concluding that Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip amount to genocide, citing statements from Israeli authorities as direct evidence of genocidal intent. The report, produced by an independent body under the UN Human Rights Council, is separate from proceedings at the International Court of Justice. Israel's Foreign Ministry has vehemently rejected the findings, labeling the report's authors as "Hamas proxies" and asserting that the document relies entirely on falsehoods. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry continues to report rising casualty figures from the ongoing conflict.</p>

His plea comes as Russia continues its aerial attacks, launching over 100 drones and 150 glide bombs overnight, resulting in civilian casualties in cities like Zaporizhzhia. Concurrently, Polish President Karol Nawrocki has advocated for NATO to strengthen its deterrence capabilities following recent Russian drone incursions into Polish and Romanian airspace, emphasizing the need to be prepared for potential conflict to ensure peace.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that human remains found across Southeast Asia, dating back up to 12,000 years, may be the world's oldest known mummies, predating previously known examples by thousands of years. Researchers discovered that hunter-gatherer communities likely used a smoke-drying process over fires to preserve the bodies of their ancestors. This practice is believed to have allowed relatives to maintain physical and spiritual connections with the deceased. The findings push back the timeline of mummification and suggest the tradition was widespread in ancient Asian cultures.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's murder, progressive groups express fear of "McCarthy era" political targeting as President Trump and his allies call for investigations into their activities. A letter from the House Freedom Caucus has requested a select committee to probe the "radical left," linking the shooting to a broader pattern of events without evidence. While no organizations have been officially contacted by law enforcement, leaders of groups like the Wren Collective and Codepink are preparing for potential government scrutiny, which they describe as an attempt to silence dissent and quash criticism.</p>

          <p>Employees at the U.S. Department of Labor describe a work environment of fear and plummeting morale under the Trump administration, likening it to a "prison." Staff and labor advocates claim the agency's mission is being undermined by significant budget cuts, deregulation, and policies that weaken worker protections, such as a proposal to eliminate minimum wage for millions of domestic care workers. With about 20% of staff having already left, remaining employees express concerns about retaliation for speaking out and the department's reduced ability to enforce labor laws effectively.</p>

          <p>Meta is set to introduce its most advanced smart glasses, codenamed Hypernova, at its annual Connect event, shifting its metaverse focus from virtual reality to a more accessible consumer device. The new glasses will feature a display controlled by a neural wristband and are part of the company's ongoing partnership with EssilorLuxottica. This launch comes as investors scrutinize the massive financial losses of Meta's Reality Labs division, which has lost nearly $70 billion since late 2020. The success of the new product is seen as a crucial test for Meta's long-term hardware ambitions.</p>

          <p>In an interview prompted by the discourse following Charlie Kirk's death, Princeton historian Fara Dabhoiwala discusses the historical complexities of free speech, challenging the modern absolutist view. Dabhoiwala argues that speech has always been understood as a form of action with real-world consequences, and its meaning is highly dependent on context, power dynamics, and amplification. The article explores how the concept evolved from a balanced ideal of liberty and responsibility to the more rigid American interpretation shaped by the Cold War. It suggests that contemporary debates must grapple with the power of online platforms to shape public discourse.</p>

          <p>A High Court in Kenya has issued an arrest warrant for a British national suspected of murdering 21-year-old Agnes Wanjiru over a decade ago. Wanjiru's body was discovered in a septic tank at a hotel in Nanyuki in 2012, months after she was last seen with British soldiers. The court's ruling, which found sufficient evidence for a trial, now opens the door for extradition proceedings from the United Kingdom.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump does not have the authority to remove Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook from her position, delivering a blow to the administration. The 2-1 decision allows Cook, a Biden appointee, to participate in the upcoming policy meeting where an interest rate cut is expected. Trump had announced his intention to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denied, but the case has raised significant questions about the independence of the Federal Reserve from political interference. The administration is expected to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.</p>

After a public and political backlash, the chancellor reversed the policy in June, and now pensioners with an annual income of £35,000 or less will again be eligible for the payment this winter.</p>

          <p>The UK state pension is projected to increase by 4.7% next April, a rise of over £500 a year for those on the new flat-rate pension. This increase is determined by the "triple lock" policy, which guarantees the pension rises by the highest of 2.5%, inflation, or average earnings growth, with the latter being the key figure this year. While this provides a boost for nearly 13 million pensioners, it also brings the state pension closer to the frozen personal income tax allowance. This proximity means pensioners could start paying income tax on their state pension for the first time by 2027. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>TV news providers are increasingly turning to free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) channels to reach younger audiences and cord-cutters who have abandoned traditional cable packages. Networks like ABC, NBC, and CNN have launched dedicated FAST channels, often featuring a more informal, rapid-fire presentation style to appeal to viewers accustomed to social media. These channels, easily accessible on smart TVs, are becoming a crucial part of the industry's strategy to maintain relevance as viewing habits shift. The growth of FAST platforms is creating a new ecosystem for news consumption outside the pay-TV bundle.</p>

          <p>Artist Alice Matzkin, 85, is experiencing a profound creative resurgence after losing most of her life's work in the 2017 Thomas fire. After a long fallow period, she was inspired to return to her studio, where she has since produced 55 large abstract paintings, a significant departure from her previous portrait work. Matzkin, whose career includes a portrait of Chelsea Clinton that hung in the White House, had previously focused on the theme of aging. Her new, vibrant work reflects a renewed energy and a philosophical acceptance of life's cycles.</p>

          <p>In an opinion column, writer Gustavo Arellano reflects on the divisive reactions to Charlie Kirk's assassination, arguing that empathy is the only way to heal a fractured nation. He criticizes both conservatives vowing vengeance and progressives suggesting Kirk deserved his fate, noting that the silent majority of Americans are tired of the partisan warfare. The author contrasts the online vitriol with his father's simple, humane sadness over the killing. He concludes that while Kirk himself derided empathy, understanding each other's perspectives is essential to prevent such tragedies from escalating into broader political chaos.</p>

          <p>A critical analysis of the proposed $1-trillion pay package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk suggests its performance benchmarks are not as "daunting and challenging" as the company's board claims. Many of the goals, such as delivering 20 million total vehicles and deploying 1 million robotaxis, are described as watered-down versions of Musk's previous, more ambitious promises. The article argues that the terms have been carefully worded to be more achievable, questioning whether they will generate genuine growth for shareholders. This scrutiny comes as Tesla faces slipping sales and increased competition in the electric vehicle market. (not investment advice)</p>

The study highlights the success of public colleges in providing economic mobility, noting that 40% allow students to recoup costs within a year, compared to just 5% of private, for-profit schools.

          <p>Southern California is bracing for a volatile week of weather, featuring a combination of triple-digit temperatures, potential thunderstorms, and strong winds. Forecasters predict Tuesday will be the hottest day, while a risk of thunderstorms from Wednesday through Friday brings the dual threat of lightning-sparked fires in dry areas and sudden, heavy downpours. The unusual weather pattern is caused by a confluence of high and low-pressure systems and the remnants of Tropical Storm Mario.

          <p>The rise of telehealth offers undeniable convenience but also presents potential drawbacks for patients, according to a primary care physician. While online services are suitable for straightforward issues like prescription refills for erectile dysfunction, they are less effective for complex conditions requiring a physical exam. The article advises that building a long-term relationship with a regular doctor, who can also offer virtual appointments, is often more beneficial. A provider who knows a patient's history may be less cautious and can prevent unnecessary emergency room visits, ultimately leading to better and potentially more cost-effective care.</p>

The date is composed of three consecutive perfect squares: 9 (3²), 16 (4²), and 25 (5²). Furthermore, the base numbers (3, 4, and 5) form a Pythagorean triple, where 3² + 4² = 5², representing the fundamental theorem of geometry for right triangles.

          <p>Despite the popularity of viral videos depicting crime in specific urban areas like Frankfurt's Bahnhofsviertel, criminologists assert that Germany is, overall, a very safe country with a long-term downward trend in crime rates. Experts note that while violent offenses have seen a recent uptick, partly linked to social factors among young men, Germany's homicide rate remains significantly lower than in many other nations. They emphasize that crime is more concentrated in cities and that factors like unemployment and lack of prospects, rather than country of origin, are key drivers of criminality.</p>
