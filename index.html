          <p>The BRICS group of emerging economies has called for the United Nations to take the lead in setting global standards for artificial intelligence to ensure fair and equitable governance. In a joint statement, the leaders described AI as a major opportunity for inclusive growth but warned it could widen the digital divide without proper oversight. They emphasized the need for technical protocols developed with public sector and UN involvement to guarantee trust, security, and interoperability across AI platforms. The group also proposed voluntary guidelines for non-military AI use, demanding equal access to technology and data for all countries, particularly those in the Global South.</p>

          <p>A counselor at Camp Mystic, Chloe Childress, is being remembered as a compassionate and loyal friend after she was killed in the catastrophic flooding in Hunt, Texas. Childress, who was set to attend the University of Texas at Austin, was praised by her high school for her selfless commitment to others and her ability to make people feel valued. The article highlights the personal tragedy within the broader disaster, where flash floods on the Guadalupe River claimed at least 78 lives, including numerous children and counselors from the camp. Her death underscores the profound human cost of the natural disaster.</p>

          <p>A Christian girls' summer camp in Texas, Camp Mystic, became the site of a tragedy when the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in 45 minutes, devastating low-lying cabins. This article provides a detailed account of the disaster, which contributed to the 78 confirmed fatalities in the central Texas floods, including 28 children in Kerr County alone. It features harrowing testimony from a 13-year-old survivor who described the terrifying scenes as first responders pulled girls from the water amid the wreckage. The story also notes the death of the camp's director and questions being raised about the safety of locating camps so close to the river.</p>

          <p>The U.S. administration is increasing pressure on its trading partners to finalize new trade agreements, warning that higher tariffs could be implemented as soon as August 1. Officials plan to send dozens of letters to countries, particularly those with which the U.S. has a significant trade deficit, to compel them to negotiate new terms. While some deals have been made, the administration maintains that the threat of steeper tariffs is a key negotiating tactic to secure more favorable terms for the United States. The move creates uncertainty in the global economy as the deadline approaches. (not investment advice)</p>

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while sending a negotiating team, remains committed to eliminating Hamas's capabilities.

          <p>Two decades after the 7/7 London bombings, the UK's counter-terrorism capabilities have become vastly more sophisticated, but the nature of the threat has grown more complex. This analysis examines the evolution from combating organized groups like al-Qaeda to confronting self-radicalized, 'DIY' attackers inspired by online extremism from both Islamist and far-right ideologies. The article details how intelligence sharing between MI5 and police improved, new laws were enacted, and public safety measures like 'Martyn's Law' were created. However, the diverse and unpredictable nature of modern threats means the question of whether the UK is truly safer remains a complex one.</p>

While the NWS maintains it issued appropriate flood watches and warnings, some Texas officials, including the emergency management chief, argue the forecasts failed to predict the historic and catastrophic volume of rainfall that occurred. Meteorologists counter that precisely pinpointing the location and intensity of such extreme weather is exceptionally challenging.
