          <p>Federal agents in tactical gear used flash-bang grenades and less-than-lethal ammunition to disperse protesters during an immigration raid in Los Angeles's Fashion District. The raids, conducted by Homeland Security Investigations, the DEA, and the FBI, resulted in dozens of arrests and sparked citywide protests. The use of force against protesters has drawn criticism, with concerns raised about the tactics employed by federal agents. The LAPD stated they were aware of the ICE operations, but were not involved in civil immigration enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arrests for illegal work in the UK have doubled in the past year, driven by increased enforcement targeting employers who exploit undocumented migrants. Immigration officers conducted raids at over 9,000 businesses, uncovering instances of squalid conditions, illegal working hours, and below-minimum wages. The government aims to crack down on illegal migration through tighter work visa regulations, while critics express concerns over potential economic impacts and insufficient measures to deter illegal immigration. The crackdown has led to a significant increase in arrests and returns of individuals without the right to be in the UK.</p>

          <p>A federal judge approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow US colleges to pay athletes, marking a significant shift away from the traditional amateur model. The settlement, stemming from the House v. NCAA case, permits schools to share up to $20.5 million annually with athletes and compensates former players barred from revenue sharing. This agreement is expected to professionalize college athletics, impacting recruitment, program funding, and the overall landscape of the NCAA. The ruling follows years of legal challenges to the NCAA's amateurism rules.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit has been filed against Sonoma County, alleging the use of government drones for code enforcement violations, constituting a “runaway spying operation.” Residents claim the county has used drones with high-powered cameras to take aerial images of private properties without warrants. The ACLU argues this violates the California Constitution's right to privacy. The county maintains it takes the allegations seriously, while the lawsuit raises concerns about the increasing use of drones by government agencies for surveillance purposes.</p>

          <p>The relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has deteriorated, marked by public disagreements and escalating tensions. Initially allies, their feud intensified after Musk criticized Trump's domestic policy bill, leading to a public spat on social media. Musk has also mused about creating a new political party, further distancing himself from the Republican establishment and potentially challenging Trump's influence, while Trump has threatened to cut off subsidies to Musk's companies. This shift highlights a significant break in their once-close alliance, driven by policy differences and personal clashes.</p>

          <p>The government is struggling to cut the amount of foreign aid it spends on hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK, the BBC has learnt. New figures released quietly by ministers in recent days show the Home Office plans to spend £2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year - that is only marginally less than the £2.3bn it spent in 2024/25. The money is largely used to cover the accommodation costs of thousands of asylum seekers who have recently arrived in the UK. The Home Office said it was committed to ending asylum hotels and was speeding up asylum decisions to save taxpayers' money.</p>
