          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 21:19:18 EDT</div>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has announced a major, long-term contract valued at $16.5 billion to supply semiconductors, running until the end of 2033. The South Korean tech giant did not disclose the identity of the counterparty, citing a request to protect trade secrets, which has led to calls for investor caution. This significant deal comes as Samsung aims to bolster its foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies, and navigate challenges in the competitive AI chip market. The announcement prompted a more than 2% rise in Samsung's shares. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has successfully shut down four dark web sites dedicated to child sexual abuse material, which had over 120,000 members globally. The investigation, dubbed "Operation Grayskull," has led to the conviction of at least 18 individuals who administered or used the network. One of the key figures, William Spearman, known as "Boss," was sentenced to life in prison for his role as a lead administrator. Officials described the operation as one of the most successful of its kind, dismantling a sophisticated and prolific network that traded horrific content.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address escalating violence in men's prisons, the UK government is launching a trial to equip specially trained prison staff with Tasers. The move follows new data revealing over £20 million in compensation paid for assaults behind bars over five years. The Prison Officers' Association supports the pilot, calling it long overdue, while some, like the Prison Governors' Association, express concern about the risks if the weapons were rolled out more widely. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to improve safety, which also includes anti-drone measures and increased searches for contraband.</p>

          <p>A new trade agreement between the United States and the European Union, which establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods, is projected to cause a significant shift in global trade dynamics. According to an economic modeling tool, the deal could lead to a more than 46% drop in total global exports to the U.S. by 2027 compared to recent years. The forecast suggests that while the U.S. may import more from some European nations, imports from major partners like China, Canada, and Mexico could see substantial decreases, potentially rewiring international supply chains.

          <p>Human rights organizations in Argentina are facing a severe crisis due to mass layoffs and funding cuts under the new government of President Javier Milei. Agencies dedicated to documenting the crimes of the country's former military dictatorship, such as the National Archive of Remembrance and the ESMA Museum, have seen their staff decimated. This includes groups like the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, which works to identify children stolen during the dictatorship. The austerity measures threaten to dismantle decades of work toward memory and justice, sparking protests and fears of a regression into historical denial.</p>

          <p>A profile of comedian John Oliver explores his journey from the UK comedy scene to becoming one of America's most influential political satirists. The article highlights the meticulous research behind his HBO show, "Last Week Tonight," which tackles complex and often obscure systemic problems with a unique blend of investigative journalism and humor. Oliver, now a U.S. citizen, explains that his pointed criticism of his adopted homeland comes from a place of love and a desire for it to improve. His success is attributed to his willingness to take risks and make people laugh about serious topics they care about.</p>

          <p>A 60 Minutes report details the poignant story of an Argentine family torn apart by the country's military dictatorship and their decades-long search for a stolen child. Patricia Roisinblit was eight months pregnant when she and her husband were "disappeared" in 1978; their baby boy was given to a military-affiliated family. Twenty-five years later, his older sister Mariana found him, leading to a painful reckoning with the truth of his identity and abduction. The story explores the complex emotional aftermath for the siblings and their family, set against a backdrop of renewed political denial about the dictatorship's atrocities.</p>

          <p>An investigative report reveals how a Skyvan PA-51 aircraft, used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights," was discovered in the United States decades later. During the regime, political prisoners were drugged and thrown from this plane into the Atlantic Ocean. An Italian photographer and an Argentine journalist, herself a survivor of a detention camp, tracked down the plane and its flight logs, providing crucial evidence of these atrocities. Their investigation was instrumental in the 2017 conviction of the pilots, and the plane has now been returned to Argentina to serve as a memorial and an irrefutable witness to state-sponsored terror.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri's victory at the Belgian Grand Prix highlighted the razor-thin margins defining the Formula 1 championship battle between the two McLaren teammates. Piastri secured the win by making a decisive move on Lando Norris at the start, capitalizing on the slipstream advantage at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit. The race analysis points to a few key moments, including Norris not creating a sufficient gap at the restart and a minor mistake at the first corner, which allowed Piastri to take a lead he would not relinquish. The result demonstrates how small strategic decisions and driver execution are proving crucial in their closely matched rivalry.</p>

The author expresses conviction in the company's long-term value, citing its strong position in aerospace and industrial automation, and views the current stock decline as an overreaction and a potential buying opportunity.

The victims, who ranged in age from 21 to 84, were attacked randomly with a folding knife and are all expected to survive. Investigators stated that a terrorism charge is justified because the mass attack was intended to inflict fear upon the entire community. Authorities praised the actions of multiple citizens, including one who was armed, for confronting the suspect in the parking lot and preventing further harm before police arrived.</p>
