          <p>PDD Holdings, the Chinese company owning the online shopping platform Temu, reported a nearly 50% drop in profits, impacted by trade policies and domestic competition. US-listed shares of the e-commerce giant fell over 13% after the announcement that profits for the first three months of the year fell to 14.74 billion yuan. The Trump administration's decision to end the "de minimis" exemption, which allowed parcels under $800 to enter the U.S. without import duties, has contributed to the company's challenges. In China, PDD faces a price war with rivals like Alibaba and JD.com amidst weak consumer spending.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his intention to pardon reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, known for their show "Chrisley Knows Best," who were convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud. The Chrisleys were found guilty in 2022 of conspiring to defraud Atlanta-area community banks to obtain over $36 million in personal loans and defrauding the IRS. Todd Chrisley received a 12-year prison sentence, while Julie Chrisley was sentenced to seven years, and Trump expressed hope the pardon would be completed quickly. A White House spokesman stated that the President is pleased to give deserving Americans a second chance, especially those unfairly targeted by the justice system.</p>

Nvidia's stock jumped more than 4% ahead of its earnings report, which is expected to show a surge in first-quarter revenue.

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest rocket ever built, reached space in its ninth test flight but lost control during reentry due to a propellant leak, causing it to break up in the atmosphere. The upper-stage vehicle experienced the leak halfway through its journey, resulting in a spin and preventing planned tests of heat protection tiles. While the booster was lost as three engines lit up to simulate a landing, the company appears to have fixed problems that caused explosions in previous flights. Despite the incomplete achievement, the company aims to accelerate the pace of future test flights, targeting one every three to four weeks.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship rocket experienced an uncontrolled reentry after mission control lost contact during its ninth uncrewed test flight, designed to advance interplanetary travel and colonize Mars. The rocket leaked fuel, spun out of control, and likely disintegrated over the Indian Ocean, approximately 45 minutes after launching from Starbase in Texas. SpaceX confirmed the "rapid unscheduled disassembly," attributing the loss of attitude control to a propellant leak or engine failure in the upper stage, similar to issues encountered in previous tests.

          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics reveals that recent college graduates are facing increased difficulty finding employment, accounting for 12% of the rise in the national unemployment rate since mid-2023. The unemployment rate for recent graduates aged 22-27 is nearing 6%, surpassing the national average of 4.2%, marking the first time in 45 years that those with higher education have a higher unemployment rate. This is attributed to a mismatch between an oversupply of graduates in fields with waning business demand, particularly in the tech industry, where automation and AI are impacting lower-level positions. Economic uncertainty and tariffs are also slowing hiring, potentially exacerbating the issue for young graduates.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship reached orbit during its ninth test flight, but a propellant leak caused a loss of control, leading to an uncontrolled reentry and expected disintegration over the Indian Ocean. The mission successfully demonstrated the vehicle could reach orbit, but an apparent propellant leak after entering its suborbital trajectory caused a loss of attitude control. Without the ability to steer the craft, the vehicle re-entered Earth's atmosphere at an angle not ideal for its heat shield. The company stated that the test will help improve Starship's reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multiplanetary.</p>

In response, the Harvard community has set aside differences, viewing the attacks as an existential threat to the university, and students and faculty members have rallied in support of Harvard‚Äôs international students.</p>

While many agree that the initial vaccination course offered protection against serious illness in children, the need for annual vaccines is more contentious.
