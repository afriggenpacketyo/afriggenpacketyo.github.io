          <p>A Florida man and his grandson discovered the wreckage of a large wooden vessel, believed to be up to 150 years old, while fishing in Aripeka's mud flats. The man suspects it could be a 19th-century rum-runner ship, a theory supported by a piece of purplish glass found at the site. Local archaeologists are now investigating the find to determine its origin, after which the state of Florida will take responsibility for the protected historical site. The discovery highlights the commonality of uncovering historical shipwrecks in coastal areas.</p>

The inauguration proceeds despite strong objections from downstream nations Egypt and Sudan, who fear the dam will severely reduce their water supplies from the Nile River. After years of failed negotiations, the two countries have warned of grave consequences and consider the issue a matter of national security, while Ethiopia insists the dam is a shared regional opportunity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid concerns over inflation and high interest rates, financial experts recommend several practical strategies to curb credit card spending this fall. Key suggestions include creating a detailed seasonal budget based on past expenses, using debit or cash for everyday purchases to create emotional distance from spending, and removing saved card information from online accounts to add friction to impulse buys. Other effective tactics involve setting up transaction alerts to track spending in real-time and avoiding "buy now, pay later" services that can obscure total debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous street artist Banksy has been confirmed on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in traditional attire striking a protester on the ground, and its appearance shortly followed a protest where nearly 900 people were arrested. The artist claimed the piece via an Instagram post, consistent with his method of authentication for his politically charged works that often critique government policy and capitalism. The mural was quickly covered by authorities pending further action.</p>

          <p>Violent clashes between protesters and security forces in Nepal have resulted in at least 19 deaths and numerous injuries following the government's decision to ban popular social media platforms. The government cited the need to regulate fake news and online fraud as the reason for blocking sites like Facebook and X, which millions of Nepalis use for communication and business. Thousands of demonstrators, identifying as Generation Z, gathered near parliament to protest what they view as an authoritarian move, leading to police using force and imposing a curfew.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a communication expert, highly likable people consistently follow a simple rule: they make others feel seen through genuine interest and curiosity. This is achieved through small, everyday habits rather than grand gestures or being overly agreeable. These habits include remembering small details about others, freely giving credit for ideas, responding to everyone regardless of their status, readily admitting when they are wrong, and making time for seemingly unimportant conversations. The article emphasizes that likability is a learnable skill that builds stronger professional and personal relationships.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team faces a critical decision ahead of its World Cup quarter-final against Scotland, as star full-back Ellie Kildunne has been ruled out due to concussion symptoms. Head coach John Mitchell must choose between the less experienced but high-scoring Emma Sing and the more versatile and polished veteran Helena Rowland. Experts suggest Rowland is the more likely choice for the high-stakes knockout match, citing her strong defensive performance and experience at the position in the previous World Cup, ensuring stability for the team's spine.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the monthly cost of operating a Tesla versus a Honda CR-V Hybrid, based on average American driving distances and current energy prices. It concludes that charging a Tesla at home is substantially more economical, costing approximately $0.05 per mile compared to about $0.08 per mile for gasoline in the hybrid. For an average driver, this translates to a monthly cost of around $51 for the Tesla versus $81 for the CR-V. The difference is attributed to the superior efficiency of electric motors over internal combustion engines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of Ethiopia's Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), the largest hydroelectric project in Africa, which aims to double the country's electricity generation. The dam, financed primarily through domestic bonds and public donations, is a major source of national pride. However, it is also at the center of a long-standing dispute with downstream countries Egypt and Sudan, who rely on the Nile's waters and fear the dam poses an existential threat to their water security, a conflict rooted in colonial-era water-sharing treaties.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run have issued a humorous apology after the medals distributed to approximately 60,000 participants featured a significant geographical error. The design, intended to show an aerial view of Newcastle and the River Tyne, instead depicted the nearby city of Sunderland and the River Wear. In a lighthearted statement, the Great Run Company admitted the mistake, which also appeared on t-shirts, and playfully declared it the "most unique" souvenir in the event's history, turning the blunder into a regional celebration.</p>

          <p>The French government, led by Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, is facing imminent collapse as it is widely expected to lose a parliamentary confidence vote it initiated. The vote was called to force a decision on a contentious budget involving €44 billion in austerity measures, which opposition parties from both the far-left and far-right have vowed to reject. A defeat would plunge France deeper into political instability and force President Emmanuel Macron to appoint his fifth prime minister in less than two years.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's government plans to increase its foreign ministry budget for Latin America and the Caribbean by over NT$1 billion (US$32.8 million) next year. This move is a direct effort to strengthen ties with its few remaining diplomatic allies in the region and push back against Beijing's persistent campaign to isolate Taipei on the world stage. The additional funds will be used for bilateral cooperation, public diplomacy campaigns, and to nearly double the number of influential guests, such as officials and academics, invited to visit Taiwan.</p>

Despite a lifetime of work as a carpenter and union representative, Scidone works part-time at a convenience store because his pension, unchanged since 1998, is no longer sufficient to cover his and his wife's $7,000 in monthly expenses. Their situation illustrates how escalating costs for housing, taxes, and healthcare can quickly deplete retirement savings and force older Americans back into the workforce to make ends meet.</p>

While expressing confidence that the administration's legal position will prevail, he acknowledged the significant financial disruption a negative ruling would cause, prompting the administration to seek an expedited decision from the court.

Despite the president's rhetoric, many business owners are hesitant to expand U.S. operations, citing the difficulty of hiring and doubts that the protectionist policies will create sustained demand for American-made goods.
