          <p>Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes declined a substantial offer from Al-Hilal, a Saudi Pro-League club, which would have more than doubled his current salary. After discussing the proposal with his family, Fernandes decided to remain with Manchester United, where he is already a top earner. United's head coach, Ruben Amorim, had previously expressed confidence that Fernandes would stay at Old Trafford. Fernandes has made 290 appearances and scored 98 goals for the club since joining in January 2020. The club is reportedly pleased with Fernandes' decision.</p>

This shift reflects the U.S. government's new "trade, not aid" approach to the continent. President Trump's second administration secured 33 deals worth $6 billion in its first 100 days, according to Troy Fitrell, a senior U.S. official for the Bureau of African Affairs. This commercial diplomacy strategy focuses on countries where U.S. companies are interested in doing business, aiming to reshape economic ties with Africa in competition with China.</p>

The AirCar transforms from a road-legal sports coupe into an aircraft in about 80 seconds, requiring no manual adjustments. It will offer three engine options, with the top version reaching speeds of 124 mph on the road and cruising at 155 mph in the air, with a range of 620 miles. Expected to cost between $800,000 and $1.2 million, it is aimed at wealthy business travelers and air taxi operators, requiring both a driver's license and a pilot's license to operate.</p>

The search focuses on 21 plots of land near Praia da Luz, where Madeleine was last seen, and involves around 30 German police officers. German investigators have identified Christian BrÃ¼ckner as the prime suspect in the case since 2020; he is currently serving a sentence in Germany for a separate sexual assault case.

Ueda also mentioned that the BOJ will not push to raise its policy rate unless economic and price conditions improve, citing uncertainty due to U.S. tariffs.

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has further reduced its economic growth forecasts for the U.S. and globally, citing the impact of President Trump's tariff policies. The U.S. growth outlook was revised down to 1.6% for this year and 1.5% for 2026, attributing the downgrade to tariff fallout, economic policy uncertainty, and a smaller federal workforce. Global growth is also expected to be lower than previously forecast, with the slowdown concentrated in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The OECD emphasized that trade uncertainty and economic policy uncertainty have reached unprecedented levels, leading to reduced consumption and investment. (not investment advice)</p>

However, intense competition could pressure margins and strain growth prospects, leading to investor confidence tumbling for beverage chains lacking a clear competitive edge.

          <p>President Trump has pardoned two South Florida shark divers, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's longline. The men believed the line was illegal and reported it to state wildlife officials after freeing the animals in August 2020. Despite avoiding prison time, the felony convictions prevented them from voting, owning firearms, and traveling freely. Attorneys for Mansell and Moore expressed relief, stating the case should never have been filed and praising their clients' intentions to save the sharks.</p>

          <p>The House v. NCAA settlement, awaiting court approval, proposes a revenue-sharing model between schools and athletes, potentially reshaping college athletics. The settlement stems from merging three lawsuits alleging the NCAA violated antitrust laws by restricting athletes' NIL rights. If approved, $2.8 billion would be provided to athletes who couldn't profit off their NIL between 2016 and Sept. 15, 2024, with revenue sharing starting July 1, capped at $20.5 million per school for 2025-26. The agreement includes roster caps, causing delays due to objections, with universities preparing for both approval and denial scenarios.</p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has warned that global economic growth is set to slow down this year, largely due to President Donald Trump's U.S. tariffs. Worldwide growth is now expected to be a "modest" 2.9%, a decrease from the previous forecast of 3.1%. The OECD attributed the downgrade to a "significant" rise in trade barriers, cautioning that weakened economic prospects will be felt globally. Trump's unpredictable approach to implementing tariffs has created widespread uncertainty in international markets.</p>
