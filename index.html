          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 01:33:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has passed its welfare reform bill, but only after making significant last-minute concessions to prevent a rebellion from within its own Labour party. Fearing a parliamentary defeat, ministers agreed to delay stricter eligibility rules for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) until a review is completed, effectively removing a key cost-saving measure. This chaotic process has been criticized as a "shambles" by some MPs and is seen as undermining the authority of Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The changes leave a multi-billion pound gap in the government's spending plans, raising questions about future tax increases. (not investment advice)</p>

In a statement, frontman Dave Grohl reflected on the band's history of joy and heartbreak, paying tribute to past members and emphasizing that Hawkins remains integral to everything they do.

The lawsuit, widely seen by legal scholars as an attack on the First Amendment, alleged that CBS News deceptively edited Harris's response to a question.

Tarvet, who prefers to be called Ollie, is unfazed by the challenge, viewing it as a significant opportunity rather than just an experience.

While the MoD has reached out-of-court settlements in at least six cases without admitting liability, it maintains there is no proven health risk.

          <p>President Donald Trump's extensive legislative package, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill," has cleared the House Rules Committee and is now set for a vote by the full chamber. The nearly 12-hour session saw Republicans advance the measure despite some conservative members voting against it due to fiscal concerns. The bill, which encompasses Trump's priorities on taxes, border security, and defense, aims to make his 2017 tax cuts permanent while also implementing other key campaign promises. Democrats have strongly opposed the bill, arguing it disproportionately benefits the wealthy and adds trillions to the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new G7 agreement will exempt American multinational corporations from a previously agreed-upon global minimum tax, a move critics argue prioritizes corporate profits over public interest. This deal effectively allows U.S. companies to continue booking profits in low-tax jurisdictions, creating an uneven playing field and undermining the original goal of ending the "race to the bottom" in corporate taxation. This decision weakens the OECD/G20's Pillar Two framework, which was designed to ensure a 15% minimum tax rate globally. The authors of the article contend that this undermines multilateralism and global tax fairness. (not investment advice)</p>

Key points of contention include major economic imbalances that disadvantage the EU and China's continued political support for Russia.

          <p>Jared Wise, a former FBI agent who was pardoned by President Donald Trump for his role in the January 6 Capitol riot, is now serving in the Department of Justice. Wise was on trial for allegedly encouraging rioters to attack police when he received the pardon. Sources confirm he is now an investigator and counselor within the DOJ's "Weaponization Working Group," which was established to probe alleged misconduct in federal law enforcement. His appointment has drawn scrutiny, as prosecutors had presented video evidence of him shouting "Kill 'em!" at officers during the riot.</p>

The legislation, which also extends tax cuts, narrowly passed the Senate and now faces a critical vote in the House.
