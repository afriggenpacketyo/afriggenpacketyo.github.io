          <h2>Trump's Administration Blasts Amazon Over Tariff Display Report</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump reportedly contacted Jeff Bezos after a news outlet stated that Amazon was considering displaying tariff costs on product listings, prompting immediate backlash from the White House. Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, called the potential move a "hostile and political act," questioning why Amazon hadn't taken similar action during the Biden administration's period of high inflation. Following the call, Amazon clarified that displaying tariff costs was never approved and will not happen, despite earlier considering it for their budget-focused Amazon Haul store. This situation highlights the ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and Amazon, particularly concerning trade policies and their impact on consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dan Howard, a former Idaho State Trooper, was found guilty of second-degree murder and domestic battery in the death of his wife, Kendy Howard. Kendy was found dead in their bathtub with a gunshot wound to her head in February 2021, initially dispatched as a suicide. However, inconsistencies at the scene, such as a packed duffle bag and freshly laundered towels, raised suspicions. After a two-year investigation, Dan Howard was arrested and charged, with prosecutors arguing he used a carotid restraint hold learned from his law enforcement training to kill Kendy, while the defense maintained it was suicide. The jury ultimately convicted Howard, sentencing him to life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>A massive power outage struck Spain and Portugal, impacting approximately 60 million people and causing widespread disruption.

While the cause remains a mystery, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has established a special commission to investigate all potential causes, ruling out a lack of nuclear power generation.

          <p>Three officials terminated from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) are suing the Trump administration to block their removal, arguing that the president lacks the authority to fire them.

The Trump administration, however, asserts its constitutional power to remove personnel exercising executive authority. This legal battle underscores the ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and public media, particularly after Trump expressed interest in cutting funding to NPR and PBS.</p>

          <p>Experts are weighing in on whether refinancing a home equity loan into a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) makes sense this May, considering factors like interest rates and homeowner needs. With HELOC rates currently lower than home equity loan rates, refinancing could be advantageous, especially if the Federal Reserve cuts rates this summer. A HELOC offers flexibility for expenses like home renovations, allowing homeowners to draw funds as needed and only pay interest on what they borrow. However, refinancing might not be ideal for those nearing the end of their loan term or with low credit scores due to closing costs and potentially higher rates.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump contacted Amazon founder Jeff Bezos following a report that Amazon was planning to display how much tariffs are increasing prices on products. The call occurred shortly after senior administration officials informed the president of the reported plans by Amazon. Following their conversation, Amazon released an updated statement saying the idea of listing import charges on certain products was never approved and would not happen. Before Amazon's statement, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer encouraged all companies to display the impact tariffs have on prices.</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal party achieved an unexpected election victory, seen as a rebuke to Donald Trump's agenda. The election was influenced by Trump's threats and remarks, which spurred voters to unite around the Liberals. Mark Carney replaced Justin Trudeau and led the Liberals to a fourth term, potentially as a minority government. The election was significantly shaped by Trump's focus on Canada's political and economic sovereignty, and Carney emphasized the need to counter Trump's influence by working closely with allies in Europe and Asia.</p>

Justices questioned the agents' discretion in planning the raid, particularly their failure to verify the address. The case, Martin v.
