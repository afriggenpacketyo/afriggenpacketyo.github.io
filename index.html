          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily reinstated President Trump's tariffs, delaying a lower court order that blocked them. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued an administrative stay while it considers Trumpâ€™s appeal, after a lower court deemed the tariffs unlawful. The administration argued that enforcing the lower court ruling would cause a "foreign policy disaster scenario," potentially stripping the president of leverage in trade negotiations. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not give him the "unlimited" power to levy tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a series of pardons and commutations, including several to individuals with financial or political ties to him. Among those pardoned are Trevor Milton, founder of Nikola, who donated nearly $2 million to Trump's reelection efforts, and Michele Fiore, a Nevada Republican awaiting sentencing on federal charges of misusing funds. The pardons have sparked controversy, with critics questioning the fairness and impartiality of the process, especially given the recipients' connections to the president.

This initiative aims to increase arrests and removals, citing public safety concerns related to undocumented immigrants remaining in the country. During Trump's first 100 days, ICE arrested 66,463 undocumented immigrants, and more than 65,000 were deported, with a significant portion having criminal convictions or charges.

          <p>For those who have yet to file their 2024 tax return, it's crucial to address key questions to mitigate potential penalties and interest from the IRS. Key considerations include whether an extension was filed, the amount owed, and the availability of necessary documents like W-2s and 1099s. The IRS offers options such as payment plans and hardship programs for those unable to pay immediately, and it's advisable to seek professional help if unsure about navigating the complexities of late filings.

Goldman Sachs' President John Waldron noted a slowdown in investment banking activity in the second quarter due to market volatility.

The suit highlights numerous inmate deaths and alleges excessive force by deputies. The lawsuit seeks an injunction ending the use of cash bail, arguing that detention decisions should be based on the severity of crimes and public safety risk, not income. The suit follows a 2021 state Supreme Court ruling that found it unconstitutional to jail defendants solely because of their inability to pay.</p>

Ovechkin, who will turn 40 in September, previously stated his intention to return for his 21st NHL season, as he has one year remaining on his contract. The Russian has set his sights on breaking Wayne Gretzky's all-time goal scoring record.</p>
