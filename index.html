          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose 25% tariffs on all goods from Japan and South Korea, set to take effect on August 1. In letters posted to social media, President Trump also revealed new tariffs for five other nations, including rates as high as 40% for Myanmar and Laos. The move follows the impending expiration of a 90-day pause on previously announced duties, which the White House says will be extended to the new August deadline. Economists warn that such wide-ranging tariffs could fuel inflation and slow economic growth, while trade experts suggest the policy makes market access a "pay to play proposition."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The deadly flash floods in central Texas were caused by an extreme weather event that saw some areas receive upwards of 20 inches of rain over the holiday weekend. The deluge was fueled by remnant moisture from former Tropical Storm Barry, causing the Guadalupe River to rise an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes. The article details specific rainfall totals from the National Weather Service, with locations like Bertram and Liberty Hill recording over 20 inches. This immense volume of water fell on the dry, packed soil of the Texas Hill Country, a region naturally prone to rapid runoff and dangerous flash flooding.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article about NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's college application has ignited controversy over its sourcing and newsworthiness. The story, which detailed how Mamdani identified as both "Asian" and "Black or African American" on his 2009 Columbia application, was reportedly rushed to publication over fears of being "scooped" by right-wing activist Christopher Rufo. Critics have condemned the Times for relying on a source known for promoting white supremacist views and for framing the story as a scandal. The incident highlights the contentious media environment and the heated nature of the mayoral race, with Rufo himself applauding the newspaper's report.</p>

          <p>A research team at the University of Tartu in Estonia is pioneering a sustainable technology solution by turning old smartphones into small-scale data centers. By removing the batteries and connecting the devices to an external power source, researchers can link them together to process and store data for various projects. This innovative approach aims to reduce electronic waste, as over a billion new smartphones are produced annually, with many ending up in landfills. The repurposed phone clusters have already been tested in real-world applications, such as underwater marine life monitoring, offering an affordable alternative to expensive traditional equipment.</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified the fossil of North America's oldest known pterosaur, a flying reptile approximately the size of a small seagull that lived 209.2 million years ago. The discovery, detailed in a Smithsonian-led paper, was made from a fragile jawbone unearthed at a fossil site in Arizona's Petrified Forest National Park. The new species, named Eotephradactylus mcintireae, helps fill a significant gap in the fossil record from the late Triassic period. The finding provides valuable new insights into the evolution of pterosaurs, which were close cousins of dinosaurs and the first animals after insects to evolve powered flight.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 70,000 immigrants from Honduras and Nicaragua in early September. This decision will revoke the work permits and deportation protections for roughly 72,000 Hondurans and 4,000 Nicaraguans, many of whom have lived in the U.S. since the 1990s. The Department of Homeland Security argued that conditions in both countries have improved enough to no longer warrant the special status, which was first granted in 1999 after Hurricane Mitch.

          <p>The U.S. dollar has recorded its worst first-half performance since 1973, declining 10.7% against global currencies through June. The slide is attributed to several factors, including policy volatility, growing national debt, and the potential for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts later this year. The weakening dollar has benefited U.S. companies with significant international sales but has also fueled concerns about the long-term stability of American assets. Some analysts believe the trend will continue, while others argue that fears are overblown, citing the dollar's deep-seated advantages in the global financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts cited in the article express concern that falling childhood vaccination rates, exacerbated by anti-vaccine sentiment, have created vulnerabilities.

          <p>Jack Dorsey, CEO of Block and co-founder of Twitter, has launched a beta version of Bitchat, a new peer-to-peer messaging app that operates without the internet. The app uses Bluetooth mesh networks to allow nearby devices to communicate directly, forming local clusters to pass along encrypted, ephemeral messages. The decentralized design requires no phone numbers or emails and does not use central servers, aiming to provide a censorship-resistant communication tool during internet outages or surveillance. The project reflects Dorsey's ongoing interest in developing privacy-focused, user-owned technologies that challenge the models of mainstream platforms like WhatsApp.</p>

          <p>The United States is pressuring its trading partners, including the European Union, to finalize new trade agreements by August 1 or face the reinstatement of significantly higher tariffs. The White House confirmed it will extend a July 9 deadline, giving nations more time to negotiate before duties announced in April snap back into place. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the administration's "maximum pressure" strategy is yielding progress, with several deals expected to be announced soon. The EU, which is in ongoing talks with the U.S., has expressed hope for a deal but is also prepared to implement retaliatory tariffs on American exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Mark Ruffalo has publicly criticized podcaster Joe Rogan for his recent comments condemning ICE immigration raids, suggesting his concern is belated. Ruffalo posted on Threads that Rogan, a prominent Trump supporter, should have been aware of the administration's hardline immigration policies and the Project 2025 playbook before the election. The criticism came after a Joe Rogan Experience episode where the host called the targeting of migrant workers in construction and gardening "insane." The exchange highlights the ongoing political and cultural divisions surrounding the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement actions, which have sparked protests and legal challenges across the country.</p>

          <p>In a political standoff, both Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo are calling for the other to drop out of the New York City mayoral race. Both candidates fear that by staying on the November ballot, they will split the moderate vote, paving the way for a victory by democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani. Adams argued on CNBC that Cuomo should step aside after a decisive primary loss, while Cuomo's team maintains that polls show he is the stronger general election candidate. The situation underscores the panic among the city's moderate and business establishments following Mamdani's primary win in the unusually crowded and competitive election.</p>

          <p>The United States is scheduled to remove the Syrian Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) from its list of foreign terrorist organizations, according to a state department memo. The group, formerly an al-Qaeda affiliate, led the rebel offensive that recently toppled the Assad regime, and its leader is now Syria's interim president. This move is part of a broader effort by Western nations to reset relations with Syria following the end of its 13-year civil war. The U.S. recently ended sanctions against the country, and the UK has resumed diplomatic visits and increased aid to support long-term recovery.</p>

          <p>El Gato Night Market, a popular destination for Latino cuisine in Los Angeles, is struggling to recover after a temporary shutdown caused by recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in the area. The market, which hosts dozens of immigrant vendors, saw its attendance and vendor participation plummet as community members feared being targeted. Organizers and vendors described the difficult choice between ensuring their safety and earning a living, as the market is a primary source of income for many. Despite the fear, the market has reopened, with vendors and loyal customers hoping to restore the vibrant community hub to its former state.</p>

          <p>Poland's recent implementation of temporary border checks with Germany and Lithuania is fueling concerns about the erosion of the European Union's Schengen Area of free movement. While officially aimed at curbing irregular migration, the move is seen as a tit-for-tat response to Germany's own increased controls. Analysts featured in the article argue that such measures are becoming more common across Europe, driven by political symbolism rather than proven effectiveness. Experts warn that the permanent reinstatement of internal borders could have severe economic consequences, disrupting supply chains and undermining one of the EU's most tangible achievements.</p>

          <p>Alex Cooper, host of the popular 'Call Her Daddy' podcast, received a mixed reaction from the crowd at Wrigley Field after a bizarre performance of 'Take Me Out to the Ball Game.' During the traditional seventh-inning stretch of the Chicago Cubs game, Cooper sang a deliberately off-key and overly dramatic version of the classic song, laughing throughout the performance. While some fans sang along, many in the stadium responded with audible boos, expressing their displeasure with the tongue-in-cheek rendition. The appearance was part of a special promotional takeover event at the ballpark, which included a commemorative Cubs jersey for some attendees.</p>
