          <p>President Trump announced his recommendation for a 50% tariff on goods imported from the European Union, effective June 1, citing ongoing trade disputes and barriers. Trump complained about the EU's trade practices and stated that there would be no tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States. This announcement immediately impacted financial markets, causing U.S. stock futures and European stock markets to decline. The move potentially sets the stage for tense discussions between U.S. and European trade representatives. (not investment advice)</p>

Harvard argues that the action is blatant retaliation for the university exercising its rights to control its governance and curriculum. The university is also seeking a temporary restraining order to immediately block the administration's action, asserting that the loss of international students would destabilize Harvard's existence.</p>

          <p>President Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple iPhones if the company does not shift some of its production to the United States. He stated that iPhones sold in America should be manufactured and built in the U.S., not India or elsewhere. Apple shares fell in pre-market trading following the announcement. This threat comes after Apple's supplier Foxconn announced plans to invest $1.5 billion in its Indian operations, and analysts project that manufacturing iPhones in the U.S. could significantly increase the cost of the devices.</p>

The article cites a lack of comprehensive legislative changes and a shift in public sentiment towards prioritizing crime reduction over reform. It also highlights racial disparities in police killings and the need to address deeper societal issues, such as poverty, to achieve meaningful change. The Trump administration has dropped efforts to investigate or oversee nearly two dozen police departments.</p>

          <p>The New York Times editorial board argues that Republican efforts to cut Medicaid through work requirements and other restrictions undermine the Affordable Care Act and would deprive millions of Americans of health insurance. The editorial emphasizes that health care should be universally accessible and criticizes the Republican plan for prioritizing tax cuts for the wealthy over affordable health care for lower-income individuals.

The report highlights that millions of borrowers risk financial hardship due to delinquency reporting, Treasury offsets, and the uncertain future of the SAVE plan. The Trump administration has already restarted Treasury offsets and plans to resume wage garnishment, potentially impacting millions of borrowers who are behind on payments or in default.

Scientists observed clownfish off the coast of Papua New Guinea during a heatwave and found that individual fish got shorter over weeks.

          <p>The Trump administration has revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, citing a failure to comply with reporting requirements and allegations of anti-Americanism and antisemitism on campus. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that this action serves as a warning to other schools. Harvard responded by calling the action unlawful and asserting that it would have a devastating effect on the university. A federal judge has since blocked the administration from arresting international students or revoking their visas without clear justification.</p>

Advocates say the law disproportionately affects communities of color and lower-income neighborhoods, like St. James Parish, that bear a heavy burden of industrial air pollution. Community groups argue that the law hinders their ability to share crucial data with residents and oppose new polluting facilities.</p>
