          <p>In an interview, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte framed the upcoming summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin as a critical test of Putin's seriousness in ending the war in Ukraine. Rutte emphasized that while Trump is initiating the high-stakes dialogue, any final peace agreement concerning territory or security guarantees must involve Ukraine and European allies. He asserted that the Western alliance remains united, with ongoing lethal aid to Ukraine continuing regardless of the summit's outcome, ensuring Putin cannot divide them. Rutte also mentioned the possibility of a de facto, but not de jure, recognition of Russian-controlled territory as a complex part of future negotiations.</p>

          <p>A woman who previously worked as a youth campaign organizer for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been arrested in New York City for allegedly making a terroristic threat. Iman Abdul, 27, is accused of posting a social media message encouraging an attack on a Brooklyn high school, identifying it as a location attended by "Israhell loving Zionisits." The post included a map pinpointing the Leon Goldstein High School for the Sciences. Abdul has pleaded not guilty to charges including making a terroristic threat and a threat of mass harm, while her attorney has declined to comment on the case.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to intensify efforts against crime in Washington, D.C., and issued a directive for the city's homeless population to relocate immediately. In a social media post, he promised to provide alternative places for them to stay far from the capital, stating, "There will be no 'MR. NICE GUY.'" This renewed focus on D.C. follows an assault on a former government official and comes despite Justice Department data showing a 30-year low in violent crime in the city for 2024. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser criticized Trump's rhetoric as hyperbolic and false.</p>

          <p>In the men's Hundred cricket competition, the Southern Brave secured a dominant nine-wicket victory over the Birmingham Phoenix. The Brave's formidable bowling attack, led by Jofra Archer and Michael Bracewell, restricted Phoenix to a modest 106-7. Archer claimed two key wickets for just 16 runs, effectively stifling any chance of a competitive total from the struggling Phoenix side. In response, the Brave chased down the target with ease, reaching their goal with 19 balls to spare, thanks to strong batting performances from Leus du Plooy and James Vince.</p>

The priest was hospitalized and remains in a serious condition, and the linked events have caused significant shock and concern throughout the local community.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte described the upcoming summit between Presidents Trump and Putin as an important opportunity to test Russia's willingness to end the war in Ukraine. Speaking to ABC News, Rutte praised Trump's efforts to pressure Moscow, including through sanctions and facilitating weapons deliveries. In sharp contrast, former national security adviser John Bolton expressed concern, arguing the meeting legitimizes a pariah leader and risks negotiations sliding in Russia's favor. Bolton fears Putin will use the one-on-one meeting to manipulate Trump, while Rutte remains confident that the alliance will not be divided.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall and subsequent flash flooding forced the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair. The fairgrounds in West Allis, near Milwaukee, were inundated with water after some areas received up to 10 inches of rain. The severe weather impacted a large portion of the Midwest, with flood warnings issued across six states. In the Milwaukee area, the storms led to widespread power outages, numerous water rescues by the fire department, and the cancellation of a national triathlon event. The city's public works department urged residents to avoid driving or walking through dangerous standing water.</p>

Lawmakers like Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Sen. Bernie Sanders defended Texas Democrats who fled the state to deny Republicans a quorum, arguing the move is a necessary response to an outrageous power grab by President Trump and Gov. Greg Abbott. In response, Abbott has threatened to have the absent lawmakers arrested upon their return to Texas and vowed to call continuous special legislative sessions until the redistricting is passed.

The plan, which has sparked widespread criticism and prompted an emergency UN Security Council meeting, involves funneling civilians into designated safe zones.

The piece contrasts the industry's push for favorable regulation with warnings from critics, like former SEC officials, who point to high volatility, speculative risks, and the potential for consumer harm.

The meeting notably excludes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has condemned any potential agreements made without Kyiv's involvement as "dead decisions." The U.S. has reportedly floated a deal involving Ukraine ceding territory, such as Crimea and the Donbas region, to Russia in exchange for a ceasefire, an idea Zelensky has rejected. The choice of Alaska as a venue is symbolic, as the U.S. purchased the territory from Russia in 1867.</p>

          <p>Allies of the late Alex Salmond have rejected claims made in Nicola Sturgeon's upcoming memoir that Salmond himself may have leaked details of a sexual misconduct investigation against him. In her book, Sturgeon denies being the source of the leak but suggests it would have been a "classic Alex" move. Kenny MacAskill, leader of the Alba party, called Sturgeon a hypocrite for her remarks while blocking transparency during her time in office. The journalist who broke the original story also stated he found the theory that Salmond was the source to be not credible, highlighting the deep rift between the two former leaders of the SNP.</p>

          <h2>Designer Willy Chavarria Apologizes for Adidas Shoe After Cultural Appropriation Accusations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 09:45:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following criticism that a shoe he designed with Adidas Originals constituted cultural appropriation. The Oaxaca Slip-On was inspired by traditional Mexican huarache sandals but was reportedly made in China without crediting or partnering with the Indigenous communities who originated the design. The issue drew condemnation, including from Mexico's president, for taking ideas from these communities without acknowledgment. Chavarria expressed deep regret that the design was not developed in a meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community, and promotional images of the shoe have been removed.</p>

          <p>Powerful storms swept through eastern Nebraska, resulting in one death and significant damage. A woman was killed when a large tree, felled by winds exceeding 80 mph, crushed her vehicle in a state park; a man in the same vehicle was critically injured. The high winds also caused extensive damage to two housing units at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln, forcing the displacement of 387 inmates. The severe weather system affected other Midwest states as well, with flash flooding reported in Wisconsin and strong storm warnings stretching into Illinois.</p>

          <p>Jason and Katie Lee, a couple from Ohio, saved $60,000 over five years to quit their jobs and move with their young son to Taiwan for a 13-month sabbatical. The primary motivation was to allow their son to bond with his paternal grandparents and for the family to immerse themselves in the culture. The career break provided Jason time to focus on his mental and physical health and re-evaluate his professional ambitions, leading him to prioritize flexibility and happiness over a high salary.

          <p>A coalition of key European nations, including France, Germany, and the UK, has issued a joint statement affirming that a lasting peace in Ukraine cannot be achieved without Kyiv's direct involvement. The declaration comes ahead of a planned one-on-one meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, which currently does not include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. While welcoming Trump's efforts to end the conflict, the European leaders stressed that Ukraine must have the freedom to decide its own destiny. The White House has indicated it remains open to a future trilateral meeting involving Zelensky.</p>
