          <h2>Novo Nordisk Anticipates Wegovy Sales Rebound as Copycat Drug Competition Lessens</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 06:03:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novo Nordisk's shares experienced a surge following the company's announcement that it expects sales of its Wegovy weight loss drug to improve in the latter half of 2025. This positive outlook is attributed to the anticipated phasing out of copycat compounded drugs, which had previously impacted Wegovy's market share in the U.S. The company's CEO, Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, stated that the end of the FDA's drug shortage ruling would enable sales to recover, and Novo Nordisk intends to pursue companies unlawfully distributing copycat drugs. The company reported better-than-expected first-quarter net profit, and is launching an online pharmacy to lower Wegovy costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is defending its newly-agreed trade deal with India against claims that it could disadvantage British workers, specifically regarding an exemption on National Insurance contributions (Nics). Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds asserts that the deal will not undercut British workers, highlighting that the UK has 16 agreements preventing double taxation of work. The deal extends the Nics exemption from one to three years for people on short-term visas, which opposition parties argue could make Indian workers cheaper to employ. The deal aims to boost trade between the UK and India by making it easier for UK firms to export goods like whisky and cars, and cutting taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports to the UK.</p>

          <p>Four women, identified as Jane Does, have filed a lawsuit against singer Smokey Robinson and his wife Frances Robinson, alleging sexual battery, assault, and a hostile work environment. The women, all former housekeepers for the Robinsons, claim that Smokey Robinson subjected them to unwanted sexual advances and assaults over several years, while Frances Robinson is accused of perpetuating a hostile work environment. The plaintiffs are seeking a sum of no less than $50 million in damages and a jury trial, citing emotional distress and financial losses due to the alleged misconduct. The attorneys for the women stated that the women were 'unwilling to report' Robinson's alleged acts to authorities due to their 'fear of losing' their livelihood, while bringing 'reprisal, public embarrassment, shame and humiliation' to them and their families.</p>

          <p>Footage showing an Egyptian military officer in a Chinese J-10 fighter jet during the joint Eagles of Civilisation 2025 exercise has renewed speculation about a potential arms sale between China and Egypt. The 18-day exercise, the first joint air training between the two countries, is seen as a possible indicator of Cairo's interest in acquiring Chinese jets. This follows reports of Egypt's potential purchase of the latest J-10C model, which has been compared to upgraded versions of the US F-16 Fighting Falcon. A deal with Egypt would expand Beijing's arms exports to a key US ally and potentially reshape the regional geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>A Republican state representative in Texas, Stan Gerdes, has introduced the Forbidden Unlawful Representation of Roleplaying in Educational Spaces (FURRIES) Act, aiming to ban schoolkids from acting like animals. Gerdes claims to have heard reports of "furry-related incidents" in schools, though he couldn't provide evidence of schools providing litter boxes for students identifying as felines. Critics argue this is a cynical attempt to attack public schools and justify defunding them, distracting voters with culture war issues to pass legislation benefiting the wealthy. Texas governor Greg Abbott referenced the FURRIES Act while promoting a bill allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition.</p>

          <p>A recent Pew Research Center report indicates a decline in interpersonal trust, with only 30% of Americans generally trusting one another, a decrease from 50% in the 1970s. Experts suggest that economic inequality, technology, increasing diversity, and political polarization contribute to this rise in distrust. Trust is essential for vulnerability, sharing dreams, and feeling safe in relationships, and while skepticism is healthy, cynicism is not preferable. Research suggests that people assess competence, benevolence, and integrity when deciding to trust someone, with genetics playing a role in how trusting we are, while distrust is shaped by past experiences. The article offers tips for fostering trust, including approaching differences with curiosity, embracing a team mindset, and leaning into transparency.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden, in his first interview since leaving office, criticized President Donald Trump's pressure on Ukraine to cede territory to Russia, calling it "modern-day appeasement." Biden expressed concern over eroding relations between the U.S. and Europe under Trump, particularly regarding NATO member nations' trust in the U.S. He also criticized Trump's statements about acquiring Panama, Greenland, and Canada, which he believes have bred distrust of the United States in Europe. Biden emphasized that the U.S. should be about freedom, democracy, and opportunity, not confiscation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent reports and endorsements promoting cattle and sheep farming as sustainable are facing criticism for downplaying the environmental impact of livestock. George Monbiot argues that beef and lamb production are land-hungry and climate-damaging, citing methane emissions and the need for grazing areas that could support carbon-rich ecosystems. Reports from FAI Farms and the Sustainable Food Trust are challenged for flawed methodologies and measurement omissions, including questionable carbon sequestration figures and unrealistic assumptions about dietary changes and food waste reduction. Monbiot suggests these claims are industry lobbying disguised as bucolic imagery, hindering efforts to address the complex challenge of sustainable food production.</p>

The move is supported by union Aslef and the Rail Safety and Standards Board, citing research that 18-year-olds are capable of safely becoming train drivers.

          <p>Democrats are being criticized for seemingly supporting President Trump's crypto plans despite pledges to protect government payments from his influence. High-profile Democrats joined Republicans to introduce legislation allowing payments in stablecoins, paving the way for Trump to require government payments to be made with cryptocurrencies, including one he has a business interest in. Critics argue that stablecoins lack consumer protections and are favored for illicit finance, while the legislation gives crypto businesses access to the same payment system as banks with weaker standards. There are concerns that Trump could use his power to benefit the crypto industry and his own crypto venture.</p>

          <p>Motown legend Smokey Robinson is being sued by four anonymous housekeepers for $50 million, alleging sexual assault and workplace violations. The lawsuit claims Robinson summoned the women to his properties and forced them to have sex over several years, starting in 2006. The women also allege workplace violations, including being paid below minimum wage and denied overtime pay. The lawsuit names Robinson's wife, Frances, claiming she contributed to a hostile work environment. Representatives for the Robinsons have not yet responded to the allegations.</p>

          <p>German football is experiencing a decline in teenage participation, with nearly 6,000 men's U19 and U17 teams lost since 2006, prompting the German FA (DFB) to push for reforms focused on fun and engagement over results. Factors contributing to this decline include the rise of digital platforms, the cost of playing organized football, and the intense scheduling of youth football. Reforms are aimed at reducing the drop out for U19s, but a results-focused culture in youth football remains a problem. A key focus is for training concepts to be more open to creative ideas, so as to get more children playing.</p>

          <p>President Trump's escalating tariff proposals have led to a shift in perception, with corporate executives becoming resigned to the idea of significant tariffs as a new normal. By initially threatening drastic tariff increases and then scaling them back, Trump has effectively increased acceptance of the tariffs that remain in place, a psychological effect known as anchoring. Despite some exceptions, the U.S. maintains substantial tariffs on various imports, leading to higher consumer costs and potential economic disruptions, though some investors are encouraged by signs of potential trade deals.</p>

          <p>President Trump's economic policies, particularly his use of tariffs, are examined in the context of historical economic cycles, questioning his ability to reverse long-term trends. Drawing on the work of historian Fernand Braudel, the article suggests that Trump's efforts to restore American manufacturing dominance may be undermined by deeper economic forces, such as the shift from manufacturing to finance and the rise of global trade. The analysis suggests that despite Trump's attempts to reshape the global economy, the U.S. may be entering a period of decline similar to that experienced by previous economic powers like Amsterdam and London.</p>
