          <p>The UK government is underwriting a £1.5 billion loan to Jaguar Land Rover to support the automaker and its suppliers after a cyber-attack halted production. The attack, which occurred at the end of August, has forced a weeks-long shutdown, raising concerns that smaller suppliers could face financial collapse. This government intervention, the first of its kind for a cyber-attack, aims to protect thousands of jobs and provide stability to the supply chain as JLR works to resume operations. The loan will be repaid by JLR over five years. (not investment advice)</p>

The attacks come as President Volodymyr Zelensky warns that Russia's aggression will not be confined to Ukraine, citing recent Russian incursions into NATO airspace. In response, NATO has been bolstering its eastern flank, and Poland has been scrambling jets during strikes on western Ukraine.</p>

A former heart surgeon, Nelson's tenure was marked by significant policy changes, including reversing a controversial 2015 policy regarding children of same-sex couples and discontinuing the use of the term "Mormon." His leadership also saw the church navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, sever ties with the Boy Scouts of America, and forge a partnership with the NAACP. Dallin H. Oaks is expected to succeed him.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's United States and Vladimir Putin's Russia are engaged in a "pincer movement" that threatens European liberal democracies, drawing parallels to the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The author contends that while their methods differ, both leaders share objectives such as weakening the EU, promoting far-right nationalist parties, and rejecting international law. The piece suggests their actions, from economic pressure and tariffs to hybrid warfare and cultural subversion, are mutually reinforcing and create a concerted assault on European security and prosperity.</p>

          <p>Citizens in Zurich, Switzerland, are voting in a referendum to decide on severely restricting the use of leaf blowers and vacuums to curb noise and air pollution. If the proposal passes, gas-powered models will be completely banned within the city. The use of electric devices would be permitted only from October to December, with special permissions required at other times of the year. Supporters argue the measure will reduce noise and harmful fine dust, while opponents claim it represents an unnecessary prohibition that complicates maintenance work.</p>

          <p>A Texas teenager, Benjamin Elliott, is on trial for the murder of his twin sister, Meghan, whom he fatally stabbed in the neck while she slept. Elliott, who was 17 at the time, immediately called 911, claiming he thought he was dreaming and had no motive to harm his sister, whom he described as his best friend. The defense is arguing that the act was unintentional, citing a family history of sleepwalking and expert analysis from a sleep disorder specialist. Prosecutors remain skeptical, questioning his account and the physical evidence, leading to a complex case with no clear motive.</p>

The plan aims to address the country's housing crisis by creating large-scale new communities, with a recommendation that at least 40% of the homes be classified as affordable.

          <p>A new report indicates that a majority of companies globally anticipate incurring "AI debt" due to the hasty and improper implementation of artificial intelligence systems. This debt manifests as the future costs of correcting security risks, poor data quality, and inefficient AI agents that waste time and resources. Despite a surge in AI adoption, many organizations lack the necessary infrastructure, training, and oversight, leading to increased digital burnout among employees. Experts advise a more thoughtful approach, involving piloting and sandboxing AI tools to build a solid foundation rather than rushing to deploy them unprepared.</p>

The move, triggered by France, Germany, and the UK, comes after Iran restricted international monitoring of its nuclear program and continues to enrich uranium to near weapons-grade levels. These sanctions will freeze Iranian assets, halt arms deals, and penalize its ballistic missile program, adding severe pressure to an already struggling economy.

The first batches of the crabs, which are maturing earlier this year due to a warmer climate, have hit markets with lower prices than last year.

          <p>Lieutenant Colonel George E. Hardy, the last surviving member of the Tuskegee Airmen to have flown combat missions in World War II, has died at the age of 100. Hardy joined the U.S. Army Air Corps at 18 and completed 21 missions over Europe as part of the pioneering group of Black military aviators. He later flew combat missions in both the Korean and Vietnam Wars, retiring in 1971 after a distinguished career. Hardy, along with other Tuskegee Airmen, was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007 for his courage and perseverance in the face of systemic racism.</p>

          <p>The Sanxingdui Museum in China's Sichuan province plans to use modern technology to showcase its ancient treasures to a global audience. While many of the museum's most significant artifacts are designated as national treasures and cannot leave the country, officials are exploring immersive digital exhibitions and high-quality replicas. This approach would allow international museums to display the unique and mysterious artifacts from the Sanxingdui civilization, which dates back over 3,000 years. The museum is planning its first major international exhibition using these methods for next year, pending state approval.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he directed the Secretary of Defense to deploy "all necessary troops" to Portland, Oregon, to protect ICE facilities from perceived threats. This move was met with immediate pushback from Oregon's Governor Tina Kotek and Portland's mayor, who stated there was no need for a federal military presence and that it was a "threat to communities." The action follows a presidential memorandum aimed at cracking down on what the administration terms "domestic terrorism." Local officials reported that recent protests in the city have been peaceful and have not seen the unrest of previous years.</p>
