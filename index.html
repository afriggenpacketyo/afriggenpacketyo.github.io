          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society examines the Hollywood blacklist, which began in 1947 amid investigations by the House Un-American Activities Committee into alleged Communist influence in the film industry. The display focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were imprisoned and blacklisted for refusing to answer the committee's questions. The article details how the blacklist expanded to affect numerous careers, including those of screenwriter Dalton Trumbo and entertainer Hazel Scott, and explores the broader impact of the Red Scare on American society. The exhibit raises questions about democracy, freedom of speech, and the consequences of punishing individuals for holding unpopular political views.</p>

          <p>Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche for approximately nine hours over two days after being granted a limited form of immunity. This "proffer immunity" allowed her to answer questions without her statements being used against her, a common practice when prosecutors seek cooperation. Maxwell, who is appealing her 20-year sentence for crimes related to Jeffrey Epstein, reportedly answered all questions about roughly 100 different individuals. While her attorney stated no deals have been made, he acknowledged she would welcome any relief, as President Trump commented he has not currently considered clemency for her.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a significant conservation mission to save the state's bighorn sheep, whose population has been halved in the last five years due to disease. The disease was introduced by non-native animals brought to the region. In a carefully planned operation, biologists captured and airlifted dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd to an isolated, safe mountain range over 200 miles away. A recent check on the relocated herd revealed their successful survival and the birth of new lambs, signaling a hopeful resurgence for the native species and a monumental success for the conservation team.</p>

          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire talks has stalled, with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff announcing his team's departure from Qatar, citing a response from Hamas that he claims shows a lack of desire for an agreement. Hamas has demanded a full Israeli withdrawal for the release of hostages, a condition Israel rejects. Amid the diplomatic breakdown, the humanitarian situation in Gaza has grown catastrophic, with the U.N. reporting that Palestinian children are starving to death. Aid organizations like UNICEF state that malnutrition is spreading rapidly, with a 180% increase in acute cases among children since February, as aid delivery remains severely restricted by Israel.</p>

          <p>Following a two-day meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Ghislaine Maxwell's attorney confirmed she answered questions about roughly 100 different people without holding back. Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role with Jeffrey Epstein, met with the high-ranking Justice Department official in Tallahassee. The meetings come amid political pressure on the Trump administration to release more information related to the Epstein case. President Trump stated he has not considered a pardon for Maxwell, though her lawyer indicated they would welcome any relief and hope the president exercises his power in a "just way."</p>

          <p>This article explores the validity and flexibility of common health targets, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting seven to nine hours of sleep, and exercising 150 minutes per week. Experts offer varied perspectives; one kidney specialist suggests simply drinking when thirsty is sufficient for most, while a nutritionist highlights the benefits of hydration for preventing fatigue and brain fog. Regarding sleep, a specialist emphasizes that seven hours is a crucial minimum for long-term health, discouraging naps as a substitute. Ultimately, most experts agree that while these benchmarks are useful guides, individuals should focus on incorporating a healthy outlook into their lives without fixating on achieving every numerical goal perfectly.</p>

He acknowledged that the Democratic party has been negligent in the district but criticized the recent redistricting as "cheating."

It also examines the nuanced impact of the menstrual cycle on performance, noting that while hormonal fluctuations can affect the body, athletes have succeeded at all phases of their cycle. Additionally, the piece discusses why female athletes face a higher risk of ACL injuries, linking it to anatomical differences and historical disparities in quality training.</p>

The boxes primarily contain dried goods like pasta and lentils, which require scarce water and fuel to prepare. Nutrition experts who reviewed the contents stated that while the boxes provide sufficient calories for survival, they are deficient in essential micronutrients like iron, zinc, and various vitamins. Prolonged reliance on this diet could lead to serious health issues such as anemia and scurvy, with one expert describing the provisions as delivering a "full stomach but an empty diet."</p>

          <p>A worldwide craze for matcha, the powdered Japanese green tea, is causing a significant supply shortage and driving up prices. Fueled by social media trends and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, demand for matcha has skyrocketed, with some cafes reporting that a month's supply now lasts only a few days. The situation is worsened by poor harvests in Japan due to heatwaves, a shortage of tea farmers, and new U.S. tariffs on Japanese goods. In response, retailers are limiting purchases, and advocates are promoting more mindful consumption to preserve the high-grade tea for its traditional use rather than in food recipes.</p>

          <p>A wave of intense sectarian violence has devastated the Druze-majority city of Sweida in Syria, leaving an estimated 1,380 people dead and displacing over 120,000. The fighting, which erupted between Bedouin clans and the Druze minority, involved summary executions and heavy bombardment, turning the city into a slaughterhouse. This article recounts the horrific experience of one family that saw 13 members killed by gunmen. The crisis highlights the instability under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, as his government forces aligned with the Bedouins, and Israel conducted airstrikes to protect its Druze population, further complicating the fragile situation in post-Assad Syria.</p>

          <p>Gaza is on the verge of a full-blown famine that will be difficult to reverse once it begins, according to Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International. After 21 months of war and restricted aid, the population's health is severely compromised, making them highly vulnerable to starvation and disease. Konyndyk criticizes the current aid system, run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, as ineffective, delivering minimal, poor-quality aid and forcing people to risk their lives at distribution sites. He argues that Israel's blockade and obstruction of professional humanitarian organizations are indisputably using starvation as a weapon of war, creating a crisis with devastating momentum.</p>

          <p>For the first time, multiple Christian contemporary musicians are simultaneously charting on the Billboard Hot 100, signaling a potential shift in the mainstream music landscape. This article explores the rise of Christian Contemporary Music (CCM), an industry ecosystem that mirrors mainstream styles without what it deems objectionable content. Experts discuss how megachurches like Hillsong and Bethel drive the genre's sound and how a new wave of male, country-flavored artists are finding success. The trend is seen by some as reflecting a broader cultural and political moment, connecting with a conservative search for faith and an administration that speaks of fighting anti-Christian bias.</p>

Key questions remain about the future of the streaming service Paramount+, which has struggled to compete with larger rivals, and the fate of traditional broadcast and cable assets in a declining market.

          <p>The White House has announced it will release $5.5 billion in federal education funds that it had frozen just before their scheduled distribution for the 2025-26 school year. The administration had withheld the congressionally approved money, claiming it discovered funds being used to subsidize a "radical left-wing agenda." This decision prompted widespread outrage from educators and bipartisan pushback, including from ten Republican senators who argued the freeze denied communities support for long-standing programs like after-school and summer enrichment. Following the reversal, lawmakers and education groups hailed the release of the critical funding for schools across the country.</p>

The move comes just days before Jacobs is set to have a confirmation hearing to lead the agency again.
