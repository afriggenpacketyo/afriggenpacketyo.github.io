          <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, rose to a 2.9% annual rate in July, its highest level since February. This figure, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, met economists' expectations and suggests that tariffs are influencing the U.S. economy. Despite inflation remaining above the Fed's 2% target, markets still anticipate an interest rate cut in September, a sentiment supported by recent comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller. The report also indicated consumer spending remained strong, increasing by 0.5% during the month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's foreign ministry has strongly condemned a visit by U.S. Senators Roger Wicker and Deb Fischer to Taiwan, labeling it a serious violation of the "one-China" principle. A ministry spokesperson stated that the meeting with Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te undermines China's sovereignty and sends an incorrect message to what it calls separatist forces. Beijing urged Washington to cease its support for Taiwanese independence advocates, warning that such actions escalate tensions in the Taiwan Strait. The U.S. officially acknowledges the one-China principle but is also legally bound to provide Taiwan with arms for self-defense.</p>

          <p>Nick Woltemade, a 23-year-old German striker, has made a high-profile move to the Premier League after a standout season with Stuttgart, where he scored 17 goals. Known for his unique combination of height and technical skill, Woltemade also led Germany's U21 team to a second-place finish in the European Championship. His transfer, reportedly for a record €85 million, came after Stuttgart rejected bids from Bayern Munich, marking a significant win for the club. The move to Newcastle United is seen as a crucial step for his development and his prospects for Germany's World Cup squad.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has removed Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office for violating ethics standards, a decision stemming from a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader Hun Sen. In the call, she was heard criticizing the Thai army amid border tensions, which the court ruled undermined national interests. This marks the fifth time the court has dismissed a prime minister since 2008 and is a significant blow to the influential Shinawatra political dynasty.

          <p>In a legal confrontation, President Trump has asked a federal judge to deny Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's request for a temporary restraining order to block her potential firing. The move to dismiss Cook is based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which her lawyer has described as a "smear campaign." In a separate filing, the Federal Reserve Board stated it would not argue the merits of the case but asked for a prompt ruling to resolve the dispute. This legal battle highlights the significant conflict between the White House and the central bank's leadership.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially ended the "de minimis" trade exemption, which previously allowed shipments valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. This policy shift is causing significant disruption for global retailers and supply chains, with experts predicting "pandemonium" as businesses adjust their operational and financial models. The change is expected to lead to higher prices for consumers on a wide range of imported goods, with one study estimating a cost of at least $10.9 billion for U.S. families.

While overall revenues slightly missed forecasts, the revival of its e-commerce business also contributed positively.

The Ministry of Local Government, led by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, based its savings estimates on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN). However, the CCN has since revised its findings, now suggesting the mergers could potentially cost money rather than generate savings, depending on the structure of the new authorities. Critics have called it "astonishing" that such a significant reform was undertaken without independent, up-to-date evidence.</p>

The robust growth comes as the country faces new economic headwinds, including recently imposed U.S. tariffs that have caused the Indian rupee to fall to record lows.

          <p>Liverpool is expected to make an improved second bid, reportedly around £120 million, for Newcastle striker Alexander Isak before the transfer window closes. This potential British record deal is the key to unlocking a chain of subsequent transfers involving several other players. For the deal to proceed, Newcastle is reportedly looking to sign two replacement strikers, including Stuttgart's Nick Woltemade and Brentford's Yoane Wissa. Brentford, in turn, is targeting Borussia Dortmund's Max Beier, creating a complex domino effect where each move is dependent on the others being completed successfully.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has affirmed his support for a 0.25% interest rate cut in September, and indicated he is open to a larger, half-point cut if the labor market shows further signs of weakening. In a recent speech, Waller expressed concern that economic conditions could deteriorate rapidly and argued the Fed should act preemptively rather than wait. He anticipates that upcoming revisions from the Bureau of Labor Statistics will show that job creation was weaker than initially reported. His comments reinforce market expectations for monetary easing in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested two firefighters battling a wildfire on Washington's Olympic Peninsula, stating the individuals were in the country illegally. The arrests occurred during an identity check requested by the Bureau of Land Management as part of a criminal investigation into the contractors the firefighters worked for. The incident prompted a sharp rebuke from Senator Patty Murray, who called the administration's immigration policy "sick" and "immoral." The Border Patrol maintained that the enforcement action did not interfere with firefighting operations, but the move was criticized by other officials as well.</p>

Prominent conservative figures, including Donald Trump Jr., attacked the change as "woke" and a betrayal of the company's traditional American aesthetic. This article argues the outrage is a cynical maneuver by culture warriors like Christopher Rufo to make an example of the company and instill fear in other corporations.

          <p>An upcoming military parade in Beijing will provide a rare glimpse into the current hierarchy of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), as the identities of commanding generals can signal who is rising in the ranks. The event, marking the anniversary of the end of World War II, is also notable for who might be absent. The PLA has been subject to an ongoing anti-corruption campaign under President Xi Jinping, which has led to the removal of at least 16 military deputies from the National People's Congress since early 2023. Observers will be watching closely for clues about personnel changes and political standing within the military.</p>

          <p>According to multiple sources, U.S. Ambassador to China David Perdue is expected to skip the large-scale military parade being held in Beijing to commemorate the end of World War II. This move is seen as part of a coordinated effort by Western diplomatic missions to opt out of the event, despite pressure from the Chinese government to attend. The parade is a major event for Beijing, intended to showcase its military strength and historical narrative. The expected absence of the U.S. envoy and other Western diplomats signals ongoing political and ideological divides between China and the West.</p>

          <p>Unlike many other developed nations, the United States does not mandate retirement savings, relying instead on voluntary plans like 401(k)s. This structural difference is a key reason the U.S. system received a C+ rating in a global pension index, ranking 29th out of 48 countries. Top-rated systems, such as the one in the Netherlands, require mandatory contributions from both employers and employees into defined contribution plans, ensuring broader coverage. Experts suggest that improving coverage, whether through mandates or making it easier to join voluntary plans, is the most critical step for enhancing long-term retirement security in the U.S.</p>

Their connection grew over shared stories and a challenge to a salsa dance-off, which eventually turned into a disco night due to a change of plans. A magical moment on the dance floor sealed their connection, leading to a nine-year relationship and a shared life of travel, proving first impressions can be misleading.</p>
