          <p>Pro-Palestinian protesters, seeking to revive the movement from the previous spring, occupied part of Columbia University's main library, renaming it "the Basel Al-Araj Popular University" and hanging banners. The protest comes amid increased pressure on Columbia to address pro-Palestinian demonstrations and concerns about protecting Jewish students from harassment, leading to federal research funding cuts. University officials are asking protesters for identification and warning of disciplinary consequences for disrupting academic activities as public safety officers work to control the situation. The article states that the pro-Palestinian movement at Columbia has become smaller and more extreme, with leaders supporting armed resistance by groups considered terrorist organizations.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Springfield, Illinois, criticizing the state's sanctuary policies and demanding changes to protect citizens from undocumented immigrants. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker responded by condemning the Trump administration's immigration policies and defending the Illinois Trust Act, a bipartisan law that complies with federal regulations. The article reports that Pritzker accused Noem of a publicity stunt and weaponizing the Real ID deadline to create fear, while Noem defended her visit by highlighting the costs of care for undocumented immigrants and claiming the Trump administration secured the border.

          <p>AppLovin's shares experienced a significant increase after exceeding earnings and revenue expectations and revealing the sale of its mobile gaming business to Tripledot Studios for $400 million in cash, with AppLovin also acquiring a 20% stake in Tripledot. The company's first-quarter net income rose to $576 million, driven by strong performance in its ad-tech sector. However, AppLovin's second-quarter sales projections of $1.2 billion to $1.22 billion fell short of analyst forecasts. The sale of the mobile gaming business is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025.</p>

          <p>In Memphis, Tennessee, three former police officers were found not guilty on all state charges, including second-degree murder, related to the death of Tyre Nichols, sparking outrage from Nichols' family and civil rights advocates. The jury, selected from a majority-White county, reached the verdict after an eight-and-a-half-hour deliberation. The defense argued that Emmitt Martin, another officer involved, was primarily responsible for the beating and that the officers acted within police department policy. The article states that the acquitted officers still face federal charges, while two other officers have pleaded guilty in both state and federal court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate, currently ranging from 4.25% to 4.5%, as policymakers assess the potential economic consequences of President Trump's trade policies. Fed Chair Jerome Powell expressed concerns about the rising risks of higher inflation and unemployment due to the tariffs, noting that consumer and business sentiment has declined. The central bank aims to adopt a cautious approach, retaining the flexibility to adjust rates in response to economic developments, but Wall Street is interpreting Powell's remarks as a sign of increased stagflation risk. Economists anticipate that Trump's tariffs will contribute to inflation later in the year.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's shares saw an increase following the Trump administration's decision to reverse the "AI diffusion rule," which would have imposed restrictions on exporting advanced AI chips. The Department of Commerce stated that the existing rule was overly complex and hindered American innovation, prompting a simpler replacement to ensure American AI dominance. Chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD have opposed the restrictions, with Nvidia's CEO emphasizing the potential loss of being excluded from the Chinese AI market.

Griffin's concession followed a judge's rejection of his legal challenges, a decision that boosts Democrats' chances of regaining the majority on the court in 2028. The ruling by Chief Judge Richard E. Myers II, appointed by Republican President Donald Trump, marks a significant victory for Democrats in the swing state.

          <p>This article argues that the current charitable tax deduction system in the U.S. disproportionately benefits wealthy donors and the charities they support, such as museums and universities, while offering little to no benefit to lower-income donors and their preferred local causes. The author proposes replacing the charitable deduction with a tax incentive that is determined by the amount of the donation, not the income of the donor. The article suggests emulating systems like the British Gift Aid program or the Canadian tax credit to provide equal subsidies for all donations, thereby removing the incentive for charities to prioritize wealthy donors.</p>
