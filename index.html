        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant decline following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, as the absence of casualties raised hopes for de-escalation in the Middle East conflict. U.S. crude oil fell by 7.22% to $68.51 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent decreased by 7.18% to $71.48, reaching the lowest levels since Israel began bombing Iran on June 13. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told CNBC that the market selloff reflects investors' belief that the conflict will de-escalate following the U.S. strikes on Iran. Qatar confirmed that its air defenses intercepted the Iranian missiles, resulting in no casualties. Optimism for a quick resolution to the conflict has led to a more stable outlook for oil prices.

          <p>Super Micro Computer's stock price decreased by approximately 6% after the company announced plans to offer $2 billion in convertible notes, maturing in 2030. The offering's proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including funding working capital for growth and business expansion, with $200 million allocated for stock repurchase from note issuers. Despite the recent drop, Super Micro shares have increased by nearly 40% in 2025, driven by strong demand for Nvidia's AI processors, solidifying the company's position as a leader in AI-optimized infrastructure. Investors had previously expressed concerns regarding tariffs and AI chip uncertainty, leading to a reduction in the company's fiscal 2025 guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several airlines rerouted flights in the Middle East following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. military base in Qatar, further escalating the regional military conflict. Over 20 commercial aircraft headed for Doha, Qatar, were diverted, while four flights to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates were redirected, with the UAE's airspace temporarily closed. British Airways has canceled its Doha flights through Wednesday, prioritizing safety and advising customers of their options. These measures reflect heightened concerns over airspace security in the region. The airspace closures and diversions are expected to cause significant disruptions to air travel schedules.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has banned staffers from using Meta's WhatsApp due to concerns over data privacy and security. The Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) cited a lack of transparency in WhatsApp's data practices, instructing staff to remove the app from government devices. Meta has responded, disagreeing with the CAO's characterization and emphasizing WhatsApp's encrypted nature, which provides a higher level of security than many approved apps. Acceptable alternatives include Microsoft Teams, Signal, and Apple's iMessage, as recommended by the CAO.

Schnall argued that his ejection was unjustified, claiming he was wrongly accused of bumping an umpire who tripped. The NCAA stated Schnall was ejected for arguing balls and strikes after receiving a warning. Coastal Carolina's athletic director, Chance Miller, expressed concern that the ejections altered the trajectory of the game, imploring the NCAA to re-evaluate its training and review processes for umpires. Schnall's suspension will begin in the 2026 season due to LSU winning the College World Series.</p>

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced plans to reduce the company's corporate workforce due to efficiency gains from AI. A World Economic Forum report found that 48% of U.S. employers plan to reduce their workforce because of AI. Other tech companies, including Microsoft and Google, are also reducing headcount. Klarna has reduced its workforce by about 40% due to AI, according to CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski. The rise of AI is expected to lead to fewer people doing some jobs while creating demand for new roles.</p>

Palestine Action called the government's action "unhinged" and said it would pursue legal challenges.

Coatti, who previously worked for Britain's Royal Society of Biology, was reportedly lured to an abandoned house by a gang planning to rob him. Police received a tip-off that led them to a house where traces of blood were found. Santa Marta's Mayor Carlos Pinedo offered a reward of $12,000 for information leading to the capture of the killers.

          <p>Florida officials have petitioned the Supreme Court to allow the state to enforce a new immigration law that criminalizes unlawful entry into Florida. Attorney General James Uthmeier requested the Supreme Court to halt a federal judge's decision preventing the law's enforcement. The judge ruled that the measure is likely unconstitutional, but Uthmeier argues that the law is necessary to protect Florida's citizens from the harms of illegal immigration. The state's immigration law makes it a crime for individuals in the U.S. illegally to knowingly enter or re-enter Florida after evading immigration officers. The case highlights the ongoing legal battles over immigration enforcement between state and federal authorities.</p>

The Congressional Budget Office projected that about 11 million people would lose health-care coverage due to provisions in the bill. Medical debt would increase by $50 billion as a result of the budget bill changes, a 15% rise over today's $340 billion in unpaid debts. Sen.

Novo Nordisk began selling Wegovy via telehealth companies to shift patients from compounded versions to the FDA-approved drug.

          <p>Ford Motor is recalling more than 197,000 Mustang Mach-E vehicles due to a door latch issue that could trap passengers inside, particularly children. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced the recall, citing that if the car's battery level drops too low, the door latches may remain locked. Ford is issuing a software update to address the recall and will notify owners of the safety risk. The company is not aware of any injuries or accidents associated with the faulty door latches. This recall follows a previous recall of over 1 million Ford and Lincoln vehicles due to a software glitch with the rearview camera.</p>

          <h2>Experts Assess Impact of Iran Conflict on Oil Prices</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about their impact on the oil and gas industry, particularly whether the conflict could lead to higher energy prices. Although oil prices initially surged, they later retreated as experts speculated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz. Disruption to oil flow through the Strait of Hormuz could severely impact markets in China, India, Japan, and South Korea. Experts predict that American drivers are likely to see higher gas prices, with prices jumping between 10 cents and 15 cents a gallon. The situation is expected to remain volatile, with ongoing tensions potentially disrupting the energy market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Homeowners Should Consider These Home Equity Loan Moves This Summer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 14:24:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With summer 2025 officially underway, homeowners should consider strategic moves regarding their home equity to manage expenses and improve financial health. Understanding the differences between a home equity loan and a HELOC (home equity line of credit) is crucial, as loans offer a lump sum with fixed interest rates, while HELOCs function as revolving credit lines with variable rates. Shopping around for rates and terms can lead to lower rates, especially with potential rate cuts on the horizon. Using home equity for financially sound purposes, such as paying off high-rate debt, is advisable, while avoiding uses like vacations is recommended. Prudent use of home equity can improve financial standing during the summer season. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Leaked code indicates that xAI is developing an advanced file editor for Grok with spreadsheet support, signaling the company’s push to compete with OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft by embedding AI copilots into productivity tools. The editor would allow users to interact with Grok while editing files. xAI launched Grok Studio in April 2025, a split-screen workspace for collaborating with Grok on various tasks. Google’s Gemini Workspace for Sheets, Docs, and Gmail appears to be the most similar to what xAI is reportedly building, but it only works within Google’s ecosystem. The advanced editor would be a step towards Elon Musk’s ambitions to turn X into an “everything app.”</p>
