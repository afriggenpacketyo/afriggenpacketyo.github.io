          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to maintain their long-term strategies. He argued that the move was widely expected and does not fundamentally alter major market themes or justify significant portfolio changes. Cramer suggested that the mixed market reaction might present buying opportunities, as stock performance is not solely dictated by Fed statements. He believes the central bank is taking a prudent, steady approach amid challenges like inflation and a weakening labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

The execution marks the 12th in the state this year, a record number since the death penalty was reinstated. Pittman was found guilty of fatally stabbing the three victims and setting their home on fire. His final appeals, which argued that he had an intellectual disability that should have precluded his execution, were denied by the courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone stated that he regrets his reaction towards Liverpool supporters following his team's 3-2 Champions League loss at Anfield. The incident occurred after Liverpool scored a last-minute winning goal, at which point Simeone appeared to be goaded by some home fans, leading to a confrontation that resulted in his being sent off. While expressing remorse for his part in the clash, Simeone also criticized what he described as continuous insults from the crowd throughout the game. He called for better protection for managers from such behavior in stadiums.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is actively reviewing numerous social media posts allegedly made by U.S. service members following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

At least six military officers have already been suspended or removed from duties pending investigation into their online remarks.

He asserted that the two leaders have never spoken directly and that members of the Trump administration have shown no interest in dialogue. Lula contrasted this with his historically positive relationships with other world leaders, emphasizing that Trump's connection was with former president Jair Bolsonaro, not with Brazil itself.</p>

          <p>The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is convening under intense political scrutiny to vote on key vaccine recommendations, including for COVID-19, hepatitis B, and the MMRV combo shot.

The states' guidelines, developed by medical doctors, are based on recommendations from major health associations and differ from the CDC's current stance, particularly regarding vaccinations for children and pregnant people.

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Tax Policies Create Complex Loopholes for Specific Groups</h2>

          <p>A recent analysis of President Trump's tax legislation, including the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," suggests it is creating a more complex and inequitable tax code. The laws extend tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy while also introducing specific carve-outs for certain working-class professions, such as a deduction for tipped income. This approach creates "horizontal inequity," where people with similar incomes face vastly different tax burdens depending on their profession or how their income is structured. The article argues this strategy is shrinking the overall tax base, leaving salaried, middle-class professionals to bear a more predictable and potentially larger share of the tax burden.

          <p>With U.S. household debt reaching record levels, many Americans are struggling to keep up with payments, especially on high-interest credit cards. For those whose debt exceeds their ability to pay, this article outlines several potential relief strategies beyond traditional budgeting. Options include debt consolidation to a lower-interest loan, negotiating a debt settlement for less than the full amount owed, or entering a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency. In the most severe cases, filing for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can provide a financial reset, though it has long-term credit implications.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Enacts Quarter-Point Interest Rate Cut Amid Slowing Labor Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 16:20:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, bringing the new target range to 4%-4.25%. This is the first rate cut since last December and comes in response to a slowing U.S. labor market and concerns about economic growth. Fed officials also signaled the possibility of two more cuts before the end of the year, though their projections show a more cautious approach for 2026. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that downside risks to employment have increased, making the rate cut a necessary step to support the economy despite persistent inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Chargers star edge rusher Khalil Mack is expected to miss four weeks after suffering a dislocated left elbow during a game against the Raiders. While a significant blow to the team's defense, the diagnosis was a relief as many initially feared a season-ending injury. Coach Jim Harbaugh praised Mack's toughness, and the team will now rely on players like Tuli Tuipulotu and Bud Dupree to step into larger roles. Mack has been notably durable throughout his career, and his absence will be a challenge as the team continues its early-season stretch of division games.</p>
