          <h2>Proposed Republican Bill Could End Medicaid Coverage for Millions of Americans</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major Republican reconciliation bill could significantly impact Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans. The Congressional Budget Office projects the bill would cut federal spending on Medicaid by $1 trillion and increase the number of uninsured people by nearly 12 million by 2034. Health policy experts warn that new work requirements could cause many older Americans to lose coverage, as employment becomes more difficult after age 50. Additionally, the substantial funding cuts raise concerns about the potential closure of rural hospitals and community health centers that heavily rely on Medicaid revenue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent polling indicates that while a majority of Americans oppose President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," public opinion is more divided on its specific provisions. A Quinnipiac University poll found 55% of voters oppose the bill, yet they are nearly evenly split on proposed work requirements for Medicaid recipients. Other polls from Fox News and the Pew Research Center show similar overall opposition but find that specific components, like extending certain tax cuts or increasing border security funding, have more nuanced support. This suggests that while the comprehensive package is unpopular, individual elements resonate differently across the electorate.</p>

          <p>In a series of early morning raids, Turkish authorities detained 157 people in the opposition stronghold of Izmir as part of an investigation into corruption and fraud. Those arrested include members of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) and the city's former mayor, Tunc Soyer. The CHP has condemned the detentions as a politically motivated crackdown, drawing parallels to the recent arrest of Istanbul's popular mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu.

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of killing four University of Idaho students in 2022, has accepted a plea deal to avoid the death penalty. According to prosecutors, he will plead guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary, resulting in four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of appeal. The deal was reached after Kohberger's defense team approached the state, but it has drawn an angry response from the family of victim Kaylee Goncalves, who claim they were not adequately consulted. The resolution brings a legal conclusion to a case that shocked the nation.</p>

          <p>Inflation across the euro zone rose slightly to 2% in June, precisely meeting the European Central Bank's (ECB) target for the first time in an extended period. This figure, reported by Eurostat, aligns with economists' expectations and signals a stabilization of consumer prices in the single-currency area. While the closely watched services inflation ticked up, the overall data has reinforced expectations that the ECB will hold its key interest rate steady in July. The ECB's chief economist stated that the central bank's cycle of interventions to curb peak inflation is now considered complete.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices fell by 0.8% in June, marking the most significant monthly decline since February 2023. This drop is largely attributed to weaker demand following changes to stamp duty rules in April, which reduced tax relief for many buyers. Despite the monthly fall, annual price growth stood at 2.1%, its slowest rate in nearly a year. Economists suggest the market slowdown is temporary, with supportive factors like low unemployment and potential interest rate cuts expected to bolster housing activity in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Starting in July, approximately 21 million households in Great Britain will see their energy bills fall by 7% under the new price cap set by regulator Ofgem. This translates to a reduction of about Â£11 per month for a typical household, offering some relief from the high cost of living. However, analysts caution that prices remain significantly above pre-pandemic levels, and there is considerable uncertainty about whether costs will rise again during the winter. Consumers are being encouraged to explore fixed-rate deals to secure more predictable payments amid ongoing market volatility.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has ordered the suspension of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office while it investigates a petition for her dismissal.

This ruling underscores the significant power of the Thai judiciary, which critics claim is often used to target political opponents.

          <p>A study published in The Lancet medical journal projects that the Trump administration's decision to cut over 80% of U.S. foreign humanitarian aid could result in more than 14 million additional deaths by 2030. Researchers state that the funding shock to low- and middle-income countries is comparable to a global pandemic, risking the reversal of two decades of health progress. The cuts, overseen by an initiative to shrink federal spending, have been condemned by humanitarian organizations and are already impacting vulnerable populations, including those in Kenyan refugee camps facing starvation.</p>

          <p>A Fox News opinion piece argues that the victory of socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral primary serves as a dire warning for conservatives. The author contends that when right-wing populism embraces state-led economic interventions like wage and price controls, it cedes ground to left-wing populists who will always promise more. The article suggests that this concession legitimizes a worldview where government is the primary economic arbiter, a battle the right is destined to lose. This trend, the author warns, could ultimately lead to more radical left-wing victories on a national scale.</p>

Chen previously served as the executive deputy minister of the United Front Work Department, the party's organ for managing relations with non-party groups, including ethnic and religious affairs. This high-profile appointment is significant because the Xinjiang party chief traditionally holds a seat on the Politburo, the party's top decision-making body. The move could therefore be a precursor to Chen's promotion into the highest echelons of China's political hierarchy, placing a specialist in ethnic affairs in a critical role.</p>

While mail-in voting has decreased from its pandemic-era peak in 2020, it remains more popular than in pre-pandemic elections. The most notable trend is the rise of in-person early voting, which has become a widely embraced option across all states. The data also showed that the 2024 election had the second-highest turnout in the last five presidential elections and that the rejection rate for mail ballots remained consistently low, indicating robust participation and system integrity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting a marathon voting session, known as a "vote-a-rama," on President Donald Trump's sprawling budget legislation, the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The bill's fate remains uncertain due to deep divisions within the Republican party over the extent of welfare program cuts needed to fund an extension of Trump's 2017 tax breaks. The process involves hours of debate on numerous amendments, with Republican leadership struggling to secure enough votes for final passage. The bill is projected to add over $3 trillion to the national debt, a key point of contention.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Huawei has open-sourced two of its Pangu artificial intelligence models in a strategic effort to accelerate global AI adoption and expand its tech ecosystem. This move allows developers to build on Huawei's technology, which is designed to work with its Ascend AI chips, creating a vertically integrated alternative to competitors like Nvidia. Experts believe this strategy will help Huawei overcome U.S. trade restrictions by fostering a global community of developers. The open-source approach is expected to be particularly appealing in developing countries and solidifies Huawei's position as a major player in the AI hardware and software stack.</p>

          <p>At a recent tech conference, experts emphasized the need for emerging economies to develop "sovereign AI"â€”the ability to control their own AI technologies and data. Panelists argued that since many prominent AI models are English-based, it is crucial for nations to build systems that reflect their own languages, cultures, and priorities. They identified open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing as key tools to democratize AI development and ensure strategic autonomy. This approach would allow countries, particularly in digitally savvy regions like Southeast Asia, to foster local talent and create more inclusive technology.</p>

They believe this would support household consumption and corporate investment in the short term. This perspective contrasts sharply with warnings from critics who highlight that the bill is projected to add over $3 trillion to the national debt.</p>

Despite offering concessions, such as protecting existing claimants from the new rules, the government is struggling to persuade a large number of its own MPs to support the bill. Critics within the party argue the changes are driven by a desire to meet fiscal targets rather than the needs of disabled people.

The speech reinforces his long-standing anti-corruption campaign, which Beijing views as critical to maintaining public trust and its legitimacy to rule.</p>

          <h2>Iowa Removes Gender Identity Protections from State Civil Rights Code</h2>

          <p>A new law taking effect in Iowa makes it the first state to remove gender identity from its civil rights protections. This means transgender and nonbinary residents are no longer legally protected from discrimination in employment, housing, and other areas of life. The law also defines sex based on reproductive organs at birth and removes the ability to change the sex designation on a birth certificate. The move is a significant rollback of rights that had been in place for nearly two decades and reflects a wider political trend of enacting restrictions on transgender people.</p>
