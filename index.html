The legislation provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 for home-schooled students. Democrats argue that the bill hurts public schools and primarily benefits wealthier students already in private school.

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to trim the IRS workforce has resulted in almost one-third of its tax auditors leaving the agency through March, according to a report from the U.S. Treasury Department's watchdog. The DOGE cuts, which have focused on firing probationary workers, may have disproportionately impacted newly hired auditors. Experts say losing a large share of auditors could impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue, given that these agents typically handle cases involving wealthy taxpayers or corporations. The cuts may end up costing almost as much as they've saved, according to an analysis from the Partnership for Public Service.</p>

          <p>The Baltimore Ravens released star kicker Justin Tucker, citing "football decisions," months after reports surfaced of sexual misconduct allegations made against him by massage therapists. Tucker, considered one of the greatest kickers in NFL history, had the worst on-field season of his career in 2024. The Ravens drafted another kicker, Tyler Loop, this year, signaling a potential move away from Tucker. The NFL is investigating the claims against Tucker, who has denied any inappropriate behavior.</p>
