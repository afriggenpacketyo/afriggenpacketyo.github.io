          <p>Vladimir Putin presided over Russia's Victory Day parade in Moscow, commemorating the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, with China's Xi Jinping in attendance. Putin used the event to tie the war to today's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and said all of Russia was behind what he called the "special military operation". The event, attended by over 20 international leaders, was marked by heightened security and a short ceasefire, rejected by Ukraine. Putin's speech emphasized Russia's role as a barrier against Nazism and Russophobia, while showcasing military hardware and international support. The attendance of Xi Jinping is viewed as a significant achievement for Putin, highlighting the strengthening ties between Russia and China.</p>

          <p>Chinese government data indicates a significant shift in trade flows due to escalating tensions between the United States and China. Exports from China jumped last month, driven by trade to other countries in Southeast Asia, even as President Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods forced a sharp slowdown in shipments to the United States. Chinese shipments to the United States plunged by 21 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, while exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by 21 percent. This redirection suggests a front-loading of the supply chain and a strategic shift by Chinese factories to leverage a pause in tariffs across the ASEAN region to fulfill orders destined for the United States.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a deal over tariffs on some goods traded between the countries, reducing or removing tariffs on specific goods. Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world remains in place and still applies to most UK goods entering the US. Car tariffs have been cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, and tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US have been scrapped. Negotiations on pharmaceuticals are ongoing, and there were no changes to the UK's digital services tax on US firms. This agreement, while not a full trade deal, represents a significant achievement for the UK, securing greater certainty for key sectors.</p>

          <p>George Brauchler, a Republican district attorney in Colorado, is taking a tough-on-crime approach, highlighted by a rare first-degree murder conviction in a DUI case. The case involved a driver who killed an Air Force test pilot while driving drunk; Brauchler charged him with first-degree murder based on "extreme indifference" to ensure a more severe punishment than vehicular homicide. Brauchler believes the criminal justice system has lost sight of its purpose and emphasizes the need to address day-to-day crimes like DUI vigilantly. He argues that society has shifted away from the idea of personal responsibility for criminal conduct, and his stance has been well-received in his community.</p>

In a speech, Putin linked past victories with current conflicts, emphasizing the defense of national interests and traditional values.

          <p>India and Pakistan are on the brink of war following a deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, leading to missile and drone attacks between the two nations. The conflict stems from a decades-old dispute over the Kashmir region, with both countries claiming the territory. After a week of intense clashes, air raid sirens blared in Indian cities near the Pakistani border, and Pakistani officials accused India of killing numerous people. The rivalry between the two countries dates back to the partition of India in 1947, with Kashmir remaining a contested region and a source of ongoing conflict.</p>

This signals a major shift from India's protectionist stance, driven by President Trump's tariffs on Indian exports. The U.S. is India's largest trading partner, and the deal aims to boost India's economic growth by attracting foreign investment and ensuring access to global markets.

He also highlighted concerns that the 10% tariff, initially presented as a baseline for negotiations, is now permanent. This criticism underscores the skepticism surrounding the trade agreement, with some economists suggesting it is a multi-billion dollar tax hike.</p>

          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, experienced a decline of nearly 7% following a first-quarter earnings report that fell short of expectations. The company's revenue and net income missed estimates, attributed to production fluctuations that lowered average selling prices. However, SMIC's wafer shipments increased significantly, driven by geopolitical changes and government policies. The company forecasts a sequential revenue decrease for the current quarter, despite positive signs in capacity utilization.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. tariffs on goods from China may be reduced as trade officials from both countries prepare to hold talks. This statement comes after the U.S. reached a tariff deal with the UK, signaling a potential de-escalation in the trade war. The upcoming meeting in Switzerland is seen as a positive step, but analysts caution that negotiations are likely to be lengthy. While China's exports to the U.S. have fallen, its overall exports have risen, indicating a complex economic landscape.</p>
