        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's Q1 2025 earnings report revealed a significant miss on both revenue and earnings per share, with automotive revenue plummeting 20% year-over-year to $14 billion, contributing to a 9% overall revenue decrease. Net income also suffered a steep decline, dropping 71% to $409 million. Tesla attributed the lower deliveries to temporary production suspensions at its factories to upgrade lines for the refreshed Model Y SUVs. The company's performance reflects challenges in the electric vehicle market and the impact of production adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case concerning whether a Maryland school board must allow parents to opt their children out of instruction involving storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation. A group of families argued that the school board's policy violates their First Amendment right to religious freedom, while the board contends that opt-outs became unworkable due to disruptions and high absence rates. The justices grappled with balancing religious freedom with the school's interest in promoting inclusivity and diversity. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for public education and parental rights. </p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesperson stated that Starmer no longer believes transgender women are women, aligning with a recent Supreme Court judgment defining 'woman' as a biological woman under equalities law. This marks a shift from Starmer's previous stance and has sparked debate within the Labour Party, with some MPs expressing concern for the trans community. The ruling clarifies that individuals born male but identifying as women do not automatically have the right to access women-only spaces, although proportionate exclusion is permitted. The controversy highlights ongoing tensions surrounding transgender rights and single-sex spaces.</p>

          <p>A Republican lawmaker is warning that the likely closure of Valero Energy Corp.'s Benicia refinery in California by April 2026 will significantly increase gas prices in the state. The closure, impacting over 400 jobs, is attributed to California's strict energy policies and regulatory environment, which are making it difficult for refineries to operate economically. With 20% of California's refining capacity potentially disappearing, the state's fuel supply is in jeopardy, leading to affordability, jobs, and reliability issues. The California Energy Commission acknowledges the closure and is working to mitigate the impact on consumers. </p>

They emphasize the automotive industry's significant contribution to the U.S. economy and its support of millions of American jobs.

          <p>A trend has emerged on social media where content creators read and analyze legal documents, attracting large audiences. This "lawyerly ASMR" involves dissecting celebrity lawsuits and other legal disputes, providing detailed explanations and commentary. The popularity of this material is attributed to the allure of stacks of papers, a desire for transparency, and the opportunity for viewers to form their own opinions. While some content focuses on high-profile cases, the trend also reveals underlying misogyny and resentment toward celebrities and elites.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to resume collecting defaulted college loan payments from millions of borrowers is raising concerns about a potential economic slowdown. Approximately 5 million borrowers will have their loans sent for collections starting May 5, with wage garnishments potentially reducing consumer spending. Experts warn that this could negatively impact the economy, especially amid existing concerns about rising inflation and slowing growth. While the policy may provide clarity for loan payments, it also poses a risk to borrowers' credit scores and overall financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

Factors contributing to the drop include high interest rates, tariffs, economic uncertainty, and the city's transfer tax, Measure ULA. The January wildfires also played a role in disrupting business activity.

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing a major overhaul of the State Department, involving the elimination of offices and positions, including the Office of Global Criminal Justice. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the restructure aims to eliminate offices "misaligned with America's core national interests" and address the department's "bloated" cost and size. The proposal does not impact US embassies and missions overseas, but some functions of cut offices will be moved to retained offices.
