          <p>Mark Carney led the Liberal Party to victory in the Canadian election, marking a decade in power for the Liberals, replacing Justin Trudeau. President Trump made a social media post suggesting Canadians should vote for him to make Canada the 51st state, which was met with criticism from Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre. Carney posted a video emphasizing Canada's sovereignty in response to Trump's remarks. The Liberals secured a victory, although it is still unclear whether they will form a minority or majority government, with final seat totals pending.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's attempt to overhaul the federal government as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) ultimately failed due to resistance from the Cabinet and legal challenges. Musk's ambitious plans to cut spending and centralize power were reined in after an initial period of influence. While some of DOGE's initiatives, such as agency reorganizations and workforce reductions, will continue, Musk's role as the de facto CEO of the federal workforce has ended. The agencies he dismantled will be difficult to rebuild, with lasting consequences for foreign aid and consumer protection.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is initiating efforts to make federal land available for housing development in an attempt to address the nation's affordable housing crisis. A task force has been created to identify and release federal land suitable for housing, particularly in Western states. While this initiative has bipartisan support, challenges remain, including the need for infrastructure development and concerns from environmental groups. The effort could potentially lead to the construction of millions of new homes, but the process may take years due to stringent procedures.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has expanded its cost-cutting efforts and reported first-quarter profit that exceeded expectations, even as sales decreased, primarily due to reduced revenue from its COVID-19 antiviral pill, Paxlovid. The company now anticipates additional savings of approximately $1.2 billion by the end of 2027, driven by enhanced digital enablement and streamlining business processes. These cuts also include expected research and development reorganization cost savings of around $500 million by the end of 2026, which will be reinvested into Pfizer's product pipeline. The cost-cutting measures aim to help the pharmaceutical giant recover from the decline of its COVID business.</p>

The partnerships aim to provide a seamless experience for patients, allowing them to access Wegovy directly from their telehealth providers and have the drug shipped to their homes. Patients can also access Novo Nordisk's online pharmacy, NovoCare, which offers Wegovy at a reduced price for those without insurance coverage.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams remains unfazed by a recent ruling against his plan to combat migrant crime, calling it 'all part of the process'. Adams, facing criticism from Democrats for cooperating with the Trump administration's immigration agenda, was sued by the New York City Council over an executive order allowing ICE agents access to Rikers Island Prison. The suit accuses Adams of prioritizing his political goals over the city’s sanctuary laws. A New York judge ruled to bar the city from implementing any agreement with the federal government for the time being.</p>

          <p>AI is influencing language, potentially leading to a new, standardized form of communication as AI-generated text becomes more prevalent. An experiment showed that exposure to AI-generated text can make people write more verbosely. The blending of human and AI writing may lead to subtle changes in linguistic patterns. Some linguists suggest that the rise of AI writing could spark a countermovement, with people leaning into their own linguistic mannerisms to differentiate themselves, valuing human writing even more.</p>

          <p>A coalition of labor unions, nonprofits, and local governments has filed a lawsuit arguing that President Trump's government overhaul, led by Elon Musk's DOGE, is unconstitutional. The plaintiffs claim that actions taken to downsize the federal workforce violate the Constitution because Congress has not authorized them. They argue that agencies are acting according to the direction given by President Trump through DOGE, OMB, and OPM, usurping Congress' authority. The lawsuit seeks to vacate Trump's executive order and accompanying memos, as well as agencies' reduction in force plans.</p>

The executive director of the Port of Los Angeles expects roughly a quarter of the usual number of arriving ships to be canceled in May.
