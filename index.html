            <h2>Friendship Marriages Gain Traction in Japan</h2>

            <p>In Japan, "friendship marriages," nonsexual partnerships primarily for practical and social benefits, are becoming increasingly common. These arrangements, distinct from visa-motivated marriages, cater to individuals seeking companionship and social security benefits without romantic or sexual involvement. A Tokyo-based agency has facilitated over 300 such unions in the past decade, often involving individuals with diverse sexual orientations who face societal pressures to marry. While some view these marriages as a pragmatic response to societal norms and the lack of same-sex marriage recognition, others see them as a reflection of evolving values and the increasing acceptance of diverse relationship structures. The trend reflects a shift towards prioritizing companionship and mutual support over traditional romantic ideals in marriage.</p>

            <p>Both Ukraine and Russia have traded accusations of violating a 30-hour Easter truce that was declared by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Russian troops had violated the ceasefire almost 3,000 times since the beginning of Sunday, while Russia's defense ministry accused Kyiv of launching hundreds of drones and shells. The BBC has not been able to independently verify either side's claims. Meanwhile, former US President Donald Trump expressed hope that Russia and Ukraine would reach a deal this week. Both sides have stated that they will mirror each other's actions, responding to silence with silence and strikes with strikes.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has decided to keep its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%. This decision appears to be driven by a focus on stabilizing the yuan amidst ongoing trade tensions with the United States. The PBOC's move comes after China reported stronger-than-expected economic data for the first quarter, including a GDP growth of 5.4% year-on-year, which provides the central bank with room to maintain its current monetary policy. The Chinese onshore yuan was trading flat following the announcement, while the offshore yuan marginally strengthened against the US dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Alessandro Paredes, a 19-year-old Venezuelan migrant, spoke from a detention center in Texas after the Supreme Court temporarily blocked his deportation. Paredes claims he and others were forced to sign documents stating they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang, a claim his mother denies. The White House maintains confidence in the legality of their actions, asserting the administration's right to remove terrorist illegal aliens. Paredes expresses fear of being deported to El Salvador, a country he has never known, highlighting concerns about due process and human rights. The ACLU argues that the migrants have not had adequate notice or time to challenge their removals.</p>

            <p>As the trade war between the United States and China intensifies, some analysts believe that the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could inadvertently make China's economy stronger in the long run. Rather than focusing solely on brute economic force, China may be compelled to address its internal economic weaknesses, such as the fragmentation of its domestic market. By resolving these issues, China could become more resilient and competitive on the global stage. The US has imposed export controls particularly on advanced technology, and China is digging in for a long fight. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Despite government promises of expanded "free hours" for childcare in England, parents are still facing significant challenges in finding nursery places. The rollout of the scheme, intended to provide 30 hours of free childcare per week for eligible working parents, has been hampered by a shortage of places, particularly in deprived areas. Experts are concerned that a gap is widening between those who are eligible for the funded hours and those who are missing out. Private nurseries are also struggling with rising costs, leading some to threaten to pull out of the scheme altogether.</p>

            <p>Men are less likely to seek medical treatment than women, often delaying visits until symptoms become severe, due to societal pressures, appointment systems, and communication preferences. Many men feel pressured to "tough it out" and fear appearing weak if they discuss health concerns. Healthcare services often rely on open communication, which doesn't align with how men typically discuss health. Experts suggest redesigning services to better meet men's needs, focusing on action-oriented solutions and providing targeted check-ups. Men's mental health charities and support groups are emerging to create spaces where men can openly discuss their health challenges.</p>

            <p>The WWF, in collaboration with Pakistan's Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), has developed AI-powered cameras to detect snow leopards and warn villagers via text message to move their livestock to safety. The cameras, deployed in Gilgit-Baltistan, aim to reduce retaliatory killings of snow leopards due to livestock losses. While the AI model has shown impressive accuracy, challenges remain in terms of community buy-in and ensuring reliable cellular service in remote mountain areas.</p>

            <p>Max Verstappen refused to discuss a penalty he received during the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, stating that "people can't handle the full truth." Oscar Piastri ultimately won the race, attributing his victory to a move around the outside of Lewis Hamilton and the penalty Verstappen received for cutting the chicane after the start. Verstappen led until the first pit stops, when he served the penalty and dropped behind Piastri. McLaren's team principal emphasized that Piastri was entitled to the corner, making Verstappen's off-track overtake a clear violation.</p>
