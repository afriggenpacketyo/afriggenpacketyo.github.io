          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 01:24:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brad Marchand's double-overtime goal secured a 5-4 victory for the Florida Panthers over the Edmonton Oilers in Game 2, leveling the Stanley Cup Final series. The game, marked by numerous penalties and high-pressure moments, saw both teams trading goals, including a late tying goal by Corey Perry for the Oilers to force overtime. Sergei Bobrovsky's stellar goaltending, with 42 saves, was crucial for the Panthers, while Marchand's two goals and contributions from Sam Bennett and others fueled their offense. The series now shifts to Sunrise for Game 3, with the Panthers regaining home-ice advantage. The game was characterized by intense play from star players like Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, who contributed assists for the Oilers. The final score was reflective of the high-stakes environment and the back-and-forth nature of the match. Optimism is moderate given the win, but the series is far from over.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is actively seeking to attract more tourists, particularly high-spending visitors, to revitalize its tourism industry, which has been negatively impacted by protests, pandemic restrictions, and a security crackdown. The city aims to broaden its appeal beyond budget travelers from mainland China by improving its image and offerings. The efforts are part of a broader strategy to boost Hong Kong's economy and re-establish its position as a major global destination. This initiative reflects the city's attempt to balance its relationship with mainland China while maintaining its unique identity and appeal to international visitors. The future success of this endeavor will depend on Hong Kong's ability to address its challenges and adapt to changing global tourism trends.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed that MI5 provided false information to the Investigatory Powers Commissioner's Office (IPCO), leading the watchdog to rewrite a report concerning the handling of a violent neo-Nazi agent. The early draft of the IPCO report contradicted false evidence given by MI5 in court, but the final version omitted this contradiction after MI5 denied departing from its core secrecy policy. MI5 Director General Sir Ken McCallum apologized to IPCO after the BBC challenged the Security Service's false statements. This revelation raises concerns about MI5's accountability and the effectiveness of IPCO's oversight, as the Security Service effectively gave false evidence to every organization or court responsible for holding it to account. The article highlights the importance of transparency and accurate information in maintaining public trust in intelligence agencies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Public health scientist Devi Sridhar argues that achieving a long and healthy life requires more than just individual efforts like diet and exercise, emphasizing the importance of public policy, infrastructure, and community. While personal optimization is often touted as the key to longevity, Sridhar points out that life expectancy is stagnating or declining in many high-income countries due to factors largely outside individual control, such as air quality and mental health conditions. She highlights that societies where people live longer normalize healthy lives through government and cultural support, such as affordable nutritious food and active cities. Sridhar advocates for collective responsibility and policies that prioritize the conditions for good health for all, suggesting that the true path to longevity lies in societal changes rather than individual self-help.</p>

          <p>Driven by a growing sentiment among European leaders, the European Union is increasingly pushing for strategic autonomy to reduce its reliance on the United States, China, and Russia.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron have voiced strong support for this mission of European independence.

          <p>Even if terminating federal contracts with Elon Musk's companies proves unfeasible due to the Pentagon and NASA's reliance on them, a future President Trump could still exert influence over the tech titan. According to news analysis, the president could tighten federal oversight of Musk's businesses. This would demonstrate the potential for political pressure and regulatory scrutiny, even in the absence of direct contract termination. The analysis suggests that the relationship between government and powerful tech companies can be complex and subject to political maneuvering.</p>

The BBC is now aware of five cases of babies being mistakenly swapped in maternity wards from the late 1940s to the 1960s.

          <p>Multiple immigration enforcement operations across Los Angeles led to dozens of arrests, triggering citywide protests and strong reactions from community leaders and elected officials. Federal agents executed search warrants in areas like Westlake District, downtown L.A., and South L.A., resulting in the detention of approximately 44 people. The arrest of Service Employees International Union California President David Huerta, who allegedly obstructed federal agents, further fueled the protests. Protesters clashed with law enforcement, leading to an "unlawful assembly" declaration and the use of non-lethal projectiles by police.

Graduates have complained that content they wrote has been incorrectly labeled as AI-generated, and even a famous Chinese essay was evaluated as being largely AI-generated.

He now faces charges of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawfully transporting undocumented people, with allegations of involvement in an alien smuggling ring. Maryland leaders, including Senator Chris Van Hollen and Congressman Glenn Ivey, have been vocal supporters of Abrego Garcia's right to due process and have called out the Trump administration for its handling of the case.</p>

          <p>Arrests for illegal work in the UK have surged, with over 6,400 people arrested in the past year, marking a 51% increase from the previous year. This rise is attributed to a focused effort by immigration enforcement officials to target "unscrupulous" employers who exploit undocumented migrants. Officers have conducted checks at over 9,000 businesses, including restaurants, nail bars, and construction sites, to address issues such as squalid conditions, illegal working hours, and below-minimum wages. The government aims to crack down on illegal migration through tighter work visas and increased enforcement, although the plans have faced mixed reactions from business sectors and political opponents.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow U.S. colleges to directly pay athletes, marking a significant shift in the landscape of college sports. The settlement, stemming from the House v. NCAA case, permits each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and provides $2.7 billion over the next decade to former players who were previously barred from revenue sharing. This move is expected to professionalize college athletics, impacting recruitment, program budgets, and the overall structure of the NCAA. While celebrated by some as a long-overdue recognition of athletes' contributions, concerns remain regarding roster limits, Olympic sports funding, and potential legal challenges.</p>

This decision marks a significant shift from the tradition of amateurism that has long governed college athletics. The new framework also introduces roster limits and a third-party clearinghouse to review licensing agreements, aiming to address concerns about fair market value and potential legal challenges.</p>

The aim is to counter opposition parties advocating for a consumption tax cut. Ishiba intends to boost rice production and lower prices through direct contracts with retailers, but challenges remain, including the risk of oversupply.
