          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a surge of over 3.5% amidst volatile trading following the announcement of a share buyback of up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion). The company's operating income for the recent financial quarter surpassed analyst estimates, although it showed an 11% decrease compared to the previous year. Sony also detailed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit, intending to distribute over 80% of the shares to shareholders through dividends. Despite these developments, Sony's outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was described as lackluster, presenting a mixed picture for investors.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, during his final remarks in Riyadh, reiterated his call for a nuclear deal with Iran and emphasized his strong relationship with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Trump criticized former President Joe Biden for allegedly turning his back on Gulf allies, assuring that his loyalties lie with them and vowing to confront aggression. He urged fellow leaders to enforce sanctions on Iranian oil and pushed for a new nuclear deal, insisting that Iran must cease sponsoring terror, halt proxy wars, and verifiably abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Trump's statements underscore his administration's continued focus on regional security and diplomatic efforts in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, in Riyadh, marking the first such encounter in 25 years and signaling a significant shift in relations. The meeting, encouraged by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, followed Trump's announcement of lifting US sanctions on Syria. Al-Sharaa, who became interim leader after leading rebels in a December uprising, was previously imprisoned for his role in the insurgency in Iraq.

          <p>Chancellor Friedrich Merz has established a new government department focused on streamlining the state apparatus, appointing Karsten Wildberger to lead it, drawing comparisons to Elon Musk's role in the US government. Wildberger's ministry will oversee the state's IT infrastructure, aiming to improve efficiency and digitalization, with Wildberger advocating for reduced business regulations. However, unlike Musk, Wildberger faces constraints from the EU's data privacy regulations and Germany's federal system, requiring him to build alliances with state governments. Some experts caution that appointing business executives to government positions can lead to policies that benefit their own sectors, highlighting the need for Wildberger to balance business interests with public service.</p>

Tencent's WeChat, with over 1.4 billion monthly active users, has also seen growth in marketing services revenue, up 20% due to robust advertiser demand.

          <p>The UK political landscape has seen significant shifts, with the Labour Party's lead diminishing since their landslide victory last summer. The Reform Party held the lead in voting intentions for the entirety of February, marking a historic challenge to the major parties. Recent polls indicate a blurring of traditional demographic lines, with support for Reform growing across all age groups, particularly among the young. Prime Minister Starmer's approval ratings have declined, and the first-past-the-post system poses challenges for predicting seat outcomes, with analysts employing MRP techniques to forecast constituency-level results.

          <p>A new study indicates that weight-loss medications, specifically GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), and bariatric surgery can effectively reduce the risk of obesity-related cancers (ORC). Researchers found that GLP-1 RAs have a direct effect on reducing ORC risk beyond just weight loss, estimating a 41% relative risk reduction compared to bariatric surgery. Experts suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of GLP-1 RAs and their ability to improve metabolic health may contribute to this decreased cancer risk. While promising, further research is needed to confirm these effects and understand the underlying mechanisms, with a focus on long-term safety and potential side effects.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami's recent struggles, including a heavy defeat to Minnesota United, are drawing comparisons to Lionel Messi's time with Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). Like PSG, Inter Miami is struggling to balance its star-studded forward line with the rest of the team, leading to defensive vulnerabilities and inconsistent performances. Despite having Messi, Luis SuÃ¡rez, Jordi Alba, and Sergio Busquets, Inter Miami has failed to win major trophies, echoing PSG's inability to capture the Champions League. The article notes that Inter Miami's problems extend beyond tactics, with lapses in concentration and defensive errors contributing to their recent slump. The team may need to make significant moves in the summer transfer window to address these issues and compete for major titles.</p>

          <p>NPR reports on multiple Trump administration officials with ties to antisemitic extremists, including a man described as a "Nazi sympathizer" and a Holocaust denier. Despite President Trump's pledge to fight antisemitism, critics question whether it has found a place within his administration. Paul Ingrassia, the White House liaison to the Department of Homeland Security, has ties to figures known for promoting antisemitism, including Andrew Tate and Nick Fuentes. Rachel Cauley, the communications director for the White House Office of Management and Budget, served on the board of the Patriot Freedom Project, which has connections to white nationalist websites. The report raises concerns about the administration's selective focus on antisemitism while ignoring issues within its own ranks.</p>

          <p>New academic standards in Oklahoma require students to identify "discrepancies" in the 2020 election results, perpetuating a false narrative promoted by President Trump. The standards, championed by State Superintendent Ryan Walters, reference baseless claims about ballot counting and mail voting security. Critics argue that the standards instruct students to accept these "discrepancies" as fact, rather than promoting critical thinking. Concerns have also been raised about the rushed approval process and the influence of conservative figures in overhauling the standards, dismissing months of work by educators. A lawsuit has been filed challenging the standards' implementation, citing issues in the approval process.</p>

          <p>Burberry announced organizational changes, including potential job cuts impacting around 1,700 roles globally by 2027, as part of its ongoing turnaround strategy. The cost-cutting measures, estimated to save Â£60 million, follow Â£40 million in savings announced in November, totaling Â£100 million. Sales fell less than expected in the fiscal fourth quarter, down 6%, with sales falling across all regions, led by weakness in Asia-Pacific. Despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, CEO Joshua Schulman expressed optimism about Burberry's future, although analysts questioned the pace of the turnaround and the ability to innovate within the brand's classic pieces.</p>

The Co-op is gradually bringing its systems back online in a safe and controlled manner, working with suppliers to restock stores and online services.

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, setting the stage for their potential release after more than three decades for killing their parents. Judge Michael V. Jesic of Los Angeles Superior Court made the decision after hearing testimony from family members, who testified that the brothers had turned their lives around through education and self-help groups. While the judge acknowledged the horrific nature of the crime, he was swayed by the support from corrections officials and stated that the brothers had done enough to earn a chance at parole. The brothers will now be eligible for parole, and their future will be in the hands of Gov. Gavin Newsom and state parole-board officials.</p>
