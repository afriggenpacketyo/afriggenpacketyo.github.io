          <p>This opinion piece argues that the world is facing a renewed and severe risk of nuclear conflict, exacerbated by Russia's withdrawal from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty and the impending lapse of the New Start treaty. The author highlights an accelerating arms race, with both the U.S. and Russia engaging in provocative rhetoric and deploying new nuclear-capable weapons in Europe. The article contrasts the current public silence with the passionate anti-nuclear protests of the 1980s, urging a renewed sense of urgency to prevent a global catastrophe.</p>

          <p>A BBC reporter provides a first-person account of going undercover to expose a violent migrant-smuggling operation in northern France. Assuming the identity of a Syrian refugee, he navigated the dangerous world of the smugglers, using a hidden camera to document his interactions with a senior gang member in a secret forest camp. The article details the constant risks, the psychological toll of maintaining a cover story, and the meticulous planning required to gather evidence, which ultimately led to an arrest in the UK.</p>

          <p>An analysis reveals that female refugees in Germany face significant barriers to employment, with two-thirds remaining jobless after eight years, a stark contrast to their male counterparts. The article identifies a "threefold disadvantage" for these women, stemming from their gender, immigrant status, and refugee experience, compounded by systemic issues like childcare shortages and difficulties with foreign qualification recognition. Through personal stories and expert insights, the piece highlights the complex challenges and the efforts of nonprofit organizations to provide support and create pathways to work.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of a meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska to negotiate an end to the war, key European allies have issued a joint statement insisting that Ukraine must be included in any peace discussions. Leaders from the UK, France, Germany, and others emphasized that Ukraine's borders cannot be changed by force and that its destiny must not be decided without its participation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky echoed this sentiment, calling any agreement made without Kyiv's involvement a "dead decision" and rejecting any potential "swapping of territories."</p>
