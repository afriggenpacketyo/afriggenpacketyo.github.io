          <p>Over 1,000 demonstrators gathered at the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, which is being used to house asylum seekers, leading to clashes with police. Protesters threw bottles and smoke flares, chanting for the removal of the asylum seekers, with one arrest made during the unrest. The protest follows the recent arrest of an asylum seeker on suspicion of alleged sexual assaults in the town, which has heightened local tensions. Essex Police implemented a special order requiring the removal of face coverings to manage the disorder, which had previously resulted in injuries to eight officers.</p>

          <p>Richard Tillman, the 44-year-old brother of the late NFL player and Army Ranger Pat Tillman, was arrested on suspicion of arson in San Jose, California. The arrest occurred after a car was driven into the Almaden Valley Station Post Office, causing the building to catch fire. Federal postal inspectors are investigating the incident, including spray-painted words found on the building and claims that the driver live-streamed the crash. Pat Tillman famously left his NFL career after the 9/11 attacks and was killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan in 2004.</p>

          <p>A growing number of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are reporting significant improvements in their symptoms after using GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. These drugs, primarily used for diabetes and weight loss, appear to help by improving insulin sensitivity, which in turn can lower testosterone levels and regulate menstrual cycles. While anecdotal evidence and small studies are promising, researchers emphasize the need for larger clinical trials to confirm these benefits and understand the long-term effects. However, high costs and limited insurance coverage remain significant barriers for many patients seeking this potential treatment.</p>

Health officials attribute the spread to declining vaccination rates, particularly within some Low German-speaking Mennonite communities, and a rise in vaccine hesitancy following the COVID-19 pandemic.

While the president's base remains strongly supportive, overall approval has dropped, particularly among Hispanic Americans.

Furthermore, the UK's complex and lengthy planning system, combined with the political need to compromise with affected communities, led to expensive changes like extensive tunneling.

          <p>Tom Troupe, a veteran actor with a career spanning decades on both stage and screen, has died at the age of 97. Troupe made his Broadway debut in "The Diary of Anne Frank" in 1957 before moving to Los Angeles, where he appeared in over 75 television series, including "Star Trek" and "Mission: Impossible." A Korean War veteran awarded a Bronze Star, he maintained a strong presence in theater, often co-starring with his late wife, actress Carole Cook. In 2002, the couple received a Los Angeles Ovation Award for their career achievements in theater.</p>

          <h2>EPA to Close its Office of Research and Development</h2>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is shutting down its primary scientific research arm, the Office of Research and Development (ORD), as part of a broader downsizing effort by the Trump administration. The ORD is responsible for analyzing environmental hazards and providing the scientific foundation for regulations on toxins, pollution, and climate change. The administration claims the move, which is part of a 23% staff cut at the agency, will save money and better equip the EPA for its core mission. Critics, however, have condemned the decision as a "travesty" that will cripple the agency's ability to use science to protect public health.</p>

          <p>Coldplay frontman Chris Martin has started giving a friendly warning to concertgoers before the band's "Jumbotron Song," advising them they might appear on the large video screens. This new practice follows a recent viral incident where a man and woman, later identified as a CEO and HR executive from the same company, were caught in an awkward embrace on camera. The fallout from the clip led to the CEO's resignation and a formal investigation by his company. Martin's lighthearted warning to "do your makeup now" seems to be a direct response to the unintended consequences of the viral moment.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Advocates for Teaching Children 'Self-Connection' as a Core Life Skill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 18:05:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a child development expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection. This is defined as the ability to understand and trust one's own emotions, needs, and inner voice, which fosters resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. The article suggests that common parenting phrases like "you're fine" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings. Instead, parents are encouraged to validate emotions, welcome all aspects of their child's personality, and model their own emotional awareness to build this crucial foundation for mental health.</p>

          <p>Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, describes the difficult position American companies face operating in China amidst ongoing trade tensions. In an interview, he notes that while a recent pause on tariff escalations is likely to be extended, the core discussions between the two governments have been almost exclusively about tariffs, ignoring other critical business issues. He expresses concern that this narrow focus creates an unpredictable environment for the over 270 American companies his council represents. Stein suggests that a path to a more normal trade relationship exists but requires reciprocal actions that have not yet materialized. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller has founded a nonprofit, Better Angels, with the ambitious goal of solving the affordable housing crisis by making it profitable without taxpayer subsidies. Using a $300 million investment fund, the initiative provides upfront capital to developers, aiming to build housing faster and at a fraction of the cost of typical government-funded projects. While the rents will be higher than in subsidized units, they will remain below market rate, targeting a "workforce housing" demographic. The model seeks to prove that capitalism can be harnessed to create a scalable solution to the housing shortage.</p>

          <p>The planned plea deals for the defendants in the 9/11 terror attacks case, including alleged ringleader Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, have been officially canceled. This development throws the perpetually delayed legal proceedings at Guantanamo Bay into further uncertainty, as the deals were seen by many as the most viable path to a resolution. Without the agreements, which would have removed the death penalty in exchange for guilty pleas, the case returns to a cycle of pretrial hearings that has already lasted for years. This raises the possibility that the defendants may never face a final conviction, frustrating family members seeking closure.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died in New York after being fatally injured by a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine. The man, who was reportedly wearing a heavy, 20-pound metallic chain used for weight training, was pulled into the machine's powerful magnetic field. According to his wife, she had asked him to enter the room to help her after her scan was complete, at which point the accident occurred. The incident is a tragic reminder of the strict safety protocols surrounding MRI technology, which requires all metallic objects to be removed due to the immense force of the magnets.</p>

          <p>England defender Lucy Bronze has spoken out about the increasing amount of abuse directed at players as women's football grows in popularity. Her comments follow an incident where her teammate, Jess Carter, revealed she had received racist messages online during the Euro 2025 tournament. Bronze noted that while men's football sees more abuse in stadiums, women's football appears to be a specific target for online harassment. The Lionesses team has decided to stop taking a knee before matches, seeking a new way to address racism, and Bronze called for more accountability from social media platforms.</p>
