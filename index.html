          <p>Approximately 3,200 Boeing workers across Missouri and Illinois have gone on strike after rejecting a proposed four-year labor agreement. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union stated the walkout is a stand for respect, dignity, and a contract that adequately reflects their critical role in national defense. Members voted down the offer despite it including significant wage growth, as key issues regarding pensions and work schedules remained unresolved. Boeing has activated a contingency plan to continue operations with non-striking employees while expressing disappointment in the rejection of its offer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the Democratic party made a significant strategic error by not encouraging President Biden to step aside sooner, potentially paving the way for a stronger candidate to defeat Donald Trump. The author contends that it was evident to most Americans that Biden's age was a major liability, a fact the party establishment and insider journalists were slow to acknowledge. The piece suggests a combination of fear of losing access, party tribalism, and deference to the presidency led to a collective failure to address the issue. It calls for the party to listen to voters and embrace a new generation of leaders.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's 2025 pre-season tour shows signs of change under new manager Ruben Amorim, who has introduced a more relaxed yet responsible team environment and new tactical approaches. Amorim emphasizes treating players like adults and focuses on intense gym work and strategic walkthroughs over traditional double training sessions. While early signs, such as player fitness levels and on-field tactical shifts, appear positive, the article questions if this progress is genuine or another false dawn. Ultimately, the team's performance in the upcoming Premier League season, starting with a match against Arsenal, will determine the success of these new methods.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic state legislators has left Texas to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to vote on a new congressional map during a special session. The Democrats argue the proposed map is a partisan gerrymander designed by Governor Greg Abbott in submission to Donald Trump, aimed at unfairly increasing the GOP's U.S. House majority. Governor Abbott has threatened to have the absent lawmakers removed from their membership in the House if they do not return. This is not the first time Texas Democrats have used this tactic to protest redistricting efforts, highlighting the intense political battle over voting maps.</p>

          <p>At least 68 migrants, mostly believed to be from Ethiopia, have died after their boat sank in bad weather off the coast of Yemen's Abyan province. The vessel was reportedly carrying around 157 people, with dozens still missing and only twelve rescued so far. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) highlighted this as another tragedy along one of the world's most perilous migration routes, where smugglers often exploit desperate individuals. The IOM is advocating for enhanced legal migration pathways to prevent such disasters, as thousands continue to risk the dangerous journey to Gulf states despite Yemen's ongoing civil war.</p>

          <p>A multi-agency manhunt is in its fourth day for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana. Authorities consider Brown armed and dangerous and have offered a reward for information leading to his arrest. The victims, all local residents, were known by the suspect, who lived next door to the bar. The small, tight-knit community has been shaken by the violence, as law enforcement scours the rugged terrain where Brown is believed to be hiding.</p>

The intense competition, marked by significant discounts, has attracted scrutiny from Beijing policymakers concerned about excessive rivalry.

This analysis suggests that new players like Rayan Cherki, Tijjani Reijnders, and Rayan Ait-Nouri, who excel at carrying the ball and direct attacks, point to a move away from rigid positional play. The shift appears to be an adaptation to a Premier League trend favoring more dynamic, transition-based football.

This creates a state of "permacrisis" where public rage and government impotence escalate in a cycle of disaffection without leading to real change. The true risk is not a collapse of the center, but a miserable status quo where it holds power ineffectively.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Biotech Firms Innovent and BeOne on Track for Profitability in 2025</h2>

          <p>Chinese biotech firms Innovent and BeOne are projected to achieve their first full-year profits in 2025, a significant milestone for a sector once reliant on investor funding. According to analyst estimates, this shift towards profitability demonstrates the maturation of China's biotech industry and its ability to create value for patients and government payers. Innovent's success is partly driven by strong sales expectations for its newly launched weight-loss drug, mazdutide. This development marks a turning point for companies that went public under a Hong Kong rule allowing pre-revenue firms to list. (not investment advice)</p>
