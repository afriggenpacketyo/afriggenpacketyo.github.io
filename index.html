            <p>A bin strike in Birmingham is set to continue after bin workers "overwhelmingly" rejected the latest offer by the city council. The strike by Unite union members has resulted in piles of uncollected rubbish accumulating on the streets of Birmingham for over a month. Unite's general secretary, Sharon Graham, stated that the council's offer was "totally inadequate" and did not address the potential pay cuts for 200 drivers.

            <p>Travelers planning to visit Sardinia, Italy, are now required to reserve beach spots through an app or website as part of a new initiative to curb overtourism. Popular beaches like Cala Brandinchi and Lu Impostu will limit visitors, requiring reservations through the San Teodoro app or website from June 1 to September 30. The local Teulada council plans to implement a similar digital reservation system, following other strict tourism rules implemented around the island. This change aims to manage the influx of tourists and protect the island's natural resources.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's tariff policies have created confusion after a cabinet official floated a plan for new levies on semiconductors just days after the Trump administration exempted computers and smartphones from tariffs. Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, told NBC the tariff exemption on several electronic devices was temporary, and that new duties would come in “a month or two”. Semiconductors would be targeted, he said. The president said he would lay out the new tariffs on Monday and that any relief for the electronics industry would be short-lived.</p>

            <p>Experts recommend using generative AI like ChatGPT to enhance LinkedIn profiles, but caution against relying on it completely. It is crucial to provide the AI tool with writing samples to capture your personality and ensure the generated content sounds authentic. AI can help with keyword optimization and grammar edits, but users must double-check its suggestions. The generated content must "sound very passionate or very authentic", as the AI tools can miss the mark if not prompted correctly.</p>

            <p>The UK government has taken control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe to prevent its closure, initiating a race to secure raw materials and maintain operations. The Scunthorpe plant is the last in the UK producing virgin steel, essential for major construction projects. Jingye, the Chinese steel-making firm that owns British Steel, retains ownership for now, but the government is considering nationalization. The plant is losing money due to challenging market conditions and high costs, but the government views its continued operation as crucial for the UK's economic security.</p>

            <p>A Stanford accounting professor emphasizes that filing for a tax extension only avoids penalties for late filing, not late payment. The IRS grants extensions until October 15, but expects payment by the original April 15 deadline, with penalties accruing for unpaid taxes. Calculating owed taxes is necessary even with an extension. It's recommended to use the extension period to gather documents and potentially hire a tax professional, but to avoid procrastination and create a plan for timely completion.</p>
