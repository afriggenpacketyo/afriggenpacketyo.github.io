          <p>The FBI has identified 25-year-old Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing. Bartkus, a resident of Twentynine Palms, is believed to have died in the explosion, which injured four others. Law enforcement sources indicate that Bartkus expressed opposition to bringing people into the world against their will and may have attempted to livestream the attack, which authorities are treating as an intentional act of terrorism. All embryos stored at the fertility clinic were saved, and the clinic is expected to reopen soon.</p>

          <p>A new factory in Arizona, built by Taiwanese company TSMC, is poised to produce the world's most advanced semiconductors in the US for the first time. President Trump has touted this as a win for his economic policies, attributing it to his threats of tariffs on Taiwan. However, the factory's reliance on global technologies and materials highlights the inherent contradiction in Trump's 'America First' approach, as the production of these advanced chips requires international collaboration and supply chains. The facility is seen as critical for US technological and economic supremacy over China, even as it depends on global partnerships.</p>
