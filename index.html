          <p>Kerri Pegg, a 42-year-old former prison governor, received a nine-year sentence for engaging in a relationship with Anthony Saunderson, a drug-dealing gang leader while serving as governor at HMP Kirkham. Pegg, once considered a rising star in the Prison Service, abused her position by assisting Saunderson in obtaining day release. Judge Graham Knowles KC emphasized Pegg's betrayal of public trust and the Prison Service during the sentencing. The case highlights the severe consequences for prison officials who violate ethical standards and abuse their authority.</p>

          <p>Nvidia refuted claims that it is sending graphics processing unit (GPU) designs to China to circumvent U.S. export controls. This denial follows a report suggesting Nvidia was developing a research and development center in Shanghai to cater to the local market while adhering to U.S. restrictions. According to Nvidia, no GPU designs will be modified or sent to China for compliance purposes, clarifying that production and design will remain outside of China. CEO Jensen Huang reportedly discussed the potential center with Shanghai's mayor, Gong Zheng, during a recent visit.</p>

          <p>A University of Michigan survey revealed that U.S. consumer sentiment has fallen to its second-lowest level on record, driven by rising inflation expectations and concerns over tariffs. The index of consumer sentiment dropped to 50.8 in May, reflecting increasing worries about the impact of tariffs on prices. While a recent pause on tariffs between the U.S. and China may alleviate some concerns, nearly three-quarters of consumers spontaneously mentioned tariffs as a key factor influencing their economic outlook. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring inflation expectations before considering further interest rate cuts.</p>

          <p>Potential Democratic presidential contenders for 2028 are facing questions about former President Joe Biden's mental acuity during his final years in office and whether he should have sought re-election. A new book alleges a White House cover-up of Biden's cognitive decline, adding fuel to the debate. Some Democratic figures, such as Rep. Ro Khanna and Sen. Chris Murphy, have expressed regret over Biden's decision to run again, while others like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer have avoided direct criticism. The potential candidates' responses are being closely watched as an early test of their honesty and judgment.</p>

          <p>U.S. consumer sentiment edged down in May for the fifth consecutive month, with the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index falling to its lowest level since July 2022.

However, some economists believe the survey may be unduly negative, as it may not have captured any improvement in sentiment from the U.S. and China agreeing to ease tariffs earlier in the week.</p>

          <p>Patrick Lutts Jr., an American man who fled to Canada over two decades ago after a fatal crash, was arrested in Toronto. Lutts, facing manslaughter charges in Orlando, Florida, had been living in Toronto without legal status for 21 years. The arrest followed an anonymous tip to Crime Stoppers in Florida, leading authorities to suspect Lutts was in Canada. The 1998 crash in Orlando resulted in the deaths of two teenagers, and investigators alleged that Lutts was intoxicated at the time of the incident.</p>

          <p>Mike Novogratz described the arduous and frustrating journey to list his crypto firm, Galaxy Digital, on the Nasdaq, costing nearly four years and over $25 million. He said the process was "unfair, infuriating" and took nine rounds of comments with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Novogratz noted that Galaxy's auditing costs were significantly higher than those of traditional firms due to regulatory scrutiny. Despite the challenges, Novogratz believes the ordeal hardened the company, which funded itself mostly through investment gains and trading.</p>

The bill, currently under consideration, would permit terminally ill adults expected to die within six months to seek help to end their lives. The approved changes ensure that no one would be forced to assist in the process against their wishes, extending protections to social care workers and pharmacists.

Investigators compared the footprints to multiple people, including Arthur Gray, who was cleared due to a solid alibi. In 2015, DNA testing revealed an unknown profile, which through investigative genetic genealogy, led to Jerry Westrom. Westrom was arrested in 2019 and denied knowing Childs, but his DNA and footprints linked him to the crime scene, leading to his conviction.</p>
