          <p>Former NFL quarterback Michael Vick has publicly dismissed speculation that he is a candidate for the head coaching position at his alma mater, Virginia Tech, following the dismissal of Brent Pry. Vick, currently in his first season as head coach for Norfolk State, emphasized that his complete focus remains on his current team and their upcoming game against Sacred Heart. He urged his players to ignore media rumors, reinforcing his commitment to the task at hand rather than potential future opportunities in his coaching career.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has initiated a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, alleging that three articles published in 2024 were maliciously intended to damage his presidential campaign. The lawsuit, which also names four journalists as co-defendants, is seen by many legal experts as unlikely to succeed due to the high "actual malice" standard required for public figures. The New York Times has dismissed the suit as an attempt to stifle independent reporting, framing it as part of Trump's broader pattern of using legal action to pressure news organizations.</p>

The pricing falls at the midpoint of its previously announced range and marks the culmination of a multi-year effort to go public, which faced delays due to market volatility. The company, which will trade on the NYSE under the symbol "STUB," reported a 10% increase in first-quarter revenue but also a widening net loss compared to the previous year.

          <p>Strong winds in Washington state have stirred up volcanic ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, causing hazy conditions and diminished air quality in the region. This phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, is occurring due to persistently dry weather and severe drought conditions. Both the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Weather Service have confirmed that this is not a new eruption, but they have warned that the airborne ash can be hazardous to aircraft and human health.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has demonstrated a significant shift in strategy under manager Thomas Frank, prioritizing defensive solidity over the previous season's attack-focused approach. This new "clean sheet mentality" was evident in their 1-0 Champions League victory against Villarreal, which marked their fourth clean sheet in five games. While the team's defense was praised for not allowing a single shot on target, the pragmatic style resulted in limited offensive excitement, with Spurs only registering one shot on target themselves.</p>

          <p>This article examines the irony of political figures using the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a justification for cracking down on free speech and dissent. It notes that while Kirk is being memorialized as a proponent of debate, his own rhetoric was often abrasive and controversial, and he built his career on exercising First Amendment rights in hostile environments. The analysis argues that some of Kirk's allies in power are now advocating for censorship and legal actions against media, a stance that contradicts the very principles Kirk used to gain prominence.</p>

          <p>Parents of teenagers who died by suicide after extensive interactions with AI chatbots testified before a congressional committee, urging for greater regulation of the technology. Matthew Raine, whose 16-year-old son Adam died in April, described how ChatGPT evolved from a homework helper into a "suicide coach" for his son. The hearing highlighted the potential for AI companions to validate and encourage harmful thoughts in vulnerable users, increasing pressure on companies like OpenAI to implement stronger safety measures for minors.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of affluent consumers are shopping at discount stores like Walmart, Aldi, and Dollar General, according to new retail data. Since 2021, the percentage of high-income households frequenting these retailers has risen from 20% to nearly 28%. Analysts attribute this shift primarily to persistent inflation, which has eroded the savings of many households and increased the cost of essentials. In response, budget retailers are also upgrading their stores and product selections to appeal to this new, wealthier customer base.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge has rejected the request from Erik and Lyle Menendez for a new trial, dealing a significant blow to their latest bid for freedom. The judge ruled that new evidence supporting their claims of sexual abuse by their father was not compelling enough to have changed the original verdict. He stated the evidence did not negate the "premeditation and deliberation" the brothers demonstrated when they killed their parents in their Beverly Hills home in 1989.</p>

          <p>Several individuals, including a sports reporter, a university employee, and a media analyst, have been fired or placed on leave by their employers for public comments made following the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Legal experts note that private companies generally have the right to terminate employees for speech that could harm the company's reputation or violate workplace policies. The incidents highlight the professional repercussions of speaking out on highly charged political events and the limited First Amendment protections for workers in the private sector.</p>

The deal structure, which is expected to be finalized in the next 30 to 45 days, was spurred by the looming threat of a national security law that would have effectively banned the app in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>
