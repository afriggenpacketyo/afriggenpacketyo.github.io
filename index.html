          <p>As the Powerball jackpot approaches a historic $1.8 billion, DraftKings is experiencing a major surge in business through its lottery courier app, Jackpocket. The company reported that 15 million tickets have been ordered on the platform during this lottery run, with sales increasing 130% in a single day this week. This acquisition is a key part of DraftKings' strategy to cross-sell its sports betting and iGaming products to a wider audience. The company forecasts that Jackpocket will contribute substantially to its revenue and earnings by fiscal 2026, despite some states banning lottery courier services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 13:38:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly to 6.29%, marking the largest one-day drop since August 2024 and the lowest rate since October of the previous year. This sharp decline followed the release of a weaker-than-anticipated August employment report, causing a reaction in the bond market. For prospective homebuyers, this rate drop could translate into considerable monthly savings, potentially reigniting interest in a housing market hampered by affordability issues. However, analysts remain uncertain if this decrease is substantial enough to significantly boost mortgage demand, which has recently been sluggish. (not investment advice)</p>

Kennedy Jr.'s recent Senate testimony where he stated he did not know the exact number of American COVID-19 deaths. The author contends that no one truly knows the precise figure due to inconsistent reporting methods during the pandemic, such as classifying deaths 'with' COVID versus 'from' COVID. The piece criticizes the CDC and WHO for what it calls unreliable data and politically motivated guidance on public health measures. It frames Kennedy's role as an effort to restore public trust by challenging the established medical and pharmaceutical industries.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested two 17-year-olds for the murder of Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, a 21-year-old congressional intern who was killed by stray bullets in Washington D.C. on June 30. A third juvenile suspect remains at large. The two apprehended suspects, Jalen Lucas and Kelvin Thomas Jr., will be prosecuted as adults on first-degree murder charges. During the announcement, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro stated that Tarpinian-Jachym was an innocent bystander and criticized the D.C.

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Newsmax's antitrust lawsuit against Fox News, citing it as an impermissible "shotgun pleading" just two days after it was filed. Judge Aileen Cannon ruled that the complaint improperly incorporated all preceding allegations into each new count, making it technically flawed. However, the dismissal is not final, as Newsmax has been granted permission to refile an amended version of the lawsuit by the following Thursday. The original suit accused Fox News of monopolistic behavior and using intimidation tactics to suppress conservative media competitors, claims Fox News has denied.</p>

          <p>Recent developments, including a press conference by Jeffrey Epstein's victims, have intensified scrutiny of the Trump administration's handling of the case. One possible scenario is that continued pressure and the potential release of more documents could create a significant political crisis for the president. Alternatively, the story could persist as a background issue without causing lasting damage, though it might still serve as a distraction during midterm elections. A third possibility is that the controversy fades over time, similar to other scandals President Trump has weathered, without new, damaging revelations to sustain public interest.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced the seizure of more than 40,000 pounds of cocaine over the past month as part of its enhanced counter-drug mission, Operation Pacific Viper.

The author argues that this approach diminishes the seriousness of Trump's other actions, such as deploying the National Guard or challenging federal institutions, by framing them as mere stunts. According to the piece, this tactic may be ineffective and could prevent Democrats from focusing on more potent lines of attack regarding Trump's policies and their consequences. It suggests the constant 'distraction' claim reveals a lack of imagination in the opposition's messaging.</p>

Because the windfall places the winner in the highest federal income tax bracket of 37%, a substantial additional tax bill is expected.

In contrast, states with high income tax rates, such as New York, would see the lowest after-tax payout.

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed significant cooling as employers added just 22,000 jobs in August, far below the 80,000 forecast by economists. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.3%, while previous data for June was revised to show a loss of 13,000 jobs, the first monthly decline since late 2020. This slowdown suggests that economic uncertainty, driven by the Trump administration's tariff policies, is causing businesses to scale back hiring plans. The weak report increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its upcoming meeting to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Determining an Adequate Monthly Retirement Income for 2025 Depends on Individual Factors</h2>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that a 'good' monthly retirement income is typically 75% to 85% of one's pre-retirement earnings, but this varies greatly based on location, lifestyle, and health. While the average U.S. retiree spends about $5,000 per month, the median retirement income is closer to $3,900, indicating many rely on more than just savings. To bridge this gap, planners recommend creating multiple income streams through strategies like purchasing annuities for guaranteed payments or using a reverse mortgage to access home equity. Delaying Social Security claims until age 70 can also significantly boost monthly benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. father is under investigation for child endangerment in Brazil after taking his 13-year-old son into a forest for a "tech detox" without informing anyone. The pair were reported missing after the boy missed several days of school, prompting a six-day search that ended when they were found camping in a secluded area. The father reportedly told authorities he wanted to spend time with his son away from technology and was attempting to simulate conditions from the reality show "Naked and Afraid." If charged and convicted by Brazilian authorities, the father could face up to three years in prison.</p>

To receive the full award, Tesla's market value would need to reach $8.5 trillion. This proposal follows a Delaware judge's decision to revoke Musk's previous $56 billion pay package from 2018 after a legal challenge from investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large-scale immigration enforcement operation at a Hyundai manufacturing site in Georgia resulted in the detention of 475 individuals suspected of working in the U.S. illegally. The raid was part of a multi-month criminal investigation into unlawful employment practices and involved multiple federal agencies, including ICE and the FBI. Officials stated that most of those detained were Korean nationals who had either entered the country illegally or violated the terms of their visas.

Experts suggest that portfolios are likely over-concentrated in mega-cap technology stocks, which now constitute nearly 40% of the S&P 500 index.

This reduction includes 34 staff members who were notified of their termination on Thursday.

A report from NAIOP found that net absorption of industrial space dropped by 11.3 million square feet in the second quarter. This downturn is attributed to economic uncertainty stemming from shifting tariff policies and high inflation, which has caused businesses to pause expansion plans. While the sector saw massive growth during the pandemic-fueled e-commerce boom, projections for the remainder of the year suggest that demand will remain nearly flat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped to 6.50%, its lowest point since October 2024, continuing a steady decline seen throughout 2025. This downward trend is largely driven by market anticipation of an imminent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected at its next meeting on September 17. The cooling of the 10-year Treasury yield has also contributed to the falling rates. For prospective homebuyers, this presents an opportunity, but experts advise them to act strategically by getting pre-approved and securing a real estate agent, as lower rates often lead to increased market competition.
