          <p>Two Japanese boxers, Shigetoshi Kotari and Hiromasa Urakawa, have tragically died from brain injuries sustained in separate fights during the same boxing event at Tokyo's Korakuen Hall. Both men, aged 28, collapsed after their bouts and underwent emergency brain surgery for subdural hematomas but ultimately succumbed to their injuries. In the wake of these devastating events, the Japanese Boxing Commission announced that all Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation title fights will be shortened from 12 to 10 rounds. The commission has also initiated a formal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the two deaths, which have cast a dark shadow over the sport.</p>

This article highlights three such companies: energy giant Chevron (CVX), asset manager Rithm Capital (RITM), and telecommunications leader AT&T (T). Analysts from firms like Morgan Stanley and RBC Capital provide their reasoning, pointing to factors like strong quarterly performance, strategic acquisitions, and robust free cash flow. These stocks are presented as potential options for investors looking to bolster their portfolios with consistent dividend payments during a volatile period. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the socialist platform of New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani should be a major concern for Republicans nationwide, not just Democrats. The author contends that Mamdani's proposals, such as the abolition of private property, represent a dangerous trend that could reshape the Democratic Party and threaten American capitalism. The piece urges Republicans to clearly articulate the perceived dangers of socialism to voters, especially younger Americans who show increasing favorability towards it. The author frames the upcoming election as a critical moment for the future of the country's economic system.</p>

          <p>Technology and private prison companies, including Palantir, Geo Group, and CoreCivic, are experiencing significant financial growth due to their involvement in the Trump administration's expanded immigration enforcement. These firms reported higher-than-expected revenues, directly attributing their success to contracts with agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for surveillance technology and detention facilities. Executives from these companies have expressed optimism about future growth, particularly with new government funding allocated for expanding immigrant detention. Critics argue that these profits are derived from inhumane policies, highlighting the moral implications of monetizing a government crackdown on immigrant communities.</p>

Tasmanian police have since charged six teenagers, two girls and four boys aged 14 and 15, in connection with the serious assault. The Chinese consulate in Melbourne confirmed the victim's status as a student and is closely monitoring the case and the official response from Australia.</p>

While politically popular, tax experts note that these events may not boost the economy as much as claimed, as consumers often just shift the timing of planned purchases. However, these holidays can provide meaningful savings for middle- and lower-income families, especially for significant expenses like back-to-school shopping. Financial advisors suggest that shoppers can maximize their savings by combining the tax holiday with store promotions, rewards credit cards, and online shopping portals for even greater discounts.</p>

          <p>The rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence sector is generating wealth and creating new billionaires at a historic pace, surpassing previous tech booms. Startups like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Anysphere have achieved massive valuations through blockbuster fundraising, creating immense paper fortunes for their founders and early investors. This wealth creation is heavily concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area, leading to a resurgence in its economy and real estate market. While much of this wealth is currently illiquid in private companies, the growth of secondary markets and future public offerings present a massive opportunity for the wealth management industry.

          <p>This article explores the concept of negativity bias, suggesting that both media outlets and human psychology are hardwired to focus on threats and problems, often obscuring genuine progress. It argues that beyond the constant stream of negative headlines, a quieter story of improvement is unfolding. As examples, the article points to the U.S. murder rate potentially reaching historic lows and the fact that fewer people globally died from extreme weather in the first half of 2025 than in any comparable period on record. The author posits that embracing realistic optimism is essential for fostering resilience and inspiring action to solve the world's major challenges.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 474 people at a demonstration in Parliament Square held in support of Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under UK terrorism laws. The protest, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw hundreds of individuals display signs with messages like "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action," leading to mass arrests for supporting a banned organization. The Home Secretary defended the police action and the ban, citing security advice, while groups like Amnesty International called the arrests disproportionate and a threat to freedom of expression. This event represents the largest number of arrests by the Met on a single day in the last decade.</p>

The meteorite's dramatic entry into the atmosphere in June was witnessed across several states, accompanied by a loud boom. The discovery marks the 27th meteorite recovered in Georgia, and scientists hope to use the data to better understand the composition of asteroids and potential future threats.</p>

          <p>A detailed investigation into the 2022 death of Minnesota nurse Alexandra Pennig, initially reported as a suicide, concluded she was murdered by her former lover, Matthew Ecker. Detectives became suspicious due to inconsistencies in Ecker's story, such as a dry sink where he claimed to have washed his hands. The crucial piece of evidence was a small metal part of the bathroom door lock found under Pennig's body, indicating the door was forced open before she was shot. This contradicted Ecker's claim that he broke down the door after hearing the gunshot, leading to his conviction for second-degree murder and a 30-year prison sentence.</p>

Conversely, Republicans are defending the bill, highlighting tax relief for tipped workers and expanded immigration enforcement as key benefits for their constituents.

The article highlights the emotional return of Jorge Malagón Márquez, who first entered the tower as a traumatized five-year-old in 1967.

          <p>A provision in President Trump's new tax bill, marketed as "no tax on tips," is causing confusion among service industry workers who are unclear on its actual benefits. The measure provides a temporary tax deduction of up to $25,000 on tip income, which reduces taxable income but does not eliminate taxes entirely, as state and payroll taxes still apply. Key details remain ambiguous, including which specific occupations qualify and how different types of gratuities, like automatic service charges, will be treated. As tipping averages decline amid consumer fatigue, some workers feel the tax break is being misperceived and may not be as generous as it sounds.</p>

The push is partly motivated by geopolitical competition, as China and Russia are collaborating on their own, more powerful lunar reactor.

She argues that the concept of a "full recovery" can be an unattainable and perfectionistic goal that leads to shame and secrecy during setbacks. Instead, she explores living in the "middle place" between acute illness and complete wellness, where slips are acknowledged and managed without derailing progress. This mindset shift, from an all-or-nothing approach to one of acceptance and forward momentum, has allowed her to build a full life while still navigating the challenges of her disorder.</p>

          <p>The 1988 film "Miracle Mile," which depicts the chaos in Los Angeles during the final hour before a nuclear strike, has found a renewed cult following in recent years. Directed by Steve De Jarnatt, the movie begins as a romance between a musician and a waitress who meet at the La Brea Tar Pits before their date is upended by news of impending doom. The film is noted for its affectionate portrayal of its namesake L.A. neighborhood, featuring now-iconic locations like the May Co. building and Johnnie's Coffee Shop. Despite its dark theme, the film's enduring appeal lies in its poignant story of finding love at the end of the world.</p>

          <p>Amid the confusing and often ineffective landscape of recycling, the reuse movement is emerging as a promising alternative to combat single-use waste. This article focuses on a successful 12-week pilot program in Petaluma, California, where 30 businesses offered customers reusable plastic beverage cups at no extra charge. The program, sponsored by major corporations like Starbucks and Coca-Cola, achieved a return rate of over 50%, surpassing the environmental break-even point compared to single-use cups. Organizers found that community pride, rather than monetary incentives, was the biggest driver of participation, suggesting a scalable model for reducing waste.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cities like Los Angeles are exploring the "sponge city" model, an urban design philosophy that mitigates flooding by making surfaces more absorbent rather than flushing water away. This article highlights a successful project in Bangkok, where an old factory site was converted into a park with wetlands that capture and clean millions of gallons of stormwater. This nature-based approach contrasts with traditional "gray" infrastructure like concrete channels, offering benefits like replenishing groundwater and creating recreational green spaces. While L.A. has programs to fund such projects, progress is slow due to bureaucratic hurdles and high costs, presenting challenges to large-scale implementation.</p>

          <p>Facing the threat of a "Day Zero" water crisis due to climate change diminishing traditional water sources, Southern California is planning major investments to ensure future supply. Water agencies are pursuing a diversified strategy that includes building a massive wastewater recycling facility, enhancing stormwater capture, and potentially desalination. These efforts aim to create a more resilient, local water supply for the 19 million people in the region, reducing reliance on increasingly unreliable imported water from the Colorado River and Northern California. The challenge lies in implementing these costly projects while keeping water affordable for the public.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite California's role as a symbolic center of resistance to federal immigration enforcement, new data reveals it was not the epicenter of arrests during the first five months of the Trump administration's second term. Texas and Florida both reported significantly more ICE arrests, with Texas leading the nation at over 26,000. Experts attribute this disparity to the high level of cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE in red states, compared to the "sanctuary" policies in California that limit such collaboration. While California saw a dramatic percentage increase in arrests, the overall numbers suggest that organized local resistance may have tempered the scale of enforcement operations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is dismissing the asylum applications of some immigrants because they did not receive a mandatory "credible fear" interview upon entering the U.S. years ago. According to letters sent by USCIS, these cases are being closed due to a lack of jurisdiction, effectively forcing applicants who have been in the U.S. for years to restart the process. Immigration lawyers argue their clients are being penalized for a government backlog, as there were not enough asylum officers to conduct all the required interviews during the border influx. This move is creating fear and uncertainty, as affected individuals lose their work permits and face potential detention.</p>
