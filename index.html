          <p>Venezuela is holding an election for governor and legislators to represent Essequibo, a region internationally recognized as part of Guyana, in an effort by President Nicolás Maduro to legitimize his rule and stir nationalistic sentiment amid domestic dissatisfaction. The election is seen as a way to unify the people and armed forces against a common enemy, despite most Essequibo residents identifying as Guyanese and wanting to remain part of Guyana. Maduro has ramped up claims to the oil-rich region, comprising about two-thirds of Guyana, especially after Exxon Mobil expanded production there. Guyana has tightened border security and is prepared to arrest anyone supporting the election, while the International Court of Justice has ordered Venezuela to refrain from electing officials to oversee the area.</p>

          <p>The British government is considering a plan that includes chemical castration for male sex offenders to reduce the prison population by 10,000 inmates. The proposal involves administering drugs to limit sexual thoughts and reduce testosterone, coupled with psychological interventions. A pilot program has been ongoing since 2002, with plans to expand it to more prisons. While initially voluntary, some advocate for making it mandatory, though medical ethicists raise concerns about informed consent. The opposition Conservative Party has criticized the plan, arguing it decriminalizes crimes like burglary and theft.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new parenting framework called "emotionally safe parenting" focuses on being deeply attuned to a child's emotional needs, building emotional resilience, and fostering trust through open conversations. This approach emphasizes accepting a child's emotions without dismissing them, responding without shaming, and viewing misbehavior as a signal for support. Emotionally safe parents prioritize their own inner healing and create an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves authentically. By setting boundaries with empathy and reconnecting after conflicts, parents can model healthy emotional repair and promote strong communication.</p>

The increased violence has led to a rise in civilian casualties, undermining hopes that peace talks initiated by President Trump would ease attacks on civilian areas.

The county's shift reflects a change from localized, tradition-based politics to ideological sorting, particularly among working-class Hispanics. Factors contributing to this shift include the weakening of old partisan ties, a focus on local elections, and a growing disconnect between the Democratic Party and the cultural values of some nonwhite voters. The rise of Donald Trump and his populist appeal further accelerated this realignment, signaling a new era of American politics driven by cultural and ideological polarization.</p>

          <p>A second power outage in two days has struck the French Riviera, this time affecting Nice after a fire at a substation. Authorities suspect the fire, which impacted at least 45,000 homes, was a malicious act. This incident follows a massive blackout in nearby Cannes a day earlier, also blamed on suspected sabotage. Police in Nice reported finding tire tracks and a broken door at the substation, leading to an ongoing investigation. The power outage impacted Nice Airport and the tramway network, but power was later restored.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, the Black Lives Matter movement faces a significant backlash, with the politics of "white grievance" championed by President Trump gaining prominence. Key developments include the removal of Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, D.C., and the abandonment of oversight agreements for police forces accused of racial bias. Despite the initial surge of support for the movement, recent polls indicate a decline in public approval, and racial justice activists face increasing headwinds. However, some gains from the movement remain, including police reforms and growing resistance to efforts to eradicate diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.</p>

The deletion indicates China's effort to stabilize ties with Japan amid increasing tensions between Beijing and Washington.

          <p>Donald Trump's actions to dismantle cherished principles of American democracy are not random but part of a deliberate strategy to reverse-engineer liberal institutions. Unlike autocrats in other countries, Trump faces a robust set of democratic institutions designed to check his power. To overcome these, he is turning law against law, police forces against each other, and courts against courts, creating an autoimmune disorder within American democracy. By repurposing the strengths of American democracy against itself, Trump aims to undermine the social contract and establish a new social order far removed from liberal democratic ideals.</p>

The Fujian, the People's Liberation Army's third carrier and first equipped with electromagnetic catapults, is expected to enhance China's naval capabilities significantly. A local maritime safety administration issued traffic control warnings for the area near the mouth of the Yangtze River as the Fujian sailed towards open waters.

Supporters tout it as key to prosperity and liberal power, while critics decry it as a corporate-aligned infiltration of the Democratic Party. This conflict stems from the agenda's challenge to the influence of activist organizations that have long shaped progressive politics.

Russia's increased manufacturing and evolving drone technology, including more explosives and improved evasion capabilities, have made the attacks more devastating.
