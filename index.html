          <p>A CDC official, Dr. Fiona Havers, who oversaw COVID-19 hospitalization data, has resigned due to concerns that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is influencing vaccine policy with potentially biased data. Havers expressed a lack of confidence that the data would be used objectively to make evidence-based decisions, following Kennedy's orders to change vaccine recommendations and replace the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices (ACIP) members. Former ACIP members have criticized Kennedy's actions as dismantling the vaccine recommendation process, potentially impacting access to lifesaving vaccines. HHS defends Kennedy's leadership, stating that vaccine policy decisions will be based on objective data and transparent analysis.</p>

Musk's prior support as Trump's biggest political donor has shifted, with both figures exchanging threats and allegations. Diplomatic observers suggest this incident reinforces the perception in China that Trump is an unpredictable negotiator who may not honor his commitments.

          <p>An illegal immigrant with a prior robbery conviction and previous arrests for murder and assault has been charged with assaulting an ICE agent in Los Angeles. Omar Pulido Bastida allegedly spat on an agent while being arrested for illegally re-entering the United States after prior deportation. The Department of Homeland Security criticized Los Angeles officials for prioritizing criminal illegal aliens over citizens, while Mayor Karen Bass stated that the ICE sweeps are targeting everyday Angelenos and not the alleged criminals. The arrest follows anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles, with President Trump calling for increased arrests and a mass deportation program.</p>

          <p>Senator Tim Kaine has introduced a war powers resolution aimed at limiting President Trump's ability to take military action against Iran without congressional approval, amid escalating tensions between Iran and Israel. The resolution seeks to reassert congressional authority over military engagements, preventing the U.S. from being drawn into another conflict in the Middle East without a debate and vote in Congress. While the resolution would not prevent the U.S. from defending itself against imminent threats, it requires congressional approval for offensive action. This move reflects ongoing concerns about presidential war powers and the need for congressional oversight in matters of war and peace.</p>

Federal prosecutors stated that Boelter went to the homes of four Minnesota state lawmakers with the intent to kill them. One lawmaker was not home, while another, state senator Ann Rest, was alerted by authorities that Boelter had been parked near her house early Saturday morning, leading to increased security. Boelter's arrest followed a large-scale manhunt, and the Justice Department is considering seeking the death penalty in the case.</p>

          <p>A proposed bill in California seeks to make it a misdemeanor for law enforcement officers to cover their faces while on duty, requiring them to be identifiable by their uniform and name or identifier. State Senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin introduced the bill to promote transparency and public trust in law enforcement. They cited recent incidents where federal officers conducted raids while covering their faces, raising concerns about accountability and potential impersonation. The bill would not apply to the National Guard, SWAT teams, or officers responding to natural disasters, aiming to balance transparency with operational needs.</p>

American journalists suggest that the timing of the tournament, close to the upcoming World Cup, may also affect attendance. FIFA's decision to manage the event in-house without a local organizing committee is cited as a reason for the marketing failures.</p>
