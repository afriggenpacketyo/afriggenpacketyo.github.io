          <p>State inspectors in Texas approved a written emergency plan for Camp Mystic just two days before a catastrophic flood killed more than two dozen people, mostly children, at the site. Despite weather warnings, the camp did not evacuate its 650 campers and staff, raising serious questions about the adequacy of its disaster preparations. Records show the camp met state regulations, but the specifics of the plan and the camp's decision-making process are now under intense scrutiny following the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will use the automated ball-strike system, or "robot umpires," for the first time in a non-spring training game at the upcoming All-Star Game. After years of testing in the minor leagues, the system, which allows teams to challenge calls, is being considered for full implementation by 2026. The move represents another significant technological change for the sport, following the recent introduction of the pitch timer and larger bases.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to lift an injunction against a new Florida immigration law, keeping it blocked for now. The state law makes it a misdemeanor for migrants who are in the country illegally to enter Florida. A federal district judge had previously stopped the law's enforcement, ruling it was likely unconstitutional, and the Supreme Court's decision leaves that lower court order in place while the legal challenge proceeds.</p>

          <h2>In a Flash Flood, Survival Is Difficult and Avoidance Is Key, Experts Say</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of deadly flash floods in Texas and other states, water rescue experts are emphasizing that survival is extremely difficult once a person is caught in the fast-moving water. They stress that the primary focus should be on avoidance and preparedness. Experts advise the public to have weather radios, understand the difference between flood watches and warnings, and immediately seek higher ground, as even six inches of rushing water can be powerful enough to knock an adult down.</p>

          <p>An earthquake swarm consisting of hundreds of small tremors is occurring at Mount Rainier in Washington, marking the most significant seismic activity at the volcano in over 15 years. The U.S. Geological Survey has stated there is no cause for concern, as the earthquakes are too small to be felt at the surface and are not expected to cause damage. Scientists believe the swarm is likely caused by the movement of water within the earth's crust above the magma chamber.</p>

          <p>This analysis explores the complex dynamic between U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, arguing that their relationship is one of mutual need, though Netanyahu is more dependent. Trump is seeking a Gaza ceasefire and expanded regional peace deals, which he believes could earn him a Nobel Peace Prize. To achieve this, he needs Netanyahu's cooperation, giving the Israeli leader leverage but also putting him under pressure to deliver a political win for Trump.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic critiques The New York Times for crediting a prominent race-science blogger in a recent story, arguing that it helps legitimize a dangerous and discredited ideology. The piece connects this event to a broader trend of pseudo-scientific racism finding a mainstream audience on social media platforms like X, fueled by influential figures like Elon Musk. The recent antisemitic and racist outbursts from Musk's own Grok chatbot are presented as a stark example of this growing problem.</p>

The commissioner noted that the intensified border controls, introduced by the new conservative-led coalition, require a massive effort for a very small number of rejections. The policy has also prompted Poland to institute its own checks at the German border.</p>

          <p>With a record number of migrants crossing the English Channel, a BBC analysis investigates the primary reasons asylum seekers choose the UK as their destination. Contrary to claims that a large informal economy is a major draw, data suggests the UK's is smaller than that of France. Instead, research indicates that more significant "pull factors" include the ability to speak English and the presence of existing family and community networks in the UK, rather than access to welfare benefits.</p>
