          <p>At least 365 people were arrested in London during a demonstration supporting Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the UK's Terrorism Act. Protesters gathered in Parliament Square, holding signs with the message "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action," leading to mass arrests for expressing support for a banned organization. The government's ban makes membership or support a criminal offense, a move that the group is challenging in court as a breach of free speech. The Metropolitan Police confirmed the arrests, stating anyone holding a supportive placard was detained.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that struck a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been identified by a planetary geologist as being 4.56 billion years old, making it older than Earth itself. The space rock, which left a dent in the homeowner's floor, is believed to have originated from the breakup of a large asteroid between Mars and Jupiter about 470 million years ago. Scientists are proposing to name it the McDonough Meteorite, marking the 27th meteorite ever recovered in Georgia. The event highlights how modern technology and public awareness are helping to recover more of these celestial objects.</p>

          <p>This excerpt from Mark K. Updegrove's book, "Incomparable Grace: JFK in the Presidency," explores John F. Kennedy's mindset in late 1963, just before his assassination. The passage details a strategy meeting where his team felt optimistic about his 1964 reelection prospects, citing a strong economy, high approval ratings, and a divided Republican field. It also recounts the political motivations for his trip to Texas, which was primarily a fundraising effort to unite a fractured state party. The excerpt provides a poignant look at Kennedy's confidence and political calculations in the days leading up to the tragedy in Dallas.</p>

          <p>A shooting in New York City's Times Square left three people injured early Saturday morning following a dispute that began inside a restaurant. A 19-year-old man, an 18-year-old woman, and a 65-year-old man were all hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. The New York Police Department has arrested a 17-year-old suspect and recovered a handgun at the scene. This article notes the incident comes as President Trump has increased rhetoric about crime and ordered federal agents into Washington D.C. to address the issue.</p>

The Crew-10 mission, commanded by Anne McClain, landed safely west of San Diego after a 17.5-hour journey from the International Space Station. This was the first NASA-sponsored crew to land in the Pacific, a change made by SpaceX to ensure debris from the capsule's trunk section falls harmlessly away from populated areas.

          <p>This article provides a historical analysis of how partisan gerrymandering has reshaped American politics over the last 15 years. It focuses on the Republican strategy known as "Redmap," which was implemented after the 2010 census to gain control of state legislatures and redraw congressional districts. This use of computer mapping and voter data allowed the GOP to lock in majorities in Congress and statehouses, even when their candidates received fewer votes overall. The piece argues these actions have entrenched hard-right lawmakers and insulated them from accountability at the ballot box.</p>

Bengen's research suggests that retirees are often too conservative and could spend more without outliving their savings.

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping to brief him on his upcoming summit with U.S. President Donald Trump. According to the official Chinese readout of the call, Xi expressed support for the U.S.-Russia dialogue and hoped to see progress in resolving the Ukraine crisis. Despite this high-level communication, analysts remain skeptical that the meeting between Trump and Putin will result in a lasting peace agreement or significantly alter the strategic dynamics of the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition is celebrating the work of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch artist who was one of the most famous and successful still-life painters of her era, even more so than contemporaries like Rembrandt and Vermeer. Growing up as the daughter of a renowned anatomist and embalmer, Ruysch developed a unique, scientifically precise style. She specialized in creating lush, complex bouquets featuring exotic flowers from around the world, often set against dark backgrounds and teeming with meticulously rendered insects and small creatures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Australian scientist, Karl Kruszelnicki, asserts that the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle can be easily solved with logic and statistics. He argues that there is no supernatural force at play, and the number of ships and planes that have gone missing in the area is proportionally the same as any other heavily traveled region of the ocean. This explanation, which points to a combination of high traffic volume, human error, and notoriously volatile weather, is supported by organizations like NOAA and the insurance market Lloyd's of London.</p>
