        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, ending one of its last remaining crypto enforcement actions. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. Binance recently forged ties with World Liberty Financial, a project aspiring to be a crypto bank that funnels a significant portion of profits to entities linked to the Trump family. This decision leaves Binance without major regulatory challenges after a previous $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily paused a lower-court ruling that struck down most of President Trump's tariffs, granting the administration's request. The Trump administration argued that the trade court's ruling improperly challenged presidential authority and threatened trade negotiations. The appeals court gave plaintiffs one week to respond to the administration's bid for a stay pending appeal, with the U.S. having until June 9 to reply. White House officials criticized the trade-court judges, accusing them of bias and undermining the credibility of the United States on the world stage. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that oceans worldwide have darkened over the past two decades, raising concerns for marine life. Satellite data reveals that 21% of the planetâ€™s oceans have darkened between 2003 and 2022, potentially impacting marine ecosystems that rely on light for essential processes. The darkening could cause marine creatures to move closer to the surface, creating a more cramped living space. Researchers believe global warming and changes in ocean currents may be contributing to this phenomenon.</p>

The security firm will provide 24/7 armed patrols to protect burned lots and vacant homes from burglary and vandalism. The patrols will work alongside the Los Angeles sheriffâ€™s office to ensure public safety during the recovery phase. Looting has been a concern for residents since the fires, which caused significant damage and displacement.</p>

          <p>The National Association of the Deaf (NAD) has filed a federal lawsuit against the White House for failing to provide American Sign Language interpreters at press briefings. The NAD argues that the lack of interpreters violates disability rights laws and deprives deaf individuals of meaningful access to government information. The lawsuit alleges that the White House abruptly stopped providing ASL interpreters when President Trump returned to office. The NAD is seeking a court order requiring ASL interpreters at briefings and making video of them available.</p>
