            <p>A Russian court convicted four journalists, Antonina Favorskaya, Kostantin Gabov, Sergey Karelin, and Artyom Kriger, of extremism for allegedly working with Alexei Navalny's anti-corruption group and sentenced them to 5 1/2 years in prison. The journalists maintain their innocence, asserting they were prosecuted for their journalistic work. The trial is part of a broader crackdown on dissent in Russia following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, targeting opposition figures, independent journalists, and activists. The journalists' work covered protests, political trials, and interviews for independent news outlets and YouTube channels, which the court deemed extremist activities, leading to international condemnation.

            <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for its handling of the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador and detained in a mega-prison. Despite court orders for his return, the administration claims it has no obligation to actively facilitate his release, leading to a legal dispute. Abrego Garcia's lawyers argue the administration is not complying with the Supreme Court's order to facilitate his release.

            <p>A new study explores the feasibility of reintroducing grizzly bears to California, where they have been extinct for a century. The study identifies three potential regions for reintroduction: the Transverse Ranges, the Sierra Nevada, and the Northwest Forest, estimating that the state could support around 1,183 grizzlies. While proponents emphasize the ecological benefits and cultural significance, wildlife officials express concerns about increased human-wildlife conflict. The study also addresses the statistical risk to humans, finding it to be small, but acknowledges the need for a well-resourced recovery program and public awareness to manage potential conflicts.

            <p>Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump's special envoy, initially suggested Iran could enrich uranium at a low level for civilian use, but later demanded the complete elimination of Iran's nuclear program. This policy shift complicates potential negotiations between the US and Iran and increases the risk of military action. The change in stance may be due to pressure from Iran hawks or reflect inconsistent foreign policymaking within the Trump administration. Iran has consistently asserted its right to maintain a civil nuclear program, making the new US position a potential obstacle to progress in talks. Optimism score: 30</p>

The U.S. is not ready to fill the gap if China's trade controls result in a complete shutdown of exports.

            <p>A judge rejected the defense's argument that the Gaudreau brothers contributed to their own deaths, upholding all charges against the allegedly drunken driver who hit and killed them. The defense claimed the brothers' blood-alcohol levels may have contributed to the incident, but the judge deemed the issue moot under New Jersey criminal law. Prosecutors argued that other drivers witnessed the defendant speeding and illegally passing before striking the brothers, who were riding safely. The Gaudreaus were bicycling near their hometown on the eve of their sister’s wedding. Optimism score: 15</p>

            <p>Financial advisors caution against moving entirely to cash amid stock market volatility, as cash may feel safer but poses risks for long-term savers. While cash is less volatile, it historically delivers lower returns than stocks over the long term. Holding too much cash can hinder the achievement of investing goals and may require saving more discretionary income. Diversification across safe and risky assets is crucial, with the appropriate mix depending on an investor's financial situation and risk tolerance. (not investment advice) Optimism score: 50</p>
