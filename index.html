          <p>Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman has issued a stern warning to violent protesters, vowing to track down, arrest, prosecute, and punish those involved in recent riot violence. Standing alongside LA Sheriff Robert Luna and LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell, Hochman announced felony charges against several rioters accused of attacking officers, looting stores, and vandalizing public property. Sheriff Luna praised the district attorney for his swift action, assigning a special prosecutor to focus on crimes against law enforcement, with assistance from federal agencies. Chief McDonnell highlighted the dangers officers face, including attacks with fireworks and Molotov cocktails, emphasizing that such actions are felonies and will be met with accountability. The DA's office intends to use social media video evidence to identify and apprehend perpetrators. </p>

          <p>A Chinese military aircraft flew dangerously close to a Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force patrol plane over the Pacific, prompting the Japanese Defense Ministry to lodge a protest with China. The Chinese J-15 warplane, operating from the aircraft carrier Shandong, approached within 45 meters of the Japanese plane. The ministry reported other dangerous maneuvers, including the Chinese plane passing in front of an MSDF P-3C aircraft at the same altitude with only 900 meters separating them. Japan has demanded an end to such flights, citing safety concerns and potential risks to maritime operations in the region. </p>

          <p>Sources have informed CBS News that Israel is reportedly prepared to launch an operation into Iran, prompting the U.S. to anticipate potential Iranian retaliation against American sites in neighboring Iraq. This anticipation is a factor in the State Department's recent order for non-emergency government officials to leave Iraq due to heightened regional tensions. Despite the tensions, President Trump's Middle East envoy is scheduled to meet with Iran for a sixth round of talks on the country's nuclear program. Trump reiterated the U.S. stance against Iran developing nuclear weapons, stating, "We're not going to allow that.". </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics reveals that gun deaths among children have risen in states with lax firearm laws over a 13-year period. States such as Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, and Georgia saw increases in pediatric gun deaths after amending their firearm restrictions following a 2010 Supreme Court ruling. The study divided states into most permissive, permissive, and strict categories based on legal changes made since 2010, finding that youth deaths, including homicides and suicides, rose in states with the most permissive laws. California, New York, and other states with restrictive laws saw stable or decreased pediatric gun deaths, indicating a link between legal posture and youth firearm deaths. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of dinosaur, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, from museum specimens, which is considered the closest known ancestor of tyrannosaurs, including T.rex. The 86-million-year-old skeletons reveal an evolutionary shift from small, fleet-footed predators to the formidable giants that dominated North America and Asia. This discovery has led to a revision of the tyrannosaur family tree, providing insights into the evolution of features like skull anatomy that enabled powerful jaws. Khankhuuluu, weighing around 750kg, represents a transitional fossil between earlier ancestors and the mighty tyrannosaurs, enhancing our understanding of tyrannosaur evolution. </p>

          <p>Paris Baguette, a Korean bakery chain, aims to expand internationally, challenging the notion that croissants must be exclusively French. The company, owned by SPC Group, operates in 14 countries and plans to open over 1,000 new branches by 2030, particularly in the US. CEO Jin-soo Hur emphasizes the brand's international nature, viewing items like croissants as universal products. Paris Baguette is investing in a Texas factory to supply the US, Canada, and Latin America, focusing on efficiency and convenience through frozen dough delivery to franchises. </p>

The US State Department official stated that they are constantly assessing the appropriate personnel posture at all their embassies, and based on their latest analysis, they decided to reduce the footprint of their mission in Iraq. </p>
