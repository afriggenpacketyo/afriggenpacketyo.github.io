          <p>Following a high-stakes summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, former President Donald Trump shared ten key takeaways in an exclusive interview with Fox News. Trump described the meeting as a "10 out of 10" in terms of rapport, stating that while no final deal was reached on the Ukraine conflict, significant progress was made. He indicated that the next steps are up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to whom his advice was to "make a deal," and also suggested he would be open to a future trilateral meeting to finalize an agreement. The article highlights Trump's belief that Putin now respects the U.S. and that the war would not have occurred under his presidency.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, marking the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, with forecasts predicting it could become a major hurricane over the weekend. The U.S. National Hurricane Center is urging residents in the Caribbean islands, including the Leewards, Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, to monitor the storm's progress due to the risk of heavy rainfall, flash floods, and life-threatening surf conditions. While the storm is expected to curve northward and remain offshore from the U.S. East Coast, its development signals the approach of the hurricane season's peak. Officials have issued tropical storm watches for several islands as a precautionary measure.</p>

          <p>A Bank of America strategist has highlighted a chart showing the S&P 500's price-to-book ratio reaching a record high of 5.3, surpassing the 5.1 peak seen during the dot-com bubble in March 2000. This surge is largely attributed to intense investor optimism surrounding the transformative potential of artificial intelligence, which is driving expectations for future earnings growth. While some classic valuation metrics suggest market froth, the article notes that high valuations do not definitively signal a bubble, especially as many AI companies have consistently beaten earnings expectations. However, the analysis serves as a caution that current market optimism is reaching historical extremes. (not investment advice)</p>

In a Fox News interview, Trump asserted that these points were negotiated on behalf of Ukraine and the broader NATO situation, describing the three-hour discussion with Putin as a "very warm meeting." He conveyed a strong sense of optimism, claiming that the two sides are now "pretty close to a deal" to end the ongoing conflict, placing the onus on Ukraine and European allies to finalize it.</p>

          <p>California Democrats have introduced a proposal to redraw the state's congressional district maps in an effort to gain up to five additional U.S. House seats. This move is positioned as a direct response to a similar Republican-led initiative in Texas and aims to strengthen the Democratic party's chances of controlling Congress in the upcoming midterm elections. The plan, which would require a state constitutional amendment approved by voters in a special election, would significantly alter the boundaries of several GOP-held districts to create a strong Democratic voter advantage. Proponents argue it's a necessary countermeasure, while critics, including some Republicans, have labeled it a partisan power grab.</p>

          <p>A data breach at a UK Ministry of Defence sub-contractor has exposed the personal information of up to 3,700 Afghans who were resettled in the UK under the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap).

          <p>The highly anticipated summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin concluded without a tangible deal or even a ceasefire agreement, leaving observers to question its purpose and outcome. In a brief press appearance, Trump offered vague assurances of progress but admitted no deal was reached, while Putin's remarks suggested his core demands regarding Ukraine remain unchanged. This analysis from The Atlantic characterizes the event as a symbolic victory for Putin, who was granted a high-profile meeting on U.S. soil after years of international isolation. The lack of specific deliverables or a clear path forward has left Ukraine and its European allies in a state of uncertainty about the future of the conflict.</p>

          <p>An internal review by the Arkansas Department of Corrections reveals that Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," spent six months meticulously planning his escape from a state prison. Hardin stated that lax security in the prison kitchen, where he worked, allowed him to gather materials to create a fake law enforcement uniform, complete with a badge made from a can lid. He escaped by walking through a gate after a tower guard unlocked it without confirming his identity, an incident that has led to the firing of two employees. Hardin survived in the wilderness for nearly two weeks on smuggled food and foraged items before his recapture.</p>

          <p>Correspondents from the BBC have analyzed the summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, concluding that it ended without any tangible achievements, most notably failing to secure a ceasefire in Ukraine. Despite the significant travel and buildup, Trump conceded "there's no deal until there's a deal," leaving allies and adversaries alike without clarity on what progress, if any, was made. For Putin, the meeting itself was a geopolitical success, granting him a stage with a U.S. president. The key question remaining is whether Trump will now follow through on previous threats to impose new, severe sanctions on Russia in response to the diplomatic stalemate.</p>

A federal judge expressed skepticism about the legality of the move, prompting the DOJ to revise its directive.

This development comes a year after the city enacted a pioneering law to allow such sales, aiming to create more accessible homeownership opportunities amid the state's housing crisis. Officials hope this ADU condominium will serve as a model for other cities, potentially creating a new category of starter homes at a more affordable price point. The initiative is part of a broader trend that has seen ADUs account for approximately one-fifth of California's housing growth in 2024.</p>

Before sharing his wartime experiences, Capt. Abbas saluted the King for attending the event despite his ongoing cancer treatment, also revealing he himself has been cancer-free for 25 years. Born in British India, Capt. Abbas served as a combat cameraman with the British 14th Army in the Burma campaign. His journey from fighting against Japanese forces to witnessing the aftermath of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima provides a powerful, personal perspective on the war's global impact.</p>

          <p>Iconic fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback to the UK High Street with the opening of new standalone stores, years after its previous owner, Arcadia, collapsed. The brand, now owned by online retailer Asos, is also hosting its first catwalk show in seven years to signal its revival. Industry experts note that while there is strong nostalgia for Topshop among millennials and Gen Z, its success will depend on its ability to attract a new generation of shoppers and reclaim its former status as a trendsetter. The new leadership aims to focus on product quality and value while navigating a competitive retail landscape dominated by fast fashion.</p>

          <p>China's bubble tea industry has grown into a multi-billion dollar market, with three major chains recently raising over $700 million in Hong Kong IPOs as investors bet on the country's consumer sector. Brands like Mixue Group have achieved massive scale through a franchise-heavy model, becoming one of the world's largest beverage chains by outlet count. However, the industry faces significant challenges, including intense price wars, market saturation at home, and the difficulties of replicating its success in overseas markets. Analysts question whether these brands can maintain their high valuations and prove they are a sustainable business rather than a passing fad. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The opening Premier League match between Liverpool and Bournemouth was temporarily halted after Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by a spectator in the crowd. The referee, Anthony Taylor, stopped play to inform both managers, and an anti-discrimination message was broadcast at halftime. Despite the distressing incident, Semenyo went on to score two goals in the match. The Football Association, both clubs, and anti-racism organizations have strongly condemned the abuse and an investigation is underway. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing issue of racism directed at players in professional football.</p>

          <p>An art exhibition in Bangkok focusing on authoritarian repression was censored after representatives from the Chinese embassy lodged complaints about works by Tibetan, Uyghur, and Hong Kong artists. The show's curator, a Burmese artist named Sai, claims officials demanded the removal of sensitive artworks and flags, and some artists' names were painted over. The incident has been condemned by human rights advocates as an act of transnational repression by China. Fearing for their safety, Sai and his wife have fled Thailand to seek asylum in the UK. The Chinese embassy accused the show of promoting independence movements and harming China's core interests.</p>

          <p>Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is promoting an American-made electric pickup truck with a minimalist, "open source" design aimed at affordability. The company's strategy is to sell a barebones, two-seat base model and allow owners to customize it with over 100 planned accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. Slate initially advertised a starting price below $20,000 with federal tax credits, attracting over 100,000 reservations. However, with the rollback of EV incentives, the truck's price will be closer to $28,000, placing it in a more competitive market segment and testing whether its simple, customizable approach remains compelling to consumers.
