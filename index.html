          <h2>Snap Shares Plummet After Company Cites Advertising Concerns and Withholds Guidance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-30 15:00:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Snap shares experienced a significant drop of over 14% after the social media company chose not to provide second-quarter guidance, citing an uncertain macroeconomic environment that could impact advertising demand. According to Snap's finance chief, some advertisers are already feeling the effects of changes to the de minimis exemption, which allows shipments under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, adding to the unsettling backdrop created by President Trump's shifting tariff plans. While Snap's revenue has grown, the company is balancing investment with realized revenue growth, as advertising revenues grew 9% year over year to $1.21 billion during the quarter.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley stated that President Trump's recent tariff reprieve for automotive parts is a positive step but emphasized the need for more comprehensive policy changes to support automakers and foster growth in the U.S. auto industry. The new executive order reimburses automakers for some U.S. parts and reduces the "stacking" of tariffs. Farley stressed the importance of policies that encourage exports and reward American production, noting that Ford is a net exporter of parts and vehicles. He highlighted the necessity of affordable parts to ensure supply chains promote domestic growth and accessible vehicles for consumers.</p>

          <p>Representative Elise Stefanik is contemplating a run for governor of New York and dealing with a strained relationship with Speaker Mike Johnson after her nomination for UN ambassador was withdrawn. The article details how Stefanik, once considered a moderate Republican, shifted to the MAGA right, leading to both admiration from Trump and top GOP donors and the implosion of her cabinet dream. Stefanik publicly accused Johnson of dishonesty, particularly regarding conversations about the governor's race, further highlighting the discord. Despite the setbacks, Stefanik remains resilient, focusing on serving New Yorkers and considering her future political paths.</p>

          <p>Divers off the coast of San Diego were puzzled by the disappearance of a 2,000-pound gray whale calf carcass, initially found in Scripps Canyon at a shallow depth of 115 feet, a rare opportunity for human divers to witness a whale fall. The calf, believed to have been separated from its mother, was first spotted by Doug Bonhaus, and later documented by underwater photojournalist Jules Jacobs. Jacobs observed scavenger sharks feeding on the carcass during a subsequent dive, but the entire carcass vanished after a series of spring storms, potentially swept deeper into the canyon by strong winds and currents, preventing a sustaining whale fall.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court seemed inclined to allow Oklahoma to use public funds for a Catholic charter school, the first of its kind in the nation, with justices debating whether excluding the school would constitute discrimination against religion. The case, stemming from Oklahoma's approval of St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, has divided the court along ideological lines, with concerns raised about the state's level of control and the potential impact on religious freedom. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case, and a ruling in favor of the school could significantly impact charter school laws across 46 states.</p>

          <p>The European Union has urged military restraint and dialogue between India and Pakistan following a recent attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, where more than two dozen tourists were killed. While the EU calls for a peaceful resolution, analysts suggest that trade interests largely define the EU's relationship with India, especially as the US turns against the EU. Pramit Pal Chaudhuri from the Eurasia Group said India doesn't expect trouble from Brussels, as the EU seeks to diversify trade relations, and Ursula von der Leyen announced plans to finalize a free trade agreement by the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>European carmakers, including Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, and Volkswagen, expressed pessimism about the future due to the chaos caused by President Trump's tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum. The tariffs have left them struggling to assess the impact and plan for the future, leading Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis to suspend their financial forecasts for 2025. Volkswagen Group scaled back its profit expectations, citing that initial calculations were made before the tariffs were introduced, while the German Association of the Automotive Industry welcomed the move by Mr. Trump, but called it “a small step”.</p>

          <p>Despite Starbucks' disappointing quarter and a 7% drop in shares, Jim Cramer maintains his "buy" rating, citing confidence in CEO Brian Niccol's turnaround expertise. Cramer sees the stock dip as a buying opportunity, noting that Niccol's messaging indicates the turnaround is still on track, and that the CEO is actively buying Starbucks stock. While Wall Street hoped for quicker progress, Cramer emphasized that Starbucks presents a different challenge than Chipotle, which Niccol turned around in less than a year, and Niccol has stated that earnings will lag in the near term.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of New Jersey commuters may need to work from home if train engineers go on strike later this month, as negotiations with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen have stalled. New Jersey Transit has advised customers to prepare for a shutdown of statewide rail service, which would be the first such strike in over 40 years. While a contingency plan involves substituting buses for some trains, it can only accommodate about 20% of the daily train riders, leading to the recommendation that those who can work from home should plan to do so.</p>

          <p>Financial planners recommend keeping enough cash in a checking account to cover a month's worth of bills, with a small buffer for peace of mind, but advise against hoarding too much, which could miss out on interest earned in high-yield savings accounts. It is also important to be mindful of fraud. While some experts recommend a month's expenses, others suggest enough to cover a typical week or two of bills, with the ideal balance being a personal decision that balances financial security with the potential for growth.</p>

          <p>Meta is set to report its first-quarter earnings, and analysts are closely watching for signs that President Trump's tariffs on China are affecting the company's online advertising business. The analysis of the article indicates that analysts expect Meta's China-derived advertising business to feel the most pain from Trump's tariffs, as online retailers such as Temu and Shein reduce their U.S. ad spending. Meta's 2025 advertising revenue could be affected by $7 billion if China-linked companies continue shrinking their digital ad spending, according to MoffettNathanson analysts.</p>

          <p>The chaotic start to President Trump's second term has roiled the economy, with U.S. gross domestic product declining at an 0.3 percent annual rate in the first quarter, primarily due to businesses stocking up on imports ahead of new tariffs. While consumer spending and business investment remained solid, economists expect a slowdown in the months ahead as tariffs drive up prices and create uncertainty. Despite the economic slowdown, inflation cooled in March, with the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index rising 2.3 percent from a year earlier, closer to the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy shrank at a 0.3% annual rate in the first quarter of 2025, as businesses rushed to stockpile goods ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariff policies. The nation's gross domestic product, the total value of products and services, was down from growth of 2.4% in the final three months of 2024, and the slowdown comes amid growing concerns that Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy. A rise in imports may appear to lower economic growth and show a shift away from domestic consumption, but that doesn't tell the whole story, economists note.</p>
