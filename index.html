          <h2>Trump Administration to Establish National Standards for College Athlete Compensation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 23:07:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order creating national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program, which allows college athletes to earn money. This follows 2021 rule changes and a recent court settlement permitting schools to pay student-athletes directly, a major shift from the NCAA's long-standing amateurism model. The order aims to create a uniform federal framework, superseding the varied state laws that currently govern NIL compensation. However, there are bipartisan concerns that the new rules might grant excessive power to the NCAA rather than prioritizing the interests of the athletes.</p>

          <p>The nomination of self-proclaimed democratic socialist Zorhan Mamdani for New York City mayor is causing a significant rift within the Democratic Party. His progressive platform has alienated moderate and conservative Democrats, with many party leaders hesitating to endorse him. This internal division presents an opportunity for Republicans, who believe the controversy could make nearby swing districts more competitive in future elections. The situation highlights the ongoing ideological struggle within the Democratic party as it seeks a unified message.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia that would set a 19% tariff on its U.S. exports, a reduction from a previously threatened 32% rate. As part of the agreement, Trump stated that Indonesia has committed to purchasing billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as dozens of Boeing jets. However, the Indonesian government has not yet publicly confirmed these terms, creating uncertainty around the deal's finality. This follows a pattern of similar trade announcements with other nations where details remained unconfirmed by the other party. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported a group of men convicted of violent crimes, including murder and child sexual assault, to the African nation of Eswatini. This action is part of an expanding and controversial policy to send deportees to third-party countries when their home nations refuse to accept them. The deported men were from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Vietnam, and Yemen. Critics raise humanitarian and safety concerns about this practice, especially regarding the legal process and the conditions in the receiving countries.</p>

Following the White House discussion, the holdouts agreed to advance the bills, demonstrating Trump's continued influence over the party. The event underscores the administration's push to establish the U.S. as a leader in digital assets.</p>

          <p>Amid an administration crackdown on immigration, some migrant workers, including those with legal status, are using mobile apps to avoid encounters with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). These apps rely on crowdsourced user reports to show the real-time locations of ICE agents and checkpoints, allowing users to alter their routes and alleviate fears of arrest and detention. While users say the apps provide a sense of security, ICE officials have expressed concern that the technology is dangerous and could be used to ambush their officers.</p>

          <p>Brazil's prosecutor-general has officially recommended that the Supreme Federal Court find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of attempting a coup after his 2022 election defeat. The charges accuse Bolsonaro and seven others of forming a criminal association to violently overthrow the democratic order, culminating in the January 8, 2023 riots in Brasília. The prosecution argues that Bolsonaro instrumentalized the state apparatus to attack public institutions. If convicted, he could face a prison sentence of up to 40 years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Central banks around the world are increasingly buying gold directly from mines within their own countries, according to a new report from the World Gold Council. This trend is driven by record-high gold prices and allows central banks to increase their reserves using local currency instead of foreign exchange assets like the U.S. dollar. The practice is seen as a cheaper alternative to buying on the international market and provides support for the domestic mining industry, though it can present challenges related to refining and reputational risks.

His conviction was overturned in 2021, and he was declared factually innocent in 2022 after a review by the District Attorney's Conviction Integrity Unit.

While a recent Supreme Court decision allows layoffs to proceed, Petrilli believes the department will not be completely eliminated as that would require an act of Congress. He argued that the cuts will have little direct impact on the daily operations of most schools, as education in the U.S. is primarily funded and managed at the state and local levels.</p>

          <p>An independent review for the UK's National Health Service (NHS) has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their titles changed to "assistants." This change is intended to reduce patient confusion and clarify the distinction between these roles and fully qualified doctors. The review also advised that these professionals should not be responsible for diagnosing patients and should wear standardized uniforms. The recommendations come after growing concerns from patient groups and doctors' unions about patient safety and role clarity.</p>

Trip, a popular CBD and wellness drink brand, was also cited for an inaccurate sugar claim and told not to repeat the ad in its current form.</p>
