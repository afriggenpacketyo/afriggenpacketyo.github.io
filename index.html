          <p>President Trump has agreed to extend the deadline for negotiating tariffs with the European Union to July 9th, following a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Von der Leyen stated she had a "good call" with Trump and needed until July 9th to reach a "good deal." This decision follows Trump's earlier threat to impose 50% tariffs on EU goods starting June 1st, citing frustration with the pace of negotiations. The EU's trade chief reaffirmed the bloc's commitment to securing a fair deal, emphasizing mutual respect rather than threats in trade relations.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that the "silence" from the United States following recent Russian attacks is encouraging President Vladimir Putin. This statement comes after Russia launched its largest aerial assault since the full-scale invasion in 2022, firing 367 drones and missiles, resulting in numerous casualties. Zelensky emphasized that Russia's "brutality cannot be stopped" without increased pressure on the Russian leadership. While President Trump commented that he was "not happy" with Putin's actions, Zelensky is pushing for more stringent sanctions against Moscow to incentivize ceasefire talks.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa has lodged a complaint with the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) following a controversial decision to disallow a goal during their match against Manchester United. The referee's decision to award a free-kick to Manchester United due to perceived control of the ball by the goalkeeper before a Villa player gained possession has sparked outrage. Villa captain John McGinn called the decision "incredible," while pundits and fans alike have questioned the referee's judgment and the effectiveness of VAR in such situations.

The investor expressed unease about Block's expansion into buy now, pay later, music, and cryptocurrency, arguing that it diverts resources and managerial attention. Regarding Pinterest, the investor was disappointed with its monetization efforts and its tendency to be slowed down by headwinds, like a plunge in advertisement pricing. The investor is now looking for growth companies that can push past headwinds, deliver consistent profits, and avoid diluting shareholders (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, the Black Lives Matter movement is facing a backlash, with the politics of "white grievance" gaining prominence. The bold yellow letters of Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, D.C., have been paved over, and the Justice Department has abandoned oversight agreements for police forces accused of racial bias. Despite this retrenchment, historians note that change is never fully rolled back, and Black activism remains a vital part of American democracy. President Trump's policies, however, reflect a belief that "anti-white" discrimination has tilted society in favor of African Americans.</p>

Emotionally safe parents take responsibility after conflicts, create an environment where children feel safe expressing emotions, and lead with calm, steady authority. This style involves parents doing their own inner work to become less reactive and more attuned to their children's emotional needs, fostering trust and connection.</p>

          <p>South Korea faces a critical juncture as it approaches presidential elections, needing strong leadership to restore domestic stability and navigate complex geopolitical challenges following former president Yoon Suk-yeol's impeachment. Society remains divided, and the ruling People Power Party (PPP) has struggled to find a stable candidate. Opposition Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung is leading in polls, having shifted towards the center. Economic concerns dominate voters' minds, but foreign policy remains crucial, requiring a delicate balancing act to ensure national security and long-term stability.</p>

          <p>President Trump and his family have monetized the White House to an unprecedented degree, normalizing activities that once would have provoked heavy blowback and official investigations. Examples include Melania Trump's promotional film deal, the Trump family's cryptocurrency ventures, and the acceptance of a luxury jet from Qatar. While critics raise concerns about conflicts of interest, the lack of official investigations and the normalization of such practices have muted public outrage.
