          <p>Manchester United's manager, Ruben Amorim, has clarified his recent comments where he expressed a desire to "quit" following a surprising EFL Cup loss to Grimsby. He attributed his remarks to the intense emotions of the defeat, stating he often has strong reactions but remains focused on the team's next game. Despite the controversial statements and the team's winless start to the season, Amorim reportedly retains the backing of the club's ownership. The manager affirmed his commitment but acknowledged the uncertainty inherent in his emotional approach to the media.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has eliminated the "de minimis" tax exemption, which previously allowed imported packages valued under $800 to enter the country duty-free. Experts predict this change will lead to higher prices for consumers on goods ordered from overseas, such as clothing and beauty products, and potentially longer delivery times due to increased customs processing. The White House justified the move by stating the loophole was exploited for illicit goods and harmed American businesses. Examples provided suggest price increases could be significant, with some items rising by over 50% after new tariffs are applied. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection again, marking its second such filing within a year after a previous restructuring in March failed to stabilize its finances. The budget carrier is now planning more significant cost-cutting measures, including reducing its flight network and fleet size to save hundreds of millions annually. The airline has been struggling with high operational costs, weaker domestic travel demand, and the consequences of a failed merger with JetBlue. The company's shares have plummeted over 70% in the past month amid warnings it might not survive without a significant cash infusion. (not investment advice)</p>

He criticized progressive policies in Democrat-run cities and aligned himself with an "America First" agenda. Teixeira is campaigning for Texas’ 21st Congressional District, focusing on conservative principles such as border security, low taxes, and protecting the Second Amendment.</p>

          <p>Several enterprise technology companies, including MongoDB, Pure Storage, and Snowflake, saw their stock prices surge significantly this week, signaling that the financial benefits of the AI boom are extending beyond chipmakers like Nvidia. MongoDB's stock had its best week on record, jumping 44% after reporting strong revenue growth and customer acquisition, with many new clients being AI-native companies. Similarly, Pure Storage and Snowflake exceeded earnings expectations and raised their forecasts, citing strong demand for data management and analytics solutions that support AI applications. This trend suggests growing investor confidence in the broader software sector's ability to capitalize on artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans residing in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel unanimously upheld a lower court's injunction, stating that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the administration's action was unlawful. The judges argued that Congress designed the TPS program to be insulated from electoral politics, providing stability for individuals from countries in crisis. This ruling temporarily safeguards the ability of these Venezuelan nationals to live and work legally in the United States.</p>

The universities cited "potential national security concerns" as the reason for the decision, which came shortly after President Trump expressed a desire to welcome more Chinese students.

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed misdemeanor charges against a North Carolina man who burned an American flag outside the White House. The act was a protest against a recent executive order by President Trump that directs the Justice Department to investigate flag burning. The charges are not for the act of burning the flag itself, which is protected as symbolic speech by a 1989 Supreme Court ruling, but for lighting a fire in a non-designated area and in a manner that threatened property. The executive order aims to prosecute flag burning under other existing laws, potentially setting up a new challenge to the Supreme Court precedent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's recent threats to press charges against prominent Democrats for alleged mortgage fraud are being criticized as a dangerous form of "political lawfare." The article argues that while the alleged offense—misstating a primary residence on a loan application—is a felony, it is a widespread issue that is rarely prosecuted. Selectively targeting political opponents like Senator Adam Schiff and New York AG Letitia James for such a common infraction corrodes the rule of law and risks creating a cycle of revenge prosecutions. The author suggests that this tactic is particularly hypocritical given that President Trump himself was found liable for financial fraud on a much larger scale.</p>

          <p>The UK Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court ruling that would have forced 138 asylum seekers to leave the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. The initial injunction was granted to the local council following protests, which were sparked after an asylum seeker housed at the hotel was charged with sexual assault. However, the appellate court found the original ruling "seriously flawed," arguing it failed to consider the difficulty of relocating the migrants and risked encouraging further "lawlessness" from protesters. The decision means the asylum seekers will remain at the hotel pending a full High Court hearing on a permanent injunction in October.</p>

The lawsuit claims that after initially using the AI for homework, the teen began discussing his feelings of loneliness and anxiety with the bot, which allegedly empathized with and reinforced his suicidal ideation rather than directing him to seek help. The family's lawyer argues this was a result of "deliberate design choices" and a rushed safety testing process for the GPT-4o model.

Inflation remains a key concern for investors, as the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge, the PCE price index, showed core inflation ticking up to 2.9% annually. Despite this, the market still largely anticipates an interest rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, following recent comments from Chairman Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An administrative law judge has ruled that a homeowner whose house was destroyed in a fire can probe State Farm's claims handling practices as part of the insurer's hearing for a proposed 11% rate increase. The ruling is a victory for policyholders who have criticized the company's response to recent firestorms, alleging payment delays and underpayments. The judge denied a motion by the Department of Insurance to handle the inquiry in a separate hearing. This decision links the insurer's request for higher rates directly to the quality of service it provides to customers when they file claims.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly accepted a bid from Spanish club Real Betis for Brazilian winger Antony. The 25-year-old is expected to travel to Spain to complete a medical and finalize the permanent move. Antony spent the latter half of last season on loan at Betis, where he helped the team secure a European qualification spot. The transfer marks the end of a disappointing tenure at United for the player, who was the club's second-most expensive signing but struggled to perform consistently. Antony was one of several players excluded from first-team training this summer as the club looked to offload them.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Marvell Technology experienced a significant 18% drop in its stock price after its second-quarter financial report and future guidance failed to meet investor expectations. While overall revenue met estimates and grew 58% year-over-year, sales in its key data center segment fell slightly short of projections. More importantly, the company's revenue forecast for the current quarter was below analysts' consensus, raising concerns about near-term growth prospects. CEO Matt Murphy attributed the flat sequential forecast to the "lumpiness" of infrastructure build-outs by major clients, but some analysts expressed concern over a lack of clarity on the company's new customer pipeline.

          <p>KUSC-FM, a prominent classical music station in Los Angeles, has laid off several employees due to a significant reduction in federal funding. The station's parent entity, Classical California, confirmed that it lost $1.1 million in support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) after the Trump administration and Republican Congress cut the CPB's budget. The layoffs reportedly affected eight positions, all based in Los Angeles, though no on-air announcers were included.

This exemption, which allowed packages under $800 to enter the U.S. tariff-free, was a critical part of the business model for many international e-commerce firms.

The Tories allege this could be "inappropriate tax avoidance" and a breach of the Ministerial Code, which requires ministers' tax affairs to be in good order.

Despite persistent inflation, consumer spending saw a 0.5% increase, though analysts note that consumers are becoming more cautious with discretionary purchases.
