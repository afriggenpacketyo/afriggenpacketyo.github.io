            <p>Tyler Glasnow, the Dodgers' starting pitcher, experienced lower leg cramping during the fourth inning of Sunday's game against the Texas Rangers and had to leave the game in the fifth. Despite the Dodgers securing a 1-0 victory, Glasnow's injury raises concerns given his history of physical issues, including a late-season elbow injury last year. The team is already dealing with injuries to other key players like Blake Snell and Blake Treinen, making Glasnow's health crucial for their season. The severity of his cramping is still being assessed by team doctors, but initial indications suggest it is not a serious ailment. Optimism score: 60</p>
