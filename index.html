        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The third day of the Test match between England and India concluded with heated exchanges over alleged time-wasting tactics. England's Zak Crawley deliberately delayed play to ensure he would only face one over before the close, prompting angry reactions from Indian players, including captain Shubman Gill. England's bowling coach, Tim Southee, defended the strategy, pointing out that India had employed similar delays earlier in the match, such as when Gill received a lengthy massage on the field. The incident adds a layer of drama to the tightly contested series at Lord's.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old Palestinian-American from Tampa, Florida, was reportedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers while visiting family in the occupied West Bank. His family alleges that Saifullah Musallet was protecting his land when he was attacked, and that an ambulance was blocked from reaching him for hours, leading to his death. A second Palestinian man was also fatally shot during the confrontation. The U.S. State Department has confirmed the death of a citizen and is providing consular assistance, while the family calls for a direct U.S. investigation into the killing.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has launched a public defense of its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation project in response to escalating attacks from the Trump administration. Using a new "Frequently Asked Questions" page, the central bank refutes claims of extravagance, such as the construction of new VIP dining rooms, made by officials like OMB Director Russell Vought. The Fed clarifies that cost increases are due to unforeseen issues like asbestos and design changes, and emphasizes that the project is self-funded, not paid for by taxpayers. This move signals the central bank's readiness to counter political pressure regarding its operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has terminated the employment of at least 20 Justice Department prosecutors and support staff members who were involved in former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Donald Trump. According to sources, the firings targeted individuals identified by a "weaponization working group" and included support personnel who may have had minor roles in the probes. This action follows the earlier removal of most senior prosecutors associated with the investigations. The move has reportedly created a climate of fear among the department's career employees, reminiscent of previous purges.</p>

          <p>Police in the United Kingdom have arrested 71 people at demonstrations protesting the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The arrests, primarily for showing support for a banned group, occurred in London, Cardiff, and Manchester. The proscription makes membership or support for Palestine Action, an activist group known for targeting arms companies, a criminal offense. The government cited the group's escalating criminal damage activities as the reason for the ban, while critics argue it is a misuse of anti-terror legislation and an authoritarian abuse of power.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's announcement of significant new tariffs on major trading partners like the EU and Mexico, the U.S. stock market has shown notable stability, avoiding the panic seen in previous trade disputes. Analysts suggest investors have become more accustomed to the administration's negotiation tactics, choosing to focus on underlying economic drivers like corporate earnings and the growth of artificial intelligence. This market resilience is also attributed to a favorable deregulation environment, which is expected to boost M&A and IPO activities, outweighing the immediate concerns over the tariff rhetoric.

          <p>The United Kingdom is sweltering through its third major heatwave of the year, with temperatures peaking at 33°C (91.4°F) in Ross on Wye. The heat is widespread, with Scotland recording its warmest day of the year and Northern Ireland its hottest in nearly three years. The conditions have led to the implementation of hosepipe bans for millions in England and severe wildfire warnings in Scotland. The heat has also disrupted travel and sporting events, with amber heat health alerts in effect for southern England, signifying a likely increase in mortality and strain on health services.</p>

          <p>Two fathers in England are initiating a legal challenge against the government in an effort to ban smartphones from schools. The campaigners, Will Orr-Ewing and Pete Montgomery, argue that the current government guidance, which allows headteachers to set their own policies, is unlawful and fails to protect children from harm. They cite concerns over access to violent and sexual content, cyberbullying, and manipulation by online predators. The fathers have sent a formal letter to the Education Secretary, threatening a judicial review if a statutory ban is not implemented to ensure a safer learning environment.</p>

          <p>The New Hollywood String Quartet is celebrating its 25th anniversary with a summer festival dedicated to the original Hollywood String Quartet of the 1940s and 50s. The original ensemble, founded by top film studio musicians, broke ground by bridging the worlds of classical music and Hollywood film scores. The festival's concerts, introduced by celebrated conductor Leonard Slatkin, son of the original founders, feature repertory from the earlier group's classic recordings. The event celebrates a rich legacy of genre-busting musicianship that continues to thrive in Los Angeles's vibrant music scene today.</p>

          <p>The preliminary investigation into the fatal Air India Flight 171 crash has revealed that both engine fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position seconds after takeoff, causing a total loss of power. Cockpit audio captured one pilot asking the other why he had cut the fuel, with the other denying he had done so, leaving investigators to determine if the act was intentional, accidental, or the result of a mechanical malfunction. The report notes the switches are designed to prevent accidental activation, making their simultaneous shutdown highly unusual. The aircraft crashed less than a minute after becoming airborne, killing all 260 people on board.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Travis County, Texas, have ordered the complete closure of Lake Travis to all recreational, commercial, and navigational activities. The ban, issued by County Judge Andy Brown, is a public safety measure in response to ongoing hazards from severe flash flooding that occurred over the July 4th weekend. The Lower Colorado River Authority had previously advised the public to avoid the lake due to dangerous debris, high bacteria levels, and fast-flowing currents. The closure will remain in effect until the hazardous conditions subside, with access limited to emergency and official government use.</p>

          <p>A collectibles shop in New Bedford, Massachusetts, was robbed of more than $113,000 worth of rare Pokémon cards during an early morning break-in. The thief, who was captured on surveillance footage, appeared to know exactly which high-value items to target, including several professionally graded vintage cards. Among the stolen items was a Skyridge Crystal Charizard, considered a 'crown jewel' by collectors. The store's owners noted that each graded card has a unique serial number, which they hope will help in tracking and recovering the stolen property as they appeal to the community for assistance.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched a massive wave of attacks across Ukraine, firing hundreds of drones and cruise missiles in an intensified bombing campaign that has killed at least six people and injured dozens. The overnight strikes targeted multiple regions, including Chernivtsi and Lviv in the west, which is a key hub for foreign military aid. Ukrainian officials reported that while their air defenses intercepted a significant number of the projectiles, falling debris caused casualties and damage. The long-range attacks coincide with a renewed Russian push along the front line, where Ukrainian forces are under severe pressure.</p>

          <p>Hartford Bakery, Inc. has issued a voluntary recall for hundreds of loaves of its "Lewis Bake Shop Artisan Style 1/2 Loaf" because the product may contain undeclared hazelnuts.

The affected bread was distributed to retailers like Kroger and Walmart across 12 states. While no major injuries have been reported, the company initiated the recall after a customer experienced digestive discomfort and others saw nuts in the product.
