        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A family who sought legal recourse to protect their daughter from her father, a convicted child sex offender, has voiced concerns over new government legislation. The Victims and Courts Bill aims to remove parental responsibility from convicted pedophiles, but only if they have abused their own children. The family spent over Â£30,000 in legal fees to achieve this protection prior to the bill. Critics argue the amendment doesn't go far enough to protect all children in similar situations, expressing disappointment that it isn't more comprehensive.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to a two-year low of 3.85% as inflation concerns continue to diminish. This decision aligns with economists' expectations, prompted by a downtrend in Australia's inflation, which recently hit a four-year low of 2.4%. While the RBA aims to keep inflation within its 2-3% target range, it also acknowledges uncertainties in the economic outlook. Despite a recent economic turnaround, analysts highlight downside risks due to global trade tensions and domestic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>In-N-Out Burger is changing its menu after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the FDA's intent to phase out petroleum-based synthetic dyes. The burger chain will modify its strawberry shake and pink lemonade recipes to remove red dye No. 40, replacing it with beta carotene and vegetable juice. Additionally, In-N-Out will switch from high fructose corn syrup to real sugar in its ketchup. The move aligns with the Trump administration's goal to eliminate synthetic dyes from the food supply by the end of next year, addressing concerns about neurological problems in children.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Rep. LaMonica McIver has been charged with assaulting law enforcement officers outside of an ICE detention facility. Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba announced the charges, alleging McIver assaulted and impeded a law enforcement officer. The incident occurred during a protest with other members of Congress and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. McIver denies the charges, claiming they are politically motivated, while Mayor Baraka's charges were dropped. Top House Democrats are defending McIver, vowing to respond to what they call an abuse of power.</p>
