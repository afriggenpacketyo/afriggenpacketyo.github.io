          <p>A Gaza pediatrician and mother of ten lost nine of her children after an Israeli airstrike hit their home near Khan Younis, according to hospital officials. The woman's husband, also a doctor, was severely wounded and is in intensive care, while their only surviving child was also injured. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that its aircraft struck suspects operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops and that the claim of harm to uninvolved civilians is under review. This tragedy highlights the dire circumstances faced by medical staff and families in Gaza amidst ongoing conflict and limited humanitarian aid, as looting of aid trucks exacerbates the crisis.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing an increasing threat of cyberattacks on state agencies, hospitals, and critical infrastructure, prompting discussions on how to improve digital security. Recent incidents, such as the DDoS attack in Bremen and the Anhalt-Bitterfeld administration shutdown, highlight the country's vulnerability. Experts emphasize the need for greater investment in digital security, particularly for smaller companies and state authorities, and closer cooperation between the state and businesses. The use of AI by both attackers and defenders is also a growing trend, requiring continuous improvement in cybersecurity strategies.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults in Europe are seeking to reduce their smartphone usage and reconnect with the real world, as evidenced by a British survey indicating that almost half would prefer a life without the internet. The Offline Club, a Dutch startup, organizes offline meetups where smartphones are prohibited, offering activities like reading, games, and arts and crafts. Studies suggest that excessive smartphone use is associated with mental health problems, prompting political measures such as potential digital curfews and raising the age limit for social media use. These initiatives reflect a broader trend of recognizing the harmful effects of smartphone overuse and promoting healthier digital habits.</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian drone and missile attacks have resulted in the deaths of at least eight people and injuries to more than 30 across Ukraine, according to regional officials. The Khmelnytskyi region reported four deaths, while the Kyiv region saw three, and Mykolaiv reported one. This comes after Kyiv experienced one of the heaviest assaults since the beginning of the Russian invasion. Russia's defense ministry claimed its air defense units intercepted 95 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions during a four-hour period on Saturday night, with no reported casualties.</p>

Additionally, the investigation into arson attacks linked to properties associated with Sir Keir Starmer is exploring potential Kremlin involvement.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts indicated that Shohei Ohtani is likely to return to the mound after the All-Star break. Ohtani is scheduled to face batters for the first time since undergoing elbow surgery in September 2023. While the Dodgers initially considered an earlier return, they prioritized his hitting during spring training and slowed down his pitching rehabilitation. The plan is to gradually build Ohtani up to five or six innings, making a pre-All-Star break return unlikely.</p>

The move seeks to end 30 years of fragmentation and save up to £150 million in compensation fees to rail operators.

          <p>Yosemite National Park's eastern entrance, Tioga Road, will reopen on Memorial Day, following its seasonal closure due to ice and snow. The reopening, earlier than in previous years, will allow visitors access to the scenic Highway 120. However, visitors entering between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. will need a reservation, and the park may face staffing shortages due to cuts at the National Park Service. Park officials are urging visitors to be patient and courteous to staff while enjoying the park.</p>

          <p>A new study finds that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may be passing anxiety on to their pets. The research shows that when owners dwell on work problems after hours, their dogs exhibit more signs of stress. The study suggests that emotional contagion and changes in care routines contribute to this phenomenon. The authors suggest that employed dog owners might benefit from avoiding work-related ruminations when at home to protect the well-being of their canine companions.</p>

Two terraced three-storey homes were gutted in the fire. Another woman in her 70s and a teenage girl, both from the same family as the four people who died, were taken to hospital.</p>

          <p>Chinese military scientists have revealed a technological breakthrough in electromagnetic coilgun technology, resulting in a weapon capable of firing at 3,000 rounds per minute. This rate significantly surpasses traditional firearms and US commercial models. The breakthrough centers on eliminating capacitors, which have been a limiting factor in previous coilgun designs, by directly powering the weapon with lithium batteries. The weapon is shown to be capable of shattering car windows and demolishing door panels in seconds.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is drafting a plan to eliminate all limits on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States. The agency argues that carbon emissions from these plants do not significantly contribute to climate change, a claim disputed by scientists. This proposal is part of a broader effort to uproot policies aimed at curbing climate change, potentially blocking future administrations from regulating carbon dioxide emissions and unraveling other climate regulations. The EPA's administrator said deregulation would drive “a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.”</p>
