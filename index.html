          <p>Athletic shoe company On is being sued by customers who allege that its popular CloudTec sneakers produce a "noisy and embarrassing squeak" with each step. The lawsuit claims the design, intended to provide a "running on clouds" sensation, instead causes problems in daily life, especially for nurses. Customers say the squeaking issues are widespread and that the company has not offered fixes or refunds, leading to accusations of deceptive marketing. The plaintiffs are seeking refunds and damages, referencing social media posts suggesting at-home remedies like coconut oil. The company has not commented on the allegations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by U.S. PIRG Education Fund reveals that Americans are receiving an average of 2.56 billion robocalls per month, marking the highest level in six years. The increase comes despite the TRACED Act and FCC efforts to combat robocalls, with less than half of phone companies fully implementing robocall-fighting software. Scammers are increasingly using AI to send fraudulent texts and clone voices, leading to significant financial losses for victims. The report details common scams, such as impersonating the IRS or banks, and package delivery scams, emphasizing the need for stronger regulations and consumer awareness. The amount of money lost to phone scams rose 16% from the first half of 2024 to the first half of 2025.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has announced he will no longer use his royal titles, including the Duke of York, due to continued accusations related to Jeffrey Epstein. This decision follows the release of excerpts from Virginia Roberts Giuffre's posthumous memoir, detailing her allegations of sexual assault against Andrew when she was a minor. Prince Andrew maintains his denial of the accusations but acknowledges that they are distracting from the work of the King and the Royal Family. As a result, Andrew will also give up other titles, such as Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, though he will remain a prince.</p>

Trading independently on October 30, Solstice is a specialty chemicals business with nearly $4 billion in sales and almost $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA. The company sells a diversified range of products including refrigerants, building solutions, electronic materials, and healthcare packaging. This is the first step in Honeywell's multi-stage breakup plan, with further separations of its automation and aerospace businesses planned for 2026, a move initially pushed by Elliott Management.</p>

          <p>A senior at Neshaminy High School in Pennsylvania, Ryan Duffy, died from Streptococcus Pneumoniae Meningitis, prompting enhanced cleaning protocols at the school. The school district emphasized that this type of meningitis is not typically contagious in a school setting. Symptoms of bacterial meningitis include severe headaches, high fevers, and a stiff neck, and the CDC recommends vaccination as the best way to prevent the disease. The community is mourning Duffy's death, highlighting the continued threat of diseases that have been around for years.</p>

          <p>At a "Play the Game" conference, Joanna Marie Harper, a transgender professor, opposed the creation of an open category for transgender athletes. Harper argues that such a category would primarily consist of cisgender males, leading trans women to quit their sports. Harper claims that hormone therapy can negate athletic advantages for trans women in many sports, citing her own experiences. She suggests that trans women may have advantages in some sports like sprinting but disadvantages in others like distance running. Twenty-nine states currently have restrictions on transgender athletes competing in girls' and women's sports.</p>

          <p>Seven skeletons discovered in a well in Croatia have been identified as Roman soldiers from 1,700 years ago. The remains were found in the ancient city of Mursa and are believed to be from soldiers who died in a battle or skirmish around 260 C.E. The skeletons showed signs of blunt-force injuries and puncture wounds, indicating they likely died in combat. Isotope analyses revealed the soldiers ate a diet of grains and vegetables with little meat, and DNA analysis suggested they were not local to the area.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump said he would consider a Russian proposal for Elon Musk and the Boring Company to build an undersea rail tunnel through the Bering Strait. The proposal, suggested by Kirill Dmitriev, would be partly funded by Moscow and would symbolize unity. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his disapproval of the idea following Trump's response. Construction of the tunnel would require working through below-freezing temperatures in a region without existing infrastructure and with deep earthquakes.</p>

          <p>In today's economic landscape, fixed annuities offer the strongest combination of safety and stability for investors and retirees. Unlike variable or indexed annuities, fixed annuities guarantee a specific interest rate for a predetermined period, shielding investors from market downturns. Multi-year guaranteed annuities (MYGAs) lock in rates for the entire contract term, while single premium immediate annuities (SPIAs) provide lifetime income guarantees. The right annuity option depends on individual goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nearly 100 stolen ballots for the Proposition 50 special election were found scattered throughout a homeless encampment in Sacramento County. The ballots, which would decide the fate of a congressional redistricting measure, were likely stolen from mailboxes. County officials have voided the stolen ballots and mailed new ones to affected residents, and an investigation is underway. The measure would change congressional district boundaries and likely shift five more seats to Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>Democrats' lack of trust in President Donald Trump is a major obstacle to negotiations aimed at ending the government shutdown. Bipartisan coalitions have been absent due to concerns that Trump could undermine any agreement reached with Republican lawmakers. Democrats are wary of making deals that Trump could later reject, citing past instances where bipartisan proposals collapsed after Trump's opposition. Some Democrats are calling for Trump to participate directly in negotiations to find a resolution to the shutdown.</p>
