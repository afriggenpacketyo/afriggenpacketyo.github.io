          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to expand its nationwide immigration crackdown into the San Francisco area, with Border Patrol agents expected to deploy as early as this week. Anonymous U.S. officials familiar with the internal plans indicated agents might stage at the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, approximately 15 miles from San Francisco. This initiative is expected to involve Gregory Bovino, a prominent figure in the administration's immigration enforcement. California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has vehemently criticized these plans, accusing President Trump of deliberately creating "conditions for anxiety" and fear in American cities by deploying federal agents. This action is part of the administration's broader, aggressive expansion of deportation efforts, targeting major Democratic-led cities across the country, often far from a U.S. border, utilizing Border Patrol's expanded search powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool secured a decisive 5-1 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League, despite ongoing defensive vulnerabilities and a new tactical approach from manager Arne Slot. Slot made bold calls, benching talismanic Mohamed Salah and experimenting with a 4-4-2 shape out of possession, starting British record signing Alexander Isak alongside Huge Ekitike for the first time. This partnership showed promise before Isak suffered a groin injury at half-time, raising concerns about his recovery. The team's high-pressing football was particularly effective in the second half, with five different players contributing goals. This emphatic win, though marred by Isak's injury, offers a potential glimpse into Liverpool's future strategies and squad depth, especially with the upcoming Afcon tournament impacting Salah's availability and form.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An 82-year-old Alaskan bush pilot, Kenneth Jouppi, is seeking U.S. Supreme Court intervention after his $95,000 Cessna U206D aircraft was forfeited due to three cases of beer found in a passenger's luggage in 2012. Jouppi, an Air Force veteran, was convicted of knowingly transporting alcohol into a dry village, fined $1,500, and served three days in jail, the statutory minimum penalty. Despite lower courts initially finding the plane's confiscation excessive, the Alaska Supreme Court reversed this decision in 2024, ruling it was not grossly disproportionate. With the Institute for Justice's support, Jouppi is appealing, arguing the forfeiture violates the Constitution's protection against excessive fines and aims to safeguard Americans from such penalties.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur managed to secure a Champions League point against Monaco, drawing 0-0, despite a largely dismal and unambitious performance. The team was heavily reliant on the exceptional goalkeeping of Guglielmo Vicario, who delivered a magnificent display with multiple crucial saves from players like Folarin Balogun and Maghnes Akliouche. Monaco, despite creating numerous clear-cut chances, failed to convert them, with former Liverpool midfielder Takumi Minamino notably wasting several late opportunities.

          <p>North Carolina's Republican-led legislature has passed a new congressional map, approved by both the state House and Senate, designed to enhance the GOP's prospects of retaining control of the U.S. House in next year's midterms. The map specifically targets the Democratic-held 1st Congressional District, currently represented by Rep. Don Davis, by redrawing its boundaries to be more favorable to conservatives. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries vehemently criticized the move as "morally corrupt" and an attempt to "dilute the voting power of Black voters," promising immediate legal challenges. This redistricting effort in North Carolina is part of a broader national strategy by Republican leaders, influenced by President Trump, to alter state maps and flip Democratic districts, as seen in Texas and Missouri.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported a 12% increase in third-quarter revenue to $28.10 billion, ending two consecutive quarters of decline and exceeding analyst estimates. However, the company's adjusted earnings per share of 50 cents missed the estimated 54 cents, leading to a nearly 5% drop in stock value in extended trading. The profit decrease was attributed to lower EV prices and a 50% surge in operating expenses, partly due to artificial intelligence and other R&D projects. CEO Elon Musk provided minimal guidance on the earnings call, focusing instead on grand futuristic visions for Cybercab, Semi trucks, and Optimus robots. The slow progress of the Full Self Driving system and a continuing sales slump in Europe, partly due to consumer backlash against Musk, remained significant concerns for investors.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to demolish the entire East Wing of the White House as early as this weekend to construct a new ballroom, with the project's cost escalating to $300 million, to be funded entirely by private donors. This decision marks a significant expansion from earlier statements that the ballroom addition "won't interfere with the current building." Administration officials cited the need for modernization to enhance security and technology, stating that full demolition became apparent as the best option during planning. Historic preservation groups, such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation, have voiced strong opposition, urging a public review process for the massive addition, arguing it "will overwhelm the White House itself" and desecrate American heritage.</p>

His unexpected passing has ignited widespread outrage among top players, with world No. 2 Hikaru Nakamura and five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen condemning Kramnik's "horrible" conduct. The Fide CEO, Emil Sutovsky, has acknowledged Kramnik's behavior as "appalling and outright shameful," while the incident itself lays bare deep fissures in online chess regarding unchecked cheating accusations and the devastating impact of cyber-bullying on players.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated these companies fund the Kremlin's "war machine" and urged international allies to join and adhere to these sanctions, emphasizing the need for an immediate ceasefire. Trump explained the timing by saying he "felt it was time" after months of threats and delays, and that he canceled a planned second summit with Putin because it "didn't feel right" to him, though he maintained belief in Putin's desire for peace.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proceeding with the demolition of the White House East Wing to build a privately funded ballroom, a project initially claimed not to interfere with the existing structure. This extensive demolition is occurring without review or approval from the usual commissions involved in changes to the White House, raising significant concerns about transparency and due process. Critics highlight this as a destruction of a key piece of American history for a personal project, done without public input, following other controversial modifications like paving the Rose Garden. The article frames this as another example of the Trump administration's governing style, exploiting the asymmetry where destruction is far easier and more permanent than restoration, regardless of future legal or public opinion.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has entered its 22nd day, becoming the second-longest federal funding lapse in history, with no immediate resolution in sight. This marks the second time a government shutdown of significant duration has occurred during President Donald Trump's tenure, with the longest having lasted nearly five weeks in 2018. The current impasse stems from Senate Democrats' repeated refusal to pass a Republican-backed short-term funding bill, demanding the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, which are set to expire. Republicans accuse Democrats of holding the government hostage and refuse to negotiate on healthcare until the shutdown ends, while Democrats call for President Trump to personally engage in negotiations to resolve the deadlock.</p>

The Maverick-2 is designed to speed up high-precision scientific computing tasks, a niche where NextSilicon seeks to capitalize as Nvidia shifts its focus towards lower-precision artificial intelligence tasks.

          <p>The U.S. gross national debt has surpassed $38 trillion for the first time, marking a rapid accumulation, with $1 trillion added in just two months, twice the rate of growth since 2000. This milestone coincides with an ongoing government shutdown, which is further exacerbating the debt by delaying economic activity and increasing costs associated with restarting federal programs, with a previous shutdown costing billions. Experts from the Peter G. Peterson Foundation and J.P. Morgan Asset Management warn that mounting debt leads to higher interest costs for the government, potentially undermining investor confidence and curtailing public and private spending in key economic sectors. Credit rating agency Moody's and others have already downgraded the U.S. rating, reflecting serious concerns about the government's fiscal duties and the nation's financial future.</p>

Trump defended the transparency of the works, arguing the East Wing, constructed in 1902 and last modified in 1942, had undergone many changes historically and was "never thought of as being much." The move has drawn criticism from historic preservation groups, who called for a public review process, and Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, who stated the White House is "not Trump's house, and he's destroying it."</p>

Around 100 federal agents, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection members, are reportedly en route to the U.S. Coast Guard’s Alameda base.

Documents seen by BBC News confirmed Andrew has only paid a token annual rent, making large lump sum payments upfront, including for renovations, totaling about £8m for a 75-year lease. Critics, including Baroness Margaret Hodge, describe the arrangement as a "rotten deal" that undermines the Crown Estate's duty to maximize taxpayer income, highlighting the pervasive lack of transparency surrounding royal finances.</p>

          <p>The "Age of the Group Chat" is increasingly exposing MAGA-affiliated politicians and officials to public scrutiny and political peril, as evidenced by recent leaks of private communications. Incidents include a Trump nominee withdrawing after racist and offensive texts surfaced, Young Republican officials making inappropriate comments, and an interim U.S. attorney discussing grand-jury matters. These leaks highlight a fundamental foolishness about what one puts in writing and a hubris regarding the reliability of communications systems, even encrypted ones like Signal, which was used by Defense officials to discuss highly sensitive information. The article suggests that group chats can foster an environment where bigotry is amplified, combined with immaturity and incompetence among less-experienced officials, leading to repeated fiascos with seemingly few major consequences for those involved.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military conducted its eighth strike on an alleged drug vessel since September 2, this time in international waters off Colombia on the Pacific side, resulting in the deaths of two individuals aboard. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth confirmed the strike, stating it was directed by President Trump against a vessel operated by a "designated terrorist organization" involved in narco-trafficking along a known transit route. Democratic Senator Mark Kelly questioned the legal rationale and constitutionality of these strikes, noting that fentanyl, a primary concern for the U.S., typically arrives via different routes, and that Congress has not been provided a secret list of targeted organizations. Previous strikes have killed at least 34 people, with the administration asserting a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels.</p>

          <p>Meta is laying off approximately 600 employees from its artificial intelligence unit, a move confirmed by chief AI officer Alexandr Wang, who aims to reduce layers and operate more nimbly. The cuts impact various AI infrastructure units, including Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) and product-related positions, but spared employees within TBD Labs, Wang's top-tier AI hires. This restructuring underscores CEO Mark Zuckerberg's bet on new, expensive hires over legacy employees, as Meta aggressively overhauls its AI strategy to compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google. The AI unit was considered "bloated," with teams often vying for computing resources, making these layoffs an attempt to trim the department and consolidate Wang's leadership.</p>

He cited a "highly charged and toxic environment" created by political "point-scoring" and a lack of confidence from some survivors due to his policing background. His decision follows the resignation of four survivor panelists who demanded the Safeguarding Minister's removal and a focus strictly on grooming gangs, not broader child sexual exploitation. Gamble expressed concern that the inquiry, intended as a generational opportunity for survivors, was being undermined by adversarial approaches and misinformation. He emphasized the need for a chair trusted by victims and criticized the political debate for obscuring the inquiry's crucial purpose, urging all parties to prioritize survivors' needs.</p>

          <p>China's new export controls on rare earth-related items, justified by national security and non-proliferation obligations, mark a significant shift in global economic statecraft. These measures directly target the military supply chain, aiming to deny foreign militaries access to critical materials essential for advanced technologies like high-performance magnets in the F-35 fighter jet and radar systems. The article highlights the U.S.'s profound dependency on China for about 70% of its rare earth imports and processing, creating a strategic challenge that the U.S. and its allies cannot easily accept. While China attempts to project its regulatory power beyond its borders, it faces a steep learning curve in effectively enforcing these controls, and their success will determine China's credibility in wielding such powerful economic tools.</p>

He accused Trump of attempting to provoke violence and strengthen an "authoritarian grip" on the nation, while praising Portlanders for their peaceful demonstrations of "joy and whimsy."

This discussion occurs amidst ongoing debates in U.S. policy circles about whether the nation should borrow from China’s playbook as bilateral competition intensifies, with China making big bets on advanced manufacturing and future industries like AI and biotech. Raimondo specifically highlighted that the U.S. lacks a competitive advantage in certain areas, such as making car seats for babies.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has launched ChatGPT Atlas, an AI-powered web browser, prompting questions about its core mission to "benefit all of humanity" and "cure cancer." CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as a "once-a-decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be," integrating ChatGPT for seamless web surfing, utilizing "browser memories," and offering an "agent" mode for task automation. However, critics note the browser largely mimics existing functionalities, serving primarily to embed ChatGPT deeper into users' lives and collect more data. This commercial pivot, including new apps, erotica features, and e-commerce integrations, appears driven by the immense, currently unprofitable, computational costs of developing advanced AI models, with the company facing billions in projected losses by 2029, necessitating new revenue streams.</p>

          <p>New research published in Neurology Open Access suggests a significant link between gum disease and an increased risk of stroke and brain damage. One study found adults with gum disease are more likely to show signs of damage to the brain's white matter than those without, associating inflammation from gum disease with atherosclerosis and hardening of small blood vessels. Another study revealed that having both gum disease and cavities is linked to an 86% increased risk of stroke compared to people with healthy mouths. Crucially, the research also found that diligent oral hygiene, including brushing, flossing, and regular dentist visits for preventative cleaning, can reduce stroke risk by as much as 81%, emphasizing the profound impact of oral health on cardiovascular well-being.</p>

Despite the dramatic rally, which saw shares briefly exceed $7 before closing down 1% at $3.60, the company has struggled with sluggish sales and has not posted a quarterly profit in over five years. Analysts caution that the surge is driven by emotions and technicals rather than fundamentals, amidst broader market jitters about an overvalued stock market and a potential AI bubble.</p>
