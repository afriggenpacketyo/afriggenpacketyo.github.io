          <p>The largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of up to $4 million. The rock was blasted off the Martian surface by an asteroid strike before landing in the Sahara desert. Scientific analysis confirmed its origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking space probe. This rare find represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet and offers significant scientific value.</p>

          <h2>Washington Farmers Use Helicopters to Protect Cherry Crops from Rain</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In central Washington, an unusual agricultural practice has become essential for protecting valuable sweet cherry crops. Farmers in the region hire helicopters to fly low over their orchards immediately after a summer rainfall. The powerful downdraft from the helicopter blades effectively blows the water off the cherries, preventing them from becoming waterlogged and rupturing, which would ruin the fruit. This alliance between aviation and agriculture is a critical, albeit expensive, method for ensuring a successful harvest in one of the nation's prime cherry-growing areas.</p>

          <p>A 15-year-old boy has tragically died after an incident in the River Kelvin in Glasgow, occurring on what was Scotland's hottest day in two years. Emergency services recovered his body late Saturday night, and the death is not being treated as suspicious. The event happened as temperatures soared, with the heatwave also linked to the death of a 63-year-old woman who fell near a waterfall. Authorities have been urging public caution as people flock to outdoor beauty spots to escape the extreme heat.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has announced that the government will introduce measures to make electric vehicles (EVs) cheaper for consumers, aiming to boost adoption rates. While details on specific grants were not confirmed, the plan includes a £25 million allocation to help homeowners without driveways install curbside charging points. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to meet the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. The high upfront cost of EVs remains a significant barrier for many potential buyers.</p>

Despite being the most disaster-prone state, Texas has a history of failing to implement preventative measures, such as an improved flood warning system or coastal barriers. Experts attribute this to the powerful influence of the fossil fuel industry and a prevailing ideology of small government and climate change skepticism among state leaders, which prioritizes post-disaster recovery over proactive resilience.</p>

          <p>A child being treated at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool has died after contracting measles, a highly contagious virus. The hospital has seen a surge in seriously ill children admitted with the illness, treating seventeen patients for measles since June. This tragic death comes as public health officials warn of rising cases across the region, linking the spike to a significant drop in MMR vaccine uptake. Health experts are urging parents to ensure their children are vaccinated, as the disease can lead to severe complications and, in rare cases, death.</p>

          <h2>One Year After Trump Rally Shooting, Scrutiny Falls on Secret Service Failures</h2>

          <p>A year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, analysis points to significant systemic failures within the U.S. Secret Service. The attack, which killed a local fire chief, has prompted multiple investigations that revealed lapses in intelligence, coordination, and resources. Experts trace some of these issues to the agency's post-9/11 restructuring, which expanded its mission without a proportional increase in budget or staffing. In response, the Secret Service has outlined 37 reform measures, but many require congressional action to address long-standing structural problems.</p>

          <p>One year later, the assassination attempt on Donald Trump is seen as a pivotal moment that upended the 2024 U.S. election. Trump's survival and defiant response, raising his fist in the air, galvanized his supporters and was framed as divine intervention, fueling a more zealous political approach. The event stood in stark contrast to President Biden's subsequent withdrawal from the race amid health concerns, a decision that left the Democratic party in disarray. The shooting intensified a culture of political violence and set off a tumultuous political cycle that continues to define the current administration.</p>

          <p>A diplomatic dispute has erupted between China and India regarding the succession plan for the 14th Dalai Lama, potentially straining a recent thaw in relations. The conflict was triggered when a senior Indian minister asserted that only the Dalai Lama's own institution could identify his successor. Beijing responded with a formal protest, insisting that the process must adhere to Chinese law and historical tradition. The exchange highlights the sensitive nature of Tibetan issues in the complex relationship between the two neighboring powers.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Caltech are transforming moon jellyfish into "cyborgs" by embedding them with microelectric controllers to guide their swimming. This innovative project aims to create biohybrid robots that can be dispatched in swarms to collect oceanic data on temperature, pressure, and salinity. Because jellyfish have no central nervous system or pain receptors, they are ideal candidates for this augmentation. The low-cost, scalable nature of this technology could revolutionize ocean research, making it more accessible to smaller labs and conservation groups worldwide.</p>

          <p>With LeBron James entering the final year of his contract with the Lakers, this opinion article suggests he is in a position to control his own retirement narrative. The author draws a parallel to Kobe Bryant, who announced his retirement at the start of his final season, leading to a celebrated farewell tour that allowed fans nationwide to show their appreciation. As the Lakers appear to be building around a different superstar, the article posits that James could follow Bryant's example to orchestrate a graceful and planned exit from the sport, rather than face an uncertain future.</p>

          <p>To address its severe housing crisis, California is creating a new state agency dedicated exclusively to housing and homelessness issues. The move, initiated by Governor Gavin Newsom, splits the former Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency into two separate entities. Supporters believe this reorganization will elevate housing on the state's agenda and bring much-needed coordination to California's fragmented and complex system of affordable housing finance programs. The new agency is seen as a crucial first step toward streamlining efforts to tackle soaring rents and widespread homelessness.</p>

          <p>The job market for recent college graduates in 2025 is proving to be one of the most difficult in recent years, excluding the pandemic era. With many companies, including the federal government and tech firms, cutting jobs or slowing hiring due to economic uncertainty, new graduates are facing fewer opportunities. This competitive environment is forcing many to accept jobs outside their chosen fields or for lower salaries than they had anticipated. Economists note that while the overall unemployment rate is low, the lack of job turnover has created a bottleneck for entry-level positions.</p>

The potential strike threatens to cause significant disruption to England's NHS, while recent polling suggests that public support for the doctors' industrial action has declined.</p>
