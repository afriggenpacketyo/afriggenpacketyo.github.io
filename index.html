          <p>Amazon is set to release its first-quarter earnings, with analysts predicting earnings per share of $1.36 and revenue of $155.04 billion, while also closely monitoring Amazon Web Services and advertising revenue. Investors are particularly interested in how President Trump's tariffs, especially the potential 145% levy on China, might affect Amazon's margins and consumer spending. Amazon has considered displaying tariff-related costs to shoppers but ultimately decided against it, while acknowledging that some third-party sellers may need to pass these costs onto consumers. The article also notes that Amazon's cloud computing business and AI investments will be under scrutiny. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in the Southern District of Texas has permanently barred the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans deemed criminals. Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. ruled that the White House's use of the 18th-century wartime law was illegal, stating that the president's claims about a Venezuelan gang did not constitute an “invasion.” The ruling, while limited to the Southern District of Texas, challenges the White House’s attempts to apply the act to modern immigration policy and could influence other similar cases.</p>

          <p>The April jobs report is expected to provide crucial insights into the U.S. economy, indicating whether it is experiencing a temporary downturn due to tariffs or a more prolonged decline. Economists predict a nonfarm payroll increase of 133,000, a significant drop from March's 228,000. A figure below 100,000 could trigger economic concerns and market instability, while a number around 150,000 may ease anxieties. The report's findings will influence market expectations and economic sentiment.</p>

          <p>Nvidia criticized Anthropic over its defense of U.S. AI chip export restrictions on China, with Nvidia arguing for innovation instead of "tall tales" about smuggling. Anthropic had claimed that Chinese smuggling tactics involved hiding chips in "prosthetic baby bumps" and "packed alongside live lobsters." The "AI Diffusion Rule," set to take effect May 15, imposes global export controls on advanced AI chips and model weights to prevent China from advancing in AI. President Trump is reportedly considering updates to these restrictions, adding uncertainty to the contentious policy.</p>

          <p>Stylist Misa Hylton is suing Mary J. Blige for $5 million, claiming Blige interfered with her business relationship with rapper Vado. Hylton alleges that Blige withheld Vado's album to pressure him to leave Hylton's management company, M.I.S.A., which was entitled to 20% of Vado's income. Hylton's attorney suggests that the lawsuit isn't the cause of their friendship ending, indicating a deeper issue between the two. Speculation arises about the connection to Sean Combs' legal troubles, given Hylton's role as the mother of Combs' son and Blige's early career association with Combs.</p>

          <p>Automakers such as Ford, Hyundai, and Kia reported significant year-over-year U.S. sales increases in April, driven by consumers purchasing new vehicles ahead of potential price hikes due to tariffs. The "tariff fear-buying" began in late March and continued into April, with automakers offering special discounts. However, demand slowed in late April as vehicle inventories tightened and prices increased, signaling that the initial consumer rush may be ending. Economists suggest that higher costs and lower inventories could lead to lower sales in the future.</p>
