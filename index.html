          <p>A federal appeals court has ordered the Trump administration to transfer Rumeysa Ozturk, a detained Tufts Ph.D. student, from a Louisiana detention facility to Vermont. The court rejected the administration's request to pause a lower court's order, citing the need for Ozturk to have access to legal and medical services. Ozturk was arrested after her student visa was revoked, with the Department of Homeland Security claiming she was involved in associations that 'may undermine U.S. foreign policy.' The ACLU, representing Ozturk, expressed gratitude for the decision, asserting that no one should be detained for their political views. This decision allows her challenge to her confinement to proceed more effectively.</p>

While acknowledging Vance as a role model, Bowman emphasizes his focus on Cincinnati's specific needs, highlighting that his job isn't to copy and paste what's going on in the nation, but rather determine what's best for the city.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson has abandoned aggressive proposals to cut Medicaid costs, revealing deep divisions within the Republican party regarding President Trump's domestic agenda. House Republicans ruled out lowering federal payments to states for working-age adults eligible through the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion. The decision underscores the difficulty of finding Medicaid cuts that meet spending targets while securing enough votes to pass. Ultraconservative Republicans voiced opposition, highlighting the challenge of balancing mainstream and right-wing support. The House budget plan aims for $880 billion in cuts from the committee overseeing Medicaid, essential for offsetting tax cuts, but disagreements threaten the entire package.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant delays and cancellations due to air traffic control staffing shortages and equipment malfunctions.

Trump initially imposed a 20% 'reciprocal' tariff on all goods coming from the EU but on April 9 paused the measures for 90 days for negotiations, lowering the duty to 10% until that time.</p>

Vance indicated that Trump is willing to withdraw from negotiations if progress is not made, stressing the need for both sides to engage in discussions.

          <p>Congressional Republicans are relying on a spending and tax cut package to revitalize their political standing, but this effort may be overshadowed by the economic damage caused by President Trump's tariffs.

Republicans face a dilemma: they need Trump's support to pass the tax extension but have shied away from criticizing his trade policy, which is hurting the economy and their chances in upcoming elections.

          <p>Tensions have escalated between India and Pakistan after India launched missile strikes into Pakistani-administered Kashmir and Pakistani territory, citing infrastructure used by militants. Pakistan has condemned the strikes as an act of war and vowed retaliation. India conducted security exercises and civil defense drills in preparation for a potential Pakistani counterattack. The U.S. diplomatic mission in Pakistan issued a security alert, advising citizens to depart conflict areas or shelter in place. Despite the heightened tensions, Pakistan reopened airports in major cities, offering some hope for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Libya's rival governments have denied agreeing to receive deported migrants from the United States, stating that such an agreement would violate the nation's sovereignty. This comes after reports that the Trump administration plans to send immigrants to Libya on military flights as early as this week. The denial underscores the complex political situation in Libya and the challenges of implementing migration policies in the region. The move has prompted condemnation from aid agencies and NGOs that operate in the central Mediterranean, which have long warned about the harsh conditions faced by asylum seekers in Libya.</p>

          <p>India's choice of the name "Operation Sindoor" for its military attack on Pakistan has sparked controversy, referencing a Hindu tradition where married women wear vermilion powder. The name is seen as a signal of avenging women whose husbands were killed in a recent terrorist attack. However, some feminists have criticized the use of the word sindoor, arguing that it reinforces a male-centric view of the world. The article also notes that a woman who lost her husband in the terrorist attack became a target of online hate after expressing that she did not want to see people going against Muslims or Kashmiris.</p>

          <p>The minimum age to become a train driver in the UK has been lowered from 20 to 18 in an effort to address driver shortages. The change aims to attract younger recruits and open up opportunities for school or college leavers. The average age of a UK train driver is 48, with a significant portion set to retire by 2029. The Rail Safety and Standards Board found that 18-year-olds are capable of safely becoming train drivers. The government hopes new job and apprenticeships for 18-year-olds could become available as early as December.</p>

          <p>Following India's missile strikes on Pakistan, experts are assessing the potential for further escalation. While Pakistan has vowed to retaliate, analysts believe neither country wants a full-blown conflict. India's actions were described as "focused, measured and non-escalatory," with targets limited to alleged terrorist infrastructure. The challenge now is to manage the next level of escalation and prevent the situation from spiraling out of control. Governments worldwide have called for restraint, and international diplomacy is seen as crucial in de-escalating the tensions.</p>

The review will focus on what the administration describes as “recent incidents of antisemitic violence.” Protesters temporarily occupied a building on campus, demanding that the university sever ties with Boeing over its arms sales to Israel. The university condemned the occupation and said it was working to ensure Jewish students have a safe and productive learning environment.

The interest rate on federal direct undergraduate loans could be 6.39% in the 2025-2026 academic year, estimates Kantrowitz. At those new undergraduate rates, every $10,000 a family borrowed would lead to a $113 monthly student loan payment after graduation, assuming the student enrolled in a standard 10-year repayment plan. The rates, which run from July 1 to June 30 of the following year, are based in part on the May auction of the 10-year Treasury note.</p>

          <p>A closely watched barometer for used vehicle pricing jumped last month to its highest level since October 2023 as consumers rushed purchases amid fears of price hikes due to auto tariffs. Cox Automotive's Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index increased 4.9% last month compared with a year earlier to a level of 208.2. Retail prices for consumers traditionally follow changes in wholesale prices, but they have not fallen as quickly as wholesale prices in recent years. While the tariffs do not directly impact used car sales, changes in new vehicle prices, production and demand affect the used car market.</p>
