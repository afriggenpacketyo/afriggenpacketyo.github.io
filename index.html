        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents of Boca Chica Village in Texas are voting on whether to incorporate as a new municipality called Starbase, largely driven by Elon Musk's SpaceX presence. Most of the 283 eligible voters are SpaceX employees. The creation of Starbase would establish a local government with control over planning, taxation, and other local issues, though some residents oppose the measure due to environmental concerns. If approved, a state bill could grant Starbase officials the power to close a local highway and restrict access to nearby Boca Chica Beach and Boca Chica State Park for rocket launches.</p>

          <p>Leader of the House of Commons Lucy Powell has apologized for comments made during a BBC Radio 4 debate where she appeared to describe grooming gangs as a "dog whistle" issue. Powell faced backlash after responding to a question about a Channel 4 documentary on sexual assault gangs with dismissive remarks. She clarified that she regards child exploitation with the "utmost seriousness" and was challenging political point scoring rather than the issue itself. Powell stated that as a constituency MP she has dealt with horrendous cases.</p>

Sanders was scheduled to speak with CBS but never showed up, raising questions about his professionalism. The analyst noted that Sanders' actions were unusual for a high-profile player, adding to concerns about his attitude and potential issues with adhering to customary obligations. Sanders was later drafted by the Cleveland Browns, but his slide in the draft was attributed to concerns about his behavior and attitude.</p>

          <p>Israel plans to mobilize thousands of reserve soldiers to reinforce its campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, indicating a potential escalation of the offensive. This move has heightened fears in Gaza, where humanitarian aid has been restricted for over two months, and many residents are displaced. Despite over a year of conflict, Israel has not fully achieved its goals of destroying Hamas or freeing all hostages, with Hamas continuing to resist and hold captives. The mobilization announcement has intensified anxieties among hostage families, who fear the increased fighting could endanger their loved ones.</p>

          <p>Several federal prosecutors in Los Angeles have resigned following a plea deal offered to a sheriff’s deputy convicted of using excessive force. The plea deal, offered by the new U.S. attorney, would reduce the deputy’s sentence significantly, prompting the resignations of prosecutors involved in the case. The move is considered unorthodox, as the plea deal seeks to withdraw a jury verdict and replace it with a plea agreement to a lesser crime. The resignations highlight concerns about the integrity of the justice system and potential political interference.</p>

The college president cited safety and security concerns, the presence of unaffiliated individuals, and warnings from law enforcement as reasons for seeking outside assistance. Prior to the sweep, seven students were suspended for erecting the encampment. The encampment and subsequent actions follow a broader trend of crackdowns on pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses.</p>

          <p>As official research positions are lost due to budget cuts, the work of citizen scientists to preserve federal forests is becoming increasingly valuable. Volunteers like Don Pike are clearing invasive species and monitoring threatened cactuses in the Tonto National Forest, helping to save what might otherwise be lost. These efforts are essential as climate change increases the risk of wildfires and invasive species spread, and citizen scientists are working to reduce fire and heat risks, clear hundreds of acres of invasives, and capture data.</p>

Despite millions taking antidepressants, there is a lack of high-quality randomized controlled trials to guide clinicians in safely tapering patients off. Patients who come off antidepressants are more likely to experience a relapse in symptoms of depression than patients who keep using them, though research is needed to determine whether that is due to withdrawal or the return of the underlying depression.</p>
