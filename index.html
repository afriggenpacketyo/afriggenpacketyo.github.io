          <p>An explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, has been declared an intentional act of terrorism by the FBI. The blast, which occurred on Saturday morning, resulted in one fatality and injuries to four others, none of whom were staff members of the clinic. The explosion caused damage extending several blocks, affecting nearby buildings, and led to evacuations in the Twentynine Palms area. The clinic confirmed that its staff and stored embryos remained safe and unharmed, and investigations are ongoing to determine the motive and identify any suspects.</p>

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts are causing anxiety among low-income and disabled Americans who rely on the program for healthcare. A Congressional Budget Office analysis suggests that these cuts could leave over 8 million people without health insurance by 2034. Many individuals, like Rosa Andresen, worry about losing essential benefits for their disabled children, such as diapers and medication. Others, like Jodie Montplaisir, fear that work requirements could hinder their recovery from opioid use disorder, as Medicaid-funded treatment programs have been critical to their sobriety and stability.</p>

          <p>A Mexican Navy training sailboat, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night, resulting in injuries to nineteen crew members, with three sustaining serious injuries. The ship, carrying 277 people, was on a goodwill cruise and en route to Iceland when the incident occurred; it had departed from Pier 17 in Manhattan. The collision caused damage to the ship's masts and rigging, and prompted a brief closure of the bridge for inspection. The National Transportation Safety Board is set to investigate the incident, which authorities believe was caused by mechanical issues experienced by the pilot.</p>

Unable to call for help due to a lack of cell service, she relied on her nutrition knowledge and foraging skills to survive, using manzanita and pine needles for tea.

          <p>President Trump's recent diplomatic tour of the Middle East signals a shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Israel and Prime Minister Netanyahu taking a backseat to negotiations with Gulf states. Trump's meetings with leaders in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates focused on brokering peace deals in Iran and Yemen, as well as securing lucrative business agreements. This shift has raised concerns in Israel, particularly regarding Trump's approach to Iran and the lifting of sanctions on Syria, actions taken without consulting Netanyahu.</p>

Discussions will also address easing food trade regulations and deepening energy collaboration. The overarching theme is navigating a world where the U.S. is pulling back, making cooperation key despite previous economic divisions.</p>
