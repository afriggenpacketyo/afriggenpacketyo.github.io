          <p>Tommy Fleetwood, an English golfer, has taken a three-shot lead at the Travelers Championship in Connecticut as he seeks his first PGA Tour title. Fleetwood shot a seven-under-par 63 on Saturday, placing him ahead of Americans Russell Henley and Keegan Bradley.

Fleetwood's impressive performance has positioned him favorably heading into the final round.

          <p>A boat capsized on Lake Tahoe on Saturday afternoon, resulting in six fatalities and two missing individuals, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. The incident occurred near D.L. Bliss State Park, with authorities attributing the capsizing to a large swell around 3 p.m. ALERTCalifornia cameras captured clear skies for most of the day before a storm system moved through the area, bringing snow and 40-45 mph winds. Search operations, involving multiple agencies, are set to resume Sunday morning. The tragedy underscores the unpredictable nature of Lake Tahoe's weather and the potential dangers of boating in such conditions.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, calling it a "spectacular military success." The strikes targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan, with the objective of destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. Trump warned Iran against retaliating, stating that failure to pursue peace would result in further attacks. The strikes involved B-2 bombers and Tomahawk missiles, with the U.S. assuring Iran that regime change was not the goal. The action has drawn mixed reactions from U.S. lawmakers, with some supporting the strikes and others criticizing the lack of congressional authorization.</p>

Climate change researchers have suggested that warmer climates could contribute to more home runs.

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, lawmakers from both parties have offered mixed reactions. Republicans largely supported the strikes, while many Democrats criticized the president for not consulting Congress. House Speaker Mike Johnson praised the action, while Senator Mark Warner expressed concern over the lack of congressional input and a clear strategy. The strikes have reignited the debate over presidential war powers and the need for congressional authorization in military actions. The political divide reflects the ongoing tensions surrounding U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>A confidential legal brief submitted to the International Criminal Court alleges that the Russia-linked Wagner Group has committed war crimes by disseminating images of atrocities in West Africa on social media. The brief argues that circulating these images, which include graphic content such as the butchering of corpses, constitutes a war crime. Experts suggest the images, though difficult to verify, could serve as evidence of war crimes and are intended to threaten enemies of Wagner and its allies. While the governments of Mali and Burkina Faso have condemned the videos, accountability for these alleged abuses remains minimal.</p>

          <p>President Trump had suggested Iran had two weeks to negotiate a nuclear deal, but he had already decided to bomb Iranian nuclear sites. Trump declared the strikes had "completely and totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear facilities, demanding Iran abandon any remaining nuclear capability. The administration is bracing for potential Iranian retaliation, which could target U.S. bases or shipping in the Gulf. While Trump hoped for a negotiated deal, he believed Iran was weak and unable to retaliate significantly. The strikes may force Iran to negotiate on dismantling its nuclear program, though asymmetric warfare is expected in the short term.</p>

          <p>President Trump joined Israel's campaign against Iran's nuclear infrastructure, declaring the strikes a "spectacular military success." However, the administration has not provided public evidence that Iran was "weeks away" from building a nuclear bomb. Tehran now faces a choice: capitulate or retaliate, with retaliation being the more likely outcome. Potential Iranian responses include regional attacks on U.S. assets, disruption of oil routes, strikes on U.S. allies, and asymmetric attacks abroad. The strike could unify the regime inside Iran and the U.S. must prepare for a shadow war.</p>

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at the earliest stage. The non-invasive test kit can simultaneously assess the risk for up to seven types of cancer. The "miSignal" test kit detects microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology, in urine. A survey using the test kits detected a tumor in the lungs of a woman and precancerous cells in the colon and pancreas of six others. The kit could be vital in places with sparse medical resources.</p>

Professor Li Lei's team reorganized yeast metabolism into four distinct yet interconnected phases. These phases mirror the concept of mutual promotion and restraint, known as xiang sheng xiang ke in traditional Chinese medicine. The four phases each reflect a unique metabolic state, similar to the "four symbols" theory in traditional Chinese medicine. This approach highlights the importance of balance between passive and active forces to maintain harmony.</p>
