          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri secured his fourth win of the season at the Miami Grand Prix, leading teammate Lando Norris in a thrilling race. Piastri showcased exceptional skill, overtaking Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli and Red Bull's Max Verstappen to seize the lead and maintain his advantage. Norris recovered from an early setback to challenge Piastri, but the Australian driver held firm. George Russell of Mercedes claimed the final podium spot, while Ferrari faced internal tension as Lewis Hamilton's request to pass Charles Leclerc was initially denied before being accepted, though he ultimately failed to overtake Antonelli.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has declared a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the United States, citing a "National Security threat" and the decline of the American film industry. He authorized the U.S. Trade Representative to initiate the levy, arguing that other countries' incentives are attracting filmmakers and studios away from America. Trump appointed Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone as special ambassadors to promote Hollywood business opportunities. China has already reduced its quota of American films in response to Trump's broader tariff policies.</p>

          <p>Dustin May's struggles with his sweeper pitch proved costly as the Dodgers lost to the Atlanta Braves 4-3, snapping their seven-game winning streak. May gave up two two-run home runs to Austin Riley on poorly executed sweepers. While May was otherwise effective, his inability to consistently land the pitch has been a source of frustration in recent outings. The Dodgers' offense also struggled against Braves starter Bryce Elder, providing limited support for May.</p>

          <p>Rodney Hinton Jr., a 38-year-old Ohio man, has been charged with aggravated murder after allegedly intentionally hitting and killing a Hamilton County Sheriff's deputy with his car.

Police Chief Teresa Theetge said the officer who fired the shots told investigators that Ryan Hinton pointed a gun at him during the chase.</p>

          <p>The year 2024 was the deadliest for Russian forces in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war, with at least 45,287 soldiers killed, according to a BBC Russian Service analysis. This is nearly three times more than in the first year of the invasion. The heaviest losses occurred during a slow Russian advance in the east, with an estimated 27 Russian soldiers killed for every square kilometer of Ukrainian territory captured. Despite the losses, Russia has managed to replenish its forces through increased recruitment and higher salaries for volunteer soldiers.</p>

          <p>Nearly one million people in 17 states may lose healthcare coverage as Aetna, owned by CVS, exits the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace. This decision comes despite CVS surpassing financial expectations. The departure is partly attributed to the scheduled expiration of ACA tax credits and financial incentives implemented by the Biden administration, which will lead to higher premium costs. CVS stated that Aetna is not a major player in the ACA marketplace and that it will continue to offer other health benefit solutions.</p>

          <p>As more women turn to egg freezing to preserve their fertility, some experts caution against relying too heavily on the procedure, citing its high costs and lack of guarantees. Egg freezing involves risks, both medical and financial, with no certainty of success. The optimal time to have a baby from a biological perspective is in one's 20s or early 30s, but society often pushes women to prioritize education and career before motherhood. Some critics also suggest that companies offering egg freezing as a benefit may be doing so to retain female employees rather than to support their family planning.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is becoming increasingly popular among women to preserve their fertility, offering a chance to delay motherhood and increase their chances of having children later in life.

The process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage, with costs ranging from $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle.

          <p>Egg freezing is gaining popularity among young women as a way to preserve their fertility and delay motherhood. The procedure involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage in liquid nitrogen. Experts say that freezing eggs at a younger age, ideally in the 20s, offers the best chance of success due to higher egg quality. Some companies are offering egg freezing as a benefit to attract and retain talent, while others caution about the high costs and lack of guarantees. Experts also suggest more discussion with gynecologists about family planning.</p>
