        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ballymena, Northern Ireland, experienced a second night of violent disorder involving petrol bombs, bricks, and fireworks thrown at police, who responded with baton rounds and a water cannon. The unrest began after a peaceful protest concerning an alleged sexual assault, organized following the court appearance of two teenage boys accused of the crime. DUP assembly member Paul Frew expressed fears of fatalities and emphasized the need to stop the violence, which he said was overshadowing sympathies for sexual assault victims. Tensions have reportedly been rising in Ballymena due to concerns about illegal immigration, with some residents displaying signs indicating their nationality to avoid attacks, and the incident underscores underlying social issues and anxieties in the community. The situation is concerning due to the potential for further escalation and the need for community dialogue and resolution, but there are currently no reported deaths from the incident.</p>

          <p>Several Asian economies are actively reducing their reliance on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties, monetary shifts, and currency hedging, with ASEAN committed to promoting local currencies in trade and investment. This move aims to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations and strengthen regional payment connectivity, as investors and officials recognize the potential weaponization of the dollar in trade negotiations. China is promoting bilateral trade settlements in yuan, and BRICS nations are developing alternative payment systems to bypass SWIFT and reduce dollar dependency. The trend reflects a broader global shift away from the greenback, with central banks gradually reducing the dollar's share in reserves, and investors increasingly hedging their U.S. dollar exposures.

Despite recovering international tourism, travel between the two countries remains sluggish due to lingering negative perceptions and anxieties among Japanese citizens about visiting China. Relations have been strained by wartime history, territorial disputes, and China's import ban on Japanese seafood following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's treated water release.

He described how the surgery had ruined his life and forced him to keep it a painful secret from his wife until her death. The eugenics law, in effect from 1948 to 1996, allowed authorities to sterilize people with intellectual disabilities, mental illnesses, or hereditary disorders without their consent.

          <p>A recent report by PwC suggests that the increasing role of artificial intelligence (AI) may diminish the importance of formal college degrees, as skills and knowledge become more rapidly outdated. The report indicates that employers are placing greater emphasis on current skills rather than past education, particularly in AI-exposed fields. With AI tools facilitating rapid knowledge acquisition, individuals are encouraged to upskill in AI to remain competitive in the evolving job market. The shift towards skills-based hiring may democratize opportunities for those lacking formal degrees, highlighting the need for continuous learning and adaptation.</p>

          <p>Two adaptations of Johann Sebastian Bach's St. John Passion explore contemporary themes, with Thomas HÃ¶ft's "QueerPassion" addressing violence against LGBTQ+ individuals and Vladimir Ivanoff's "Arabian Passion" reflecting on war and displacement in the Middle East. HÃ¶ft's work incorporates stories of discriminated and murdered queer people, while Ivanoff's version integrates Arabic instruments and vocals to connect Western and Eastern cultures. Both adaptations are touring and will be performed at the Bachfest in Leipzig, aligning with the festival's theme of "Transformation". The reimagined versions aim to add new layers of meaning to Bach's original work.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' ex-girlfriend, identified as "Jane," testified about his alleged sexual behavior, including drug use and voyeuristic fantasies, during his federal trial for sex crimes. Legal experts suggest that while Jane's testimony reveals Combs' morally reprehensible behavior, it may not directly prove the charges he faces. The case hinges on whether actions were consensual or coerced, and the defense is suggesting Jane willingly participated in the events. The trial is expected to conclude by July 4, and the outcome will depend on whether the prosecution can demonstrate coercion beyond the allegations of sexual deviancy.</p>
