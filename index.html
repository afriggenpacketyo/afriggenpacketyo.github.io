          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is creating a complex situation for central banks globally, offering potential relief from dollar-denominated debt burdens and import inflation but also posing challenges to export competitiveness. While some countries may consider currency devaluation to boost exports, they must carefully balance this against the risks of capital flight and potential trade retaliation from the U.S. The European Central Bank has already cut rates, and other central banks are weighing their options, avoiding a currency war that could destabilize the global economy. Overall, central banks are treading cautiously, balancing the benefits of a weaker dollar against potential economic risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks and the dollar experienced a significant decline following President Donald Trump's renewed criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates. Trump's attacks on Powell, coupled with concerns over tariffs, have contributed to market volatility and fears of an economic slowdown. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all experienced substantial losses, while the dollar index fell to its lowest level since 2022. Gold prices, however, reached a new record high as investors sought safe-haven assets amidst the economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Noor Abdalla, wife of detained Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, gave birth to their son without her husband present, as ICE denied his request for temporary release. Khalil, detained in Louisiana, could only experience the birth via telephone. Abdalla condemned ICE's decision, stating it was a purposeful act to cause suffering and silence her husband's activism. Khalil was arrested on grounds of being a threat to US foreign policy and is eligible for deportation.</p>

          <p>The Madison County Sheriff’s Office arrested John Canaan Emmons, 23, for possession of child sex abuse materials after receiving a tip from a "predator poacher" organization. The organization, conducting an online sting operation, encountered Emmons communicating inappropriately with an individual portrayed as an 11-year-old. Deputies reviewed the evidence, and a forensic analysis of Emmons's mobile device revealed child sex abuse material. Emmons is currently held in the Madison County Jail on a $40,000 bond, with the investigation ongoing and additional charges possible.</p>

The main contenders are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure as Canada seeks to reduce its reliance on the US. Mark Carney's Liberals promise to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy, while Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives aim to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax. The shift reflects a decline in voter concerns about climate change amid rising prices and energy costs.</p>
