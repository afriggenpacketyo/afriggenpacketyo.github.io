          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 15:55:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent statements by President Trump have sparked widespread confusion and concern over the safety of acetaminophen, commonly known as Tylenol, for pregnant women and children. While some studies have suggested a possible association between the drug's use during pregnancy and a higher risk of autism or ADHD, this link is not considered causal by many researchers. Major medical organizations emphasize that untreated fever and pain during pregnancy pose known, significant risks to both mother and child, and acetaminophen remains one of the few safe options available. Experts advise parents to consult their medical providers for guidance rather than relying on political commentary for health decisions.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, some homeowners are considering using a home equity loan to finance the purchase of a second property. This financial strategy requires careful evaluation of the current interest rate environment, as today's rates are still higher than in the recent past. Homeowners should also precisely calculate their available equity and determine if it's sufficient for a down payment to avoid private mortgage insurance. Ultimately, the decision should align with long-term financial goals, weighing the benefits of leveraging home equity against the risks involved in taking on new debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has abruptly canceled a scheduled meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, increasing the probability of a federal government shutdown. The talks were intended to negotiate a funding deal and address Democratic demands, particularly the extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits. Trump criticized the Democrats' proposals as "unserious and ridiculous" in a social media post, stating no meeting could be productive. Democratic leaders accused the president of political maneuvering and warned that he would be responsible for the consequences of a shutdown.</p>

          <p>During his address at the United Nations, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva strongly criticized the United States for its trade tariffs and military policies, while advocating for stronger ties with China. Despite the sharp rebuke, U.S. President Donald Trump extended an unexpected olive branch shortly after the speech. Trump told reporters that he and Lula had a brief but positive interaction, describing their chemistry as "excellent" and announcing they had agreed to a formal meeting next week.

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist candidate for mayor of New York City, has publicly criticized the high ticket prices for the upcoming World Cup final at MetLife Stadium. He highlighted that some face-value tickets are being listed for over $6,000, calling the cost "absurd" and prohibitive for most New Yorkers. Mamdani is advocating for FIFA to set aside 15% of tickets at discounted prices for local residents and to abandon its demand-based dynamic pricing model. This model could cause ticket prices to fluctuate significantly, potentially pricing out many local soccer fans from attending the historic event.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's Noni Madueke is expected to be out of action for six to eight weeks after sustaining a knee injury during a recent match against Manchester City. The 23-year-old winger, who was signed from Chelsea over the summer, underwent tests that fortunately ruled out a more severe anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta confirmed the winger would be out for "a few weeks" but expressed hope that the injury was not as bad as initially feared. The absence is a significant blow to both Arsenal and the England national team, as Madueke will miss key domestic, European, and international matches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FCC Chair Brendan Carr's recent threats to revoke broadcast licenses of networks critical of Donald Trump, such as those airing Jimmy Kimmel's show, are likely legally unenforceable due to strong First Amendment protections. Historically, the FCC has almost never revoked a license based on programming content, making such threats appear hollow. However, this article suggests the real power Carr wields is not in license revocation but in regulatory oversight of media mergers and acquisitions. By creating a climate of fear, the FCC can pressure companies seeking approval for major deals to self-censor or settle politically motivated lawsuits, effectively influencing content without direct censorship.</p>

Trump's remarks were part of a broader critique where he labeled the UN as ineffective, operating with "empty words" that fail to solve global conflicts.

          <p>President Donald Trump has officially designated the Antifa movement as a domestic terrorist organization, prompting the government to investigate its operations and funding. The term Antifa, short for "anti-fascist action," originated in 1930s Germany and represents a decentralized, leaderless coalition of groups and individuals opposed to fascism, racism, and right-wing extremism. While many Antifa-aligned groups engage in non-violent activities like counter-protesting, some militant factions advocate for or use violence. Legal experts have previously raised concerns about such a designation, citing the movement's lack of a formal structure and First Amendment protections for political beliefs.</p>

          <p>The Medigap "birthday rule," a provision available in about 18 states, offers a valuable opportunity for Medicare beneficiaries to switch their supplemental insurance plans annually without medical underwriting. This state-specific rule typically provides a window around a person's birthday during which they can switch to a Medigap plan with equal or lesser benefits, regardless of pre-existing health conditions. This allows seniors to seek more affordable premiums or better service without being locked into their initial plan choice. Understanding the specific regulations in one's state is crucial for taking advantage of this potential for significant cost savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With average home equity levels high, many homeowners are considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) for significant expenses. For a $60,000 HELOC at the current average rate of 8.05%, monthly payments would be approximately $730 for a 10-year repayment period or $575 for a 15-year period. These costs are slightly lower than earlier in the year due to the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. A key advantage of a HELOC is its variable rate, which could lead to even lower payments if further rate cuts occur as anticipated later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has officially designated the transnational gang Barrio 18 as a foreign terrorist organization. The department stated the group, one of the largest in the Northern Hemisphere, has conducted attacks on officials, security forces, and civilians in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. This designation places Barrio 18 on a list with other criminal groups like MS-13 and the Sinaloa drug cartel, which were labeled as terrorist groups by the Trump administration. The move is part of the administration's broader strategy to dismantle gangs and cartels, which has included controversial lethal strikes on alleged drug transport vessels.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has forcefully pushed back against accusations that the central bank's decisions are politically motivated, calling such claims a "cheap shot." Without naming President Trump directly, Powell addressed the intense pressure and criticism from the White House, which has sought greater control over the Fed's monetary policy. His comments came during an event in Rhode Island, where he reiterated the Fed's commitment to independence and data-driven decision-making. The remarks highlight the ongoing and extraordinary battle over the central bank's autonomy amid a challenging economic landscape of rising inflation and a slowing labor market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new report from CDC researchers, U.S. infection rates from highly drug-resistant bacteria, often called "nightmare bacteria," increased by nearly 70% between 2019 and 2023. The surge is primarily driven by bacteria carrying the NDM gene, which makes them resistant to most antibiotics, including last-resort carbapenems. Researchers suggest that a significant increase in antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic likely contributed to this rise in resistance. The trend poses a serious public health threat, as common infections could become much more difficult and costly to treat, potentially spreading unrecognized within communities.</p>

Nexstar stated it stands by its decision "pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue."
