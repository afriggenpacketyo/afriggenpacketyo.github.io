          <p>Novo Nordisk has revised its 2025 sales growth projections downwards, anticipating sales growth between 13% and 21%, which is below the previous forecast of 16% to 24%. Despite exceeding first-quarter profit expectations with a net profit of 29.03 billion Danish kroner ($4.4 billion), the company faces increased competition from copycat compounders affecting Wegovy sales. While Wegovy sales rose 83% to 17.36 billion Danish kroner, they fell slightly short of analyst predictions. Overall, Novo Nordisk's revenues increased by 18% to 78.09 billion Danish kroner, aligning closely with anticipated figures, and Ozempic sales surpassed forecasts, reaching 32.72 billion Danish kroner.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani continued his impressive form by hitting his 10th home run of the season during the Los Angeles Dodgers' 5-4 loss to the Miami Marlins in 10 innings. Ohtani's solo home run tied the game in the sixth inning, marking his fifth consecutive season with double-digit home runs. He also contributed a double, finishing the game with two hits and two RBIs. Despite Ohtani's efforts and a home run from Freddie Freeman, the Dodgers were unable to secure the win, with Miami ultimately prevailing thanks to a walk-off single by Jesus Sanchez.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India launched strikes on alleged terrorist infrastructure sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, in an operation dubbed "Operation Sindoor." The Indian defence ministry stated the strikes were a response to the April 22 attack that killed 26 people, while Pakistan has condemned the strikes as "unprovoked aggression." Pakistan claims to have shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone, resulting in casualties, though India has yet to respond to these claims. The strikes have heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, with both sides taking retaliatory measures.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has implemented a series of monetary easing measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks. The measures are intended to stimulate the economy and counteract the impact of trade tensions with the United States. The announcement came shortly after news of upcoming trade talks between top officials from both countries. The New York Times article notes that analysts anticipate a "positive but modest" impact from the policies, with concerns remaining about lackluster demand from borrowers despite increased lending capacity for banks.</p>

          <p>A new bill proposed in Parliament seeks to add up to two years in prison for criminals in England and Wales who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. The move aims to prevent offenders from evading justice, as stated by victims' families whose loved ones' killers did not attend sentencing. While some believe the additional sentence may not be a significant deterrent for those facing lengthy jail terms, others suggest restricting family visits and parole eligibility as alternative measures. The article reports that the bill is a step in the right direction for families who seek a moment of reckoning for the convicted.</p>

          <p>China's top securities regulator, the CSRC, has committed to further opening up financial markets and improving foreign institutional access, particularly emphasizing Hong Kong's role as a global finance hub. This move comes as trade tensions and decoupling risks between China and the US intensify. The CSRC plans to simplify approval processes for foreign investors, encourage foreign firms to apply for licenses in securities and fund advisory services, and support yuan-denominated stock counters in the southbound Stock Connect mechanism. The regulator also aims to protect the interests of Chinese companies listed abroad and facilitate overseas-listed firms to offer shares on mainland and Hong Kong exchanges.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article examines the shifting military alliances between India, Pakistan, and major world powers, highlighting the increased Western military support for India and China's support for Pakistan. The article suggests this realignment adds a new layer of uncertainty to the ongoing military conflict between the two South Asian rivals following a terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir. The changing arms flow patterns reflect a broader geopolitical shift, with the United States increasingly viewing India as a partner in countering China, while China strengthens its ties with Pakistan. This injection of superpower politics into the regional conflict increases the risk of escalation and instability.</p>

Huang stated that losing this market would be a significant setback for the company. The company currently faces tightening export restrictions from Washington that impact its China-tailored H20 AI chips. China contributed roughly 14 per cent of Nvidia's revenue last financial year, accounting for US$17.1 billion.</p>

          <p>Following disappointing local election results, the Labour party is facing scrutiny over several economic policies that are projected to backfire. The article reports that reforms to the "non-dom" tax regime, intended to generate Â£33bn for the Treasury, may instead cost taxpayers billions if wealthy non-doms leave the country. The decision to impose 20% VAT on private schools to raise Â£1.7bn for state schools could strain local authorities if 35,000 private school pupils transfer to the state system. Additionally, cuts to the winter fuel allowance may be revisited due to the policy's unpopularity and a surge in pension credit applications, while increases to capital gains tax appear to have backfired, reducing tax revenue.</p>

          <p>Mikel Arteta aims to harness "rage, anger, frustration" to overturn Arsenal's 1-0 deficit against Paris St-Germain in the Champions League semi-final. The article from BBC Sport explores tactical adjustments Arsenal can make to secure a win in Paris. Thomas Partey's return to midfield and Ousmane Dembele's fitness are key factors. While Arsenal has struggled to score in recent semi-final matches, PSG has a history of Champions League meltdowns, leaving the tie delicately poised.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom after Newsom proposed a federal film tax credit aimed at boosting the state's film industry. Newsom's proposal came in response to Trump's announcement of 100% tariffs on films produced outside the U.S. Trump accused Newsom of causing the film industry to "abandon" the U.S. and criticized California's High-Speed Rail project. Despite the criticism, Trump expressed a fondness for Newsom and acknowledged his past cooperation on issues like wildfires.</p>
