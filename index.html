          <p>Dartford Labour councillor Ricky Jones has been found not guilty of encouraging violent disorder after telling an anti-racism rally that far-right protesters' throats should be cut. Jones argued his remarks, which included drawing his finger across his throat, were ill-advised but not intended to incite violence, claiming they referred to extremists who allegedly hid razor blades behind stickers on trains. The jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court deliberated for just over 30 minutes before reaching the verdict, which has drawn criticism from some political figures.</p>

          <p>In Bihar, India, where inadequate cold-chain infrastructure leads to significant crop spoilage, solar-powered cold storage facilities are emerging as a potential solution for small-scale farmers. Companies like Inficold are installing units that allow farmers to preserve perishable goods for weeks, reducing waste and enabling them to sell produce when market prices are more favorable. However, challenges remain, including the high upfront investment costs and the need for community-based models and government support to make the technology accessible and economically viable for all farmers.</p>

Despite this resilience, industry leaders express concern that new U.S. tariffs, combined with rising silver prices and a weakening dollar, could eventually temper the robust demand that has characterized the market.

          <p>A report by the environmental group Climate Power found that Republican lawmakers who voted for a major Trump-backed bill that benefits the oil and gas industry have accepted over $105 million in career donations from the sector. The legislation provides billions in giveaways to fossil fuel companies while rolling back clean energy tax credits established by the Inflation Reduction Act. The analysis highlights a potential conflict of interest, as many of the bill's supporters represent districts that have benefited from green energy investments.</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II, a commentary in the Chinese People's Liberation Army's official newspaper accused right-wing forces in Japan of never abandoning the "dream of becoming a military power." The article criticized Tokyo's expanding defense partnerships with the U.S., NATO, and other regional allies as a pretext for its own military development. It also condemned visits by Japanese officials to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which China views as a symbol of past aggression.</p>

          <p>The sixth round of UN negotiations aimed at creating a historic treaty to end plastic pollution has failed after countries remained deeply divided on the core issues. A coalition of approximately 100 nations, including the UK and EU, advocated for binding limits on plastic production. However, a group of oil-producing states, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, blocked this proposal, insisting the treaty should focus exclusively on waste management and recycling, leading to a collapse of the talks.</p>

          <p>Spain is on high alert for new wildfires as a major heatwave continues to scorch the country, with temperatures expected to reach 40C in some regions. Firefighters are already battling 14 large blazes that have devastated over 1,500 square kilometers and resulted in seven deaths. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez warned of "very tough" conditions, as meteorologists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of such extreme weather events across southern Europe to human-induced climate change.</p>

          <p>The human rights organization Pro Asyl has filed a lawsuit against Germany's foreign and interior ministers, accusing them of failing to protect vulnerable Afghan refugees. The case centers on approximately 2,000 Afghans who were granted asylum in Germany but remain stranded in Pakistan, where they now face mass deportation back to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan due to German bureaucratic delays. The group argues that this inaction has left these individuals in a perilous situation, facing risks of arbitrary arrest and abuse.</p>

While not a major strategic breakthrough, these gains provide Moscow with a potential propaganda victory and leverage heading into the high-stakes negotiations. Analysts suggest Russia will use this battlefield momentum to portray Ukraine as weakening, thereby pressuring Kyiv and its allies to accept a peace deal on Russian terms.</p>
