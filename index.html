          <h2>Chinese Nationalists Criticize Acclaimed Mathematician for Using English in Lectures</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Renowned mathematician Hong Wang, a leading contender for the Fields Medal, has become a target for Chinese cyber-nationalists. The criticism stems from her decision to deliver academic lectures in English during a recent tour of prestigious Chinese universities. Despite the online backlash, Wang, a Peking University graduate who is now a professor in the US and soon France, was met with packed and enthusiastic audiences at every venue. Her groundbreaking research has significant implications for fields like cryptography and data processing.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has hit his 350th career home run, achieving the milestone faster than any other player in MLB history. He reached the mark in his 1,088th game, surpassing the previous record holder, Mark McGwire, who did it in 1,280 games. Despite the personal achievement, Judge expressed that a team win would have been more gratifying. The two-time AL MVP continues a dominant season, leading the major leagues in batting average, home runs, and RBIs.</p>

          <p>The UK's Health Secretary and the British Medical Association (BMA) are scheduled to meet in an attempt to prevent a five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The BMA is demanding a better pay offer than the proposed 5.4% increase, arguing that real-term wages have fallen significantly since 2008. While the government states it cannot improve the pay offer, it is reportedly open to discussing better working conditions. The planned strike has drawn criticism, including from prominent professor Lord Robert Winston, who resigned from the BMA in protest.</p>

          <p>China's space industry is experiencing a significant boom driven by private investment, which is projected to constitute 45% of the sector's total investment by 2025. This surge is fueled by technological advancements, reduced manufacturing costs, and government support for private enterprises. Companies like i-Space and LandSpace are emerging as leaders, with successful orbital launches that rival state-led missions. This growth aligns with global trends, as the space economy is forecasted to expand to US$1.8 trillion by 2035. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a significant reorganization of the U.S. State Department, resulting in the layoff of 1,353 employees, including both civil and foreign service officers. The cuts are part of a broader plan to reduce the department's domestic workforce by 15% and consolidate various offices to eliminate redundancy. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the move weakens American diplomacy during a time of global complexity, particularly as the layoffs have heavily impacted bureaus focused on human rights, refugee assistance, and Afghan relocation efforts.</p>

          <p>Investigators are beginning a two-year excavation at the former site of the St Mary's mother-and-baby home in Tuam, Ireland, where up to 796 babies and children are believed to be buried in an unmarked mass grave. The institution, run by nuns from 1925 to 1961, housed unmarried mothers and their children. The horrific discovery was brought to light by the work of a local historian, Catherine Corliss, whose research pointed to the children being buried in a defunct sewage tank. The excavation aims to recover and identify the remains, bringing a painful truth to light for survivors and relatives.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that his administration will impose 30% tariffs on all goods imported from both Mexico and the European Union, effective August 1. In letters posted to his social media platform, he cited Mexico's perceived failure to curb drug trafficking and the United States' persistent trade deficit with the EU as justifications. The move represents a significant escalation of the administration's trade strategy, which has involved threatening and levying tariffs on numerous global partners in an effort to reshape international trade rules and encourage domestic manufacturing.

          <p>Sweden delivered a commanding performance at the Women's Euro 2025, defeating eight-time champion Germany 4-1 to win their group. The victory marks a significant statement for the Swedish team, which has not won the tournament since the inaugural event in 1984. Players like Chelsea's Johanna Rytting Kaneryd expressed a strong belief in the squad's potential this year, citing a "different" feeling and the goal of reaching the final. Having won all three group games decisively, Sweden will now advance to the quarter-finals with considerable momentum.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, barring immigration officials from making "indiscriminate" arrests without reasonable suspicion. The ruling, by U.S. District Judge Maame Frimpong, states that arrests cannot be based solely on factors like race, speaking Spanish, or being present at a specific location. The order stems from a lawsuit filed by individuals, including U.S. citizens, who were detained. The decision represents a legal setback for the administration's intensified immigration enforcement and deportation campaign.</p>

While still on a limited workload following Tommy John surgery, his effective outing provided the momentum the team desperately needed.

          <p>England has won its rugby test series against Argentina 2-0 after a dramatic, last-minute try from Jack van Poortvliet sealed a 22-17 victory in the second match.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has dismissed all federal charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore, a Utah plastic surgeon accused of a scheme involving COVID-19 vaccines. Moore was indicted in 2023 on charges of destroying over $28,000 worth of government-provided vaccines, administering saline shots to children, and selling fraudulent vaccination cards. In a statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the dismissal was in the "interests of justice," asserting that Dr. Moore gave patients a choice when the government did not. The trial had just begun last week.</p>

          <p>While artificial intelligence is often blamed for exacerbating China's declining birth rate by replacing roles in companionship and elder care, some experts argue this may not be entirely negative. As more young people choose a single life, they see AI as a future solution for needs traditionally met by family. A leading demographer suggests that the AI revolution could fundamentally redefine life and family, potentially making traditional population concerns obsolete. This perspective challenges the conventional narrative about the societal impacts of both AI and demographic shifts.</p>

The incident is one of many recent deadly events surrounding aid distribution in Gaza, where severe shortages of food and medicine persist.
