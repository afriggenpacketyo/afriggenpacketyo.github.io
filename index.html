          <h2>Trump's Tariffs on China and Vietnam to Hike Toy Prices by 50%</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-04 08:38:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's expanded trade war, imposing significant tariffs on China and Vietnam, is expected to cause a substantial increase in toy prices.  The high tariffs on these major toy manufacturing nations will likely lead to price increases of 35% to 50%, impacting consumers and the toy industry significantly.  Toy companies, such as Hasbro and Mattel, are already experiencing stock declines and may need to adjust their guidance projections, leaving consumers to bear the brunt of the increased costs.</p>

          <h2>Treasury Yields Plummet Amidst Fears of Recession Triggered by Trade War</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-04 08:38:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 10-year Treasury yield fell below 4% on Friday, driven by investor concerns over a potential global recession sparked by escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China.  China's retaliatory tariffs against President Trump's aggressive policy caused investors to seek the safety of bonds, pushing yields down significantly. This marked a sharp reversal from earlier in the year when yields were much higher due to expectations of economic growth spurred by tax cuts. The decline reflects a growing fear of a trade war-induced recession.</p>
