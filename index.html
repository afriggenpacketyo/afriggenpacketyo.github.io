          <p>Russia launched a large-scale aerial assault on Ukraine, deploying hundreds of drones and cruise missiles in overnight attacks that resulted in at least six deaths and dozens of injuries. The strikes targeted multiple regions, including Chernivtsi, Lviv, Kharkiv, and Dnipropetrovsk, damaging infrastructure and civilian areas. Ukraine's air force reported shooting down a significant number of the projectiles, while Poland scrambled fighter jets in response to the activity near its border. This intensified bombing campaign coincides with Russia's renewed efforts to advance along the extensive front line, placing Ukrainian forces under severe pressure.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to levy 30% tariffs on goods from Mexico and the European Union, with the new duties set to begin on August 1. The stated rationale for the policy is to compel Mexico to increase its efforts against drug trafficking and to address what the administration calls a non-reciprocal trade relationship with the EU. Both Mexican and EU officials have voiced their opposition, stating they will pursue negotiated alternatives while also preparing to implement proportionate countermeasures if the tariffs are enacted. This move represents a significant escalation in global trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hartford Bakery, Inc. has issued a voluntary recall for approximately 883 loaves of its "Lewis Bake Shop Artisan Style 1/2 Loaf" across 12 states because the product may contain undeclared hazelnuts. This poses a significant risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reactions for individuals with a nut allergy. The recall was initiated after customer complaints, including one report of digestive discomfort, though no major injuries have been recorded. The affected products, sold at retailers like Kroger and Walmart, are being removed from shelves, and consumers are advised to return them for a full refund.</p>

European leaders have expressed their readiness to continue negotiations but will take necessary countermeasures to protect EU interests if a deal is not reached.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated widespread layoffs, cutting over 1,300 civil and foreign service positions as part of a major reorganization under the Trump administration. The move, which aims to reduce the department's domestic workforce by about 15%, is intended to streamline operations and eliminate redundant offices. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the cuts will weaken American diplomacy and undermine national security interests.

          <p>Amid rising trade war tensions, companies are increasingly utilizing U.S. Customs-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay, reduce, or eliminate tariffs on imported goods. These zones allow companies to store or assemble products using foreign components without immediately paying duties, which are only collected when the final product enters U.S. commerce. This strategy preserves cash flow and provides a buffer against fluctuating tariff rates. However, a recent executive order ended the "inverted tariff" benefit in FTZs, increasing costs for some manufacturers and driving more businesses toward the flexibility of bonded warehouses.

Russia has significantly ramped up its domestic drone production, reducing its reliance on foreign suppliers like Iran.

          <p>Leaders across the European Union have reacted with strong disapproval to the US announcement of a 30% tariff on all EU goods, set to take effect August 1. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated the bloc would take all necessary steps to safeguard its interests, including potential countermeasures. French President Emmanuel Macron called for the speedy preparation of a credible response, while German officials warned of the negative impact on both European and American economies. Despite the condemnation, leaders affirmed their commitment to continue negotiations in hopes of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement and avoiding a full-scale trade war.

          <p>After years of debate, new online safety regulations are set to take effect in the UK, legally obligating tech platforms to prevent children from seeing harmful content like pornography and material promoting self-harm. The rules, enforced by the regulator Ofcom starting July 25, will require platforms to implement age verification measures, with heavy fines for non-compliance. However, critics and even government sources acknowledge the rules already need updating to address new challenges like AI chatbots and content on private messaging apps. The ongoing debate centers on whether these measures are sufficient to protect children in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.</p>

Their victory marks a significant moment for British tennis, as the last time two Britons won a men's doubles Grand Slam was in 1936.

          <p>Following President Trump's visit to central Texas after devastating floods, political analysts are discussing the administration's approach to federal disaster response. Panelists on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" noted a shift from previous presidents, who often used such events to connect empathetically with affected citizens. While acknowledging the administration can be effective at mobilizing resources, they observed that the current approach relies more heavily on state and local officials and focuses on touting the government's performance rather than expressing personal empathy. This reflects a different philosophy on the role of the federal government during national emergencies.</p>

          <p>In a post on his Truth Social platform, President Trump stated he is giving "serious consideration" to revoking the U.S. citizenship of his longtime critic, Rosie O'Donnell, calling her a "Threat to Humanity." Legal scholars quickly noted that the president does not have the authority to revoke the citizenship of a person born in the United States, as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. O'Donnell, who was born in New York and recently moved to Ireland, responded by calling the president a "disgrace" and a "danger to the nation." The incident is the latest example of the administration targeting dissenting voices.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party, the "America Party," intended to be a centrist alternative to the Democratic and Republican parties. Musk envisions the party winning a small number of congressional seats to act as a deciding vote on key legislation. However, political science experts are skeptical, noting the immense structural and financial advantages of the two major parties make it exceedingly difficult for a third party to win seats. They argue that successful third parties typically function as disruptors that influence the platforms of major parties rather than achieving electoral victory themselves.</p>

While NASA's Artemis program officially targets a crewed lunar landing by 2027, it faces significant technical hurdles, including the need for unproven in-orbit refueling technology.

          <p>In a personal essay, a transgender writer reflects on the current political and social environment, which feels increasingly hostile despite a supposed "transgender tipping point" a decade ago. The author shares her experience of growing up in the 1970s and 80s without access to gender-affirming care, arguing that her own survival and success should not be used as an argument for making today's youth wait for transition. She likens this to survivorship bias, pointing out that many others did not fare as well and that her own childhood would have been far happier with acceptance and care.

          <p>According to negotiation expert Kathryn Valentine, securing a salary increase is rarely accomplished in a single meeting and is more likely to be a process that unfolds over several weeks. She advises employees to initiate compensation discussions during mid-year check-ins rather than annual reviews, as budgets are often set by year's end. The first meeting should aim to open the dialogue and set a date for a follow-up, not to finalize a deal. Valentine stresses the importance of patience, clear documentation, and understanding that negotiation is a collaborative process that requires time for the employer to consider options and crunch numbers.</p>

These intimacy blockers include excessive phone use creating emotional distance, unresolved feelings about an ex-partner, a persistent negativity bias that fosters self-rejection, and an unmanaged stress response that can shut down desire. The therapist emphasizes that intimacy is more than just physical and is essential for a thriving partnership. She offers practical advice for couples to address these issues through open communication, setting boundaries, and understanding each other's emotional triggers.</p>
