            <p>Nvidia announced plans to mass produce AI supercomputers in the U.S., aiming for $500 billion in AI infrastructure over four years, in response to growing demand and supply chain concerns. CEO Jensen Huang emphasized that American manufacturing will bolster supply chain resilience. This move follows President Trump's initial imposition of tariffs on goods from Taiwan and China, where Nvidia primarily manufactures its GPUs. The tariffs were later eased on chips and tech components. The company's decision reflects a broader trend of companies adjusting manufacturing strategies in response to changing trade policies.</p>

            <p>The World Health Organization described the conditions in Gaza hospitals as 'beyond description' following Israeli attacks, with a major facility, al-Ahli hospital, being severely damaged. WHO spokeswoman Dr. Margaret Harris reported continuous attacks on hospitals and healthcare workers, alongside critically low medical supplies due to Israel's blockade. The Church of England, which runs al-Ahli, expressed 'grief, sorrow and outrage,' calling for an independent investigation into the attack. Israel claims the hospital was used as a Hamas command center, a claim disputed by the Church of England.</p>

            <p>Jim Cramer discusses the challenges of investing in Apple and Nvidia during the Trump era, highlighting the uncertainty caused by fluctuating trade policies. While recent exemptions on tech products from reciprocal tariffs provided a temporary reprieve, comments from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggest these exemptions may be short-lived. Cramer expresses concern about the potential impact of reshoring production on Apple's earnings and considers reducing his position in the company. He also notes that Nvidia has become a 'meme stock,' divorced from its fundamentals, making it difficult to invest in. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Campaigners from Canada's Liberal party planted "stop the steal" buttons at a conservative conference in an attempt to link the Conservative party to Donald Trump. The incident, revealed by a CBC reporter, involved staffers placing provocative buttons designed to create a false impression of Conservative support for Trump-style rhetoric. The Liberal party confirmed the incident, stating that some campaigners had "regrettably got carried away." The move comes amidst heated campaigning, where Liberals have sought to characterize Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre as Canada's version of Trump.</p>

            <p>Former FTC Chair Lina Khan alleges that Facebook, now Meta, engaged in a 'buy-or-bury scheme' by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp to stifle competition. According to Khan, Facebook 'panicked' as smartphone use surged and resorted to acquiring rivals it couldn't outcompete. Meta is currently facing a trial with the FTC over these acquisitions, with the government alleging that the company monopolized the personal social networking market. The trial could potentially lead to Meta divesting the two companies.</p>

            <p>President Trump has again attacked CBS's '60 Minutes,' threatening their broadcast licenses after critical stories regarding his handling of the Russia-Ukraine war and his proposal to annex Greenland. Trump accused the program of being a 'dishonest Political Operative' and claimed they should lose their license. The legal dispute stems from a lawsuit Trump filed against CBS for $20 billion, alleging election interference related to edits made in a '60 Minutes' interview with Kamala Harris. CBS has not commented on Trump's post.</p>

These podcasts, often characterized by casual, intimate conversations between friends, create a sense of community and connection with the hosts. The author highlights the commercialization of female friendship in the podcasting space, contrasting it with the self-improvement focus of many male-dominated podcasts. The phenomenon is linked to the increasing normalization of podcasting and the low barrier to entry for creating these types of shows.</p>
