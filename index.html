          <p>Emergency search operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4th floods in Kerr County, Texas, have been suspended due to a new and serious flood threat. Heavy rainfall is causing the Guadalupe and San Saba rivers to rise again, prompting new evacuation orders in several counties. The original flooding event resulted in over 100 deaths, with many people still unaccounted for, and the renewed danger complicates the massive, ongoing recovery and search efforts.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem clarified that President Trump's intention is to "remake" the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), rather than eliminate it entirely. Her comments come amid widespread criticism of the administration's response to the deadly Texas floods, including reports of thousands of calls to FEMA's helpline going unanswered due to lapsed contracts. Noem defended the flood response as the "best in years" and dismissed critical reports, while acknowledging her policy of personally approving all contracts over $100,000.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte this week, a meeting that gains significance following reports of a U.S. plan to sell weapons to NATO allies for transfer to Ukraine. This potential move, discussed by Senator Lindsey Graham, signals a "turning point" in the U.S. approach to the war, as the administration seeks to increase pressure on Russia. The meeting comes as President Trump is reportedly considering authorizing fresh funding for Ukraine for the first time in his second term.</p>

          <p>White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett has affirmed that President Trump's recent tariff threats against the European Union and Mexico are serious and will be implemented unless better trade deals are negotiated. Trump announced plans for a 30% tariff rate starting August 1, escalating trade tensions. Hassett also stated that the administration is looking into the legality of firing the Federal Reserve chair for cause, linking the possibility to an investigation into renovation cost overruns at the Fed's headquarters.

The tariff threat was also linked in the President's letter to Brazil's handling of a criminal case against his political ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a preliminary report into a fatal Boeing 787 crash that killed 260 people, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Boeing have privately notified airlines that the plane's fuel switch lock design is safe. An FAA notification stated the issue is not considered an "unsafe condition" that would require a mandatory airworthiness directive. This comes after the crash report questioned the switches and noted a 2018 non-mandatory FAA advisory to inspect them, which the airline had not performed.</p>
