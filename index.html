        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Target's CEO, Brian Cornell, has cautioned about the potential for significant cost increases due to tariffs, expressing a reluctance to raise prices unless absolutely necessary. The retail giant reported a decline in sales for the most recent quarter, attributing this downturn to consumer apprehension regarding tariffs and a negative response to the company's adjustments to its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. Sales decreased by 2.8% compared to the same period last year, falling short of analysts' expectations. Cornell emphasized the challenging environment faced by the company and its commitment to supporting American families in managing their budgets.</p>

Archer sustained the injury while playing for Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League. He will be re-evaluated in the coming weeks to determine when he can return to the field. Luke Wood, a left-arm seamer from Lancashire, has been called up to replace Archer in the ODI squad, having already been part of the T20 group.

          <p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry has criticized President Donald Trump's "Golden Dome" missile defense program, stating it risks undermining global strategic balance and stability. China urged the U.S. to abandon the project, which aims to create a missile defense umbrella capable of intercepting missiles from anywhere, including space. According to a ministry spokesperson, the shield will heighten the risk of turning space into a war zone, potentially sparking a space arms race and destabilizing the international security and arms control system. The spokesperson added that this initiative prioritizes U.S. security above all else, conflicting with the principle of undiminished security for all.</p>

          <p>As of May 21, 2025, the price of gold is $3,302.23 per ounce, according to American Hartford Gold. The article explains that the price of gold is influenced by various factors, including supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies. Gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty and as a hedge against inflation. The relationship between gold prices and interest rates is inversely proportional, with lower interest rates making gold more attractive. Given the fluctuating nature of gold's spot price, investors and enthusiasts should closely monitor these factors to make informed decisions regarding their gold investments.

The Grammy-winning singer, who has not yet entered a plea, can proceed with his world tour as planned, subject to bail conditions. Brown was arrested last week and charged with grievous bodily harm for allegedly attacking a music producer with a tequila bottle at Tape nightclub in London's Mayfair. The 36-year-old was required to pay a £5 million security fee to the court as a financial guarantee.</p>

          <p>Three days after Israel announced it would ease its blockade of humanitarian aid to Gaza, little of the desperately needed food, fuel, and medicine has reached Palestinians. Dozens of trucks with supplies have crossed into Gaza at the Israeli-controlled border crossing of Kerem Shalom, but the United Nations has been unable to move any trucks from Kerem Shalom to warehouses inside Gaza. The delays suggest that distributing aid across Gaza will take time, even as Israel threatens a major ground offensive. Gazans are struggling to make their provisions last, with some vendors selling single onions for exorbitant prices.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem incorrectly defined habeas corpus during a Senate hearing, stating that it is a constitutional right for the president to remove people from the country. Senator Maggie Hassan corrected her, explaining that habeas corpus is the right of individuals to challenge their detention by the government in court. Noem's remarks come as her agency carries out a campaign of detentions and deportations, some of which courts have ruled violate detainees' habeas corpus rights. Earlier in the month, Stephen Miller suggested suspending habeas corpus for migrants.</p>
