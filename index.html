          <p>In his first show since being suspended, Jimmy Kimmel delivered an emotional monologue criticizing threats to free speech, which he labeled as "un-American." He clarified that he never intended to make light of the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and addressed the pressure from the Trump administration and the FCC. Kimmel also noted that some local affiliate stations, owned by Nexstar and Sinclair, were still refusing to air his show despite his return, highlighting the ongoing political and media controversy surrounding his comments.</p>

          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered almost £500 million lost to fraud over the past year with the help of a new artificial intelligence tool. A significant portion of the reclaimed money, £186 million, was linked to fraudulent Covid-19 pandemic schemes, with other funds recovered from unlawful tax claims and housing fraud. The Cabinet Office announced that this new AI tool, which identifies weaknesses in policies before they are exploited, will now be licensed to other countries, including the U.S. and Australia, though its use has raised concerns among civil liberties groups.</p>

          <p>China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, welcomed a bipartisan U.S. House of Representatives delegation to Beijing, characterizing the rare visit as an "ice-breaking journey" for bilateral relations. In the meeting, Wang emphasized that China and the U.S. should be partners rather than rivals and urged Washington to help stabilize the relationship, particularly concerning its commitments on Taiwan. This visit marks the first time in six years that a U.S. congressional delegation has traveled to mainland China, opening a new channel for engagement between the two global powers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump is openly dictating law enforcement actions, creating a clear double standard and eroding post-Watergate norms of prosecutorial independence. The author points to the recent firing of a U.S. attorney for not charging the president's political opponents, alongside dropping investigations into his allies, as evidence of the Justice Department's politicization. The piece suggests that these actions represent a serious departure from ethical boundaries, where the president broadcasts his demands for who should be prosecuted and who should be protected.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian drones have once again attacked the Salavat petrochemical complex in Russia's Bashkortostan region, one of the country's largest such facilities. The local governor confirmed the attack, which is the second on the Gazprom-controlled plant in less than a week, stating that emergency services were on the scene. These repeated strikes are part of Ukraine's broader strategy to target Russia's critical energy infrastructure, which has reportedly led to fuel shortages within Russia as refinery operations are disrupted.</p>

This development has relegated Trafford to a backup role, potentially stalling the career momentum he built at Burnley and casting doubt on the path that was presented to him upon his return.</p>

          <p>Australia's national broadcaster, the ABC, has been ordered to pay A$150,000 in penalties for the unlawful dismissal of radio host Antoinette Lattouf. A federal court found that Lattouf was removed from the air in December 2023 due to her political views after she shared a Human Rights Watch post about the war in Gaza. The judge ruled that the ABC had surrendered to an "orchestrated" campaign by pro-Israel lobbyists and that the substantial penalty was necessary to ensure the broadcaster learned its lesson about protecting employee rights.</p>

          <p>During his address at the United Nations General Assembly, Colombian President Gustavo Petro called for a "criminal process" to be initiated against U.S. President Donald Trump. Petro's demand stems from U.S. missile strikes on alleged drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean, which have resulted in over a dozen deaths. He argued that if any of the victims were Colombian, an investigation must include the senior officials who gave the order, up to and including President Trump, marking a significant and direct diplomatic challenge on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region fell on Wednesday, following a downturn on Wall Street triggered by comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Major indexes in Japan, Australia, and South Korea all slipped, reflecting concerns that the U.S. central bank may maintain its tight monetary policy for longer than anticipated.

The sculpture depicts the two men frolicking and holding hands, with a plaque that reads, "We celebrate the long-lasting bond between President Donald J. Trump and his 'closest friend,' Jeffrey Epstein." The installation, which has a permit to remain through Sunday, highlights the persistent public scrutiny of the president's past association with Epstein.</p>

          <p>During a press conference, President Donald Trump made several inaccurate claims regarding autism, vaccines, and the use of Tylenol. He repeated the disproven talking point that Amish children do not get vaccines or autism, and falsely stated that children receive 80 "horse-sized" vaccine shots. Medical experts and scientific studies contradict these assertions, confirming that autism exists in Amish communities and that the pediatric vaccine schedule is safe and crucial for preventing diseases like hepatitis B, which can be transmitted from mother to child at birth.</p>

          <p>An investigation by Canada's privacy commissioner has concluded that TikTok's efforts to prevent underage use and protect children's data are insufficient. The probe found that hundreds of thousands of Canadian children under 13 use the app annually and that the company has collected their sensitive personal information for marketing and content targeting. In response to the findings, TikTok has stated it will introduce new measures to strengthen its platform for Canadians, though it disputes some of the investigation's conclusions.</p>
