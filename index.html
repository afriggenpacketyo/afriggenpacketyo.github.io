          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson addressed Elon Musk's criticisms of the spending bill, stating that while he respects Musk's work, he believes Musk is incorrect about the bill's impact on the deficit. Johnson mentioned that former President Trump also disagreed with Musk's assessment. He added that he attempted to contact Musk but did not receive a response, hoping to discuss the matter further. The speaker emphasized his respect for Musk's efforts to reduce waste but stood firm on his disagreement regarding the spending bill. Optimism remains neutral given the differing opinions on the economic impact of the bill.</p>

          <p>South Korea's newly elected President Lee Jae Myung is expected to pursue stable ties with Japan, particularly given regional security challenges and uncertainties arising from U.S. President Donald Trump's policies. Despite Lee's past critical remarks about Japan, experts anticipate a pragmatic approach, especially considering the need for cooperation with the United States and Japan amidst North Korea's nuclear threats and China's assertiveness. Lee acknowledged Japan as an important partner and pledged pragmatic diplomacy. This shift is seen as an attempt to present himself as a realistic leader during turbulent times, and the need for strong regional alliances.</p>

          <p>Private equity bosses at the SuperReturn 2025 conference in Berlin are showing increased optimism about opportunities in Europe, contrasting with sentiments from the previous year, this shift is driven by factors such as falling interest rates and Germany's fiscal package. Blackstone's Vice Chairman Thomas Nides believes that increased political stability in France, Germany, and the U.K. makes investing in Europe a good bet. Digital infrastructure, energy efficiency, and defense were highlighted as key areas for potential growth.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that leprosy, caused by the bacteria species Mycobacterium lepromatosis, was present in the Americas for at least a thousand years before European colonization. Researchers analyzed over 800 samples from ancient remains in Canada and Argentina, reconstructing and dating the bacterial genomes. The study indicates that Mycobacterium lepromatosis spread rapidly across the Americas, affecting indigenous populations well before the arrival of Europeans, who introduced a different leprosy-causing bacterium, Mycobacterium leprae. This discovery enhances the understanding of pre-colonial diseases and the complex relationship between pathogens and humans throughout history.</p>

Medicaid enrollment is projected to decrease by 7.8 million, and changes to the Affordable Care Act would leave another 1.3 million uninsured.

This practice highlights a shift towards hypermasculinity, potentially driven by a desire to impress other men rather than attract women. This trend mirrors the feminist movement's efforts to empower women to define their relationships with their bodies independently of male approval. However, this pursuit of masculine ideals can lead to body dysmorphia and a rejection of perceived feminine traits.</p>

          <p>The arrest of a Chinese researcher in the United States for allegedly importing an illegal biological pathogen has been described as "politicised" and could lead to more Chinese talent leaving the country, according to some researchers. Jian Yunqing, a research fellow at the University of Michigan, was arrested in connection with allegations against her boyfriend, Liu Zunyong. A Chinese scientist suggested that the incident would further damage US-China collaboration in agriculture and other fields, potentially encouraging more Chinese researchers to return home.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that it is "extremely hard" to reach a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping, amidst ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. This statement comes as trade talks have stalled, with both countries blaming each other for violating a previous agreement. China has not significantly eased restrictions on rare earths exports, and the U.S. is moving forward with efforts to limit China's access to advanced technology. These developments highlight the challenges in resolving trade disputes between the two nations.</p>
