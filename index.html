          <p>A 14-year-old girl has been sentenced to 15 years in detention for stabbing two teachers and a pupil at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman in Carmarthenshire last April. The teenager, who repeatedly said "I'm going to kill you," was found guilty of attempted murder after a second trial. The victims, Fiona Elias, Liz Hopkin, and a 14-year-old pupil, were treated in hospital for stab wounds. The judge noted the girl showed no remorse and appeared to enjoy the publicity, with the victims expressing lasting trauma and advocating for teacher safety following the violent incident.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin has ordered a three-day cease-fire in Ukraine from May 8-10 to mark Russia's Victory Day, celebrating the Soviet victory in World War II.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ESPN NFL analyst Damien Woody suggests Shedeur Sanders' slide to the fifth round of the NFL Draft was due to the NFL sending a message that he wasn't considered a top prospect, despite his talent. Woody believes that if Sanders were seen as a guaranteed winning player, he would have been picked in the first round. Other reports suggest Sanders' pre-draft interviews may have contributed to his fall, but Sanders himself remains focused on proving his worth to the Cleveland Browns. He hopes to clean up his game and prove that he is a good draft pick for the Browns.</p>

Developed by the Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology (NINT), the microwave gun weighs significantly less than traditional HPM weapons and is powered by a three-gigawatt pulsed current, with dimensions comparable to a Gatling gun.</p>

          <p>China is increasing its soybean imports from Brazil amid escalating trade tensions with the U.S., reducing its reliance on American agricultural products. An estimated 40 ships carrying Brazilian soybeans are expected to arrive at Ningbo Zhoushan Port this month, marking a significant increase from the previous year. This shift follows the cancellation of orders for American pork and is attributed to tariffs imposed by both countries. The move impacts U.S. farmers, who consider China their greatest export market for soybeans.</p>

The proposal involves enhancing Japan's Preferential Handling Procedure, a system for imported vehicles sold in small quantities. This may be discussed along with increasing U.S. farm imports during the next round of tariff negotiations. The U.S. has criticized limited access to Japan's automotive market, citing nontariff barriers.</p>
