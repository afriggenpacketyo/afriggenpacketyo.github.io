          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced a strong retaliatory response to President Trump's new tariffs, emphasizing the significant impact on Canadian citizens.  While Canada was exempted from a universal 10% tariff, the existing 25% tax on imported cars remains a major concern. Carney's response is seen as a political win, contrasting with the Conservative Party's approach. The situation highlights the tense Canada-US relationship and its effect on the Canadian federal election.</p>
