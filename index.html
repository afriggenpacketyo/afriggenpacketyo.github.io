          <h2>Mainland Chinese Students Report Feeling Unwelcome and Fearful in Taiwan</h2>

          <p>Mainland Chinese students studying in Taiwan are describing a tense and hostile environment, particularly around political events. One student recounted feeling afraid to speak due to his accent during a protest outside Taipei's parliament, fearing he would be targeted for being from the mainland. The article highlights the strong anti-mainland sentiment present in some parts of Taiwanese society, creating a harsh reality for students who feel caught in the crossfire of cross-strait political tensions. This situation underscores the personal impact of the broader geopolitical friction between Beijing and Taipei.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola will reportedly switch from high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar for its products sold in the United States. The change comes after President Donald Trump announced he had spoken with the company about the matter, a move praised by his Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long advocated against corn syrup. While Coke sold in many other countries already uses cane sugar, the US version has traditionally used corn syrup. A Coca-Cola spokesperson acknowledged the president's enthusiasm and stated that more details about new product innovations would be shared soon.</p>

          <p>The United States has announced an agreement on "specific steps" aimed at ending days of deadly sectarian violence in Syria's southern Suweida province. The announcement came after Israel conducted air strikes against the Syrian defense ministry in Damascus and government forces in the south, stating it was acting to protect the local Druze population. The conflict, which has reportedly killed over 300 people, involves clashes between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes, with Syrian government forces also involved. Syrian state media reported that its military has begun withdrawing from Suweida as part of the agreement.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama have jointly addressed and dismissed recent rumors about their marriage being in trouble. Appearing together on a podcast, they joked about the speculation, which had been fueled by Barack Obama attending several high-profile events alone. Michelle Obama explained that with her daughters grown, she now feels free to make her own decisions about which events to attend. She reaffirmed the strength of their marriage, stating there has not been a moment where she considered leaving, despite facing hard times together over their 32-year partnership.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: How Trump Primed His Base to Turn Against Him Over the Epstein Issue</h2>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic explores how President Donald Trump, after years of cultivating an anti-establishment base, is now facing a backlash from those same supporters over the Jeffrey Epstein files. By now dismissing the Epstein story, Trump is contradicting the very distrust in government he fostered, creating a schism with his most ardent backers. The piece analyzes why this particular issue has stuck, citing widespread public suspicion and the administration's own behavior, which suggests something is being hidden. It concludes that this conflict reveals an irreconcilable tension in Trump's political identity as he can no longer blame others for government actions.</p>

          <p>A package of cryptocurrency regulation bills has been stalled in the U.S. House of Representatives for a second consecutive day due to opposition from a bloc of conservative Republicans. Despite last-minute negotiations and an intervention from President Trump, new objections arose, preventing the legislation from proceeding to a full debate. The stalemate casts doubt on the Republican conference's ability to unify on crypto policy and deliver a legislative win for the industry. The impasse is a significant setback for crypto advocates who had hoped to see the bills advance during what was promoted as "Crypto Week." (not investment advice)</p>

Buxton stated, "I ain't a fan of ABS," expressing concern that it overcomplicates the game and removes the human element that has long been a part of baseball. His comments came after the system was used in the first inning to overturn a ball call into a strikeout. The ABS challenge system, while used in the minor leagues, is still a controversial topic as Major League Baseball considers its future implementation.</p>

Fearing the data could reach the Taliban, the government obtained a super-injunction to prevent the leak from becoming public and covertly launched a secret £400 million program to relocate those affected. It is now known that over 16,000 individuals on the list and their family members have been moved to the UK.

          <p>President Donald Trump has acknowledged that Beijing is making "big steps" to control the flow of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that has fueled a deadly crisis in the US. His positive assessment marks a significant shift in tone from February, when he cited the fentanyl issue as a justification for doubling tariffs on Chinese imports. The comments come as high-level trade negotiations continue between the two countries. Trump made the remarks while signing the HALT Fentanyl Act, a bill that permanently classifies fentanyl-related substances as the most dangerous category of controlled drugs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC analysis suggests that Donald Trump's strategy for handling the Jeffrey Epstein controversy could backfire by pitting him against his most loyal supporters. By blaming Democrats for a "hoax" while also criticizing his own base for believing it, Trump is challenging the core tenets of his political appeal: being an anti-establishment outsider and a straight-shooter. This approach risks making him appear like a man with something to hide, a narrative some of his base is not accepting. While most Republican officeholders remain aligned, persistent disaffection among his voters could become a significant political liability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported five men from various countries to the southern African nation of Eswatini, which has a troubling human rights record. The Department of Homeland Security stated the men were convicted of serious crimes including murder and child sexual assault, and were deported to a "third country" because their home nations refused to accept them. This action signals an escalation of a controversial policy cleared by the Supreme Court, which allows the US to send migrants to countries where they are not citizens. Eswatini's government confirmed the men are in correctional facilities pending repatriation.</p>

The legislation aims to establish consumer protections and clear rules for issuing these "digital dollars," potentially opening the market to banks and credit unions.

Despite a late-game effort from England that saw two quick wickets fall, India's Amanjot Kaur held her nerve to see the team through. For England, the loss highlighted a below-par performance with sloppy fielding, though Sophia Dunkley's score of 83 was a positive in an otherwise disappointing start to the crucial series.</p>

The court hears legal disputes between states, unlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), which tries individuals. Its jurisdiction depends on whether states have agreed to submit to its authority, either through a blanket declaration, mutual consent for a specific case, or by signing a treaty like the Genocide Convention that designates the ICJ as the arbiter. While its rulings are legally binding, the ICJ has no enforcement mechanism, meaning it relies on the cooperation of the involved parties, as seen in cases like Russia's defiance of an order to halt its war in Ukraine.</p>
