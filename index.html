          <p>At least two firefighters were killed in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, after being targeted by a shooter while responding to a wildfire on Canfield Mountain. The Kootenai County Sheriff's Office reported that first responders were under active sniper fire from a suspect using high-powered rifles, creating a highly dangerous and ongoing situation. A shelter-in-place order has been issued for local residents as the suspect remains at large.

          <p>Turkish police detained over 50 people at a banned LGBTQ+ Pride parade in Istanbul, clashing with activists and preventing the demonstration from taking place. For the ninth consecutive year since 2015, the city's governor had forbidden the event, citing risks to social peace and family values. The crackdown occurs amid President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan's increasingly harsh rhetoric against the LGBTQ+ community, which human rights groups warn is fostering a hostile environment.

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, a decision that followed shortly after President Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him. The conflict arose from Tillis's opposition to the president's major spending and tax bill, which he argued contained devastating Medicaid cuts for his state. In his announcement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and independent thinking in Washington, stating he preferred to spend time with his family over navigating more political gridlock.

Scientists at the University of Melbourne, in partnership with Colossal Biosciences, are attempting to resurrect the species by editing the DNA of its closest living relative, the dunnart.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is facing a significant and unresolved national security threat from mysterious drone swarms flying over sensitive military and civilian sites. A notable incident occurred in December 2023, when up to 40 drones repeatedly flew over Langley Air Force Base, forcing the relocation of advanced F-22 fighter jets. Despite investigations by the FBI and military, the origin and purpose of these drones remain unknown. Officials express concern over a "capability gap," as current radar systems are ill-equipped to detect these low-flying objects, which could be used for surveillance or attack.</p>

          <p>Renowned German filmmaker Werner Herzog, now 82, is known for his decades-long career of creating unconventional films that explore the edges of human sanity and the indifference of nature. In a recent interview, he reflected on the extreme lengths he has gone to for his art, such as hauling a 340-ton steamship over a mountain for his film "Fitzcarraldo." Herzog, who describes his approach as requiring "good criminal energy," continues to work on new projects and teaches his philosophy to aspiring filmmakers. He believes his prose and poetry will ultimately outlive his extensive filmography.</p>

          <p>A deeper look into the photo album of Auschwitz officer Karl HÃ¶cker reveals the involvement of young female secretaries, or "Helferinnen," who were integral to the camp's operations. These women, often recruited from the Hitler Youth's female division, were true believers in Nazi ideology and worked as communications operators. Their duties included reporting the number of people arriving on trains and being sent to the gas chambers. The photos show them smiling and relaxing, a stark contrast to the monstrous work they were facilitating, a reality confirmed by their post-war trial testimonies.</p>

          <p>Stopping the unidentified drone swarms over sensitive U.S. sites presents significant challenges due to technical limitations and jurisdictional complexities. Standard radar systems cannot reliably track these small, low-flying aircraft, and simply shooting them down over populated areas poses a major safety risk from falling debris. Furthermore, jamming the drones' communication frequencies could disrupt civilian services like Wi-Fi and GPS. A lack of a single, empowered agency to coordinate a response across military and civilian authorities has hampered efforts, though the military is now developing deployable counter-drone kits.</p>

          <p>A system in the western Gulf of Mexico has strengthened into Tropical Storm Barry, the second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. The National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for Mexico's northeastern coast, where Barry is expected to make landfall overnight Sunday or early Monday. While the storm is expected to weaken as it moves inland, it is projected to bring three to six inches of rain, with isolated totals up to 10 inches. This rainfall poses a significant threat of dangerous flooding and mudslides across the region.</p>

          <p>UK punk duo Bob Vylan has faced widespread condemnation after leading chants of "death, death to the IDF" during their performance at the Glastonbury Festival. The UK prime minister called the act "appalling hate speech," and festival organizers said the statements "very much crossed a line." The BBC, which broadcast the set live, called the comments "deeply offensive" and announced the performance would not be available on its iPlayer service. The incident has intensified debate over political expression at cultural events, with police now reviewing footage to determine if any laws were broken.</p>

          <p>Vin Diesel has announced that the late Paul Walker's character, Brian O'Conner, is planned to return for the final installment of the "Fast & Furious" franchise, slated for April 2027. Walker died in 2013 during the filming of "Furious 7," and his appearance was completed using a combination of archival footage, digital effects, and his brothers as stand-ins. Diesel stated that bringing back the character was one of his conditions for the finale, aiming to reunite the iconic duo of Dominic Toretto and Brian O'Conner. The potential return revives debate over posthumous digital performances in film.</p>
