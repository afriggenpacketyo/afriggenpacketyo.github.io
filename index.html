          <p>The leader of an MS-13 clique in suburban New York is facing sentencing for a federal racketeering case that includes his role in eight murders and other violent crimes. The case gained national attention for the 2016 killings of two high school girls, which prompted calls for the death penalty from then-President Trump. Prosecutors are seeking a 70-year sentence, citing the leader's sadistic crimes, while the defense argues for 45 years, pointing to his remorse and a traumatic upbringing.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of the federal charges against music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, whose trial jury is currently deliberating. The most serious charge is racketeering conspiracy, which alleges he ran a criminal enterprise involving sex trafficking, drugging, and kidnapping. A conviction on this complex charge, typically used against mob bosses, requires prosecutors to prove a coordinated criminal plan and carries a potential life sentence. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p>

          <p>The chief executive of the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the body that investigates potential miscarriages of justice in the UK, has resigned after months of criticism. Karen Kneller's departure follows calls for her to step down after the CCRC admitted to "failing" Andrew Malkinson, who was wrongly imprisoned for 17 years. The new chair of the CCRC acknowledged that confidence in the organization has been badly damaged and must be restored.</p>

          <p>A new study proposes that the Earth's most catastrophic mass extinction, the "Great Dying" 252 million years ago, was followed by five million years of lethal heat because of a global collapse of tropical forests. Researchers analyzing fossils in China found that the loss of vegetation severely crippled the planet's ability to store carbon, leading to a prolonged "super greenhouse" state. The findings serve as a stark warning about the potential consequences of rainforest collapse from modern climate change.</p>
