        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent wave of Russian strikes across Ukraine has resulted in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries, impacting regions including Crimea, Zhytomyr, and Kyiv. Ukrainian air defenses reportedly shot down 45 cruise missiles and neutralized 266 unmanned aerial vehicles during the attacks, which affected 22 locations. In Khmelnytskyi, four people were killed and six private houses were destroyed, while the Kyiv region reported four deaths and 16 injuries, including children. Moscow claimed that Ukrainian drones targeted eight Russian regions, destroying or intercepting 95 unmanned aerial vehicles. Optimism about peace remains low as these attacks persist despite recent prisoner exchanges and diplomatic efforts. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, with the initial nationalized service running from Woking to Surbiton. The government describes the move as a "new dawn for rail," focusing on service improvements and infrastructure reinvestment, but refrained from promising fare reductions. SWR trains will now fall under the responsibility of the Department for Transport Operator and will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval. The Transport Secretary highlighted this as a "real watershed moment," though unions have raised concerns about outsourcing to private companies. </p>

          <p>Tracey Lynch, the sister of Jason Corbett, is advocating for her brother's honor after he was murdered in North Carolina by his wife, Molly Martens, and her father, Tom Martens. The Martens claimed self-defense, alleging Jason was choking Molly, but prosecutors argued it was murder. Lynch aims to correct what she sees as the destruction of Jason's character, describing him as an amazing human being and devoted father. Molly and Tom Martens were initially convicted of second-degree murder, but the convictions were overturned, and they later pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter and were released in June 2024. </p>

Despite successfully robbing the bank, Renee faced suspicion and harsh treatment during the trial, with the defense attempting to portray her as complicit. Although Butler was convicted, Ramirez was acquitted, leading to further victimization for Renee, but Butler later recanted his testimony, admitting Renee's innocence. </p>

          <p>North Korean authorities have detained three shipyard officials following the unsuccessful launch of a naval destroyer, which was attended by leader Kim Jong Un. The 5,000-ton-class ship sustained damage to its stern during the ceremony in Chongjin, prompting Kim Jong Un to criticize military officials, scientists, and shipyard staff for carelessness. Despite Pyongyang's claim that the damage is not severe and repairs will take 10 days, observers speculate it could take longer. The failed launch is viewed as an embarrassment to Kim's efforts to strengthen North Korea's naval force. </p>

          <p>Cities across the United States, including Minneapolis and Houston, are holding religious services, concerts, and vigils to mark the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's murder. The events aim to honor Floyd's memory and reflect on the progress and challenges in police reform and racial justice. However, the remembrances occur amid concerns about the Trump administration's rollback of police oversight and diversity initiatives. Activists contend that meaningful change remains elusive despite promises from city officials. </p>

          <p>A wealthy Qatari businessman's campaign to become president of the International Table Tennis Federation is facing scrutiny, with allegations of bribery and lavish spending. A Swiss whistle-blower, Georg Silberschmidt, was detained and interrogated in Doha after distributing fliers for a players' union. The federation's integrity unit is investigating whether the Qatari businessman, Khalil Al-Mohannadi, or his supporters are attempting to influence the election through monetary means. This follows a history of similar allegations against Qatari officials in sports governance. </p>

          <p>In a guest essay, Rachel Feintzeig reflects on her obsession with zombie shows like "The Last of Us" and how they serve as a distraction from the anxieties of the real world. She finds that immersing herself in fictional apocalypses provides a temporary escape from the stresses and worries of everyday life. Drawing from personal experiences, including a miscarriage, Feintzeig explains how horror and the contemplation of terrible, fictional scenarios can offer a strange sense of perspective and relief. Ultimately, she suggests that sometimes the best way to cope with reality is to escape into a more terrifying, yet fictional, one. </p>

The rail services were privatized in the mid-1990s, and the government says renationalization will save up to Â£150 million in compensation fees paid to rail operators.

Researchers found that when dog owners dwell on work problems during their free time, their dogs exhibit more stress-related behaviors. This "crossover" of stress is attributed to emotional contagion, where dogs pick up on human feelings through subtle cues. The study suggests that avoiding work-related rumination at home could benefit the well-being of dogs. </p>
