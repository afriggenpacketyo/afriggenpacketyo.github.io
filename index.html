          <p>Democrats believe that President Trump's low approval ratings and perceived broken promises provide an opportunity to regain control of the House in 2026. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) argues that Republicans have lost public support due to high prices and potential cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, while Republicans claim Democrats are spreading fear and blaming external factors for economic issues. The DCCC plans to target vulnerable districts, emphasizing Republican accountability for their promises. Both parties express confidence in their ability to win the House in the upcoming midterm elections, framing Trump's agenda as either revitalizing the country or harming states through spending cuts.

          <p>Three officials terminated from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) are suing the Trump administration, arguing that the president lacks the authority to fire them. The lawsuit claims that the CPB is a private corporation, and Congress intended to limit presidential power over it to nominating board members. The officials seek to block their terminations, citing potential damage to the CPB's mission and operations. The White House defends the terminations, asserting the president's constitutional power to remove personnel exercising executive authority. </p>

          <p>The suspicious death of Kendy Howard, initially reported as a suicide by her husband Dan Howard, is being investigated by "48 Hours." First responders noted inconsistencies at the scene, including warm bathwater, broken glass, and a packed duffle bag. A key piece of evidence was an unfinished dryer cycle that appeared to have been started just before Dan Howard called 911. Investigators theorize that Dan Howard murdered his wife, and the dryer was started to cover up evidence. Dan Howard was arrested in April 2023 and went on trial for the murder of his wife in March 2024.</p>

          <p>President Trump personally contacted Jeff Bezos to complain about Amazon's potential plan to display tariff costs on product listings. Following the call, Amazon downplayed the initiative and ultimately canceled it. This occurred after the White House criticized Amazon for what they deemed a "hostile and political act." Amazon initially stated the plan was limited to its budget-focused shopping section, Amazon Haul, but later clarified it was never approved. The Trump administration's response comes as Bezos has seemingly sought to improve his relationship with the Republican president. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court will hear arguments regarding Oklahoma's effort to create a Catholic charter school, a case that could lead to public funds directly supporting religious schools. Opponents argue that approving St. Isidore would violate the Establishment Clause and create a slippery slope, compelling the approval of charter schools by all faiths. Supporters contend that excluding religious schools from the charter school program is unconstitutional religious discrimination. The outcome hinges on whether charter schools are considered public schools, with a decision expected by the end of June or early July.</p>

          <p>The chair of the upcoming COP30 climate talks admits that the summit will be challenging due to economic turmoil and Trump's withdrawal of the US from climate efforts. The absence of the US, a major economic power, creates concerns that other countries will scale back their climate plans. The focus at COP30 will be on highlighting the economic benefits of cleaner energy and forest protection. Despite Trump's actions, states, cities, and businesses within the US continue to push for the energy transition.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's policies, including his tariff war and threats to annex Canada, significantly influenced the Canadian election, leading to a Liberal victory. An election that would have punished the Liberals for poor economic management became a referendum on Canada's national existence due to Trump's actions. The Liberals, traditionally seen as more America-skeptical, benefited from the situation. The election also pushed Canada away from free markets and back towards statism and protectionism, diminishing American influence.</p>

In a new report, Blair says voters "feel they're being asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle when they know the impact on global emissions is minimal." The report calls for the rapid deployment of carbon capture and storage technology, greater use of AI to make energy grids efficient, and investment in small-scale nuclear reactors.
