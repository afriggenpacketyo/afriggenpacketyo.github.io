          <p>The U.S. Senate has commenced debate on a significant Republican-backed legislative package, facing a tight self-imposed deadline of July 4th. The process is fraught with internal GOP tension, as House leaders work to secure votes while several conservative and moderate members express strong opposition to the Senate's version of the bill. Senator Thom Tillis publicly condemned the legislation, stating it breaks promises made by the president regarding Medicaid protections and criticizing the artificial deadline. The bill's passage remains uncertain as Republican leadership can only afford a few defections to succeed.</p>

          <p>Two firefighters were shot and killed, and a third was critically wounded, after being lured into an ambush in Idaho. Authorities state the suspect intentionally started a wildfire on Canfield Mountain to draw in first responders.

The Kootenai County Sheriff described the incident as a heinous and intentional attack, stating the firefighters "did not have a chance."

          <p>Sumo's newest yokozuna, Onosato, has declared his ambition to win the upcoming Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament in his debut at the sport's highest rank. This feat has only been accomplished by five of the last thirty wrestlers promoted to grand champion. The 25-year-old hopes his success will energize his home prefecture of Ishikawa, which was heavily impacted by the Noto Peninsula earthquake earlier this year. His rapid rise after just 13 tournaments has made him a major star, and he is the first Japanese-born yokozuna since his stablemaster, Kisenosato, in 2017.</p>

          <p>Turkey's largest opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), faces a critical court ruling that could declare its recent party congress null and void. This would delegitimize its entire reform-minded leadership, which took over after the party's 2023 election defeat. The legal challenge was brought by the party's old guard, led by former chairman Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who claim the leadership election was illegal. Observers suggest the trial may be a strategic maneuver by President Erdogan to weaken and divide the increasingly popular opposition, potentially plunging the party into chaos.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has withdrawn its plan to impose a digital services tax on technology firms, paving the way for the resumption of trade talks with the United States. The move came after President Trump suspended negotiations, calling the proposed tax a "blatant attack" on the U.S. The tax would have applied a 3% levy on Canadian revenue for companies like Google and Amazon, retroactive to the tune of $2 billion. Prime Minister Mark Carney's retreat is seen as a victory for the White House, allowing tense negotiations over broader tariffs to continue.</p>

In response, the Chinese ambassador to Ghana, Tong Defa, has pushed back, stating that Chinese citizens cannot obtain local mining licenses and are often brought in by Ghanaian facilitators.

The seasonally adjusted index of production at factories and mines reached 101.8 against the 2020 baseline of 100. This follows a revised 1.1% decrease in industrial output recorded in April.

          <p>Jens Spahn, a leading politician from Germany's conservative CDU/CSU parliamentary group, has called for Europe to develop its own nuclear deterrent capability. Citing the "completely new threat" posed by Russian aggression, Spahn argued that US nuclear weapons stationed in Germany are no longer a sufficient deterrent. He proposed that Germany should seek participation in the nuclear arsenals of France and the United Kingdom, or even develop its own capabilities with other European states. The proposal reflects growing anxiety over European security and reliance on the U.S. nuclear umbrella.</p>

The conflict has evolved into a complex battle combining basic infantry assaults with sophisticated drone warfare, where both sides are in a constant race of innovation and production.

The company's 2020 pivot towards renewable energy under former CEO Bernard Looney, followed by his abrupt departure and a subsequent strategic reset back towards oil and gas, has left investors questioning its direction. Persistently underperforming shares compared to rivals like Shell have fueled rumors that BP could be acquired by another major energy firm.

For many participants, cockfighting represents a desperate livelihood and a gamble that can either lift a family from destitution or ruin it completely.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he has a group of "very wealthy people" prepared to acquire the U.S. operations of TikTok. This comes as the social media platform's Chinese owner, ByteDance, faces a September deadline to divest under a 2024 law citing national security concerns. Trump, who has extended the divestiture deadline three times, stated that he could reveal the buyers' identities within two weeks but noted that any deal would likely require approval from Beijing. The fate of the popular app in the U.S. remains uncertain pending a successful sale.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump reiterated his threat to impose new tariffs on Japanese cars, but drew criticism for his bizarre phrasing during a television interview. Instead of naming Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Trump described a hypothetical letter beginning with "Dear Mr. Japan," before stating his intent to apply a 25% tariff. He argued the move was necessary because Japan does not import enough American cars, a claim complicated by the fact that most Japanese-brand cars sold in the U.S. are already manufactured there. The comments have added to concerns about his administration's diplomatic approach.</p>

          <p>The second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Barry, has made landfall on the east coast of Mexico as a tropical depression. The system, located south of Tampico, is moving northwest with sustained winds of 35 mph. While the storm weakened as it approached the coast, the National Hurricane Center warns it will still bring tropical storm conditions and significant rainfall to the region. Forecasters predict three to six inches of rain, with isolated totals up to ten inches, posing a threat of flooding and mudslides across Veracruz and neighboring states.</p>

          <p>A concerning trend of rising right-wing extremism and nationalism is taking hold among young people in eastern Germany, particularly in cities like Dessau.

This radicalization is occurring in a region that has faced economic decline and depopulation since German reunification. The trend reflects a broader normalization of extremist views, with the far-right AfD party gaining significant political traction in the area.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity contracted for the third straight month in June, signaling persistent weakness in the world's second-largest economy. The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) registered at 49.7, remaining below the 50-point mark that separates contraction from growth. This comes despite government stimulus efforts and indicates ongoing struggles with a supply glut, sluggish consumer demand, and deflationary pressures. While production and new orders showed slight improvement, factory employment continued to decline, painting a challenging picture for China's industrial sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has conditionally resumed imports of Japanese seafood from certain regions, partially lifting a blanket ban imposed in 2023. The original prohibition was a response to Japan's release of treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. According to a customs notice, the measure allows for the import of aquatic products from all areas of Japan except for ten prefectures, including Fukushima, Tokyo, and surrounding regions. This move signals a potential, albeit limited, de-escalation in the diplomatic and trade tensions between the two countries over the issue.</p>

Automakers like Aston Martin and Jaguar Land Rover expect to see a surge in shipments, but the deal is capped at a quota of 100,000 vehicles per year. However, British farmers have criticized the agreement, arguing their sector was used as a bargaining chip, citing the removal of tariffs on US ethanol and new quotas on beef imports.
