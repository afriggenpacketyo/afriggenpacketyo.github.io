          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is standing by his government's efforts to turn away asylum seekers at the country's borders, even after a court ruling blocked the move. The Berlin Administrative Court's decision was a setback for Merz, who promised to curb irregular migration after taking office last month. Merz maintains that border rejections can still be carried out within the framework of existing European law, aiming to protect public safety and prevent overburdening cities and municipalities. Critics have repeatedly challenged Merz's immigration policies as violating both German and EU law, citing insufficient evidence for a "national emergency."</p>

          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader, Lee Jae-myung, is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, according to exit polls. This victory would position him as the next leader after the removal of President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached following a declaration of martial law. Lee's eligibility for the presidency was previously questioned due to election law charges, but a final ruling was postponed. Experts predict Lee will face challenges reviving South Korea's economy and negotiating trade agreements with the U.S., potentially seeking to extend tariff talks beyond the agreed deadline.

          <p>Overnight Russian strikes across Ukraine have resulted in at least seven deaths and 27 injuries, according to local officials. Ukraine's air force reported that it recorded 112 Russian drones launched into the country overnight, with most of the reported deaths occurring in the northeastern regions. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as a deliberate assault on civilians, suggesting that Putin lacks genuine interest in peace despite ongoing negotiations. The attacks occurred after Ukrainian and Russian representatives met for a second round of peace talks in Istanbul, with Russia issuing demands including Ukrainian withdrawal from regions it claims and limitations on Ukraine's armed forces.</p>

Tensions rose after Ishiba reportedly told aides that dissolving the House of Representatives was "in sight."

          <p>An article in *The Atlantic* explores the trend of increasing privatization and its potential consequences, drawing parallels to feudalism. The author discusses how essential functions of the state, such as security, law, and governance, are increasingly being outsourced to private entities. This shift raises concerns about transparency, accountability, and the concentration of power among a small group of wealthy individuals. The author notes that while privatization may offer certain efficiencies, its cumulative effect could lead to a society resembling the Middle Ages, with independent fiefdoms and a decline in public services.</p>

          <p>Three suspects have been arrested in connection with the kidnapping and murder of five Mexican musicians in Tamaulipas state, near the Texas border. The musicians, members of the band Fugitivo, were hired for a performance but were kidnapped while driving to the event. Authorities seized weapons, cartridges, cocaine, and methamphetamines during the operation. The U.S. State Department has been revoking visas of Mexican musicians for playing music that glorifies cartel violence.</p>

          <p>As Ukraine and Russia intensify attacks, the Trump administration is taking a step back from actively mediating the conflict. President Trump has shown growing frustration with the lack of progress toward peace and has become increasingly disengaged. While Secretary of State Rubio reiterated Trump's call for direct talks, the administration has not taken any new steps to impose sanctions on Moscow. Ukraine launched drone strikes inside Russia, and Moscow deployed a record number of drones and missiles against Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Dutch government has collapsed after far-right leader Geert Wilders withdrew his party from the governing coalition due to a dispute over immigration policy. Wilders cited a lack of support for his asylum plans as the reason for his decision, which will likely trigger snap elections. Former coalition partners have accused Wilders of engineering the crisis for political gain. The collapse has raised concerns about the stability of the Netherlands' leadership, especially with the NATO summit scheduled to be held in The Hague later this month.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has decided against signing winger Jadon Sancho on a permanent basis, opting to pay a £5 million penalty to send him back to Manchester United. Sancho moved to Chelsea on loan last summer after a breakdown in his relationship with former United manager Erik ten Hag. Chelsea had an obligation to buy Sancho if they finished higher than 14th in the Premier League, which they did, but they chose to pay the penalty instead. Manchester United, who initially signed Sancho for £73 million, are open to him leaving.</p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has warned that President Trump's tariffs are forecast to hurt global growth. The OECD downgraded its forecast for worldwide growth to 2.9%, citing a "significant" rise in trade barriers. The group also slashed the outlook for the U.S. economy this year from 2.2% to 1.6% and warned of rising inflation. The OECD trimmed its expectations for UK growth this year to 1.3% from 1.4%, noting that growth would be "dampened by heightened trade tensions" and "elevated uncertainty."
