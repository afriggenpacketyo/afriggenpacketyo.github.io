          <p>The Trump administration barred most international students from studying at Harvard University, citing concerns that the school is no longer a trustworthy steward of international student programs. The order suspends the entry of foreign students or exchange visitors planning to attend Harvard, unless their entry is deemed in the national interest, and it directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking visas of current student visa holders. A Harvard spokesperson criticized the order as retaliatory and a violation of the school's First Amendment rights, vowing to protect its international students. This action follows previous attempts by the administration to restrict Harvard's ability to enroll international students and cut off federal funding amid disputes over disciplinary practices and handling of pro-Palestinian protests.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation to suspend foreign student visas for those seeking to study at Harvard University, citing concerns over foreign ties and radicalism. The proclamation directs the State Department to consider revoking existing academic visas of current Harvard students who meet certain criteria. The Trump administration accuses Harvard of failing to provide sufficient information about foreign students' illegal activities and of having extensive entanglements with foreign adversaries, including receiving over $150 million from China. Harvard officials contend that the administration is retaliating against the university for its handling of antisemitism on campus and other issues.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has initiated an investigation into Joe Biden's actions during his presidency, alleging that Biden's top aides masked his cognitive decline. The inquiry will build upon a Republican-led campaign to discredit Biden and overturn some of his executive actions. GOP lawmakers are seeking testimony from Biden's former aides regarding his mental and physical faculties, while a separate inquiry is examining clemencies Biden issued in his final days in office. Trump's memo also targets Biden's use of an autopen, questioning who wielded executive power during Biden's term.</p>

Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. The study suggests that the development of feathers that generate thrust and lift was crucial for the evolution of birds, distinguishing them from most feathered dinosaurs that lacked the same flying capabilities.</p>

The exact mechanism is still being investigated, but it's believed that these bacteria or their byproducts interact with the immune system and influence its maturation.</p>

          <p>The upcoming NBA Finals between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Indiana Pacers marks a generational shift, with both teams primarily composed of Gen Z players. Led by stars like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Tyrese Haliburton, these young teams represent a new blueprint for the league, moving away from the era of super teams. The Thunder, with an average age of 24.148, and the Pacers, at 25.263, are among the youngest teams in NBA history to reach the championship. Both teams have built their rosters through strategic draft picks and trades, connecting with younger fans through social media.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Colorado has temporarily blocked the deportation of the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, the man charged in the Boulder attack. The order aims to preserve the court's jurisdiction over the case, citing potential irreparable harm from deportation without due process. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had announced that ICE had taken Soliman's family into custody for removal proceedings. Soliman, an Egyptian national, is facing multiple charges, including attempted murder and a federal hate crimes charge.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested the FDA to review the latest data on mifepristone, the abortion pill, raising questions about its safety. The FDA confirmed plans for the review but did not specify the timeline or scope. Concerns about the drug's safety have been fueled by a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which claims the pill harms women, though experts argue these concerns are misguided. While the review's impact on access is unclear, the Supreme Court previously rejected a challenge targeting the pill's availability in 2024.</p>
