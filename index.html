          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts publicly defended the independence of the judiciary, criticizing attempts to impeach judges due to disagreements with their rulings. Speaking at an event in Buffalo, Roberts emphasized that impeachment is not a suitable response to judicial decisions, echoing his previous statements against political interference in the judiciary. His remarks follow similar comments from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who denounced attacks on judges and harassment that undermine the Constitution. Roberts' defense comes amid intense pressure on the Supreme Court regarding challenges to Trump administration policies and increased scrutiny of federal judges.</p>

          <p>Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins testified that the USDA is actively recruiting to fill key positions after offering 15,000 employees deferred resignations. This program, aimed at downsizing the federal workforce, has faced scrutiny due to the immediate need to fill vacated roles. Rollins acknowledged potential mistakes but insisted that critical positions were not included in the second round of resignations. The agency is even open to rehiring some employees who accepted the offer, if they held key roles, to address staffing gaps.</p>

Boise's mayor issued a proclamation retroactively making the pride flag an official city flag. These measures respond to state laws restricting flag displays to official flags, and demonstrate support for LGBTQ+ rights amid conservative efforts to roll back such protections.</p>

          <p>West Virginia coal miners are losing access to free black lung screenings after President Trump slashed funding for the worker safety agency NIOSH.
