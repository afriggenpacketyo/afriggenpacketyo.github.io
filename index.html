          <p>George Simion, a nationalist candidate, secured a significant victory in the first round of Romania's presidential election, leading with 40% of the vote. The election, a rerun after the annulment of the initial results due to fraud allegations, is being closely watched by European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow, given Romania's strategic importance in supporting Ukraine. Simion, an admirer of Donald Trump, advocates for a strong NATO presence while also expressing concerns about financial support for Ukrainian refugees. The upcoming runoff on May 18 will determine Romania's future direction and its relationship with key international players, with the Trump administration reassessing its commitment to Romania.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Egg freezing has become a popular option for women to preserve their fertility, with the number of procedures increasing significantly in recent years. The process involves hormone injections to stimulate egg production, followed by surgical retrieval and cryopreservation. While it offers women more control over their reproductive timelines, egg freezing is expensive, with costs ranging from $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, plus annual storage fees and additional expenses for thawing and fertilization. Experts emphasize that it is essential to have realistic expectations and be aware of the potential risks and uncertainties associated with the procedure.</p>

The oil price decline also comes amid fears of a recession triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, which could slow demand.

          <p>Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh stated that the team's decision on whether to retain kicker Justin Tucker will be based on "football" considerations, despite ongoing sexual misconduct allegations. The Ravens drafted Arizona kicker Tyler Loop, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Tucker's future. The accusations against Tucker include claims of inappropriate sexual behavior during massage therapy sessions, which he denies. Tucker, considered one of the greatest kickers in NFL history, had a subpar season in 2024, converting only 73.3% of his field goals.</p>

          <p>Rory Truex, a China expert at Princeton University, analyzes President Trump's evolving China policy, noting the shift from initial ease to aggressive trade tactics. Truex suggests that Trump's actions, including tariffs and rhetoric, might be bargaining tactics rather than a desire for a broader reset of the relationship. He emphasizes Trump's affinity for authoritarian leaders and the potential for a broader realignment. Truex also highlights the growing pressure in Washington for policy specialists to adopt an anti-China stance.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to retaliate against the Houthis after a missile fired by the group struck near Israel's main airport. The missile, launched from Yemen by the Iran-backed group, landed near the main terminal of Ben Gurion airport, causing minor injuries and prompting a temporary suspension of flights. The Houthis said they would impose a comprehensive aerial blockade on Israel, targeting its airports in response to Israeli military plans to expand operations in Gaza.

International negotiations have failed to reach a new ceasefire deal and the release of the remaining hostages. An expanded offensive will put more pressure on reservists and raise questions about Netanyahu's intentions in Gaza.</p>
