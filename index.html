          <p>President Trump's announced tariffs have sparked debate due to discrepancies between the administration's stated rates and data from the World Trade Organization.  Trump presented a poster board outlining tariffs supposedly levied by other countries against the U.S., and the reciprocal tariffs the U.S. would impose. However, independent analysis reveals that the administration's figures significantly overstate the average tariff rates imposed by many countries. This raises questions about the accuracy and transparency of the Trump administration's tariff calculations.</p>

          <p>Actor Adam Devine discusses his recent health scare, initially diagnosed with stiff person syndrome, a potentially fatal condition.  After further medical evaluation, the diagnosis was revised, attributing his muscle spasms to injuries sustained in a childhood accident and possibly overexertion during pandemic lockdowns.  Devine's intense workout regimen during the pandemic is suggested as a contributing factor to his health issues.  He is currently undergoing stem-cell treatments and reports some improvement.</p>

          <p>Experts criticized President Trump's tariff formula for misrepresenting global trade economics.  The administration's claim of "reciprocal" tariffs was challenged due to inconsistencies in the calculations and the underlying assumptions.  The formula, which appears to use trade deficits and import figures, is deemed flawed by economists who highlight the complexities of trade balances.  This analysis points to the formula's failure to reflect modern economic realities and its potential to yield unintended consequences.</p>
