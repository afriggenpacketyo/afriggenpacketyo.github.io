          <p>HSBC's first-quarter results surpassed expectations, driven by strong performance in its wealth business and corporate and institutional banking segment. The bank announced a share buyback of up to $3 billion, expected to be completed before the announcement of its 2025 interim results. While profit before tax declined 25% year-on-year and revenue fell 15%, profit soared nearly 317% from the previous quarter. The bank warned of macroeconomic uncertainty and the adverse effects of protectionist trade policies on consumer and business sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal party secured a victory in Canada's federal election, attributed to a backlash against Donald Trump's statements about Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state and tariff threats. The Liberals are projected to win enough seats to form a government, although it's unclear if they will secure a majority. Carney's campaign focused on the threat Trump posed to Canada's sovereignty and economy, leading to a political turnaround for the party. Carney plans to start negotiations on a new economic and security relationship with the U.S. following the election.</p>

          <p>China's military is rapidly deploying low-cost, AI-powered drones to gain an edge in modern warfare technology. One of the latest is a micro drone resembling a thermal flask, designed for use across infantry units.

The PLA Daily described this as a "phased leap" in unmanned combat technology, transitioning to deep integration within operations and eventually autonomous systems, vital for defining future battlefield rules.</p>

          <p>Congress has approved the TAKE IT DOWN Act, a bill supported by Melania Trump that aims to implement strict penalties for publishing and promoting revenge porn. The act subjects offenders to prison time, a fine, or both for publishing "intimate visual depictions" of people without their consent or with harmful intent. Public forums would have to incorporate a way for subjects of revenge porn to request that it be scrubbed, with platforms having 48 hours to remove the content. Melania Trump stated that the bill is a powerful statement that the country stands united in protecting the dignity, privacy, and safety of its children.</p>

          <p>Approximately 55,000 L.A. County workers initiated a two-day strike, leading to disruptions in public services such as healthcare, social work, libraries, and parks. SEIU Local 721 cited the county's failure to fairly negotiate a new contract and alleged labor law violations as the reasons for the strike. Libraries and some healthcare clinics will be closed, while hospitals will remain open. The union is also protesting what it considers an insultingly low pay offer from the county, which cited wildfire costs, a massive sexual assault settlement, and the loss of federal grants as reasons for its financial constraints.</p>

          <p>Millions of Canadians voted in a federal election focused on candidates' responses to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats and calls to make Canada the 51st U.S. state. Prime Minister Mark Carney called the election shortly after taking over from Justin Trudeau. The Liberal Party and the Conservative Party are competing for seats in Parliament. Results are expected to be projected shortly after polls close, but the determination of a minority or majority government may take longer.

          <p>President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown now includes targeting unaccompanied minors for deportation, with the Department of Homeland Security conducting "welfare checks" on children who arrived in the U.S. alone. These moves have sparked fears of a crackdown and concerns about "backdoor family separation." The president has also signed executive orders targeting "sanctuary cities" that obstruct federal immigration laws. This intensification of immigration enforcement raises concerns about the treatment of vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>A research team predicts that without serious efforts to tackle global warming, students in Japan may no longer be able to engage in extracurricular outdoor sports in summer by the 2060s. Heat stress projections indicate that all or intense outdoor sporting activity would need to be avoided for some time between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. in July and August in most areas, excluding Hokkaido. The team's model is based on weather data and heat stress measurements in 842 cities over a 12-year period.</p>

DOGE said this was a great job by the Justice Department for prosecuting voter fraud where a noncitizen voted in a federal election.</p>

Studies suggest drought, sea level rise, severe storms, and dredging are partly to blame for the increase in saltwater intrusion.</p>
