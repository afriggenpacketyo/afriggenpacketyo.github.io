          <h2>Harvard University Sues Trump Administration Over Funding Freeze</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to halt a freeze of $2.2 million in funding, alleging the administration is trying to control academic decision-making. Harvard President Alan Garber accused the administration of trying to dictate what private universities can teach and who they can admit, following months of student activism related to the war in Gaza. The lawsuit claims the administration's actions threaten Harvard's academic independence and critical research, including efforts to improve cancer treatment and predict infectious disease outbreaks. The Trump administration has not yet responded to the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Chinese and French scientists have created a detailed map of the crab-eating macaque's claustrum, a brain region believed to be important for consciousness. The map shows connections between nerve cells in the claustrum and other brain areas, which could help understand cognitive functions like memory and abstract thinking. Researchers also found differences between macaque and rodent claustrums, potentially providing insights into the evolution of consciousness. While the claustrum is known to orchestrate brain functions, its molecular and cellular organization had been poorly understood, making this a significant advancement.</p>

          <p>A minke whale that was found in Long Beach Harbor has died from domoic acid poisoning, linked to a toxic algal bloom affecting marine life in Southern California.

          <p>US trade officials have finalized tariff levels on solar cells and panels from Southeast Asia, concluding a year-long trade case brought by American manufacturers. The Commerce Department imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on solar equipment from Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The case was initiated by US solar manufacturers seeking to protect their investments, accusing Chinese companies with factories in Southeast Asia of unfair pricing and subsidies. The dumping duties range from 6.1% to 271.28%, while anti-subsidy duties are between 14.64% and 3,403.96%.</p>

          <p>President Trump defended his administration's deportation policies, stating that giving everyone a trial would take an impractical amount of time. This comes amid increasing deportations of Venezuelan migrants, some without criminal records. Lawyers have challenged the administration's use of a wartime law to deport migrants without judicial review, leading to Supreme Court intervention. The court ruled that deportations can continue only if detainees are given due process to challenge their removal.</p>

This marks a shift from the 2021 election when the environment was a top voter concern.</p>

This announcement coincides with staff reductions at Federal Student Aid, raising concerns about borrower support.
