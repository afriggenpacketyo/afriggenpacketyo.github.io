          <p>Despite years of U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese tech giant Huawei has transformed into a dominant force in the artificial intelligence sector. The company has expanded beyond telecommunications into AI chips, data centers, and large language models, positioning itself as a key competitor to American firms like Nvidia. Analysts note that U.S. sanctions inadvertently bolstered Huawei's status as a national champion, accelerating its development of a comprehensive AI ecosystem. The article highlights Huawei's resilience and innovation, which have enabled it to challenge established leaders in the global tech landscape.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are increasingly viewing the Singapore dollar (SGD) as a potential safe-haven asset, particularly amid uncertainty surrounding traditional choices like the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen. The currency's stability is attributed to Singapore's strong institutional framework, prudent fiscal policies, and unique monetary management system. However, its path to becoming a global standard is hindered by the relatively small size of its market and limited trading volume compared to established safe havens. While it may not replace the top-tier currencies soon, analysts believe the SGD is becoming a key option for diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida has set an August 19 execution date for Kayle Bates, a 67-year-old man on death row for the 1982 murder of Janet White. Bates was convicted of abducting the 24-year-old woman from her workplace, attempting to sexually assault her, and then stabbing her to death. The execution was scheduled after Governor Ron DeSantis signed the death warrant, marking the tenth scheduled execution in the state for the year. Bates' attorney has stated they will file further appeals, arguing the execution would be unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>The United States is introducing a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for all nonimmigrant visa applicants, including tourists and students. This fee, part of the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is in addition to existing visa application costs. While the provision allows for reimbursement if visitors comply with their visa terms, the implementation details remain unclear, causing concern among travel industry advocates. The policy aims to enhance immigration system integrity, but critics worry it may deter inbound travel ahead of major international events.</p>

The defeat undermines the coalition's legislative power, having already lost its majority in the more powerful lower house last year.

          <p>President Trump has threatened to obstruct the Washington Commanders' plans for a new stadium in D.C. unless the NFL team reverts to its former name, the "Redskins." In a social media post, Trump claimed there is a "big clamoring" for the change and that he might not approve a deal for the stadium without it. The team dropped the controversial name in 2020 after decades of criticism that it was a racist slur against Indigenous people. It remains unclear what authority Trump could use to intervene in the project.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why Canada Has Become a North American Measles Hotspot</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada is currently experiencing a significant measles outbreak, with infection numbers nearly three times higher than in the U.S., making it a top-10 global hotspot. The surge, most prominent in Ontario and Alberta, is primarily linked to low vaccination rates, particularly within some Low German-speaking Mennonite communities. Experts point to post-pandemic vaccine hesitancy, fueled by misinformation and a general distrust in the healthcare system, as a key driver. Health officials warn that the reported cases are likely just the "tip of the iceberg" and stress that increasing MMR vaccination is the only way to stop the spread.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread market anxiety over looming trade tariffs, analyst Jim Cramer argues that numerous underlying factors are creating a bullish environment for stocks. He points to strong corporate earnings, massive economic stimulus from the "big beautiful bill," and significant tax relief for both consumers and businesses. Cramer also highlights the economic boost from required investments in data centers, the energy sector, and aerospace. He suggests these powerful tailwinds are being underestimated and will likely propel the economy and the market forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has issued a stark warning that people retiring in 2050 will be financially worse off than today's pensioners unless retirement savings are significantly boosted. Citing analysis that four in ten people are not saving enough, the Department for Work and Pensions is reviving the Pensions Commission. The commission will investigate why many, particularly the self-employed, low earners, and certain ethnic groups, are not contributing to private pensions. The goal is to build a national consensus on a new strategy to avert a future retirement crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has declined, with a majority now disapproving of the use of detention facilities. This shift corresponds with a perception that the program is targeting more than just dangerous criminals. The poll also reveals that a majority of Americans, including those outside Trump's political base, believe the administration should focus more on lowering prices rather than on tariffs or spending cuts. Overall approval for the president has continued to slide, nearing levels seen during his first term.</p>

While X-rays were negative, the injury adds to the frustration of a team that has been outscored 71-36 during its recent slump.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain's massive High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project, now billions over budget and years behind schedule, is being cited as a case study in mismanagement. Insiders and analysts suggest the project was troubled from its inception due to uniquely British challenges, including the complexities of building on a densely populated, property-owning island. The ambition to build the world's fastest line drove up costs, while the democratic planning process led to thousands of expensive compromises and delays. This has led to questions about whether the UK's system is capable of delivering such large-scale infrastructure projects efficiently.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has confirmed it will launch a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1984-85 miners' strike. The incident involved thousands of police officers clashing with striking miners outside a coking plant in Rotherham, leading to numerous injuries and 95 arrests. The subsequent trial against the miners collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for decades, welcomed the news as a long-overdue step toward truth and justice for the affected mining communities.</p>
