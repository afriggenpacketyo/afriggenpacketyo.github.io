          <p>Representative Jim Himes, the leading Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, voiced apprehension regarding the recent U.S. attacks against Iran, characterizing them as a "massive gamble" by President Trump and drawing parallels to past U.S. military engagements in the Middle East. Himes highlighted the historical pattern of initial success followed by long-term costs, citing conflicts in Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan as examples where early gains were offset by prolonged instability and significant casualties. He emphasized that it is premature to celebrate the attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities and urged caution, advocating for restraint in optimism. Furthermore, Himes expressed concern over the lack of Congressional approval for the strikes, asserting that Congress holds the constitutional authority to declare war.</p>

          <h2>Strait of Hormuz's Vital Role in Oil Trade Faces Potential Iranian Retaliation</h2>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, particularly the possibility of Iran blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz is a crucial global trade route connecting the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, facilitating the transit of millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products daily. Disruption to oil flow through the strait could significantly impact international energy markets and economies, potentially leading to higher oil and gas prices. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that any Iranian effort to block the strait would be a "suicidal move" that would likely provoke backlash from numerous countries, including China, which relies heavily on the strait for its oil imports.</p>

Big Hit Entertainment, BTS's management agency, confirmed that Suga completed his alternative service duties, with no special events planned for his release due to concerns about overcrowding. In South Korea, all eligible men between 18 and 28 are required to serve in the military for 18 to 21 months, though special exemptions are granted to athletes and classical musicians who have achieved significant recognition. BTS members were able to postpone their service until the age of 30, and the group plans to reunite as a whole in 2025.</p>

          <p>Representative Thomas Massie has accused President Trump of betraying his campaign pledges with the recent strikes on Iran, expressing feeling "misled" and asserting that Trump is allowing neoconservatives to dictate foreign policy. Massie, a conservative libertarian, has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration's actions, arguing that the strikes constitute an act of war requiring Congressional approval. He is co-leading a resolution with Representative Ro Khanna to prevent unauthorized U.S. military action in Iran, despite likely opposition from pro-Israel groups and congressional leaders. Massie contends that the strikes are a needless escalation of tensions in the Middle East, especially amid ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, and that the Republican base may become apathetic as a result.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is defending its recent precision strike on Iranian nuclear sites, asserting it was a limited engagement to disrupt Iran's nuclear capabilities and not indicative of plans for longer involvement in the conflict between Iran and Israel. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the action was not an attack on Iran or its people, but rather to degrade nuclear weaponization ambitions. However, some lawmakers, including Republican Representative Thomas Massie, argue that Trump acted without Congressional approval, violating the War Powers Act. Democrats, such as Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Kelly, have also voiced concerns, stating that Trump's actions escalate the risk for American troops in the region and that Congress should have been involved from the start.</p>

Israeli leaders lauded the U.S. strikes, while Iranian officials condemned the action and vowed to defend their sovereignty. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed grave alarm and called for de-escalation and diplomacy. Allies of Iran, including Hamas and the Houthis, condemned the "American aggression" and pledged to join in retaliation, while Saudi Arabia expressed "deep concern" and called for restraint and de-escalation. China's state-run media suggested the U.S. could be repeating its "Iraq mistake," and the U.K. Prime Minister called on Iran to negotiate.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's decision to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities is described as a significant gamble with potential far-reaching consequences for his political reputation, the Middle East, and the concept of military intervention. Success could empower Trump, diminish Iran's influence, and strengthen the U.S. alliance with Benjamin Netanyahu, but also risks alienating European leaders and prompting a response from China and Russia. Gulf states fear being drawn into a wider conflict, and Iran may abandon the non-proliferation treaty and attempt to rebuild its nuclear program in secret. Sanam Vakil of Chatham House suggests Trump views the strike as a one-off event aimed at securing a negotiation and a deal that sets back Iran's nuclear program, but a careful de-escalation is fraught with risk.</p>

The Syrian Interior Ministry attributed the attack to an extremist from the Islamic State group, who entered the church and fired at the people before detonating an explosive vest.

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from potentially closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global oil trade route. This appeal comes in the wake of U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and warnings from Iran that it reserves the right to defend its sovereignty. Blocking the Strait of Hormuz could have severe consequences for the global economy, as it facilitates the transit of approximately 20% of the world's daily crude oil consumption. Rubio stated that closing the strait would be "economic suicide" for Iran, as its own oil exports also pass through the waterway, and that the U.S. retains options to address any Iranian attempts to block the strait.</p>

          <p>US Vice President JD Vance stated that the U.S. is only at war with Iran's nuclear program, not Iran itself, following U.S. airstrikes ordered by President Trump.

He accused Iran of not negotiating in good faith during previous diplomatic talks, which he said prompted the U.S. strikes. Vance added that the U.S. does not seek regime change in Iran but desires a long-term settlement that ensures Iran is not a threat to its neighbors or the United States.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefing following the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites offered details on the military operation, but lacked clarity on future actions. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the bombing an "incredible and overwhelming success" and emphasized that the U.S. wants Iran to negotiate peace, while threatening further aggression if it doesn't. Despite President Trump's claim of Iran's nuclear sites being "obliterated," General Dan Caine revised that assessment to "extremely severe damage." The U.S. aims for the attack to be a "one-and-done" event, but faces an Iran talking of a closed diplomatic door and seeking support from Russia, creating uncertainty about the future.</p>

Satellite images, however, show that the main support building at the Fordo facility remained undamaged, and analysts are conflicted on whether the strikes will bring Iran to the negotiating table or push it toward assembling a nuclear bomb.

          <p>A gunman opened fire during a service at a church in Wayne, Michigan, wounding one person before being shot and killed by a security guard. The person shot in the leg was the security guard, while a church member ran the attacker over with a truck, giving the security guard time to shoot him. About 150 people were attending the service at Crosspointe Community Church when the incident occurred. The church had established a security team a decade ago in response to violence at other places of worship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Raul A. Reyes argues that the practice of ICE agents wearing masks during enforcement operations is a concerning trend that undermines their authority and endangers public safety. He contends that masked agents can confuse both bystanders and targets, potentially leading to interference in law enforcement actions and increasing the risk of people impersonating agents. Reyes points out that the federal government's lack of a specific policy prohibiting masks creates a double standard, as it has demanded universities ban students from wearing masks during protests. He concludes that the need for accountability outweighs any justification for agent anonymity and calls for Congress to prohibit the use of masks by immigration agents.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, U.S. leaders are urging Iran to choose diplomacy over retaliation. President Trump stated that Iran must now make peace, warning of far greater tragedy if it continues on its current path. Officials are calling for a diplomatic process and threatening additional military action should Iran retaliate for the U.S. attack. The U.S. is sending messages directly to Iran, offering an opportunity to come to the table and take steps toward peace, but also emphasizing that the scope of the U.S. attack was intentionally limited and not aimed at regime change.</p>

Searches of major wire services found no reports of such an announcement, and the rumor likely originated from an X post by an account not affiliated with any government entity. The claim was shared amid escalating tensions in the Middle East, but lacked credible evidence to support its validity. Snopes contacted Iran's ministry of foreign affairs for clarification but has not yet received a response.</p>

          <p>President Trump had already approved a plan for the U.S. to attack an Iranian nuclear facility before a scheduled lunch with Steve Bannon.

However, a White House official claims that Trump had already decided to hold off on the strike before the meeting with Bannon.

While Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed down slightly, other Gulf markets, including Qatar and Bahrain, saw gains. Egypt's EGX30 was the major gainer in the region, closing significantly higher. Fadi Arbid of Amwal Capital Partners suggested that the Gulf's distancing from the conflict and calls for peaceful resolution have helped isolate it from significant market impact.

          <p>The United States has entered the conflict between Israel and Iran by launching attacks on key Iranian uranium enrichment sites. The Pentagon confirmed that seven B-2 Spirit bombers carried out the attacks, using "bunker-busting" warheads to target subterranean nuclear facilities. While President Trump claimed the attacks were a "spectacular military success," the extent of the damage is yet to be independently verified. The attacks have drawn mixed reactions globally, with praise from Israel, condemnation from Iran, and concerns from regional governments and traditional U.S. allies.</p>
