          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson and other prominent Republicans are publicly urging Attorney General Pam Bondi to clarify her previous statements and provide transparency regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case files. This call for openness is echoed by figures like Rep. Tim Burchett and Sen. Josh Hawley, who are pushing for Ghislaine Maxwell to testify before Congress. The growing pressure from within the GOP, coupled with similar demands from Democrats, highlights a rare point of bipartisan agreement focused on resolving public questions about the extent of Epstein's network and potential cover-ups.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon announced the release of 2,000 California National Guard members from their federal mission in Los Angeles, which was initiated to address protests against immigration enforcement. This withdrawal accounts for half the troops deployed by President Trump, an action taken despite objections from Governor Gavin Newsom. Newsom has called for the remaining forces to be returned as well, stating they have been used as "political pawns." The deployment had sparked a legal battle over presidential authority, with the administration citing the need to quell disorder and protect federal agents.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives is considering the "Genius Act," a bipartisan bill that seeks to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation would define legal categories for stablecoins and establish consumer protections, potentially allowing banks and credit unions to issue their own versions. Proponents argue this will facilitate faster and cheaper financial transactions, while critics point to risks such as the potential for "depegging" from their underlying asset, as seen during the 2023 banking turmoil.

Over half of the 330 individuals interviewed had lived in the country for at least a decade, with more than a third residing here for over 20 years. Furthermore, nearly one-third of those detained have U.S.-born children, challenging the notion that they are recent arrivals.

On a monthly basis, prices increased by 0.3%, the largest jump since January, driven partly by rising energy costs. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose by a slightly lower 2.9% annually. The data suggests that new tariffs may be starting to influence prices in some sectors, though analysts believe underlying inflation remains relatively contained, making a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in July unlikely.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer highlighted the unpredictable nature of earnings season, using recent stock movements of Nvidia, BlackRock, and Wells Fargo as examples. He expressed satisfaction with Nvidia's stock surge after news of its ability to sell chips in China, but was disappointed by the negative market reactions to BlackRock and Wells Fargo's earnings reports. Cramer noted that investors focused on BlackRock's lower net inflows and Wells Fargo's reduced guidance for net interest income. He reiterated his long-term confidence in the banks but acknowledged the immediate, and sometimes harsh, judgments of the market during earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

Torres was convicted in 2001 based on shaky witness testimony, despite having a solid alibi and a cast on his arm that would have made firing a gun difficult. His conviction was vacated in 2021 after efforts from the California Innocence Project and the L.A. County District Attorney's Conviction Integrity Unit. A judge declared him factually innocent in 2022, leading to the civil settlement for his two decades of wrongful incarceration.</p>

Murdoch was serving a life sentence and never revealed the location of Falconio's body, an act of silence that denied the victim's family closure. The murder occurred on a remote highway where Murdoch shot Falconio and attempted to kidnap his girlfriend, Joanne Lees, who managed to escape. Despite his death, Northern Territory Police remain committed to finding Falconio's remains and have reiterated a substantial reward for information leading to their discovery.</p>

A Reuters analysis reveals a "dual-speed economy" where strong, export-focused industries are propped up by state support, while weak domestic demand and deflationary pressures squeeze company profits and, in turn, worker incomes. The article features personal stories of state firm employees and teachers taking on side hustles or relying on family to make ends meet. This growing disparity highlights the human cost of policies that prioritize industrial output over household consumption and welfare. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be retitled as "assistants" to avoid patient confusion. The review, authored by Prof. Gillian Leng, also calls for standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors and states they should not be diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow concerns from patients and doctors' unions about the lack of clarity and potential safety risks associated with the roles, which were introduced to support doctors but have seen their responsibilities expand without a clear national plan.</p>

The ad for its cucumber, mint, and magnesium drink suggested it could be used to "find some calm" or "unwind." The watchdog ruled that this and other language implied the drink could treat anxiety, a health claim not permitted for food products on the official UK register. The ASA also found that claims about the drink's ingredients and its sugar content were inaccurate and in breach of advertising codes.</p>

He was convicted of treason and insurrection by a military court, but his family has long argued the trial was unjust and politically motivated by the new military regime. The retrial re-examines a pivotal moment in South Korean history, forcing a modern reflection on a man viewed by some as a traitor and others as a patriot.</p>

A spokesperson for Schiff stated that he has always been transparent about owning homes in both California and the Washington D.C. area and has followed all laws and guidance.
