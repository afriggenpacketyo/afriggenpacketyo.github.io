          <p>German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil is scheduled to present the initial draft of the 2025 budget, which has been delayed due to national elections in February. This budget follows Germany's parliament approval in March of a significant fiscal package that includes modifications to debt policies, facilitating increased spending on defense and a ‚Ç¨500 billion infrastructure fund. The announcement will come after a press conference, scheduled for 10:45 a.m. (0845 GMT/UTC), where further details are expected to be revealed. The budget's focus on defense and infrastructure reflects Germany's strategic priorities for the coming year. The budget update is highly anticipated given the economic challenges facing the country. </p>

          <p>An Irvine couple operating a dog training service, Kwong ‚ÄúTony‚Äù Chun Sit and Tingfeng Liu, have been arrested and charged with multiple felony counts related to the deaths of at least 11 dogs. The investigation began after a dog owner reported their healthy dog died in its sleep and was cremated without explanation, raising suspicions. Authorities discovered that some dogs died from heatstroke and blunt-force trauma, while others were cremated before examination. District Attorney Todd Spitzer condemned the couple's actions, emphasizing that animal abuse will not be tolerated, as the couple are being held on bail of $550,000 and face significant prison sentences if convicted.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, following a week of aerial attacks that began after Israel's strike on Iran's nuclear program. Iran reportedly launched a missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in response to the U.S. sending B-2 bombers to drop 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs on Iranian nuclear sites. Trump stated that "Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran," though a full battle damage assessment is pending. The ceasefire announcement comes after escalating tensions and military actions between the two countries, with the U.S. playing a significant role in mediating the agreement.</p>

He emphasized that the protests were marked by violence and vandalism, justifying the police's actions to restore public safety. However, critics and eyewitnesses have raised questions about the use of force against non-threatening individuals, and the LAPD likely faces civil litigation alleging excessive force.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a "Complete and Total" ceasefire, aiming to end the weeklong conflict, although Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi's remarks suggested less certainty about the agreement. According to Trump's timeline, Iran would cease striking Israel within six hours, followed by Israel ceasing strikes on Iran 12 hours later, with the war considered over after another 12 hours. Araghchi indicated Iran had already stopped its strikes but stated there was no formal agreement on a ceasefire, and the final decision on ceasing military operations would be made later. The conflict began with Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, prompting Iranian counterattacks on Israel, and the U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend.</p>

          <p>Eight people have died on Lake Tahoe after multiple boats capsized due to a sudden storm that brought high winds and large swells. The incident occurred on Saturday, during what was supposed to be the first official weekend of summer. Witnesses described a rapid change in weather conditions, with winds reaching 35mph and waves causing boats to crash into each other and onto the shore. The tragedy has prompted investigations into boating safety and weather preparedness on the popular alpine lake.</p>

          <p>Over 100 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's proposed changes to the benefits system, which aims to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments by ¬£5 billion a year by 2030. The amendment expresses concerns about the potential increase in relative poverty, lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessment on the job market and people's health. If the amendment is selected by the House Speaker and gains majority support, the welfare reform bill could be halted. The government has a working majority of 165 in the Commons, meaning that 83 Labour MPs would need to oppose the bill to force a parliamentary defeat.</p>

The plan has drawn criticism, with Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniela Levine Cava expressing concerns about the potential environmental impact on the Everglades ecosystem.

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume expedited deportations of certain immigrants to countries other than their own, without advance warning or the chance to challenge their removal based on potential torture or death.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor criticized the decision as a gross abuse of the Court's discretion, noting that the government wrongfully deported individuals despite evidence of potential torture.

          <p>President Trump took a gamble by involving the U.S. in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, which may have resulted in a potential ceasefire. Trump announced that the two countries agreed to a ceasefire that could lead to lasting peace, although neither Israel nor Iran has definitively confirmed the development. White House officials are privately promoting this as a diplomatic breakthrough after U.S. airstrikes hit Iranian nuclear facilities. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi indicated that Iran would halt its attacks if Israel stopped its aggression, leading to a de-escalation after a day of Iranian missile strikes on a U.S. base in Qatar.</p>

The ruling coincided with President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, which he dubbed "THE 12 DAY WAR."

The NWS warns of numerous daily record maximum and minimum temperatures from the Midwest to the East Coast through at least Wednesday. Over 150 million Americans are under extreme heat alerts, with the total number affected rising to about 200 million. Meteorologists attribute the heat wave to a heat dome, an area of high pressure trapping heat and humidity, making the first heat waves of the season particularly dangerous as bodies have not yet adjusted to warmer temperatures.</p>

Combs has admitted to domestic violence but denies the prosecution's charges, some of which rely on laws originally aimed at mob bosses. Witnesses, including ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura and rapper Kid Cudi, testified about Combs's alleged abuse and coercion, presenting a compelling case. However, jurors were also shown loving text messages from the alleged victims, and prosecutors lost a third alleged victim's testimony, potentially complicating the case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's dominance in rare earth production is increasingly reliant on supplies from Myanmar, despite Beijing's efforts to control rare earth exports. Myanmar accounts for about 57% of China's total rare earth imports, particularly heavy rare earth elements like dysprosium and terbium, crucial for high-tech manufacturing. This reliance has strengthened China's monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain, as extraction is concentrated in Myanmar, while processing occurs in China. Environmental concerns and labor practices in Myanmar's rare earth mining industry raise ethical questions about the supply chain.</p>
