          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has stated that universities must act decisively to protect Jewish students from an "unacceptable increase in antisemitism." In response, the government is funding training programs for university staff and students to identify and tackle harassment and hate. The move comes amid reports of Jewish students feeling unsafe on campuses and a significant rise in antisemitic incidents in recent academic years. The government has allocated funds to support these initiatives and to teach students about the Holocaust and how to identify misinformation.</p>

          <p>As the US government shutdown continues, some federal workers are experiencing confusion regarding their employment status. Approximately 700 of the 1,300 CDC employees who received layoff notices on Friday were reinstated after the Department of Health and Human Services stated the notices were sent in error. However, Vice President JD Vance warned that deeper cuts could be ahead if the funding impasse between Democrats and Republicans is not resolved. The shutdown has also led to the closure of Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo in Washington D.C.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of California, Irvine, have found that inulin, a type of dietary fiber, may protect the body from damage caused by fructose. The study, published in Nature Metabolism, indicates that inulin alters gut bacteria in the small intestine, enabling them to metabolize fructose before it reaches the liver, where it can cause fat buildup. This process was shown to prevent and even reverse signs of fatty liver disease in non-obese participants. The findings highlight how specific fibers can play a crucial role in metabolic health beyond aiding digestion.</p>

While some media outlets framed this as "extra holidays," the policy merely codifies an existing practice rooted in religious freedom, similar to accommodations made for other non-Christian faiths. The discussion highlights Germany's ongoing conversation about integration and equality, as the country navigates a patchwork of state-regulated public holidays in an evolving demographic landscape.

          <p>Madagascar's government has announced that an illegal and forceful attempt to seize power is in progress. An army unit known as CAPSAT, which was instrumental in President Andry Rajoelina's 2009 rise to power, claimed it has taken control of the military command. The unrest follows weeks of escalating youth-led protests against utility shortages, corruption, and the high cost of living. Protesters have gathered in the capital's main square, with some CAPSAT troops reportedly joining them. The African Union has expressed deep concern and urged dialogue to resolve the escalating crisis.</p>

          <p>The first phase of a U.S.-brokered peace plan between Israel and Hamas involves a complex exchange of hostages and prisoners set for Monday. Hamas is expected to release its remaining 48 hostages, including 20 believed to be alive, in exchange for Israel releasing approximately 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,722 detainees. The agreement, which began with a ceasefire on Friday, also includes a partial Israeli troop withdrawal and the deployment of a multinational monitoring force. Subsequent phases of the plan, which call for Gaza's demilitarization and new governance, face significant hurdles and potential disagreements.</p>

          <p>US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has labeled China's recent tightening of export controls on rare earth minerals as a "power grab." He stated that the US was not notified of the new measures in advance and that China deferred a request for a phone call to discuss the matter. The move by Beijing, which controls a majority of the global supply of these critical materials, has been seen as an escalation in trade tensions. It prompted a retaliatory tariff threat from President Trump and contributed to a significant sell-off in the U.S. stock market.</p>

          <p>Germany has signaled its readiness to help lead the rebuilding of Gaza following the recent conflict, with Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul proposing a reconstruction conference co-hosted with Egypt. German officials across the ruling coalition have supported this initiative, citing humanitarian, security, and migration policy reasons. The plan would require a political framework leading to a two-state solution and would necessitate Israel's involvement. However, the proposal faces challenges, as Israel has criticized a recent related meeting in Paris, and the broader U.S.-led peace plan assigns only a minor role to European nations.</p>

Germany's Constitutional Court had previously raised concerns about the conditions of detention and the potential for a fair trial, given the case's politicization by Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The situation is contrasted with that of co-accused Ilaria Salis, whose new status as a Member of the European Parliament has granted her immunity from the Hungarian proceedings, a decision that has outraged Budapest.</p>
