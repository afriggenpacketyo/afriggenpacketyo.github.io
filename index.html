          <p>A new tax provision championed by President Trump, intended to eliminate taxes on tips, is causing significant confusion. The law does not eliminate taxes entirely but instead offers a deduction of up to $25,000, which phases out for higher earners. Key details, such as which specific occupations qualify for the break, remain undefined by the IRS, leaving workers and tax professionals uncertain about its application. This ambiguity is compounded by concerns over the underreporting of cash tips, a long-standing issue that could affect eligibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. is calling for a thorough investigation into the death of Saif Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian American allegedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers in the West Bank. Musallet's family claims he was attacked while protecting his family's land and that medical assistance was blocked for hours. The incident occurs amid rising settler violence, with the UN reporting a significant increase in attacks on Palestinians. While Israeli authorities state an investigation is underway and arrests were made, Musallet's family has not been informed of any progress, fueling calls for accountability.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has defended Constitutional Court nominee Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf against what he termed "unacceptable" and "personally insulting" attacks from the political right. The nomination, proposed by the junior coalition partner Social Democrats, was stalled after conservative figures raised concerns over her views, fueling accusations of an ideologically motivated campaign. Brosius-Gersdorf has refuted the "defamatory" characterizations of her as "ultra-left," stating her positions fall within the democratic center. The controversy has created the first major crisis for Germany's new governing coalition.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Jordan Addison has pleaded no contest to a "wet reckless" charge, a lesser offense, stemming from a 2024 DUI incident in California. The 23-year-old was arrested after being found asleep behind the wheel of his car. As part of the plea deal, Addison will complete online courses and pay a fine, with his probation potentially being reduced. While this resolves the state-level legal matter, the third-year player could still face disciplinary action from the NFL, which has stated the incident remains under review.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that gives it a significant stake in Guyana's vast offshore oil reserves. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled in Chevron's favor, rejecting Exxon Mobil's claim that it had a right of first refusal on Hess's assets in the region. Exxon, a partner in the Guyana project, stated it disagrees with but respects the ruling. The acquisition's completion removes major uncertainty for Chevron, though its CEO indicated some job reductions are expected as the two companies integrate. (not investment advice)</p>

Children's programming is also less expensive to produce and has a longer shelf life than other content.

          <p>The Environment Agency has reported a 60% increase in serious water pollution incidents by water companies in England in 2024, reaching the highest level on record. Of the 2,801 total incidents, 75 were deemed to cause "serious or persistent" harm, with Thames Water, Southern Water, and Yorkshire Water being the primary offenders. A cross-party parliamentary committee has condemned the "woeful" level of pollution and criticized regulators for being "missing in action." The report comes ahead of a major review of the water industry, with critics blaming years of underinvestment and weak regulation for the ecological damage.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old man has been charged with two counts of murder in the shooting deaths of Robin Kaye, a longtime music supervisor for 'American Idol,' and her husband, Thomas Deluca. The couple, both 70, were found dead in their Los Angeles home during a welfare check. Investigators believe the suspect, Raymond Boodarian, was burglarizing the residence and shot the couple when they unexpectedly returned home. In addition to the murder charges, Boodarian is also accused of first-degree burglary, deepening the tragedy that has shocked the entertainment community.</p>

          <p>A protest in Epping, Essex, against a hotel being used to house asylum seekers turned violent, resulting in assaults on police officers and damage to vehicles.

The disturbance, which police said was caused by a minority after a peaceful demonstration, led to the closure of the high street. The protest follows local tensions and the recent arrest of an asylum seeker on suspicion of sexual assault, with police vowing to prosecute those responsible for the violence.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives has passed a funding package that claws back $9 billion in federal spending, a key demand of President Trump. The bill, which passed largely along party lines, rescinds about $8 billion allocated for foreign assistance programs and $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The legislation had been modified by the Senate to protect funding for global AIDS prevention and some food assistance programs, which placated some initial Republican opponents. The package now heads to the president's desk to be signed into law. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted an injunction, allowing the Trump administration's layoffs of approximately 1,400 Department of Education staffers to remain in effect. A lower court had previously blocked the staff reduction, arguing it would hinder the agency's ability to perform its duties. Student aid administrators and consumer advocates now express concern over the department's capacity to manage financial aid programs and support borrowers. This is particularly critical as millions of borrowers may seek to change their repayment plans, potentially facing significant delays and a lack of support due to the reduced staffing.

          <p>This article explores the profound ethical questions facing engineers and researchers in the field of artificial intelligence, where top talent can command immense salaries. It weighs the potential for AI to achieve great social good against the significant risks, including the creation of manipulative systems and the potential for hostile AI actions. The author argues that working at a frontier AI lab is only ethical if one has a defensible reason to believe their contribution will improve outcomes, rather than accelerate risks. The piece notes that intense competition and financial incentives often lead labs to sideline safety, creating a high-stakes moral challenge.</p>

The UN has documented killings of civilians by government-affiliated forces, while state media blames "outlaw groups" for massacres. Hundreds have been reported killed in the violence, leaving the local Druze population feeling abandoned and terrified in what one resident called a "barbaric" bloodbath.</p>

In his first interview on the matter, Shapps stated his focus was on "sorting out the mess and saving lives," arguing the secrecy was justified to prevent people from being murdered. The injunction has since been lifted, revealing the scale of the breach and the covert resettlement scheme created in response.</p>

Mbeumo is seen as a versatile and proven Premier League player who can operate as a central striker or on the wing, providing the consistency and work-rate that Manchester United's new manager is seeking to add to the attack.</p>

His lawyers state the government alleges he provided material support to a "Tier III" terrorist organization, a claim they call illogical and pretextual.
