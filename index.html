          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the Cuauhtémoc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night, resulting in two fatalities and at least 19 injuries among the 277 people on board. The vessel, which had been docked at Pier 17 in Manhattan, reportedly experienced mechanical issues that caused it to veer off course and strike the bridge. Emergency responders assisted crew members, and the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident. The ship, which is used to train seamen and officers, had set sail from Acapulco in April with the goal of promoting peace and goodwill during its voyage to various ports, but its tour was abruptly halted in New York due to the crash.</p>

          <p>Elton John has strongly criticized the government's plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws, calling the move "theft" and expressing feelings of betrayal. Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, he warned that this policy would rob young artists of their legacy and income, as AI firms could use artists' content without payment. The government defended its position by stating that no changes would be considered unless they work for creators, while also consulting on measures allowing developers to use content unless rights holders opt out. The singer said that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to "wise up" and threatened to take ministers to court if the plans are not changed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Casey Michel's guest essay in the New York Times discusses how the Trump family's recent business dealings and profiteering from political influence are part of a broader, long-standing pattern of corruption in American politics. The article argues that while the Trump administration's actions are particularly brazen, they build upon a history of foreign regimes and oligarchs targeting and bankrolling American politicians. The author points to instances involving the Clinton Foundation and Hunter Biden to illustrate that this issue transcends party lines. The article concludes by suggesting legislative measures to prevent future abuses, such as barring family members of high-ranking officials from foreign lobbying and investments.</p>

          <p>Dan Richards' guest essay in the New York Times contrasts the revitalized sleeper train network in Europe with the declining state of long-distance public transport in the United States. In Europe, night trains are making a comeback due to climate concerns and efforts to compete with short-haul flights, while the U.S. continues to prioritize cars and underfund public infrastructure. The article highlights the correlation between car dependence and decreased happiness in American drivers, and criticizes the U.S.'s focus on unproven transportation projects rather than investing in rail networks. The piece advocates for revitalizing railways in America as a means to foster community, connection, and a shared sense of purpose.</p>

          <p>A rare and intense dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, including Chicago, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue dust storm warnings. The storm, driven by winds up to 70 miles per hour from thunderstorms, originated near Bloomington, Illinois, and created a dramatic scene as it moved into downtown Chicago. This event marked the first time the Weather Service had issued a dust storm warning for Chicago itself. The dust storm was attributed to exceptionally dry soil conditions in the region, reminiscent of the Dust Bowl era, and is referred to as a haboob due to its origin from thunderstorm winds.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent actions in the Middle East, including engaging with Syria's new leader and pursuing deals in Iran and Yemen, indicate a shift in U.S. foreign policy that sidelines Israel.

This approach contrasts with past administrations, where Israel held a central position in American foreign policy in the region. While the U.S. maintains its ties with Israel, Trump's actions signal a change in priorities and a willingness to pursue diplomatic solutions without necessarily involving or prioritizing Israeli interests.</p>

This gyroscope, developed by the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, improves the accuracy of inertial navigation systems, which are vital for military and security applications because they do not rely on external signals and are immune to interference. The device uses the movement of light in optical fibers to sense orientation and turning rates, offering a simpler structure and higher resolution compared to traditional mechanical gyroscopes.</p>

In the video, Edan sits next to Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and Trump's voice is heard on a speakerphone. Trump expressed his pleasure that Edan was released and was fascinated to learn more about what Alexander had endured under captivity. The president noted how Alexander's family became strong advocates for their son's release and regularly communicated with the president.</p>

          <p>Saturday Night Live's Season 50 finale opened with a sketch featuring James Austin Johnson's Donald Trump character addressing the controversy surrounding Qatar's offer of a $400 million plane. The sketch satirized Trump's recent trip to the Middle East, including his praise for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and referenced the real Trump's Truth Social posts insisting the plane was a donation to the U.S. Air Force, not a personal gift. The sketch also touched on the criticism Trump has faced for accepting the gift and for his relationship with MBS.</p>

          <p>This article previews an episode of "48 Hours" focusing on the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs in Minneapolis, where a rare clue—bloody, bare footprints—launched a decades-long search for the killer. The footprints, left by the perpetrator who stepped in the victim's blood, became a key piece of evidence. Years later, DNA testing led investigators to Jerry Westrom, a businessman and hockey dad, whose DNA matched that found at the crime scene. The article highlights the use of investigative genetic genealogy and forensic science in solving the cold case, and the upcoming episode will explore the experts' conclusions about the footprints.</p>
