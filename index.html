          <p>China has denied accusations from the United States that it violated the Geneva trade agreement, countering that the U.S. is the party breaching the terms. This comes after a meeting in Geneva between U.S. and Chinese officials aimed to de-escalate trade tensions, which resulted in a temporary suspension of tariffs. China's commerce department claims the U.S. has unilaterally provoked economic and trade frictions by imposing export restrictions and threatening to revoke visas for Chinese students. The spokesperson vowed that Beijing would take measures to protect its interests if the U.S. continues actions that damage China's interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A corporate manslaughter investigation has been initiated into the Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS trust following failings that resulted in the deaths or injuries of hundreds of babies. The investigation aims to determine if the maternity care provided by the trust was grossly negligent, focusing on two maternity units. This follows an independent inquiry examining approximately 2,500 cases of neonatal deaths, stillbirths, and injuries to mothers and babies. Campaigners are calling for individual accountability for those responsible for the failings, while the trust has expressed deep sorrow and committed to improving maternity services.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to modernize flight paths, potentially leading to shorter journey times and fewer delays. The changes, the largest redesign since the 1950s, aim to allow planes to climb and descend more smoothly, reducing aviation's climate change impact. While changes to airspace over London are not expected until the 2030s, some changes to routes outside London could be implemented sooner. Some residents are concerned about new flight paths potentially increasing noise pollution, while aviation industry leaders have expressed support for the modernization efforts.</p>

          <p>A new Social Security Administration (SSA) policy requiring beneficiaries to visit offices to change direct deposit information will affect nearly 2 million people, with many seniors facing long travel times. According to a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis, nearly one-quarter of seniors live over an hour away from their local SSA field office. The policy change, intended to curb fraud, has been criticized by advocates as an overreaction, considering the scale of direct deposit fraud. The SSA estimates the enhanced safety measures have avoided $19.9 million in losses, but the new requirements may disproportionately burden elderly and disabled individuals.</p>

The moon's appeal lies in its abundant resources such as iron, silicon, hydrogen, and helium-3, which could be used for self-sufficiency in lunar bases and as fuel for future Mars missions.

          <p>A restaurant consultant shares tips on proper dining etiquette, advising customers to avoid "one-timing" servers by requesting multiple items separately. He suggests explaining to the server if you are in a hurry and need to order quickly. When trying to get the server's attention, eye contact and a wave are preferred over snapping fingers. If a meal is incorrect, customers should approach the situation calmly, understanding that errors can occur in the kitchen. It's courteous to place your first order shortly after being seated, and to be mindful of the time spent at the table after the meal is finished.</p>

          <p>This article explores the difficulties and limitations of achieving perfect self-knowledge. It argues that while self-reflection can be beneficial, overthinking and rumination can be detrimental. The piece suggests that people should focus on constructing a positive and realistic narrative about themselves rather than seeking a single, unchanging truth. It emphasizes the importance of a flexible sense of self that allows for change and surprise. The author shares personal anecdotes to illustrate the idea that people's preferences and identities can evolve over time.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the role of anti-feminism in South Korea's upcoming presidential election, highlighting how opposition to women’s rights has fueled authoritarian movements in other countries. It notes that while South Korea has advanced economically, gender equality has lagged behind. The rise of the feminist movement in response to violent crime against women has inspired right-wing forces to champion the cause of disgruntled men. The article suggests that the preservation of South Korean democracy depends on addressing real problems, such as the cost-of-living and urban-housing crises.</p>

It highlights the power of the bond market to influence government policy and the potential consequences of high interest rates. The author notes that interest rates have been rising, and the bond market is reacting negatively to the prospect of increased borrowing. High interest rates could make it more expensive for the government to borrow and for individuals to get mortgages, credit cards, and loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>First-time homebuyers in the UK are now typically borrowing through mortgages that last an average of 31 years, an increase from 28 years a decade ago. Higher mortgage rates have pushed people to borrow for longer terms to keep monthly repayments manageable. About two in five new mortgages have terms that extend into retirement.

His win is a blow to the government of Donald Tusk, the prime minister and a former European Council president who came to power in 2023.
