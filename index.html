          <h2>California National Guard Deployment Faces Legal Challenges in Appeals Court</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments regarding California's challenge to the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard amid protests over immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. The federal government argued that the deployment was within the president's authority to quell a rebellion, while California contended it was an unlawful executive action infringing on state sovereignty. The court did not immediately issue a ruling, with the lower court having previously called Trump's actions illegal and in violation of the Tenth Amendment. This legal battle unfolds as tensions remain high over federal immigration policies in California.</p>

          <p>Seven men from California have been charged in connection with the theft of $100 million worth of jewelry from a Brinks truck in Lebec, California, in July 2022. The Department of Justice alleges that the suspects scouted a jewelry show near San Francisco before following the truck and stealing 24 bags of jewels. The robbers reportedly did not use weapons, and some of the stolen jewels were recovered during search warrants. The heist has been a mystery for nearly three years, and the victims, many of whom are senior citizens, are hoping for the return of their merchandise.</p>

          <p>President Trump's consideration of military action against Iran has revealed a split among his supporters, pitting isolationist and hawkish wings against each other. While Trump campaigned against "endless wars," he also maintained that Iran cannot possess nuclear weapons. Some Republicans are siding with Democrats to block unauthorized military action, while others support intervention. The dilemma has sparked debates over America's role in the Middle East and the potential for domestic terror attacks.</p>
