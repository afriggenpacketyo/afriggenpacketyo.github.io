        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a fall in exports, according to preliminary government data. This contraction exceeded economists' expectations of a 0.1% decrease. The Bank of Japan had previously cautioned about potential economic moderation due to global trade policies, particularly those of the United States. Despite these concerns, some BOJ board members suggest the central bank might continue to raise policy rates if inflation targets are met, while others advise caution due to economic uncertainty.

          <p>Top US diplomat Marco Rubio expressed skepticism about upcoming Ukraine-Russia peace talks in Turkey, suggesting that a direct meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is necessary for any significant progress. Rubio's comments came after a NATO foreign ministers meeting, where he emphasized the need for Trump and Putin to interact directly on the issue. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized the low-level delegation sent by Moscow, while Trump suggested that progress was unlikely until he and Putin met in person. The BBC reported that Zelenskyy accused Moscow of disrespect towards Trump and Erdogan due to the Russian delegation's lack of seniority.</p>

The Efra Committee stated that the changes were made without adequate consultation or impact assessment. The committee also warned that the government's closure of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) environmental payments scheme has affected trust in the government.</p>

The family is upset that Georgia's law, which restricts abortion after cardiac activity is detected, doesn't allow relatives to have a say in whether a pregnant woman is kept on life support. The family says Emory doctors have told them they are not allowed to stop or remove the devices that are keeping her breathing because state law bans abortion after cardiac activity can be detected. The fetus has fluid on the brain and that they're concerned about his health.</p>

Ventura acknowledged loving Combs for over a decade and hoping to build a life with him, but testified that she saw a violent and coercive side of him as they spent more time together.
