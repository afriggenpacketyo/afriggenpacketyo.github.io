          <p>During a press conference, former President Trump addressed the humanitarian situation in Gaza by highlighting U.S. financial contributions, expressing frustration that the aid has not been publicly acknowledged. He suggested other nations, particularly in Europe, should contribute more, while also blaming Hamas for stealing food supplies intended for civilians. Separately, while meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump maintained a firm stance on trade negotiations, indicating a 50/50 chance of a deal and affirming that a potential tariff rate would not be lower than 15%. These discussions occurred as a critical deadline for imposing new tariffs approached.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This year's San Diego Comic-Con proceeded without a major presentation from Marvel Studios in its famous Hall H, leading to some initial disappointment among pop culture followers. However, many fans attending the event reported a positive experience, taking advantage of smaller crowds to access panels for other anticipated projects like "Alien: Earth" and "The Long Walk." While major film studios were less present, the convention still featured significant draws, including a presentation by DC Studios' James Gunn and a world premiere for the "Demon Slayer" anime movie. The shift highlighted the growing influence of television, anime, and independent creators at the traditionally film-dominated event.</p>

          <p>A Wyandotte County Sheriff's Deputy, 34-year-old Elijah Ming, was shot and killed in Kansas City, Kansas, while responding to a domestic violence call. Ming, a nine-year veteran, was accompanying a woman to retrieve her belongings from a residence when a man inside, identified as Shawn Harris, opened fire without warning. The suspect then barricaded himself inside the home and engaged in a gunfight with other responding officers before surrendering after an hour of negotiations. Harris was wounded and taken to a hospital, while the Kansas Bureau of Investigation has taken over the probe into the fatal shooting.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review of 57 studies by the University of Sydney challenges the long-held belief that 10,000 steps per day are necessary for good health, suggesting that around 7,000 steps can provide substantial benefits. The research, published in The Lancet Public Health, found that walking at least 7,000 steps daily was linked to a reduced risk of death by 47% and a lower risk of dementia and type 2 diabetes. Researchers emphasized that even modest increases from low activity levels yield significant health gains. The study encourages focusing on progress over perfection, noting that small, incidental movements throughout the day contribute to overall well-being.</p>

He asserted that the administration's focus is on what it deems fiscal mismanagement at the Fed, such as renovation costs, and achieving lower interest rates to align with global trends.

Known for his darkly humorous and politically charged songs that gained popularity in the 1950s and 1960s, Lehrer was a unique figure who balanced a successful academic career with his musical pursuits. Despite his fame, he largely retired from public performance in the 1970s to focus on teaching mathematics at institutions like Harvard and MIT. His witty and enduring songs, such as "The Elements" and "The Masochism Tango," have influenced generations of comedians and satirists.</p>

          <p>CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in 2026 is fueling debate about the viability of the traditional late-night talk show format. While some see the cancellation as a specific financial move by parent company Paramount, others view it as a sign of broader industry decline due to rising production costs and shrinking linear TV ad revenue. The article notes that while NBC has extended its late-night hosts, the future of ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live" after 2026 will be a key indicator. The changing media landscape, dominated by streaming and a focus on live sports, continues to put financial pressure on legacy programming. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's recent move to weaken his country's anti-corruption agencies is a direct consequence of a shift in U.S. foreign policy under the Trump administration. The article posits that the U.S. has moved from pressuring emerging democracies to reform to actively tolerating and even encouraging global corruption. This change, exemplified by the dismantling of U.S. anti-kleptocracy programs, has removed the external pressure that once pushed leaders like Zelensky toward transparency. The author suggests that even a leader once seen as a democratic hero is now seizing the opportunity to protect allies from investigation.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators, led by Chris Van Hollen, is calling on the Trump administration to stop funding the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a private organization delivering aid in Gaza. In a letter to the Secretary of State, the senators expressed "grave concerns" over the GHF's methods, which involve armed contractors and have been linked to hundreds of Palestinian deaths at distribution sites. They argue that U.S. taxpayer money should not support an operation that has become a "death trap" and are demanding a return to funding established UN-led aid mechanisms. This comes as the UN warns of a deepening starvation crisis in the region.</p>
