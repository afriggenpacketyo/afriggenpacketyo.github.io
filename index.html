          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. projects a 34.9% drop in net profit for the fiscal year through next March, estimating 3.1 trillion yen due to U.S. tariffs under President Trump.

          <p>Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million units of its upcoming Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking the company's initial sales forecast for the successor to its popular Switch device, set to launch in June. The company reported a 24.7% revenue decrease and a nearly 50% profit plunge in its fiscal fourth quarter, attributed to consumers delaying purchases in anticipation of the new console. Investors are focused on Nintendo's forecast for the fiscal year, with the company expecting net sales of 1.9 trillion yen, a 63% year-on-year rise, and net profit to jump 7.6% to 300 billion yen. However, the forecast is based on U.S. tariff rates effective Apr. 10.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has achieved a significant trade agreement with the United States, marking a win for the UK after years of seeking such a deal since President Trump's initial tariffs. This success follows closely on the heels of a full free trade agreement between the UK and India, estimated to boost bilateral trade by ¬£25.5 billion and increase UK GDP by ¬£4.8 billion annually. The deal provides a political boost for Starmer, who has faced pressure to reassess domestic policies following recent election setbacks, by finalizing the India deal and reaching an agreement with the U.S. Trump alluded to the agreement on social media, hinting at reduced tariffs on specific goods, with the UK aiming to lower tariffs on steel and cars.</p>

This marks the first instance in Mexico of a musical group facing legal proceedings for disseminating content related to drug trafficking, following government efforts to discourage music that glorifies violence and drugs.

          <p>An interim report states that the root cause of the fire that led to the shutdown of Heathrow Airport, affecting hundreds of thousands of journeys, "remains unknown." Heathrow was closed to all flights for much of March 21 after a fire at a nearby electrical substation caused a power outage at the airport. The Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit found "no evidence to suggest" the incident was suspicious. Power was restored to Heathrow's terminals around seven hours before flights resumed late on 21 March. The report found the flow of electricity to all four of Heathrow's passenger terminals was restarted by 10:56 on 21 March.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor is projecting a significant decline in operating profit for the fiscal year, citing headwinds from a stronger yen and a $1.3 billion hit from President Trump's tariffs in April and May alone. The company's chief executive, Koji Sato, noted the extreme flux in the current environment surrounding the auto industry, including trade relations. The murkiness of Toyota‚Äôs forecast underscores how the whiplash of Mr. Trump‚Äôs tariff agenda is upheaving the auto industry and leaving many global companies unable to estimate future prospects. The tariffs, including a 25 percent tariff on vehicle imports into the United States, are already impacting the company's bottom line.</p>

          <p>A study found that the deadly storms that caused death and destruction across the central Mississippi valley in early April were made significantly more likely and more severe by burning fossil fuels. The floods were caused by rainfall made about 9% more intense and 40% more likely by human-caused climate change, the World Weather Attribution (WWA) study found. Warm ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico that fed the storm moisture that it dropped across Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama.

          <p>A study found that climate change made the deadly storms that tore through eight U.S. states in early April, killing at least 24 people, significantly worse. The World Weather Attribution analysis revealed that human-caused global warming increased the intensity of record-breaking downpours by about 9%. Unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, partly attributed to climate change, fueled the storms, making them 14 times more likely.

          <p>China's steel exports are projected to decline in the second quarter, potentially worsening a domestic supply glut, due to the impact of the trade war and increasing protectionism. Analysts anticipate a decrease of up to a fifth in second-quarter shipments compared to the first quarter, with further declines expected later in the year. The trade war has affected exports as Washington's tariffs choke off the transshipment trade, where third countries resell Chinese steel to the U.S., and top customers like South Korea and Vietnam impose their own duties. The Chairman of China's largest listed steelmaker, Baosteel, said late last month the sector's exports faced "unprecedented" pressure.</p>
