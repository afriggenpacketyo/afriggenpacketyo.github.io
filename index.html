          <p>Nicole Brown, a police officer from the Westminster Police Department in California, has been charged with 15 felonies related to workers' compensation insurance fraud. Prosecutors allege that Brown falsely claimed she was unable to work due to a head injury sustained on the job, while simultaneously engaging in strenuous activities like running races, skiing, and attending music festivals. Brown collected over $600,000 in salary and benefits during this period, while her stepfather, Peter Gregory Schuman, a lawyer specializing in workers' compensation cases, was charged with conspiring with her. Brown's lawyer maintains that her on-duty injury continues to cause her severe limitations, and she intends to vigorously defend against the charges.</p>

          <p>Twelve members of an extended family, spread across three states, were diagnosed with histoplasmosis after visiting the Venado Caves in Costa Rica. The family members experienced symptoms such as headaches, fever, and respiratory issues, beginning 8 to 19 days after exposure. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has alerted health departments and is working with the U.S. Embassy in Costa Rica to inform the public about the risks of contracting histoplasmosis during cave tours. The Venado Caves have been linked to a previous histoplasmosis outbreak in 1998–1999, and the CDC is now collaborating with the Costa Rican Ministry of Health to include risk information in tour waivers.</p>

Despite her release, Arias Cristobal still faces deportation proceedings to Mexico, as ICE has started a deportation case against her.

          <p>President Trump hosted a gala at his Virginia golf club for high-paying investors in his personal cryptocurrency, $TRUMP, sparking ethical concerns. Protesters gathered outside the event, criticizing it as a historic corruption of the presidency. Trump promised to promote the crypto industry from the White House, while critics assailed the event as a pay-for-play scheme. Justin Sun, a Chinese billionaire, spent over $40 million on $TRUMP coins to secure a top spot at the dinner, hoping to discuss crypto's future with Trump. The event was unlike anything in recent American history, not a campaign fundraiser but a gathering arranged by the president's business partners to directly enrich the first family.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has detected multiple cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, linked to a surge in China, through its airport screening program. Cases have been reported in arriving international travelers at airports in California, Washington state, Virginia, and the New York City area. Preliminary data from researchers in China suggest the NB.1.8.1 variant has a greater ability to bind to human cells, suggesting it could be more transmissible. The strain came up during a meeting of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccine advisers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to end the Flores Settlement Agreement, a cornerstone immigration policy that requires the government to provide basic rights and protections to child immigrants in its custody. The protections limit the amount of time children can be detained and require the government to provide adequate food, water, and clean clothes. The administration argues that the agreement incentivizes unauthorized border crossings and prevents effective detention and removal of families.

Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled his intent to raise rates given price trends, while also monitoring the effects of U.S. tariffs.
