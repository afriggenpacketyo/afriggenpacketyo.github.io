          <p>Pakistan intends to nominate Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. The Pakistani government stated that Trump demonstrated strategic foresight and statesmanship through diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi, de-escalating a rapidly deteriorating situation. Trump has claimed that he used trade as leverage to facilitate the ceasefire, a claim corroborated by Pakistan but denied by India. Some Pakistani officials support the nomination as a way to pander to Trump's ego, while others criticize it due to his stance on Israel and Iran.</p>

The Federal Reserve maintained its benchmark lending rate and revised economic projections, and is expected to cut rates later this year.

          <p>Senator Jack Reed criticized President Trump's rejection of his own intelligence chief's assessment that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon. Reed suggested Trump's stance is politically motivated due to contemplating an attack against Iran. Reed stated that if the intelligence director made a false statement, there would be an obligation to correct the record, not suddenly conclude she was wrong.</p>

          <p>The second week of the Israel-Iran war began with additional strikes targeting an Iranian nuclear research facility. Iran's foreign minister warned against U.S. intervention in the conflict. Israeli strikes targeted centrifuge production sites, and senior Iranian commanders were killed in targeted attacks. Iran launched a new wave of drones and missiles at Israel, but there were no immediate reports of significant damage. The war between Israel and Iran erupted on June 13, resulting in numerous casualties on both sides.</p>
