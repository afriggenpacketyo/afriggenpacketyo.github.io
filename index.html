          <p>The Trump administration has initiated investigations into Harvard University and its Law Review following reports that the journal was allegedly selecting articles based on the authors' race rather than merit. These investigations come amidst ongoing disputes between the administration and Harvard over DEI programs and ideological screening of international students. The Department of Education and Department of Health and Human Services are jointly investigating potential violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The administration has previously frozen grants to Harvard over concerns about antisemitism on campus, signaling a broader conflict over civil rights and academic freedom.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson met with President Trump to strategize on the GOP's approach to budget reconciliation as Congress returns from recess. Republicans aim to reshape federal spending to align with Trump's domestic agenda, focusing on tax cuts and deregulation. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed optimism about the unified front among Republican leaders, aiming to pass the tax portion of the budget package by July 4. Despite some market volatility, Johnson remains confident in the GOP's ability to defend its congressional majority in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

          <p>CBS News is facing accusations that its parent company, Paramount, is censoring coverage to appease the Trump administration, raising concerns about freedom of the press. Journalist Scott Pelley suggested that Paramount is scrutinizing content, including stories about the Trump administration, to protect its standing with the government amid a proposed merger with Skydance Media. This follows President Trump's criticism of a 60 Minutes episode and a lawsuit against CBS and Paramount. The FCC, led by Trump ally Brendan Carr, is also investigating CBS's campaign coverage, adding to the pressure on the network.</p>

          <p>'The Legend of Ochi,' a new film from A24, uses intricate puppets in a style reminiscent of classic children's media. The film follows a teen named Yuri who befriends a creature called an ochi. The film blends live-action with practical effects, giving the ochi a tangible and lifelike quality. This approach contrasts with the anonymity of CGI animals, highlighting the craftsmanship and intimacy of traditional puppetry.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of lawyers and staff members are leaving the Justice Department’s civil rights division due to a shift in priorities under the Trump administration. Veterans of the office say they have been driven out by officials who want to drop traditional work and pursue cases against schools and liberal cities. The administration has reopened its “deferred resignation program,” leading to further departures. The new head of the division has welcomed the turnover and emphasized a focus on enforcing federal civil rights laws, not "woke ideology."</p>

Factors such as high out-of-pocket expenses, living on campus, taking longer to graduate, and choosing certain majors can lower a college grad's ROI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Martinelli's is recalling over 170,000 apple juice bottles due to potential contamination by patulin, a toxic substance produced by some fungi. The recall affects 10-ounce round glass bottles with a "best by" date of December 5, 2026, and a specific UPC code. The bottles were distributed in 28 states, and retailers have been instructed to remove the product from inventory. While no health issues have been reported, patulin can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.</p>
