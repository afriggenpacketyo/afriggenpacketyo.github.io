          <p>Thieves executed a brazen daytime robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris, stealing jewelry described as having "inestimable heritage and historical value." The perpetrators reportedly used a basket lift to force open a window while the museum was open to tourists, smashing display cases in the Galerie d'Apollon to access the items. The incident, which lasted only a few minutes, prompted a full evacuation and closure of the world-renowned museum as authorities launched an investigation. French officials have called the heist the work of professionals, noting that all measures are being taken to recover the stolen artifacts.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military launched aircraft and artillery strikes in southern Gaza, citing attacks by Hamas on its soldiers, which it termed a "bold violation" of the recently brokered ceasefire. An Israeli official reported that Hamas fighters used a rocket-propelled grenade and sniper fire against troops in an Israeli-controlled area. In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered "strong action" against terrorist targets. Hamas has denied involvement in any clashes, reaffirming its commitment to the ceasefire and stating it had lost contact with its remaining groups in the specified Rafah area.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department issued a warning about "credible reports" suggesting that Hamas may be planning an imminent attack on Palestinian civilians within the Gaza Strip. The statement emphasized that such an act would represent a grave violation of the current ceasefire agreement and could undermine recent progress achieved through mediation. While specific details regarding the timing or location were not provided, the U.S. indicated that measures would be taken to protect Gazans if the attack proceeds. Hamas rejected the claims as "false allegations," accusing Israel of supporting armed gangs in the region.</p>

          <p>A commentary by Charles M. Blow highlights the severe crisis facing local journalism in the United States, with over 3,200 print newspapers having disappeared since 2005. The article argues that this decline erodes the "connective tissue" of communities, which rely on local outlets for everything from accountability reporting to wedding announcements and high school sports coverage. This loss contributes to growing political polarization, as nationalized news often frames issues in partisan terms. The piece suggests that supporting local news is essential for maintaining community identity and fostering common ground among residents.</p>

          <p>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson defended his characterization of the nationwide "No Kings" anti-Trump rallies as "hate America" rallies. In an interview, Johnson clarified that his comments were directed at the message of the protesters, not the individuals or the entire Democratic Party, citing what he described as violent rhetoric and hateful messages seen in videos from the events. When pressed on his equation of anarchists and pro-Hamas activists with the modern Democratic Party, he pointed to what he claims is a rise of Marxism within the party, referencing a New York City mayoral candidate as an example.</p>

          <p>The Haskell Free Library & Opera House, a century-old institution uniquely situated on the border between Quebec, Canada, and Vermont, U.S., is facing new access restrictions imposed by the Trump administration. For decades, the library has allowed patrons from both nations to mingle freely, but new rules now require Canadian visitors to report to a legal U.S. port of entry before using the main entrance. U.S. Customs and Border Protection cited "illicit cross-border activity around the library" as the reason for the change. The move has been met with sadness by local residents and library staff, who see it as a blow to a long-standing symbol of unity and friendship.</p>

          <p>Following over a week of intense fighting along their shared border, Pakistan and the Taliban government in Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire. The agreement, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace and stability in the region. The clashes, which were the most severe since the Taliban regained power in 2021, were fueled by Islamabad's accusations that the Taliban harbors armed groups that attack Pakistan. Under the new deal, the Taliban has agreed not to support such groups, and both sides will refrain from targeting security forces and civilians.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's defense ministry has observed no significant increase in Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) activities near the island in the week following a major policy speech by President William Lai. According to Taiwanese figures, the PLA conducted between seven and 27 sorties per day, a level consistent with routine activity rather than a large-scale exercise. This relative calm contrasts with previous instances where Beijing responded to perceived provocations with massive military drills. For example, a large-scale exercise in April involved 76 sorties as a stated "serious warning" to what Beijing considers pro-independence forces.</p>

Kushner's comments came amid rising tensions, including a U.S. warning of a potential Hamas attack on civilians and clashes that are testing the fragile ceasefire.

Other points include the reduced dependency on cars due to walkable cities and reliable public transport, affordable and accessible healthcare, and a greater sense of public safety.

Petro claims the vessel was a fishing boat that was adrift with a distress signal and that the deceased was a fisherman with no ties to the drug trade. This incident is one of several recent U.S. strikes on ships in the Caribbean, which the Trump administration defends as necessary to stop drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested that the government is considering a cut to the 5% VAT rate on household energy bills ahead of the November Budget. While declining to speculate on specific fiscal measures, Miliband acknowledged the severe "cost-of-living crisis" and stated that officials are "looking at all of these issues." The potential tax reduction comes as the government faces pressure to lower energy costs, which recently rose by 2% for millions under the latest price cap. Scrapping the VAT could save the average household approximately £86 per year, though it would cost the Treasury an estimated £2.5 billion annually.</p>

The case, which involves Bolton's actions after leaving the White House in 2019, is considered rare but not unprecedented for such a high-ranking official. Prosecutors will need to prove that Bolton knowingly transferred classified information to an unauthorized individual to secure a conviction.</p>

          <p>Six months after President Trump implemented sweeping tariffs, many Americans are reporting significant financial strain, with rising prices on everyday goods from groceries to car tires. A recent study estimates that U.S. consumers will absorb over $900 billion in extra costs, with one analysis projecting an annual household cost of nearly $2,400. Consumers described cutting back on non-essentials, changing shopping habits to find lower prices, and facing empty shelves for certain products. Despite the public's concerns, the administration maintains that the tariff policy is necessary to boost American manufacturing and has recently threatened further increases on Chinese imports.</p>

          <p>Georgia is experiencing a historic surge in demand for electricity, largely driven by the construction of datacenters for artificial intelligence, which account for about 80% of new energy requests. Georgia Power is seeking to add nearly 10 gigawatts of capacity at an estimated cost of $16 billion, prompting concerns among consumer advocates and environmental groups about rising utility bills and increased reliance on fossil fuels. The state's Public Service Commission will hold hearings to decide on the plan. Critics argue that residential customers are unfairly subsidizing industrial users and are calling for datacenters to bear the costs of the new infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A Chinese robotics manufacturer, MyActuator, has experienced a significant increase in orders, which it attributes to U.S. President Donald Trump's threats of new tariffs. A company source reported receiving over 1,000 new orders in the past week from clients making emergency purchases to avoid potential price hikes on intelligent drive modules for humanoid robots. The company's factories are now working overtime to ship products before the proposed November 1 tariff deadline. The source humorously thanked Trump for acting as a "sales consultant," noting the surge in demand is much larger than what was seen during previous tariff threats.</p>

          <p>AI startup Anthropic finds itself in a public disagreement with the Trump administration, particularly with AI czar David Sacks, who accuses the company of "fear-mongering" to achieve regulatory capture. Sacks claims Anthropic's advocacy for stronger AI safety regulations and state-level rules undermines U.S. competitiveness against China. This conflict highlights the differing philosophies between Anthropic, founded on AI safety principles, and its larger rival OpenAI, which has partnered with the White House on a major AI infrastructure initiative. Anthropic has consistently pushed back against the administration's efforts to preempt state laws, creating a tense dynamic in the rapidly evolving AI policy landscape.</p>

          <p>As Medicare's open enrollment period continues through December 7, experts are urging beneficiaries to carefully review their options rather than automatically renewing their current plans. The federal government shutdown may cause delays in accessing information from official channels like the 1-800-Medicare hotline, but online resources and private carriers remain available. Beneficiaries should compare traditional Medicare and private Medicare Advantage plans, paying close attention to out-of-pocket costs, provider networks, and prescription drug coverage. Experts stress that even small changes in a plan's coverage for preferred doctors or necessary medications can significantly impact annual healthcare spending.</p>

Liu defended China's retaliatory fees on U.S. ships as a necessary measure to protect its own shipping industry's interests.

          <p>Marjorie Taylor Greene, once a staunch loyalist of Donald Trump, has recently surprised observers by breaking with the Republican party on several key issues, including the war in Gaza, the release of Epstein files, and healthcare subsidies. While she has avoided direct criticism of Trump, her independent streak has drawn praise from some unlikely Democratic allies and fueled speculation about her motives and future ambitions. Some analysts suggest she is staying true to her populist roots by siding with her constituents' interests, while others posit she may be retaliating after the White House discouraged her from a statewide run for office.</p>

          <p>An investigation has uncovered a coordinated campaign by major soft-drink and snack-food corporations aimed at undermining public health efforts to curb the consumption of soda and ultra-processed foods. The campaign reportedly uses a network of Republican-tied pollsters and strategists to frame health-focused policies, such as restricting soda purchases with SNAP benefits, as an attack on working-class families and a betrayal of the MAGA movement. The effort involves industry-funded polls, articles placed in partisan news outlets, and paid social media influencers. This strategy aims to create a political conflict between Donald Trump's base and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s 'Make America Healthy Again' movement.</p>

          <p>The growing popularity of pickleball has been accompanied by a significant increase in eye injuries, according to a new study in JAMA Ophthalmology. Researchers estimate that such injuries, including corneal abrasions and lacerations, have risen by approximately 405 cases annually from 2021 to 2024, with adults over 50 being the most affected group. The study's authors call for the development of standardized guidelines for protective eyewear, which can prevent up to 90% of sports-related eye injuries.

Surovtsev is considered stateless, having left before the fall of the Soviet Union.
