          <p>In an unusual legal arrangement, media executive Rupert Murdoch has agreed to provide Donald Trump with regular updates on his health condition. This deal postpones Murdoch's deposition in a $10 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Trump over a Wall Street Journal article concerning Jeffrey Epstein. Trump's legal team had sought an expedited deposition, citing Murdoch's advanced age and potential health issues. The agreement stipulates that if a judge denies the motion to dismiss the case, Murdoch must be deposed within 30 days.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell's legal team has formally opposed the unsealing of grand jury transcripts related to her criminal case. The opposition comes after the Department of Justice, under the Trump administration, moved to make the documents public. Maxwell's lawyers argue that releasing the transcripts would compromise her appeal to the Supreme Court and that she cannot form an informed opinion without first reviewing them. They emphasized that unlike the deceased Jeffrey Epstein, Maxwell is alive and her due process rights are still in effect.</p>

After retiring as a player, he transitioned into management and recently served as Porto's director of professional football.

          <p>In Dresden, Germany, a trial has commenced for Jian G., a former aide to a lawmaker from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. He is accused of espionage, specifically of passing classified information about European Union matters and details about AfD leadership to Chinese intelligence services. The case has drawn significant attention, with the defendant's lawyer suggesting the timing of the arrest before the 2024 European elections was politically motivated. A co-defendant is also on trial for allegedly assisting in gathering information.</p>

          <p>Germany's Federal Statistical Office reports that individuals aged 15 to 24 now constitute only 10% of the nation's population, a historic low. This figure has remained unchanged since late 2021 and would have fallen to 8.5% without the influx of young immigrants, particularly from Ukraine. The demographic data places Germany below the European Union average of 10.7% for this age group. States in former East Germany show the lowest proportions of young people, highlighting regional demographic challenges within the country.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump indicated that his administration's planned tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could ultimately rise as high as 250%. Speaking to CNBC, he stated an initial "small tariff" would be imposed, with potential increases to 150% and then 250% within approximately a year and a half. The proposed levies are part of a strategy to encourage drug companies to relocate manufacturing to the United States. The pharmaceutical industry has warned that such high tariffs could lead to increased costs and disrupt supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comparison of support systems across Europe reveals significant differences in the aid provided to Ukrainian refugees. While Germany offers generous "citizens' money" payments of €563 per month plus housing and health insurance, other countries have vastly different approaches. For example, Poland provides access to services but no monthly stipend, while Belgium offers the highest cash assistance at around €1,100 per month. The variance highlights the lack of a standardized EU policy on the value of aid, despite guidelines requiring member states to provide access to essentials.</p>

The committee's report noted that Ocasio-Cortez listed Roberts as her "spouse" on travel forms related to the 2021 Met Gala, which allowed him to attend as a gifted guest. However, he was not listed as a spouse on her financial disclosures, which would have required reporting his financial assets. The committee criticized this discrepancy, while also noting that Ocasio-Cortez has been cooperating.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added a disappointing 73,000 nonfarm jobs in July, falling short of expectations and signaling a sharp economic slowdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics report also included major downward revisions for May and June, slashing a previously estimated 291,000 jobs to just 33,000 over the two months. In response, President Donald Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, alleging without evidence that the numbers were "rigged." The data indicates significant job losses in sectors like professional services and manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

His legacy is complex; he was lauded by some for steering the country away from its past but was also accused of crimes against humanity for his role in the violent 1989 revolution and the subsequent brutal crackdown on student protests in 1990, though he was never convicted.</p>

          <p>Following the recent controversial downward revision of U.S. jobs numbers, labor market experts are clarifying that such adjustments are a normal feature of the reporting process. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) issues preliminary monthly reports based on initial survey responses and then revises them as more complete data becomes available. While last week's two-month revision was unusually large, former officials state it is not evidence of bias or failure, but a standard procedure designed to balance timeliness with accuracy. Declining survey response rates have made the process more challenging. (not investment advice)</p>
