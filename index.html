          <p>The White House confirmed ongoing negotiations for the US government to acquire a 10% stake in Intel.  This unusual move, potentially involving a grant-for-shares exchange, aims to bolster Intel's competitiveness in the AI chip market and support domestic manufacturing. The deal is intended to help Intel build a manufacturing hub in Ohio, and comes amid increased White House scrutiny of the US chip industry.  The potential for political influence on Intel's operations is a concern raised by some experts.</p>

          <p>Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen announced plans for a new immigration detention center, repurposing a minimum-security prison work camp in McCook.  This initiative, supported by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, aims to increase deportation capacity and aligns with President Trump's immigration policies.  The facility will house up to 300 detainees, with the Nebraska National Guard providing logistical support and the State Patrol assisting federal agents.  Concerns have been raised regarding transparency and potential human rights violations.</p>

          <p>Texas Democrats are protesting new house chamber surveillance protocols requiring permission slips to leave, calling them demeaning.  This follows a quorum break to delay a vote on controversial redistricting maps pushed by Donald Trump.  Representative Nicole Collier remained in the chamber overnight in protest, while other Democrats returning to Austin tore up their signed slips.  The situation highlights the escalating political battle over redistricting and the use of police escorts to control lawmakers.</p>
