          <p>The United States and China have reached a preliminary agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs imposed on each other, signaling a de-escalation in the ongoing trade war between the world's two largest economies, as reported by the New York Times article.

          <p>The Kurdish group PKK, which has been engaged in a 40-year insurgency against Turkey, has announced it is laying down arms and disbanding, according to a BBC article. This decision follows a call from the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who urged the group to disarm and dissolve itself. Ocalan has been in solitary confinement since 1999, and his message emphasized the need for a democratic approach to achieving Kurdish rights. The move could lead to new political dialogues and greater Kurdish rights, though it remains uncertain what Ocalan and his supporters will receive in return.</p>

          <p>Royal experts suggest Kate Middleton's success as a modern royal stems from adhering to royal protocols and avoiding the rebellious path taken by Princess Diana, according to a Fox News article. Unlike Diana, who married Prince Charles at a young age and faced immense press scrutiny, Kate was more mature and deliberate in her approach to royal life. Kate's ability to manage press attention by focusing on duty and not seeking personal attention has been crucial. Experts highlight the strong support system Kate has from her family and Prince William, contrasting with Diana's struggles with royal bureaucracy and lack of support.</p>

The course will be set up tougher than usual, with longer rough and softened slopes on the greens. Weather forecasts predict a soft course, which suits McIlroy's powerful driving game.

          <p>Shipping companies will need to adapt to new trading barriers, including tariffs and higher port fees, according to the head of the International Chamber of Shipping. Guy Platten emphasized the industry's resilience and ability to adjust to market changes. The US Trade Representative announced fees targeting Chinese vessels, set to take effect in mid-October, with the goal of re-establishing the US shipbuilding industry. These fees include charges per net tonne for vessels owned or operated by companies in mainland China, Hong Kong, or Macau, as well as charges for Chinese-built vessels entering US ports.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is facing backlash, even from his staunchest supporters, over the potential acceptance of a $400 million luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar's ruling family. The plan involves using the jet as Air Force One and later transferring it to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation. Critics argue this constitutes bribery and violates the Constitution's emoluments clause. Conservatives and Democrats alike have condemned the move, raising concerns about foreign influence and ethical implications. Trump defended the arrangement, stating it was a free gift to the Defense Department to replace an aging Air Force One.</p>

          <p>Sugar, ubiquitous in modern diets, can trigger addiction-like patterns in the brain, altering dopamine signaling and stress-related pathways. Although it may not be a substance addiction in the same vein as nicotine or cocaine, overconsumption can lead to behavioral patterns of craving and withdrawal. Neuroscience studies reveal that chronic sugar intake can change neuronal pathways, particularly in individuals stressed or with challenging early life experiences. Quitting sugar addiction requires a multi-pronged approach, including behavioral interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy, nutritional strategies, and governmental actions such as sugar taxes to deter consumption.</p>

          <p>Kenbishi, Japan's oldest sake brand, remains committed to traditional brewing methods despite the sake industry facing declining domestic consumption. Brewing always takes place during the winter season, with brewers staying onsite for six months, consuming around 1,500 bottles of sake. The brand emphasizes the use of traditional wooden equipment like "dakidaru" to maintain temperature, which is essential for Kenbishi's sake production. While the brand acknowledges the industry's crisis, it sees UNESCO heritage listing as an opportunity to revive interest in Japan and maintains its focus on preserving the taste and brewing methods passed down through generations.</p>

          <p>Britain's armed forces are facing significant challenges, including dwindling troop numbers, weak morale, and aging equipment, according to a BBC article. The situation is exacerbated by increasing geopolitical uncertainty and the looming threat from Russia. A Strategic Defence Review is underway to identify threats and recommend solutions, but doubts remain about its potential impact due to financial constraints. Troop numbers are down, with the Army struggling to meet its target of 73,000 soldiers. There are also concerns about weaknesses in Britain's NATO commitments, including shortages of ammunition and ground-based air defenses.</p>

The White House called it a "trade deal" but provided no further details, promising a joint statement on Monday. These talks mark the first face-to-face meetings since President Trump imposed a 145% tariff on Chinese imports, which prompted a 125% levy from Beijing on some US goods.

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled a plan that includes at least $880 billion in cuts, largely to Medicaid, to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks. The legislation is expected to ignite a significant political battle over health care, reminiscent of the Affordable Care Act repeal efforts. Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage, while Republicans insist they are rooting out waste and abuse. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade.</p>
