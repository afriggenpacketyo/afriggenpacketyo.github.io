          <p>The Trump administration has issued executive actions to increase logging on federal lands, framing the policy as a way to boost timber production and mitigate wildfire risks. The move has been praised by logging communities in states like Oregon but has drawn sharp criticism from environmental groups. These organizations fear the deregulation could harm ecosystems, destroy old-growth forests, and undermine key environmental laws like the Endangered Species Act. Stakeholders, including former U.S. Forest Service employees, also question if federal agencies have adequate staffing and resources to implement the new policies responsibly and legally.</p>

          <p>First responders successfully rescued 31 construction workers who were trapped after a tunnel collapsed in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The collapse occurred within a seven-mile-long, $630.5 million effluent outfall tunnel project designed to upgrade the county's aging wastewater infrastructure. All workers were brought to safety without any visible injuries after being trapped for about an hour. The project has been put on hold as the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA) launches an investigation into the cause of the incident.</p>

          <p>Patty Hartman, a public affairs specialist with nearly two decades at the Justice Department, has been terminated, marking the fourth firing of an official connected to the January 6th prosecutions. Hartman expressed deep concern that the traditional separation between the White House and the DOJ has been eroded under the current administration. She described her dismissal as part of a vindictive purge and a broader destabilization within the agency, warning that the country is heading "straight into an abyss." Hartman, who is considering legal action, believes the administration is weaponizing the Constitution for its own purposes.</p>

          <p>An ex-assistant to the rapper Ye, formerly Kanye West, has amended a lawsuit with new, serious allegations including sexual battery, sex trafficking, and stalking. The plaintiff, Lauren Pisciotta, claims Ye forced her to perform oral sex, engaged in inappropriate behavior with other employees, and fostered a hostile work environment with antisemitic and derogatory language. The updated complaint also alleges that after she filed her initial lawsuit, Ye stalked her by moving into her apartment complex and arranged a "swatting" incident at her home. Pisciotta is seeking unspecified damages and a jury trial.</p>

          <p>The famous red windmill sails of the Moulin Rouge in Paris are turning once again, 14 months after they collapsed due to high winds. The restoration was celebrated with a street performance by 60 can-can dancers and a fireworks display in the Montmartre district. The original collapse in April 2024 was attributed to a mechanical failure, and while new blades were installed before the Olympics, a motor delay kept them stationary. The return of the iconic spinning sails marks the full restoration of a landmark that attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists annually.</p>

In an interview, he argued that reliance on technology is causing human intellect to atrophy, turning people into "dumbed down machines." Welsh, who is releasing a sequel to his famous book, reflected on the 1990s as a time when people "had lives" and were more willing to engage with challenging art.

This means that even small increments of planetary warming can lead to significantly longer and more dangerous periods of extreme heat. The research, published in Nature Geoscience, indicates that the longest and rarest heat waves are showing the greatest increases in frequency. The findings underscore the urgent need for accelerated adaptation strategies to protect public health, infrastructure, and agriculture from the growing threat of prolonged and intense heat events.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a policy change that will exclude undocumented children from the federal Head Start preschool program, reversing decades of precedent. The move is part of a broader strategy to reclassify numerous federal programs as "public benefits" to bar access for immigrants without legal status. Critics, including the National Head Start Association, warn that the policy will create fear and confusion among all low-income families, not just those directly affected. This decision denies a vulnerable group of children access to early childhood education and other critical support services.</p>

          <p>Suspected asbestos fragments have been found in five locations surrounding a controversial bonfire site in south Belfast, prompting public health concerns. The Northern Ireland Environment Agency has already removed 20kg of material from the site, which is located near an electricity substation critical to two major hospitals. Despite requests from the city council to dismantle the structure, police have stated they will not assist contractors in removing the bonfire, citing a risk assessment. The bonfire is part of the annual Eleventh Night celebrations preceding the Twelfth of July.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss & Co. has raised its full-year revenue and earnings guidance, citing robust consumer demand and strong performance in its direct-to-consumer channels. The denim maker's second-quarter results surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by 11% growth in direct sales and significant gains in its women's apparel category. Company executives stated they are currently absorbing some of the financial impact from new tariffs, a strategy aided by strong sales and reduced promotions. However, they noted this approach depends on how U.S. trade policy evolves, with the current forecast based on specific tariff assumptions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has intensified its criticism of the Federal Reserve, with Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought accusing Chairman Jerome Powell of gross mismanagement. In a letter, Vought claimed Powell misled Congress about a costly renovation of the Fed's headquarters, which he described as "ostentatious" and significantly over budget. This new line of attack raises questions about whether the Trump administration is building a case to remove Powell for cause. The conflict highlights the ongoing tension between the administration, which has repeatedly called for interest rate cuts, and the independent central bank.</p>

Officials state the reorganization will eliminate Cold War-era redundancies and functions no longer considered priorities, such as merging several bureaus.

The plan aims to deter illegal crossings by showing they will be "in vain," though initial numbers are expected to be small.

          <p>President Donald Trump has waived executive privilege for former aides to Joe Biden, compelling them to provide unrestricted testimony to a Republican-led House investigation into Biden's health. This move forces Biden's former staff to choose between revealing confidential discussions or facing contempt of Congress. The action marks a reversal for Trump, who previously argued that such waivers would do "grave damage" to the presidency when Biden waived privilege for the Jan. 6 committee. Constitutional experts worry this sets a dangerous precedent of presidents using the privilege as a political weapon against their predecessors.</p>
