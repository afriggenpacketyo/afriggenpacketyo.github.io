          <p>This opinion article critiques President Trump's proposed TikTok deal, asserting that it ultimately benefits China despite appearances of increased U.S. control. While the deal raises American ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations to 80%, ByteDance, the Chinese parent company, retains a significant minority stake, making it the largest single shareholder. The author argues that this structure leaves China with considerable leverage over the platform's data and algorithms, potentially transforming what seems like a U.S. victory into a strategic win for President Xi Jinping. This outcome raises questions about the long-term security and control of American user data.</p>

          <p>The Dodgers clinched a 5-3 win over the Seattle Mariners, but their focus immediately shifts to critical roster decisions for the wild-card series, overshadowed by player health concerns. Max Muncy, Tommy Edman, and Will Smith are all dealing with injuries, making their postseason status uncertain. Manager Dave Roberts is navigating complex choices for the pitching staff, especially the bullpen, where a mix of veteran experience and rookie talent like Roki Sasaki and Emmet Sheehan are being considered. The team is also weighing options for position players, including Kiké Hernández and Michael Conforto, aiming to build the strongest possible lineup for their playoff run.</p>

          <p>The Wyoming town of Rock Springs is actively addressing its violent anti-immigrant history by dedicating a new, prominent monument commemorating the 1885 massacre of Chinese laborers. This event, one of the deadliest anti-Chinese incidents in U.S. history, saw a mob burn down Chinatown and kill 28 people amid labor disputes. Archeological research is now uncovering artifacts from the destroyed settlement, and local schools are incorporating the massacre into their curriculum. The town's mayor, while acknowledging the irony of honoring immigrant history amidst renewed ICE contracts, emphasizes the importance of confronting the past and promoting a more inclusive future for the community.</p>

          <h2>China's Hairy Crab Prices Fall Amid Weak Consumer Demand Before Golden Week</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 00:00:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of China's "super golden week" holiday, hairy crab prices have significantly dropped by approximately 20 yuan per kilogram compared to last year. Industry experts point to increased production, a decrease in traditional gift-giving, and general weak household spending as the primary causes for this market downturn. The extended eight-day holiday, combining National Day and the Mid-Autumn Festival, is being closely watched as a critical indicator for domestic consumption across various economic sectors, from retail to dining. This article underscores broader concerns about the current state of consumer demand in China's economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer, facing challenges from Reform UK and internal leadership speculation, expressed optimism about the Labour Party's prospects as its annual conference begins. He intends to position Labour as a unifying, patriotic alternative, strongly criticizing Nigel Farage for his "grubby" and "unpatriotic" rhetoric, particularly regarding immigration policies. Starmer highlighted a YouGov poll revealing public division over Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain, arguing such a move would be deeply divisive and detrimental to society by impacting long-term residents. The conference aims to present Labour's vision against what Starmer calls "toxic divide and decline."</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the Trump era could signify a "reverse convergence" in US-China relations, moving away from the long-held Western fantasy of societies becoming more alike through industrialization and liberal democratic values. The author suggests that rather than China adopting Western ideals, the United States is increasingly mirroring China's approach to political legitimacy and matters of war and peace. This emerging trend indicates a potential de-emphasis of ideology in their bilateral relationship, leading to a new dynamic where both nations might prioritize pragmatic, non-ideological governance strategies. Such a shift could profoundly reshape global power dynamics and diplomatic engagement between the two superpowers.</p>

          <h2>Venezuela Mobilizes Civilians for "Undeclared War" Amid Rising Tensions with US</h2>

          <p>Tensions in Venezuela are sharply rising as President Nicolás Maduro mobilizes and trains civilians for an "undeclared war," following recent US navy strikes that resulted in 17 deaths on alleged drug-carrying boats. The US military's deployment in the South Caribbean, officially for counter-narcotics operations, is perceived by Venezuela as an aggressive act, exacerbating already strained bilateral relations. Maduro's government, whose legitimacy is not recognized by the US, is instructing its National Bolivarian Militia, primarily older volunteers, on handling arms. Experts suggest the US deployment isn't indicative of an invasion, but the article highlights Maduro's strategy to use civilians as a "human shield" against potential US military action.</p>
