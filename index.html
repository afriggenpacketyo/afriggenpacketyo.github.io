        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy showed signs of faltering in July as key indicators like retail sales and industrial output missed forecasts. The slowdown is attributed to weak domestic demand, challenges from the external environment, and Beijing's policies to curb excess production capacity. Despite solid growth in the first half of the year, economists warn of risks and call for new policy support, with unemployment also ticking up. The data suggests that the initial post-stimulus momentum is fading, creating uncertainty for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of the summit in Alaska, U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have outlined President Trump's primary goal: to quickly assess if a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine is possible. The main objective is to achieve a ceasefire to allow for broader conversations about security guarantees and territorial disputes. The historical significance of Alaska as a meeting location is also being highlighted by experts, emphasizing the deep-rooted history in the U.S.-Russia relationship. The administration's hope is that the direct interaction can pave the way for a halt in the fighting.</p>

The FDNY and hazmat units responded quickly, and authorities later confirmed five separate letters contained the substance. While officials stated that no threat remains to the public, the powder is being tested and sent to the FBI for further analysis. The incident occurred at a location that has been a site of protests regarding the treatment of immigrants.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, which formed in the eastern Atlantic, is on a path to become the season's first hurricane by Friday. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict it will intensify into a large and formidable major hurricane over the weekend as it approaches the Caribbean. While it does not pose an immediate threat to the U.S. mainland, its long-term path remains uncertain, and tropical storm watches have been issued for the northern Leeward Islands. The storm has already caused deadly flooding in Cabo Verde, where a state of emergency was declared.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, has formally requested that Prime Minister Keir Starmer allow him to appoint peers to the House of Lords. In a letter, Farage argued that the current composition of the upper chamber is a "democratic disparity," noting that his party lacks representation despite significant vote shares and local election victories. He pointed out that parties with fewer votes, like the Liberal Democrats, have numerous peers. The decision to grant such appointments rests with the prime minister, and Downing Street has yet to comment on the request.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly escalated its federal law enforcement takeover of Washington D.C., appointing DEA chief Terry Cole as the city's "emergency police commissioner." This move grants Cole the full powers of the police chief, requiring the Metropolitan Police Department to seek his approval for all orders. The action was prompted by Attorney General Pam Bondi's disagreement with local "sanctuary policies" limiting cooperation with immigration agencies.

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has rescinded local directives in Washington D.C. that limited cooperation between the city's police and federal immigration agents. This effectively ends the capital's "sanctuary" policies, allowing full collaboration with ICE as part of the Trump administration's broader anti-crime crackdown. The move was enabled by an emergency declaration that placed the city's police under federal control. The new directive scraps rules that previously prevented D.C. police from arresting individuals solely on administrative immigration warrants or transferring them to ICE without a judicial order.</p>

          <p>Mali's ruling military junta announced it has foiled a coup attempt, arresting several military officers, civilians, and a French national alleged to be a foreign agent. The government claimed the plot was supported by "foreign states" and aimed to destabilize the country. This development occurs amid a broader crackdown on dissent, with the junta having recently dissolved political parties and extended its own mandate until 2030. Analysts suggest the arrests may be a tactic to intimidate opposition rather than a response to a legitimate coup, as discontent grows over the delayed return to civilian rule.</p>

While the annualized growth was positive, economists remain cautious, predicting a potential slowdown in the coming quarters due to softening investment and the full impact of tariffs.

Putin's objective is likely to persuade Trump that a swift peace deal on Russia's terms is the best path, while offering superficial concessions to allow Trump to claim a victory. The Russian delegation includes economic and defense officials, indicating that Putin may offer incentives like arms control pacts or business deals to appeal to Trump's transactional nature.

          <p>President Trump shrugged off concerns that Latin American countries are strengthening economic ties with China, stating that the U.S. economy is "blowing everyone away." His remarks came as Brazil increases its coordination with Beijing to develop a response to U.S. tariffs imposed in July. Trump asserted that other nations are not performing well economically compared to the United States. The comments reflect his administration's confidence in its economic policies despite growing international partnerships aimed at countering American trade measures.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department will seek the death penalty for Teresa Youngblut, a 21-year-old woman accused of murdering a Border Patrol agent in Vermont. Youngblut was indicted on a murder charge for the January shooting of Agent David Maland during a traffic stop. Authorities allege she opened fire on agents, leading to a shootout that also killed her companion. The two had been under surveillance and were reportedly linked to the Zizians, a cultlike group associated with several deaths across three states.</p>

          <p>As students in Los Angeles returned to school, many undocumented families expressed deep-seated fear due to increased immigration enforcement activity in the area. Some parents are reportedly hesitant to send their children to school, afraid of being separated by a raid. In response, the LAUSD has implemented "safe zones" around 100 schools, with volunteers monitoring for federal agent activity. The heightened anxiety follows several high-profile incidents, including a mistaken detention of a 15-year-old student, creating a traumatic environment for children and families throughout the district.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by ConsumerAffairs has ranked Oregon as the fourth-worst state to move to in 2025, citing poor scores for affordability, safety, and the economy. The report highlights that Oregon is the third-worst state for affordability and among the most vulnerable to environmental risks like wildfires and drought. In contrast, neighboring Washington fared better, ranking as the 35th best state. The analysis suggests these challenges are impacting Oregon's ability to attract and retain residents, with Utah, New Hampshire, and Idaho topping the list of best states.</p>

While the comeback is not flashy, the city's population has stabilized, and the unemployment rate is now only slightly above the national average.

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that two-thirds of Americans feel that expectations for tipping have grown in recent years. For many, tipping is seen as a way to show appreciation or supplement service workers' income, while others view it as an additional mandatory cost. The survey found that few people who noticed the trend thought it was a good thing, a sentiment that may be linked to broader public concerns about rising prices. The poll indicates a shift in social norms around gratuity that is not being universally welcomed by consumers.</p>

          <p>The British government is collaborating with medical influencers on TikTok to raise awareness about the dangers of traveling abroad for cosmetic procedures. The campaign addresses growing concerns over "medical tourism," where people seek cheaper treatments like dental work or surgery in other countries, sometimes with devastating results. The influencers will advise their followers to consult a UK doctor first, get proper insurance, and be wary of package deals. This initiative is part of a broader effort to protect patients and reduce the burden on the NHS, which often has to correct botched overseas procedures.</p>

          <p>Four years after famously adopting a completely plant-based menu, the three-Michelin-star restaurant Eleven Madison Park is reintroducing animal products. Chef Daniel Humm, who had championed the vegan shift as an ethical and creative imperative, announced that fish, meat, and other animal products will return to address flagging business. Humm cited a decline in private event bookings and wine sales, acknowledging it was difficult to attract corporate dinners to a plant-based restaurant. The reversal highlights the commercial challenges of high-end vegan dining, even for one of the world's most acclaimed culinary establishments.</p>
