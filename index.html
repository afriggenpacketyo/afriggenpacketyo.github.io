          <p>Scottie Scheffler secured his first US PGA Championship title at Quail Hollow, overcoming a mid-round challenge from Jon Rahm. Scheffler began with a three-shot lead, but Rahm's birdies narrowed the gap, creating a tense duel. Rahm faltered in the final holes, allowing Scheffler to secure the victory with a comfortable five-stroke margin. This win marks Scheffler's third major title, adding to his Masters victories in 2022 and 2024, solidifying his position as a top golfer.</p>

          <p>Gary Lineker is expected to leave the BBC following a social media post about Zionism that contained an antisemitic illustration, prompting speculation about his departure. Lineker, the BBC's highest-paid presenter, had previously announced his exit from Match of the Day at the end of the season but was slated to continue covering the FA Cup and World Cup in 2026. This incident follows a previous suspension in March 2023 for a post criticizing the government's asylum policy, highlighting ongoing tensions between Lineker's social media activity and the BBC's impartiality guidelines.</p>

          <p>After a 10-week blockade, Israel announced it would allow a "basic amount of food" into Gaza to prevent a starvation crisis, following increasing international pressure. The decision comes amid warnings from aid agencies about famine among Gaza's population and reports of severe malnutrition among children. This move coincides with Israel's announcement of "extensive ground operations" in Gaza aimed at defeating Hamas and freeing hostages. The article notes that negotiations for a ceasefire are ongoing, with Hamas proposing a full Israeli withdrawal and prisoner exchange, while Israel seeks a temporary truce for hostage release.</p>

The ship's masts snapped upon impact, injuring several sailors, and the ship lost power as it departed from South Street Seaport. Senator Charles Schumer questioned whether Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts may have contributed to the incident, citing a possible dysfunction within the Coast Guard's vehicle traffic service.

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone, according to a statement from his office. The cancer is characterized by a Gleason score of 9, indicating a high likelihood of rapid growth and spread, but it is also hormone-sensitive, potentially allowing for effective management. Doctors are reviewing treatment options with Biden and his family, which may include hormone therapy to slow the disease's progression. Despite the diagnosis, prostate cancer generally has a high five-year survival rate, even when it has spread.</p>

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer affecting men, behind skin cancer, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

The TSMC factory is closely guarded as it is the most important factory in the world, and it's being built by a company you've never heard of: TSMC, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.</p>

          <p>The recent armed clashes between India and Pakistan have inadvertently become a testing ground for competing military technologies, particularly Chinese versus Western and Russian systems. Pakistan's arsenal, bolstered by defense cooperation with China, increasingly features advanced Chinese air, missile, and drone systems. This contrasts with India's mix of Russian, Western, and domestically adapted platforms. The lower cost of Chinese systems, even if they offer slightly less capability, could reshape global defense procurement and strategic alignments.</p>
