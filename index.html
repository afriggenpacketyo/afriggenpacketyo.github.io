The thieves utilized a mobile freight elevator to access the Apollo gallery, smashed display cases with power tools, and fled on motorcycles within minutes. French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to recover the stolen items and bring the perpetrators to justice, as the museum remained closed for investigations.</p>

          <p>A fragile truce in Gaza faced a significant challenge as Israel launched air and artillery strikes, accusing Hamas of targeting its soldiers and killing two IDF personnel. An Israeli security official stated aid transfers into Gaza are halted indefinitely, while Prime Minister Netanyahu ordered "strong action" against "terrorist targets." Hamas denied involvement in any clashes, reaffirming its commitment to the ceasefire and stating contact with its groups in "red zones" was cut off months prior. Hospital sources in Gaza reported at least 38 fatalities since Sunday morning, escalating tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly denounced Colombian President Gustavo Petro as an "illegal drug leader" and announced the immediate cessation of all U.S. aid and subsidies to Colombia. This declaration followed Petro's accusations that U.S. forces committed "murder" by striking what he claimed was a fishing vessel, not a drug boat, killing a fisherman. Trump justified the aid cut by alleging Petro encourages massive drug production for U.S. sale, causing "death, destruction, and havoc." Petro countered Trump's remarks as "rude and ignorant," defending his record against drug trafficking amidst escalating tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Southeast Asia has seen a dramatic reduction in per capita tobacco consumption over two decades, attributed to strong political commitment and comprehensive public health policies. Despite this success, the absolute number of smokers has risen due to population growth, and the region now faces the new challenge of rising e-cigarette use, particularly among adolescents. Indonesia remains an outlier with high male tobacco use and strong industry influence, recently scrapping a planned tax hike. While many countries ban vaping, others like Malaysia struggle with regulation due to political sensitivities and economic factors.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to resume student loan forgiveness under two income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) and Pay as You Earn (PAYE), following an agreement with the American Federation of Teachers. This decision reopens a path to debt cancellation for over 2.5 million borrowers, after the administration had previously paused such forgiveness. The "big beautiful bill" will phase out ICR and PAYE by July 1, 2028, but for now, eligible borrowers will receive relief. Additionally, forgiveness granted in 2025 will be federally tax-free.</p>

          <p>Bolivia is undergoing a significant political transition with a presidential run-off election pitting two conservative capitalists, Jorge Quiroga and Rodrigo Paz, against each other. This election follows two decades of leftist rule and comes amidst the country's worst economic crisis in decades, characterized by a US dollar shortage and high inflation. Both candidates promise to stabilize the economy, fix the exchange rate, and attract foreign investment, though they differ on approaches to IMF loans and fuel subsidies. The outcome is expected to shift Bolivia's alliances towards the US, impacting the hemisphere economically and geopolitically.</p>

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband suggested the government is considering cutting the 5% VAT rate on energy bills, acknowledging a nationwide "cost-of-living crisis." While not confirming details ahead of the Chancellor's November Budget, Miliband emphasized addressing high bills and the country's dependence on fossil fuels. Scrapping VAT on domestic energy bills could save average households £86 annually, costing an estimated £2.5 billion per year. The government is also reportedly looking at reducing regulatory levies on energy bills, amidst political debate over net-zero policies and energy costs.</p>

          <p>A diplomatic controversy erupted after US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth wore a white, blue, and red striped tie, resembling the Russian flag, during Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to the White House. Russian state media highlighted the tie, and a Putin envoy shared an image, fueling speculation. While US Vice-President JD Vance defended it as American colors, the sartorial choice occurred amid concerns over President Trump's shifting stance on Ukraine aid. Hegseth has previously called for Ukraine to cede territory, adding to the complexity of the diplomatic situation.</p>

          <p>Green Party leader Zack Polanski defended his party's proposals for an annual wealth tax, advocating it as a means to "tackle the deep inequality in our society." The party's manifesto suggested a 1% tax on assets above £10 million and 2% on assets above £1 billion, which Polanski estimates could raise £15-£25 billion annually. Critics argue such a tax could penalize investment and encourage the wealthy to leave the country. Polanski also called for aligning capital gains tax with income tax, emphasizing that the focus should be on the wealthiest to contribute more to public services.</p>

          <p>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson defended his characterization of "No Kings Day" anti-Trump protests as "hate America" rallies, asserting he was referring to the protesters' messages, not Democrats themselves. He cited "violent rhetoric" against the president and a "rise of Marxism" within the Democratic Party. Johnson also addressed his delay in swearing in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, citing a "Pelosi precedent" for waiting until the House is in session. He also commented on the commutation of George Santos's sentence, affirming the president's right to clemency and downplaying political motivations.</p>

          <p>A leak of bigoted messages, including racist, homophobic, and antisemitic epithets, from a Young Republicans Telegram chat has intensified internal rifts within the organization. The messages, which included a call to "sexual assault Hayden," revealed deep divisions stemming from an August leadership election. While some state chapters condemned the texts, others remained silent or questioned their authenticity. This incident exposes severe factionalism and "unkind" behavior among members, potentially hindering the organization's effectiveness for the Republican Party in future elections.

          <p>Approximately 91,585 pounds of frozen breakfast burritos and wraps, distributed through federal school breakfast and lunch programs, have been recalled due to potential listeria contamination. The California-based M.C.I. Foods initiated the recall after discovering listeria during routine testing of egg ingredients from external suppliers. No illnesses have been confirmed, but officials urge institutions not to serve these products, which include items from El Mas Fino, Los Cabos, and Midamar brands. Listeria infection can be serious, particularly for vulnerable populations, and is a leading cause of foodborne illness deaths.</p>
