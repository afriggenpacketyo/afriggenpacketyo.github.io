        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has processed 2.5 million retroactive payments for public pension holders, addressing previous benefit restrictions under the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO). These payments are a result of the Social Security Fairness Act, signed into law by President Biden in January 2025, which aims to adjust benefits for 3.2 million individuals. Beneficiaries should have received a one-time retroactive payment by the end of March 2025, with new monthly benefits reflecting increases starting in April. Those who have not received their payments can check their account online or call the SSA to ensure their information is up-to-date. Optimism is present as most cases have been processed, but some complex cases will take longer.

          <p>Satellite images reveal the aftermath of a Ukrainian drone attack, dubbed "Operation Spider's Web," on Russian airbases, reportedly destroying 41 military bombers. The images from Belaya and Oleya airbases show debris, burn scars, and some seemingly untouched aircraft with unusual items placed on top. Ukraine claims the attack inflicted over $7 billion in damage, while Russia asserts the estimates are exaggerated and that fires were extinguished. This attack occurred as delegates from both countries met in Istanbul for peace negotiations, and President Trump discussed the attack with President Putin during a phone call.

          <p>Elon Musk has intensified his criticism of President Donald Trump's tax-cut bill, claiming it will lead to "debt slavery" for America. Musk urged lawmakers to reject the bill, advocating for a new spending plan that does not significantly increase the deficit. This opposition comes shortly after Musk departed from the Trump administration, where he headed the government-shrinking group known as DOGE. According to a source, Musk's stance is partly influenced by the bill's cuts to an electric vehicle tax credit that benefits Tesla. The article outlines Musk's arguments against the bill and his call to action.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court is considering a novel approach to protect federal civil servants from political firings by the Trump administration. Due to Trump's actions, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), which safeguards civil servants, lacks a quorum and cannot operate. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals suggests that if the MSPB cannot fulfill its role, federal courts should step in to hear cases of illegally fired civil servants. This proposal aims to close a legal loophole that has left civil servants unprotected, potentially challenging the "unitary executive" theory embraced by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Following a phone call with Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump warned that the Russian president will retaliate for Ukraine's drone attack on Russian airbases. Trump's call with Putin was the first since a major Ukrainian attack on missile-carrying aircraft deep inside Russia. Putin reportedly told Trump that Ukraine has tried to "disrupt" negotiations and has "essentially turned into a terrorist organization." The conversation between the two leaders marks the first since Ukraine launched a surprise attack using smuggled drones to strike Russian airbases on June 1, targeting what it said were nuclear-capable long-range bombers.</p>

          <p>Congressional forecasters estimate that President Trump's tariffs could reduce the federal deficit by $2.8 trillion over the next decade if they remain in place. This could potentially offset the $2.4 trillion increase in the deficit projected from the House-passed budget bill. However, the forecast includes caveats, such as uncertainty about the impact of high taxes on imports and the potential for retaliatory measures. The tariffs are also projected to result in higher inflation and slower economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>
