          <p>Li-Young Lee's poem, 'Infant Longing,' delves into the cyclical nature of the world, marked by both creation and destruction, innocence and slaughter. The speaker reflects on their mother's experiences of finding and burying loved ones amidst violence, and the sustenance she provided through her own longing. The poem uses the imagery of kissing to explore the duality of sealing and opening, closing and opening eyes, questioning the difference between these acts. Ultimately, the poem finds a glimmer of hope in the union of two souls, suggesting an infinite longing that transcends time and earthly boundaries.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to end the recruitment of care workers from abroad as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that firms will be required to hire British nationals or extend visas of existing overseas workers. The government also intends to raise the threshold for skilled visas to graduate level and introduce stricter training requirements for unemployed individuals. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp criticized the plans as insufficient and called for an annual migration cap.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva for a second day of high-stakes negotiations aimed at easing trade tensions stemming from tariffs imposed by both countries. These tariffs have disrupted global supply chains, leading American companies to seek alternative sources and Chinese factories to explore new export routes. Economists have warned that the trade dispute could slow global growth and fuel inflation, prompting the Trump administration to seek a resolution. Ahead of the meetings, Trump suggested lowering tariffs to 80% if China makes concessions, while China has maintained it will not make concessions in response to tariffs.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is escalating his anti-Ukraine rhetoric with a smear campaign aimed at discrediting Ukraine's EU accession. This campaign involves pro-government media platforms disseminating propaganda that portrays Ukraine as a hub for drug trafficking and organized crime. Orban's actions are seen as a way to divert attention from domestic political challenges, including the rising popularity of opposition leader Peter Magyar, and to appeal to far-right voters with revisionist sentiments. Experts suggest Orban's stance also serves as a declaration of loyalty to Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump.</p>

The fire forced them to reconsider their priorities, and the political climate under the Trump administration led them to decide to move to Spain. While acknowledging the privilege of having this option, they feel it is a more prudent and positive step than rebuilding in an America that feels increasingly unwelcoming. They intend to return someday when they feel more optimistic about the United States' prospects.</p>

          <p>A study reveals that nearly half of Americans engage in some form of preparedness for adverse events, reflecting a deep-seated cultural value of self-reliance. This trend is driven by a combination of factors, including historical narratives of frontier self-sufficiency and contemporary anxieties about extreme weather events and inadequate government responses. While the ultra-rich may invest in extravagant bunkers, prepping is also a significant phenomenon among the middle class, with shelf-stable food and home fallout shelter kits gaining popularity. The growing interest in doomsday prepping underscores a broader question about the balance between individual responsibility and collective action in confronting societal challenges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly poised to accept a super luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the royal family of Qatar, intended for use as Air Force One until shortly before Trump leaves office, after which ownership would transfer to the Trump presidential library foundation. The arrangement raises legal questions about accepting such a valuable gift from a foreign power. Lawyers for the White House counsel's office and the Department of Justice have drafted an analysis concluding that the gift is legal and does not violate bribery laws or the Constitution's emoluments clause.</p>

          <p>A proposal to replace public basketball courts with pickleball facilities on Fort Lauderdale's historic beachfront has ignited controversy, with some residents alleging a racial motive. The basketball courts, built shortly after the end of segregation, are popular among a diverse group of players. Critics fear the conversion to pickleball will erase a community tradition and "whiten" the beach. While the developer asserts the decision was based on pickleball's broader appeal, some remain skeptical and see it as an attempt to exclude minority residents.</p>
