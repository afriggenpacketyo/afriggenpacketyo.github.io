          <p>Senator Ron Johnson stated that he believes there are enough Republican senators who oppose the House's budget bill to potentially stall its progress and demand changes. This highlights the challenges the bill faces in the Senate, despite passing narrowly in the House. Fiscal conservatives in the Senate are concerned about the bill's lack of spending reduction and its potential impact on the national debt. Johnson indicated that they intend to halt the legislative process until the President addresses spending and deficit concerns, emphasizing the difficult path ahead for the bill.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the House-passed tax and border bill, dubbed the "big, beautiful bill," against criticism from Senate Republicans and economists. The bill includes tax cuts, border security funding, and changes to social programs, estimated to cost between $4 trillion and $5 trillion over the next decade. Johnson argues that the bill will stimulate economic growth through tax and regulation reductions, while addressing fraud and abuse in programs like Medicaid and SNAP. He also urged Senate colleagues to minimize modifications to the bill, but faces opposition over provisions such as Medicaid cuts and state and local tax deductions.</p>

          <p>Despite pledging to halt funding for fossil fuels, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas projects, particularly liquefied natural gas (LNG), investing $93 billion between 2013 and 2024. This investment contradicts Japan's climate-friendly promises and its leadership in the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC), which promotes cooperation on net-zero emissions. Critics argue that Japan's promotion of LNG as a "transitional fuel" for its partner countries is a form of greenwashing, as LNG involves significantly more emissions than coal when processing and shipping are considered. Japan's energy policies risk hindering the transition to renewable energy in Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>A new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" focuses on being deeply attuned to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, trust, and connection through open conversations. This approach involves accepting a child's emotions without dismissing them, responding without shaming, and viewing misbehavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents also take responsibility after conflicts by apologizing and reconnecting, creating an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves authentically. Practicing emotionally safe parenting involves doing inner work to understand personal triggers, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame through healthy repair.</p>

          <p>Germany's finance minister, Lars Klingbeil, has joined European politicians in urging talks with the U.S. after President Trump threatened to impose 50% tariffs on imports from Europe starting next week. Klingbeil warned that the tariffs would endanger both the U.S. and European economies, emphasizing the need for serious negotiations. The EU's trade chief, Maroš Šefčovič, stated the bloc's commitment to a deal that works for both sides and stressed that trade relations should be based on mutual respect, not threats.

          <p>President Trump's warming relationship with the new Syrian leader has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region. Since Trump's meeting with Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara, Israeli airstrikes on Syria have significantly decreased. Previously, Israel had launched numerous attacks to prevent weapons from falling into hostile hands and to counter extremist groups near its border. Trump's shift in policy has undercut Israel's efforts to leverage instability in Syria and prevent the rise of another anti-Israel neighbor, leading to a potential de-escalation and a willingness to engage in dialogue with the Syrian regime.</p>

Most countries and the 125,000 residents of Essequibo consider it part of Guyana.
