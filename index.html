          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva for crucial trade negotiations aimed at de-escalating the ongoing trade war. These talks mark the first high-level discussions since tariffs on Chinese imports were increased to 145 percent by the U.S., leading to retaliatory levies by China. While expectations for a significant breakthrough are tempered, the fact that discussions are occurring has raised hopes for a potential easing of tensions. The impact of these tariffs is already affecting the global economy, causing businesses to pass additional costs onto consumers and reorient supply chains.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge detention in court, in certain cases. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller stated that the Constitution allows for the suspension of this legal liberty in times of rebellion or invasion. This consideration comes as judges have challenged detentions made by the administration in efforts to combat illegal immigration and remove dissenting foreign students. Legal experts have questioned the administration's interpretation of U.S. law, noting that Congress, not the president, holds the power to suspend habeas corpus.
