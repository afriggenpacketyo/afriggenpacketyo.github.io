          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues Israeli-Backed Food Program in Gaza is an "Alibi for Starvation"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 05:00:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a commentary piece, Alex de Waal argues that the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), backed by the US and Israel, is failing to address the mass starvation in Gaza and instead serves as a deceptive cover. He contends that the 2 million meals provided daily are less than half of what is needed and that the distribution system, located in dangerous military zones, is inaccessible to the most vulnerable. The article asserts that the program lacks essential therapeutic foods for malnourished children and operates in a way that humiliates Palestinians. It concludes that the GHF is an alibi to avoid accusations of starvation, not a genuine humanitarian effort.</p>

          <p>A report details a growing trend of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arresting asylum seekers at their scheduled court hearings. The article highlights the story of a Cuban journalist who, despite following legal procedures and having a future court date, was apprehended by masked agents immediately after her hearing. This tactic is part of a broader push for increased arrests under the Trump administration, creating fear and confusion within immigrant communities and undermining the perceived safety of the legal process. The practice targets individuals even if their cases are not dismissed, casting a wide net that disrupts lives and access to due process.</p>

          <p>Rapper Snoop Dogg has collaborated with the Zac Brown Band on a new country-rap song titled "Let It Run," which he describes as "gangster gumbo." The artists recently performed the song live for the first time during a concert in Los Angeles. This is not Snoop Dogg's first venture into country music, as he has previously worked with artists like Willie Nelson and Ernest, viewing the genre as a form of hip-hop. The article also notes his recent promotional campaign with the fast-food chain Raising Cane's for its "Chicken Finger Day" holiday, highlighting his diverse collaborations across music and branding.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is experiencing a paradoxical situation where home prices hit an all-time high in June, even as the volume of sales reached a nine-month low. This divergence is attributed to a "haves and have-nots" market, where affluent, all-cash buyers and those with existing home equity can afford the high prices, particularly in the luxury segment. Meanwhile, high mortgage rates, currently averaging 6.74%, are sidelining many first-time and middle-income buyers. The limited inventory, exacerbated by current homeowners being "locked in" to lower mortgage rates, contributes to the sustained high prices, creating significant affordability challenges.

          <p>Representatives for Syria's Kurdish minority have declared that disarmament is a "red line" as they navigate a critical political landscape. Peace talks with Syria's interim government have been postponed, with key disagreements over the integration of Kurdish forces into the national army and control of their autonomous region. Turkey, which views the Syrian Kurds as a threat, is reportedly seeking a defense deal with Damascus that could further pressure the Kurds. This situation leaves the semi-autonomous Kurdish region in a precarious position, with analysts suggesting potential for further instability unless a durable political solution is achieved.</p>

The comments come amid continued interest from Liverpool in the 25-year-old Swedish international, who did not travel with the team for a pre-season tour due to a thigh injury. Howe acknowledged the speculation surrounding Isak but expressed his hope that the player, who has a contract until 2028, will continue his journey with the club. He emphasized the club's strong financial position and ambition, while also acknowledging the unpredictable nature of the football transfer market.</p>

This pressure is part of a broader trend of shrinking space for civil liberties and rising authoritarianism in Pakistan, which has seen a decline in its democracy ranking.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is planning to remove all 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), according to a source familiar with the matter. The independent panel is responsible for making evidence-based recommendations on clinical preventive services, such as cancer screenings, which must then be covered by insurance. The source indicated that Kennedy views the influential group as being too "woke." An HHS spokesperson stated that no final decision has been made on the task force's future, but a scheduled meeting was abruptly canceled earlier this month.</p>

          <p>China has taken a significant step forward in its next-generation nuclear energy plans with the design finalization of the CFR-1000. This will be the country's first commercial, gigawatt-level fast neutron reactor, a type of advanced fourth-generation nuclear technology. The facility, which is now awaiting final approval, is expected to become operational after 2030 and is part of a global race to develop more fuel-efficient nuclear power sources. The milestone was announced at an event in Fujian province, where China has already constructed a smaller demonstration version of the fast reactor technology.</p>
