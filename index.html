          <p>George Clooney's latest film, "Jay Kelly," has premiered at the Venice Film Festival to largely positive reviews, with some critics calling it a "midlife crisis masterpiece." In the movie, directed by Noah Baumbach, Clooney plays an aging movie star grappling with his life choices and legacy, a role that draws parallels to his own career. The film, which also stars Adam Sandler and Laura Dern, is already generating awards season buzz for its crowd-pleasing yet subtle examination of identity and fame.</p>

          <p>Automotive research firm Edmunds suggests that this Labor Day weekend is an opportune time for consumers to lease electric vehicles. A significant $7,500 federal tax credit for new EV leases is set to expire on September 30, along with a $4,000 credit for used EVs. With EV prices declining and leasing becoming the dominant way consumers acquire these vehicles, the expiring credit offers substantial savings. The IRS has also clarified that eligibility is tied to the contract date, not the delivery date, giving buyers more flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), Colin Smyth, has had his parliamentary pass deactivated following reports that he placed a camera in a Holyrood toilet. Smyth was previously suspended by the Labour Party after being charged with possessing indecent images of children and is now reportedly facing an additional charge. The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body took the action due to the ongoing criminal investigation, effectively barring him from the parliament building as it prepares to return from recess.</p>

While touting that overall crime numbers are down, Newsom acknowledged that public perception is key and that targeted, data-driven operations are needed to address community concerns. The move is also seen as a pushback against President Trump's narrative about crime in blue states and his threats to use military forces for local law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The recent leadership crisis at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including the firing of its director and multiple high-level resignations, stems from a deep conflict over vaccine policy and public health science. The upheaval is linked to measures by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, to overhaul federal health agencies. Resigning officials have cited an inability to serve in an environment that disregards scientific reality, creating concerns about the agency's future and the erosion of public trust.</p>

          <p>Robert Primus, a Democratic member of the Surface Transportation Board (STB), was fired by the Trump administration on Wednesday. Primus stated he was blindsided by the termination, discovering he was locked out of his work phone after returning from an Amtrak event. His ouster comes as the STB reviews a major merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern, a deal Primus had indicated he opposed. The White House claimed Primus did not align with the president's agenda, while rail worker unions condemned the move as an assault on regulatory independence.</p>

The lawsuit argues that the president's action subverts the Federal Reserve Act and is an attempt to undermine the central bank's independence, setting up a significant legal battle over presidential power.</p>

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a hose in the rear brake system can rupture, which may lead to increased brake pedal travel and longer stopping distances.
