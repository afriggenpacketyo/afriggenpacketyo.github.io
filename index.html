          <p>A significant Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv has resulted in at least 23 deaths, including four children, and left dozens wounded. The bombardment destroyed a residential building and caused damage to the nearby European Union delegation office and the British Council. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed outrage, calling the strikes a deliberate escalation that mocks peace efforts. The attack, the largest on the capital this month, has drawn widespread condemnation from European and American leaders.</p>

          <p>A new Texas law, SB 17, is set to take effect, restricting individuals and companies from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from purchasing or renting property. State officials defend the bill as a measure to protect national security, but opponents, including community activists and business owners, argue it is discriminatory and xenophobic. The law has created uncertainty and fear within immigrant communities, with critics drawing parallels to historical anti-immigrant legislation like the Chinese Exclusion Act.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace has secured a spot in the Conference League league phase after a 1-0 aggregate victory over Fredrikstad in their play-off round. Having been demoted from the Europa League due to multi-club ownership rules, qualifying for the third-tier European competition was a key objective for the club. Manager Oliver Glasner, who previously won the Europa League, brings valuable experience, and the team is now seen as a potential contender to win the tournament, which would continue a historic year for the FA Cup winners.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Compares President Trump's Behavior to the Character Homelander from 'The Boys'</h2>

          <p>This opinion article draws a parallel between President Trump's assertions of unlimited power and the character of Homelander, an omnipotent and narcissistic superhero from the TV series "The Boys." The author argues that both figures are surrounded by sycophants and display a childlike need for adoration, creating a dangerous environment. However, the piece concludes that unlike the fictional character, Trump is a mortal politician constrained by the Constitution, the courts, and ultimately, the voters, urging citizens to counter his authoritarian posturing with truth, satire, and democratic participation.</p>

          <p>An executive order signed by President Trump is suspending the "de minimis" rule, which for decades has allowed low-value packages to enter the U.S. without import taxes. Effective Friday, all shipments will be subject to a duty, ending the exception that applied to goods valued under $800. This change is expected to significantly impact online retailers like Temu and Shein, which have heavily relied on the rule, and will likely lead to higher prices for American consumers on many cheap imported goods.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Trump to prevent her removal from the central bank's board, with a judge scheduling an urgent hearing. Trump moved to fire Cook "for cause," citing allegations of mortgage fraud, which her lawsuit calls "nakedly pretextual" and an illegal attempt to undermine the Fed's independence. The case represents an unprecedented challenge to the statutory protections for Fed governors and is seen as part of a broader effort by the administration to exert political control over the nation's monetary policy.</p>
