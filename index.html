          <p>A federal jury in New York found Sean "Diddy" Combs guilty on two counts of transporting individuals across state lines for prostitution, charges that could result in up to 10 years in prison for each count. However, he was acquitted of the more severe charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. The verdict followed a seven-week trial featuring graphic testimony from former girlfriends, including singer Cassie Ventura, who described a pattern of control and abuse. The prosecution alleged Combs used his business empire as a criminal enterprise, while the defense argued the activities were consensual aspects of a swinger lifestyle.</p>

          <p>Del Monte Foods, a nearly 140-year-old staple of American pantries, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as it seeks a buyer for the company. The canned goods producer cited declining consumer demand and a shift in preferences towards healthier, less-processed alternatives as key factors in its financial struggles. With liabilities estimated between $1 billion and $10 billion, the company has secured $912.5 million in financing to continue operations during the court-supervised sale process.

          <p>This article provides a detailed timeline of the University of Idaho murders case, from the night of the killings in November 2022 to the expected guilty plea of suspect Bryan Kohberger. It recounts the stabbings of four students, the subsequent investigation that led to Kohberger's arrest through DNA evidence, and the key legal proceedings. Kohberger, a former criminology student, has accepted a plea deal to avoid the death penalty, agreeing to four consecutive life sentences without parole. The deal has drawn mixed reactions from the victims' families, with some expressing relief and others condemning it as a failure of justice.</p>

The agreement, which requires him to waive all appeal rights, has divided the victims' families, with some supporting the deal to avoid a lengthy trial and others expressing anger.

          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court, in a 4-3 decision, has struck down the state's 176-year-old abortion ban. The liberal-majority court ruled that the 1849 law, which made performing an abortion a felony, was superseded by a 1985 law that permits abortions until fetal viability. The ruling provides legal certainty for abortion access in the state, which had been in question since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The decision resolves a lawsuit filed by the state's Democratic attorney general and solidifies the legality of abortions that had resumed after a lower court's 2023 ruling.</p>

          <p>German companies are increasingly looking to Taiwan as a source for drones and their components, aiming to reduce their reliance on China, which dominates the global market. A recent report indicates Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones in early 2025, a shift driven by security concerns and China's tightening of its own drone export controls. While a complete decoupling from China is considered unrealistic, Germany is focused on diversifying its supply of critical components like software and chips. This trend reflects a broader European effort to achieve defense autonomy and build "non-red" supply chains independent of Chinese influence.</p>

          <p>Chinese merchants selling on Amazon are facing uncertainty ahead of the annual Prime Day sales event due to the looming threat of U.S. tariffs. Many sellers of low-margin goods have already raised prices by 10-20% to absorb costs, but they are constrained by the hyper-competitive nature of the platform. This situation puts them in a difficult position, as they must balance profitability with the need to offer steep discounts for the sales event. The timing is critical, with a U.S. tariff deadline approaching just before Prime Day begins, leaving many to wonder how it will impact prices for American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of ethnic Lhotshampa refugees, who were resettled in the United States after being expelled from Bhutan, are now facing deportation again after being sent back to Nepal. Having been deported from the U.S. for various reasons, they were denied re-entry into Bhutan and subsequently entered Nepal, where many grew up in refugee camps. Now, Nepalese authorities are charging them with illegal entry and initiating procedures to deport them, creating a stateless crisis. Refugee rights advocates have condemned the move as inhumane, as these individuals are being punished for a lack of citizenship that was forced upon them.</p>

          <p>Private sector employment in the U.S. unexpectedly declined in June, with a loss of 33,000 jobs, according to a report from payroll firm ADP. This figure starkly contrasts with economists' forecasts of a 100,000-job gain and marks the first decrease since March 2023. The job losses were concentrated in service-providing sectors like professional services and health, while goods-producing roles saw a modest increase. ADP's chief economist attributed the decline to a hesitancy to hire and replace departing workers, suggesting a potential cooling in the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>
