          <p>The British Medical Association has scheduled a five-day strike for resident doctors in England, beginning November 14, after negotiations with the government stalled. This marks the 13th strike in a protracted dispute over pay and working conditions. The union asserts that despite recent pay increases, resident doctors' real-term pay is still 20% lower than in 2008 due to inflation. Talks had focused on career progression and expenses, as the Health Secretary has refused further pay negotiations, but the lack of progress has prompted renewed industrial action.</p>

Speaking at the Bund Summit in Shanghai, she stated it is too early to "claim victory" despite some large IPOs, such as CATL's US$5.3 billion offering. Chan highlighted the upcoming expiration of the US-China tariff truce and potential new tariffs as sources of uncertainty. To mitigate risks, the HKEX plans to diversify its revenue by strengthening its fixed-income product offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former British paratrooper, identified only as Soldier F, has been acquitted of murder and attempted murder charges related to the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Northern Ireland. The veteran was accused of killing two people and attempting to kill five others when soldiers opened fire on civil rights marchers. The trial, held 53 years after the event, concluded with no conviction, a result that follows a long and painful campaign for justice by the victims' families. Key evidence from a 2010 inquiry could not be used in the criminal trial, and the prosecution's case was deemed insufficient.</p>

          <p>Dave Ball, the musician and co-founder of the pioneering 1980s synth-pop band Soft Cell, has passed away at the age of 66. Alongside singer Marc Almond, Ball was instrumental in creating the band's iconic sound, which produced the worldwide hit "Tainted Love." He later formed the successful techno group The Grid. Ball died peacefully in his sleep following a period of ill health, just weeks after completing a new Soft Cell album with Almond, which is scheduled for release in 2026. Almond paid tribute to him as a "wonderfully brilliant musical genius."</p>

          <p>In a new interview for the 40th anniversary of "Back to the Future," actor Michael J. Fox spoke out against what he calls a pervasive "bully culture" in society today. He identified his own battle with Parkinson's disease as his personal "bully," drawing a parallel to the film's themes of standing up to adversity and showing resilience. Fox, who was diagnosed with the degenerative brain disorder 35 years ago, is returning to acting in the show "Shrinking," where his character also has Parkinson's. He emphasized the importance of courage in confronting life's challenges, whether they are bullies, time, or a chronic illness.</p>

          <p>In an economy marked by inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace rising costs. While national average yields for CDs are relatively low, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some six-month CDs offering APYs around 4.45%. The article notes an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently provide better returns than long-term ones. To maximize earnings, consumers are advised to compare offers from online banks and consider strategies like CD laddering to lock in high rates for various terms. (not investment advice)</p>

He recounts how the discipline of running helped him reclaim his health and identity after his diagnosis, ultimately running a marathon faster than before he got sick.

          <p>A jury has found six men guilty of rioting in the Ely district of Cardiff in May 2023. The violence erupted after two local teenagers, Kyrees Sullivan and Harvey Evans, died in an e-bike crash, sparking rumors on social media that they were being pursued by police. The subsequent disorder involved a crowd of 100 to 150 people. While one man was acquitted of the riot charge, he had already pleaded guilty to assaulting a police officer. The judge warned the convicted men that they would likely face significant custodial sentences for their roles in the unrest.</p>

          <p>A Metropolitan Police officer, PC Philip Neilson, has been dismissed with immediate effect for gross misconduct after being secretly recorded making "highly racist and discriminatory remarks" during a BBC Panorama investigation. The panel upheld allegations that Neilson made offensive comments about various ethnic groups, referred to an "invasion" of "scum," and suggested a detainee should have a "bullet through his head." Despite his denial of being a racist, the panel ruled his comments caused "significant harm" to the police's reputation. He is the first of ten officers facing accelerated misconduct hearings as a result of the undercover report.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The growth rate for single-family home rents in the U.S. slowed to just 1.4% in August year-over-year, the smallest increase recorded in 15 years, according to data from Cotality. This slowdown was observed across all price tiers, continuing a cooling trend seen in the second half of the year. While cities like Chicago still saw robust growth, others like Dallas experienced a slight decline in rent prices due to a surge in new apartment construction. This trend mirrors the multifamily apartment sector, where a construction boom has increased supply and pushed the national vacancy rate to a record high. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Colorado River basin is facing a critical water shortage, escalating a conflict among the seven U.S. states and Mexico that rely on its supply. Prolonged drought and a warming climate have reduced the river to a trickle, with its largest reservoirs, Lakes Mead and Powell, at dangerously low levels. States are currently in high-stakes negotiations to establish new water-sharing rules after 2026, as current consumption rates are unsustainable. The core of the dispute lies in overuse and historical allocations that overestimated the river's capacity, pitting agricultural needs against the demands of 40 million people.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has confirmed that the "existing structure" of the White House East Wing will be completely torn down to make way for a new $250 million ballroom. This represents a significant expansion of the project, which was initially presented as an addition that would not interfere with the current building. The move has drawn criticism from Democratic politicians and conservationists over a lack of transparency and public review for a project impacting a historic landmark. Trump defended the demolition, stating the wing had been heavily modified over the years and that the project was being funded privately.</p>

          <p>European aerospace and defense giants Airbus, Thales, and Leonardo have announced a merger of their satellite and space activities to create a new, unified European space company. The joint venture aims to establish a powerful regional player with the scale to compete globally, particularly against Elon Musk's Starlink. The new entity will employ 25,000 people and combine the companies' complementary technologies to offer end-to-end space solutions, excluding space launchers. This move is seen as a pivotal step for Europe to enhance its technological sovereignty and build a more competitive presence in the increasingly dynamic global space market.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 08:15:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be around 2.7% to 2.8%, a modest increase compared to the record-high adjustments seen during the post-pandemic inflation spike. While the COLA is designed to help benefits keep pace with rising prices, some retirees express concern that the smaller increase will not be enough to cover elevated costs for essentials like healthcare and housing. The adjustment is calculated based on the Consumer Price Index, so as inflation cools, the COLA also decreases, reflecting a more stable but still challenging economic environment for beneficiaries.
