          <p>Ian Watkins, the former lead singer of the rock band Lostprophets, has died at the age of 48 after being attacked in HMP Wakefield. Watkins was serving a 29-year sentence for numerous child sex offenses, including the attempted sexual assault of a baby. West Yorkshire Police have arrested two men on suspicion of murder following the incident, which occurred at a facility recently criticized for a marked increase in violence. The attack highlights ongoing safety concerns within the prison system, particularly for inmates convicted of sexual offenses.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed doubling tariffs to 50% on steel imports that exceed a newly reduced quota, a move aimed at tackling global overproduction and protecting its domestic industry. This policy mirrors similar tariffs imposed by the United States, leading to speculation that Brussels is seeking leverage for trade concessions from Washington. While the European Steel Association has welcomed the measure as a "lifeline," China has criticized it as a protectionist step. The new tariff structure could also negatively impact major steel exporters to the EU, such as the United Kingdom and India. (not investment advice)</p>

Data from the China Passenger Car Association reveals a 10% sales decline for major dealers in the first half of 2025, following an 18% drop in 2024. Industry groups are now urging Chinese authorities and banks to provide financial support to the approximately 30,000 dealerships, warning that many could face corporate failure within the next two years without intervention.

          <p>The European Union has begun a phased rollout of its new Entry/Exit System (EES), a digital framework designed to track non-EU citizens entering and leaving the 29-country Schengen Area. The system, which will eventually replace manual passport stamping, requires travelers to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, upon their first entry. While intended to enhance security and streamline travel, concerns have been raised about potential delays at major transit points like the Port of Dover and Eurostar terminals during the initial implementation period.

          <p>Scotland's head coach, Steve Clarke, has expressed his determination to qualify for the upcoming men's World Cup, viewing it as an opportunity to "put right" the team's painful 2022 play-off loss to Ukraine. Having already led Scotland to two consecutive European Championships, Clarke is now focused on ending the nation's 28-year absence from the World Cup finals. He reflected on the strange build-up to the rescheduled Ukraine match and the absence of key players as contributing factors to that disappointment. A victory in their next match against Belarus would significantly boost their qualification chances.</p>

          <p>A recent agreement in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein formalizing the right for Muslim students and employees to request unpaid leave for two major Islamic holidays has ignited a public debate. While the policy simply affirms an existing legal practice rooted in religious freedom, some media outlets inaccurately portrayed it as granting "extra holidays" exclusively to Muslims. Legal scholars clarify that the regulation is unremarkable and aligns with how other non-Christian religious holidays are treated in Germany.

          <p>The Philippines has accused a Chinese Coast Guard ship of deliberately ramming one of its government vessels near Thitu Island in the disputed South China Sea.

China responded by blaming the Philippines for the collision, stating the Filipino vessels had "illegally entered" its waters.

          <p>A collaborative team of researchers from China and the Netherlands has identified the mechanism that allows a single plant cell to regenerate into a new plant. The study, published in the journal Cell, found that flipping two specific genetic switches can revert a differentiated somatic cell back to an embryonic state, a process known as somatic embryogenesis. This ability was previously thought to be exclusive to fertilized eggs. The discovery provides fundamental insights into one of biology's most profound processes and could have significant implications for agriculture and plant science.</p>

The reported email, sent after the period he claimed to have cut ties, undermines his credibility and has prompted calls for further sanctions from the Royal Family. This article examines the potential consequences, including his exclusion from royal events and renewed calls to strip his titles. However, options for King Charles are limited, as Prince Andrew maintains an independent lease on his Royal Lodge residence and is no longer a working royal.</p>

          <p>King Miller, a walk-on running back, delivered a breakout performance to lead the USC Trojans to a significant 31-13 victory over No. 15 Michigan. After USC's top two running backs left the game with injuries, Miller stepped up and rushed for 148 yards and a touchdown, energizing the team. His performance was central to a dominant ground game that outmatched Michigan's defense, while USC's own defense successfully contained the Wolverines. The crucial win puts USC back in the conversation for a College Football Playoff spot and was a major statement for a program that had struggled against ranked opponents.</p>

          <p>The Milwaukee Brewers secured a spot in the National League Championship Series by defeating the Chicago Cubs 3-1 in a decisive Game 5 of their division series. Tiebreaking and insurance home runs from Andrew Vaughn and Brice Turang powered the Brewers to their first postseason series victory since 2018. The win was particularly meaningful as it came against their regional rivals and former manager, Craig Counsell, who now leads the Cubs. Milwaukee will next face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS, with Game 1 scheduled to be held in Milwaukee.</p>

          <p>Beijing has accused Washington of employing "double standards" and has pledged to take countermeasures if the US proceeds with threatened 100% tariffs on Chinese goods. The proposed tariffs come after China announced new export controls on rare earth minerals, which are vital for technology and defense industries. China defended its export limits as necessary for national security amid global instability but stated they would have a limited impact on supply chains. The exchange marks a significant escalation in trade tensions, threatening to reignite a trade war between the world's two largest economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Indiana jury has found Alison Davis not guilty of murdering her husband, Kevin Davis, who died from severe head trauma at the bottom of their staircase in 2023. Prosecutors argued that the injuries were inconsistent with a fall and that Alison had beaten him to death, but they never found a murder weapon. The defense successfully contended that Kevin's death was a tragic accident, with an expert testifying his single impact with a banister post caused the multiple skull fractures. The case, featured on "48 Hours," highlighted the challenges of an investigation where the scene was released and cleaned before it was deemed a potential homicide.</p>

          <p>As the Los Angeles Dodgers prepare to face the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS, this analysis outlines key challenges the Dodgers will encounter. The Brewers, despite a much smaller payroll, have built a formidable team centered on a small-ball offensive strategy, strong fundamental play, and deep, effective pitching. Their staff ranked second in the majors in team ERA, and their offense excelled at getting on base and manufacturing runs. Key players for Milwaukee include ace pitcher Freddy Peralta, breakout starter Quinn Priester, and a versatile lineup that twice swept the Dodgers during the regular season.</p>

          <p>Austin Beutner, the former superintendent of Los Angeles schools, is set to announce his candidacy for mayor in 2026, challenging incumbent Karen Bass. Beutner, a philanthropist and former investment banker, is criticizing the current administration for what he calls a "failure of leadership," specifically citing the city's response to the devastating Palisades fire, crime, and housing costs. His entry into the race makes him the first serious challenger to Bass, potentially reshaping the political landscape and encouraging other high-profile candidates, like developer Rick Caruso, to consider running.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed the Secretary of Defense to ensure that military personnel receive their pay despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. The directive aims to prevent troops from missing their upcoming paycheck, even as hundreds of thousands of other federal employees are either furloughed or working without pay. Trump blamed Democrats for the shutdown, accusing them of holding national security "hostage." The move comes as the administration has also begun laying off thousands of government workers, an unprecedented step during a shutdown, to pressure Democrats into a funding agreement.</p>

          <p>China's state broadcaster, CCTV, is airing a new television drama titled "Silent Honour," which for the first time chronicles the country's clandestine espionage operations in Taiwan following the Chinese Civil War. The series marks a significant shift, as Beijing has historically remained quiet about these covert activities, many of which ended in failure with agents being captured and executed by the Kuomintang. The 39-episode drama, produced under state guidance, premiered on Martyrs' Day, suggesting a move by Beijing to officially commemorate these spies and integrate their stories into the national narrative.</p>
