          <p>President Trump insisted that a man deported to El Salvador had an MS-13 tattoo on his knuckles, despite evidence to the contrary, according to a New York Times article. During an interview, Trump pointed to a social media post where the man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was shown with MS-13 superimposed onto the photo, and the president appeared to believe the typed characters were actual tattoos. The administration faces scrutiny over its handling of Abrego Garcia's case and is accused of waging a public relations war rather than complying with a Supreme Court order. The article highlights the administration's focus on tattoos as evidence of gang membership, despite law enforcement experts questioning their reliability.</p>

          <p>Former Colorado football players are speaking out against the program's decision to retire Travis Hunter's and Shedeur Sanders' jerseys, according to a Fox News article. The decision has sparked controversy because Sanders and Hunter have not yet graduated, unlike previous players honored with jersey retirements. Michael Jones criticized the university for lacking a formal jersey retirement process, while Darian Hagan expressed shock that the decision was at the discretion of the athletic director and head coach. Jones suggested that allowing Sanders and Hunter to skip the line erased the program's football legacy.</p>

          <p>A Senate vote aimed at blocking President Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs fell short, with Republicans largely opposing the measure, according to a CBS News article. The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden and Republican Sen. Rand Paul, sought to terminate the national emergency used to impose the tariffs. The vote reflects ongoing anxieties about the economic impact of the tariffs, despite efforts by the White House to reassure senators. House Speaker Mike Johnson indicated limited openness to congressional intervention, suggesting the executive branch has broad authority on trade.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Times reports on the Netflix adaptation of the Argentine comic 'El Eternauta,' set in a dystopian Buenos Aires.

Director Bruno Stagnaro decided to move the story to the present to connect with the current state of the city. Ricardo Darín and César Troncoso star in this production, which deals with themes of collective heroism and human contradictions in the face of an immense threat.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's cloud computing unit unveiled its Qwen3 family, consisting of eight enhanced AI models, according to the South China Morning Post. Analysts suggest that these models indicate Chinese companies have significantly narrowed the tech gap with US firms, despite US export restrictions on advanced semiconductors. The impact of sanctions on China's AI development has diminished due to the growing availability of alternative AI chips from domestic suppliers. This development suggests that China is making progress in AI technology despite challenges.</p>

          <p>Waiters, dealers, and bartenders in Las Vegas are still waiting for President Trump's campaign promise to eliminate taxes on tips, according to a CBS News article. While inflation has made it harder for hospitality workers, there's no legislation on the issue 100 days into Mr. Trump's second term. Two bills are working their way through committees, one to eliminate federal income tax on tips and another to replace the sub-minimum wage with the federal minimum. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent believes revenue from tariffs could fund the plan, but action is needed for the promise to materialize.</p>

Tenant advocates say the increases will push lower-income New Yorkers closer to the brink, while landlords argue the increases are insufficient to cover rising costs.

          <p>Meta's finance chief Susan Li said Chinese online retailers have cut back their spending on Facebook and Instagram ads in reaction to President Donald Trump's tough trade policy with the country, according to CNBC. The firms are likely preparing for the de minimis trade loophole ending this Friday. While some spending has been redirected, overall spend for those advertisers is below the levels prior to April. The report echoes similar warnings from Google and Snap about headwinds to their advertising businesses from the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy shrank in the first quarter of 2025 as businesses rushed to stockpile goods ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariff policies, according to CBS News. The nation's gross domestic product contracted at a 0.3% annual rate, down from 2.4% growth in the previous quarter. The slowdown comes amid growing concerns that Mr. Trump's tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy, although businesses sought to get ahead of the impact by front-loading purchases early in the year. Economists expect the U.S. economy to slow in 2025, partly due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs.</p>
