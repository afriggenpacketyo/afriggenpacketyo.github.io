          <p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official testified that the agency has not decided where to send Kilmar Abrego Garcia if he is released from pretrial detention. Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March and is now back in the U.S. facing human trafficking charges. A federal judge expressed frustration with the government's lack of a clear plan, emphasizing the need for due process to prevent him from being removed again without a proper hearing. The case highlights significant confusion and a lack of preparedness within the U.S. immigration system regarding complex deportation cases.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has advanced to the Wimbledon finals after defeating world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka. This marks a significant comeback for the 23-year-old, who took a break from the sport in 2023 to address burnout and mental health struggles. During her time away, she focused on personal well-being through activities like painting and music. Her return to top-tier competition and subsequent success is a powerful story of resilience and prioritizing mental health in professional sports.</p>

          <p>Recently highlighted transcripts from 2017 House Intelligence Committee depositions reveal that top Obama-era officials, including James Clapper and Loretta Lynch, stated they had not seen direct empirical evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. This testimony aligns with the findings of the Mueller report, which found no criminal coordination. The article resurfaces these details amid news that former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey are under criminal investigation for their roles in the probe, suggesting a continued political and legal fallout from the 2016 election investigations.</p>

          <p>A San Francisco judge has ruled that former CNN anchor Don Lemon's lawsuit against Elon Musk and his social media platform X can go to trial. Lemon sued after X abruptly canceled a partnership for a new show on the platform, an action taken shortly after Lemon conducted a tense interview with Musk. The judge found that Lemon's claims, including "fraud by false promise," were plausible enough to proceed. This case adds to a series of legal challenges Musk and X have faced since his acquisition of the company.</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old man, Ernesto Sepulveda, has been charged with two counts of attempted murder for allegedly shooting a Los Angeles police officer. The incident occurred when two officers from a gang enforcement detail attempted to question Sepulveda, who then fled and opened fire, striking one officer in the leg. The injured officer's injuries were not life-threatening. The district attorney stated that the weapon used was an untraceable "ghost gun," highlighting the ongoing challenge these firearms pose to law enforcement. Sepulveda has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>

          <p>Following the passage of his "One Big Beautiful Bill," President Donald Trump's administration is shifting its focus away from major new legislation ahead of the midterm elections. Instead, the White House will concentrate on promoting the economic benefits of its tax cuts and deregulation while pursuing high-stakes trade deals and continuing its crackdown on immigration. This strategy bets heavily on achieving a booming economy to bolster Republican chances in the midterms. Democrats, however, plan to counter by arguing that the administration's policies have disproportionately benefited the wealthy at the expense of working families. (not investment advice)</p>
