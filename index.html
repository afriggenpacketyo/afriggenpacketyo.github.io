          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump as much as 14% in its Hong Kong trading debut.

          <p>Despite trade war tensions with the U.S., China attracted a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April. This contrasts with concerns over rising Treasury yields and a Moody's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest investors are moving away from U.S. dollar assets due to the trade war, and China's economic recovery is making it an attractive destination for investment. The weakening U.S. dollar is also contributing to the stability of the Chinese yuan.</p>

The rate cuts came as state-backed commercial lenders reduced deposit rates, paving the way to lower key lending rates.

          <p>Ruth LÃ³pez, a leading human rights activist in El Salvador, has been arrested on charges of embezzlement of state funds, an accusation her organization Cristosal denies as politically motivated. LÃ³pez has been an outspoken critic of President Nayib Bukele and has documented human rights abuses in the country. Her arrest has sparked condemnation from international human rights organizations amid a growing crackdown on dissent and closer ties between the Trump administration and the Bukele government. Cristosal has denounced her arrest as "short-term enforced disappearance."</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson faces significant challenges in passing a tax and budget bill due to deep divisions within the Republican Party. Conservatives are demanding more spending cuts, while moderates oppose reductions to social programs like Medicaid. Disagreements also persist over clean energy tax credits and state and local tax (SALT) deductions, with different factions holding competing priorities. The bill's future is uncertain given these divisions and the narrow Republican majority in the House.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration explored acquiring a luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to serve as Air Force One due to delays in Boeing's existing contract. The plan involved secret coordination between Washington and Doha, with Trump's Middle East envoy playing a key role. While Trump characterized it as a free gift, questions remain about the financial sense of refitting the plane and whether it could be ready before the end of his term. The potential deal has drawn criticism over ethical concerns and the possibility of Qatar currying favor with the administration.</p>
