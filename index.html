          <p>The head of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), Filippo Grandi, has expressed concern over Germany's decision to temporarily withdraw from the organization's refugee resettlement program. The program is designed to help particularly vulnerable refugees who cannot remain in their initial host countries. Germany had previously pledged to accept 13,000 refugees in 2024 and 2025, but this commitment was suspended after a change in government. Grandi emphasized the importance of the program for individuals in perilous situations, such as those facing persecution for their homosexuality, and urged Germany to reconsider its withdrawal.</p>

          <p>In a farewell speech at the Social Democratic Party congress, former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned against misunderstanding Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions, stating that Putin aims to retain and expand his conquests in Ukraine. Scholz emphasized that borders must not be changed by force, a principle Putin has violated, breaking with decades of post-war European understanding. He defended the strengthening of the German military (Bundeswehr) and increased cooperation within NATO as necessary consequences of this new reality.

          <p>Following New York state lawmaker Zohran Mamdani's primary victory in the New York City mayoral race, Republican leaders have begun a coordinated effort to brand the Democratic party as extremist. At events like the Faith and Freedom Coalition summit, prominent Republicans have labeled Mamdani, a self-described Democratic socialist, a "communist" and used his win to argue that the entire Democratic party is out of step with the country. While some progressives have embraced Mamdani, moderate Democrats have been more hesitant, and some have condemned what they call Islamophobic attacks against the candidate. The strategy aims to energize conservative voters by linking all Democrats to Mamdani's progressive platform.</p>

          <p>Canadian national security agencies are on high alert for potential threats from Iranian sleeper cells targeting opponents of the Tehran regime on Canadian soil. The national terrorism threat level is currently at "medium," indicating a violent attack is a realistic possibility. Former Canadian Justice Minister Irwin Cotler, who has been targeted by Iran himself, warns that the regime is intensifying its campaign of "transnational repression" against diaspora groups, activists, and journalists. Cotler is urging the government to establish an independent agency to counter these external threats and to follow the U.S. in prosecuting those who collaborate with Iranian agents.</p>

His comments echo sentiments from global players' union Fifpro and current players who have warned about the physical and mental toll of an increasingly crowded calendar.

The march drew significant international support, with European officials and diplomats in attendance. The massive turnout is seen as a rebuke to Orban's government, which has increasingly restricted civil liberties and targeted the LGBTQ+ community under the guise of protecting children.</p>

          <p>Thousands of protesters gathered in Bangkok, demanding the resignation of Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra over her handling of a border dispute with Cambodia. The demonstrations, organized by a nationalist group, were fueled by a leaked phone call in which the prime minister was accused of being overly deferential to Cambodia's former leader, Hun Sen. The long-standing dispute concerns the historic Preah Vihear temple, which the International Court of Justice has ruled belongs to Cambodia. The protests highlight growing political dissatisfaction and nationalist sentiment surrounding the sensitive territorial issue.</p>

While the museum building itself was undamaged, the surrounding grounds required nearly six months of repair work.

The decision also follows increased federal scrutiny of synthetic dyes, including the recent ban of Red 3 from the food supply.

          <p>South Africa's coalition government is experiencing significant strain after the Democratic Alliance (DA), the second-largest party, withdrew from President Cyril Ramaphosa's "National Dialogue" initiative. The move came after Ramaphosa dismissed a DA deputy minister, Andrew Whitfield. DA leader John Steenhuisen accused Ramaphosa of double standards for not acting against corruption-implicated ministers from his own ANC party. While the DA will remain in the government for now, the public spat threatens the stability of the coalition, which was formed just over a year ago after the ANC lost its long-held parliamentary majority.</p>

However, the win was tempered by an injury to Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams, who left the field with a tight hamstring, raising concerns about squad depth in a key position. Head coach Andy Farrell praised the team's attacking ambition but noted a high penalty count in the first half, which he attributed to over-eagerness.

          <p>A tourist in Grand Teton National Park had a dangerously close encounter with a large male grizzly bear, forcing him to make a dramatic escape. After exiting his car, the man found himself just feet from the bear and, upon trying to re-enter his vehicle, discovered the door was locked. With the bear approaching, he quickly improvised by diving headfirst through the open driver-side window, pulling his feet in just as the animal rounded the car.

Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, who championed the bill, argued it was necessary to reassert Congress's constitutional role in declaring war, especially given the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran.

Vehicles like the Jaguar I-PACE, Maserati Levante, and Nissan Leaf are noted for losing a significant portion of their value within a few years due to factors like rapid EV technology changes, high maintenance costs, and brand perception. The article explains that for these models, dealers offer minimal trade-in amounts to mitigate their own risk. Owners may find better financial outcomes through private sales or other alternatives.

          <p>The U.S. government is set to halt the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), a critical source of atmospheric data, by the end of June 2025. Scientists warn that this abrupt shutdown could severely impact the ability to forecast hurricanes, potentially setting capabilities back by decades just as the hurricane season intensifies. The DMSP satellites provide unique, high-resolution data essential for seeing inside developing storms and tracking polar sea ice. Researchers inside and outside the government expressed shock at the sudden decision, stating there is no adequate replacement and that the move will leave forecasters "a bit blind."</p>
