          <p>A violent mass stabbing in the Hollow Water First Nation community in Manitoba, Canada, has resulted in the death of an 18-year-old woman and seven other injuries. The suspect, a 26-year-old man identified as the victim's brother, also died while fleeing the scene after his stolen vehicle collided with a police car, critically injuring an officer. The incident has deeply shaken the small Anishinaabe community, drawing parallels to a similar tragedy in another First Nation community three years prior.</p>

          <p>Daniel Levy has ended his nearly 25-year tenure as the executive chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, a move reportedly initiated by the club's ownership. During his leadership, Levy oversaw significant infrastructure developments, including a new £1 billion stadium, but faced persistent criticism from fans over a lack of on-field success, with the club securing only two major trophies. His departure marks a significant shift in the club's leadership, with Peter Charrington appointed as the new non-executive chairman.</p>

          <p>During a recent hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced sharp questioning from both Republican and Democratic senators regarding his stance on vaccine policies and turmoil at the CDC. Republican senators, including medical doctors Bill Cassidy and John Barrasso, avoided expressing direct confidence in Kennedy's leadership when questioned. The hearing highlighted significant political division over public health strategies, with debates over childhood vaccination schedules and the secretary's leadership capabilities.</p>

          <p>Lululemon's stock price dropped significantly after the company issued a full-year earnings forecast that fell far short of Wall Street expectations. While second-quarter earnings surpassed estimates, the company cited the impact of tariffs and the removal of certain import tax exemptions as major factors in its reduced guidance. CEO Calvin McDonald also acknowledged that the brand's product offerings, particularly in casual wear, have become "stale," and outlined plans to innovate and refresh its styles to regain momentum.

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's call for a new global order centered on "true multilateralism" is resonating with developing nations, particularly in the Muslim world. As U.S. global influence is perceived to be waning, Beijing's vision appeals to countries frustrated with Western-led institutions like the IMF and World Bank. The piece suggests that many states in the Global South are seeking to diversify their political and economic alliances, viewing China as an alternative partner that promises a more inclusive international framework.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has overturned a lower court's injunction, permitting the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention facility in Florida to continue operating. The initial ruling had ordered the center to be shut down based on a lawsuit from environmental groups arguing it lacked necessary federal environmental reviews. The 2-1 appellate decision allows the state of Florida and the Department of Homeland Security to proceed with the facility while the legal challenges continue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The start of the new school year is causing heightened anxiety for mixed-status families across the U.S. due to fears of immigration enforcement actions near schools. Parents without legal documentation, even those with U.S. citizen children, report being afraid to leave their homes or take their children to school, which has impacted student attendance in some districts. While ICE policy generally avoids enforcement at sensitive locations like schools, reports of parents being detained nearby have intensified the community's fear and uncertainty.</p>

          <h2>Florida Announces Plan to Phase Out All Childhood Vaccine Mandates for Schools</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has become the first state to announce a plan to eliminate all vaccine mandates for children attending school, a move that public health experts warn could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases. The state's plan would roll back long-standing requirements for immunizations against illnesses like measles and polio. This decision comes amid a national trend of rising non-medical vaccine exemptions and declining vaccination rates, raising concerns about the potential loss of herd immunity in communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The fourth installment of "The Conjuring" series, subtitled "Last Rites," is being reviewed as a tired and formulaic conclusion to the story of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. While Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are praised for their anchoring performances, the film's plot, involving a haunted antique mirror, is described as sluggish and routine. The review suggests that while the broader cinematic universe may continue, this final chapter for the Warrens demonstrates that the core storyline has been exhausted.</p>

The leisure and hospitality sector was a notable exception with strong gains, but weakness was observed in areas like trade, transportation, and utilities, contributing to the overall slowdown.

Based on the 4% withdrawal rule, it suggests that for every $1,000 of desired monthly income, a person needs to have saved between $240,000 and $300,000.
