          <p>Germany and Israel are marking six decades of diplomatic ties, an event overshadowed by the ongoing war in Gaza and rising antisemitism. Israeli President Isaac Herzog's visit to Berlin includes a visit to the "Platform 17" Holocaust memorial and a meeting with German and Israeli youth. Chancellor Friedrich Merz reiterated Germany's commitment to Israel's security, while also emphasizing the need for Israel to adhere to international law and humanitarian obligations. The complex relationship is further strained by the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which Germany would be obligated to enforce should Netanyahu visit the country.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable energy projects, with solar and wind power constituting 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, approximately US$66 billion was invested in Africa's energy sector, with one-fifth of China's overall energy sector investment taking place there. This shift aligns with China's commitment to halt funding new coal-fired power plants overseas, as well as Africa's growing energy demands, with Chinese solar and wind technology exports surging 153% from 2020 to 2024. Africa has become a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology.</p>

          <p>President Trump is commencing his first foreign trip of his second term with a focus on the Middle East, aiming to secure investment, trade, and technology agreements from Gulf allies. His tour includes stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, where discussions will cover oil, regional conflicts like the Israel-Gaza situation, and the Iran nuclear program. Trump's administration has indicated that Saudi Arabia's civilian nuclear infrastructure deal is no longer tied to normalizing relations with Israel.

          <p>As weight-loss medications like Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Wegovy become increasingly popular, many individuals are choosing to keep their use of these drugs a secret, even from close family and friends. This phenomenon is driven by a fear of judgment and the pervasive idea that weight loss should involve hard work and willpower. Some individuals also feel ashamed about being overweight in the first place, leading them to hide their medication use to avoid criticism. The article explores the reasons behind this secrecy, highlighting the societal pressures and stigmas surrounding weight loss and medication use.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China are meeting in Geneva for high-stakes negotiations aimed at easing tensions stemming from President Trumpâ€™s trade war. The talks have significant implications for the global economy, which has been disrupted by tariffs imposed by both countries. While Trump has suggested a willingness to lower tariffs, the White House insists that China must make concessions for any reduction to occur. Economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a quick deal, even if tariffs are reduced to 80 percent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a guest essay for the New York Times, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that mothers should stop striving for perfection, as being flawed is an essential part of parenting. She contends that a child's caregivers are the template for their future relationships, and relationships are not one-way. Dr. Ross also notes that psychiatrists have historically blamed mothers for their children's problems, which can deter parents from seeking mental health treatment for their teenagers. She encourages mothers to embrace their imperfections and recognize that they are good enough.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry's recent public plea for reconciliation with his father, King Charles III, has resurfaced deep-seated ruptures within the British royal family. This comes at a time when the monarchy is attempting to project an image of unity, especially during King Charles' ongoing battle with cancer. Harry's comments, made after a legal defeat regarding his security arrangements in Britain, have drawn attention back to the rift that began in 2020 when he and his wife, Meghan, stepped down from royal duties. Some royal watchers warn that this unresolved conflict could negatively impact the King's reign and undermine his messages of tolerance and inclusiveness.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf ahead of a Middle East trip has drawn condemnation from Iranians across the political spectrum. The name "Persian Gulf" has been used for centuries, and Iranians view it as a core part of their national and cultural identity. Trump's idea has seemingly united Iranians, who have expressed their displeasure through statements and social media posts. Experts believe the move could negatively impact ongoing nuclear talks between Iran and the United States.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pushing the European Union to accept more American farm products, including hormone-raised beef and acid-washed chicken, as part of trade negotiations. However, European officials are steadfast in their refusal to lower their food safety standards, calling them a "red line." The dispute highlights the differences in agricultural practices and consumer preferences between the United States and Europe. While the U.S. emphasizes large-scale agricultural businesses, Europe prioritizes smaller family farms and strict health and safety regulations, leading to trade tensions.</p>
