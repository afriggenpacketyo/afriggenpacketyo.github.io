          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night, resulting in the death of two crew members and injuries to at least 22 others. The ship, carrying 277 people, reportedly lost power and drifted into the bridge while departing from Pier 17 in Manhattan for Iceland. The incident caused damage to the ship's masts and a temporary closure of the bridge, prompting investigations by the National Transportation Safety Board and local authorities. The Mexican Navy has pledged full transparency in the investigation, while the uninjured cadets will continue their training. </p>

The White House is addressing potential changes with a 'manager's amendment' before the Rules Committee, aiming to finalize the bill's text and ensure it does not increase the deficit over a 10-year period.

          <p>Director Ari Aster discusses his new film 'Eddington,' a paranoid thriller set in a New Mexican town grappling with pandemic anxieties, and its polarizing reception at the Cannes Film Festival. Aster explains that the film, which stars Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal, explores the sociopolitical landscape of 2020, focusing on the breakdown of agreed-upon realities and the resulting anxiety. He describes 'Eddington' as a horror film reflecting the horror of free-floating political anxiety and the feeling of powerlessness in a world where nobody agrees about what is happening. Aster emphasizes that he aims to make films about the environment rather than personal statements, seeking to understand how we can re-engage with each other in a divided world.</p>

According to Phillies president Dave Dombrowski, the positive test was attributed to a weight loss drug taken by Alvarado during the offseason, with the player accepting the suspension without appeal. The suspension renders Alvarado ineligible for the postseason and will cost him $4.5 million of his $9 million salary, prompting the Phillies to explore alternative closing options like Jordan Romano and Orion Kerkering.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have released Chris Taylor, their longest-tenured position player, to make room for Tommy Edman's return from the injured list. This move signifies the end of Taylor's 10-year career with the team, as his declining performance and the emergence of rookie Hyeseong Kim made him expendable. The Dodgers also added pitcher Lou Trivino to the roster, marking the second time in a week they have parted ways with a familiar player.</p>

          <p>Despite a measles outbreak, anti-vaccine activists in Texas are gaining influence with support from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is a prominent vaccine skeptic. The Texas House has passed several bills making it easier to opt out of school vaccine requirements, restricting vaccine advertising, and preventing doctors from denying organ transplants to the unvaccinated. Public health experts are concerned about declining vaccination rates and the potential for more outbreaks, as these activists aim to normalize vaccine hesitancy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump Justice Department is considering a move that could limit the Public Integrity Sectionâ€™s power to oversee indictments of members of Congress, raising concerns about politically motivated prosecutions. If implemented, U.S. attorneys could indict members of Congress without the sign-off from attorneys in the Public Integrity Section, reducing its ethical oversight role. Critics argue that this change would weaken protections against corruption and signal the Trump administration's intention to avoid accountability, potentially leading to partisan investigations.</p>

          <p>Ukraine reports that Russia launched its largest drone attack since the start of the full-scale invasion, targeting Kyiv and other regions. The attack, involving 273 drones, comes just before a scheduled call between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, where the US President has been urging a ceasefire. Ukrainian officials said they intercepted 88 drones, while others went astray, and the strikes killed one person and injured several others. This marks an escalation in the conflict as Germany's Chancellor Merz plans a virtual meeting with Trump prior to his conversation with Putin.</p>

          <p>President Trump's Middle East diplomacy appears to be sidelining Israel, as evidenced by his engagement with Syria and the pursuit of deals in Iran and Yemen without significant involvement from Prime Minister Netanyahu. This shift signals a change from previous administrations, where Israel held a central role in American foreign policy in the region. While the U.S. maintains its historic ties and support for Israel, Trump's focus on the Gulf States and a potential deal with Iran indicates a re-evaluation of priorities and a potential reduction in Israel's influence.</p>
