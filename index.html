          <p>US fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following accusations of cultural appropriation from authorities in Oaxaca, Mexico. The controversy surrounds a new Adidas sandal design that critics say reinterprets the region's traditional huarache sandals without community partnership. Mexico's government is seeking compensation from Adidas, highlighting a broader issue of fashion brands using Indigenous designs. The German corporation has expressed regret and requested a meeting with local officials to discuss repairing the damage.</p>

          <p>Apple experienced its most successful week in over five years, with its stock climbing 13% and adding more than $400 billion to its market capitalization. This significant gain followed CEO Tim Cook's meeting with President Donald Trump, where he announced plans to invest $100 billion in American companies. The President's assurance that Apple would be exempt from future chip tariffs assuaged investor fears, contributing to the stock's strong performance.

          <p>A shooting in New York City's Times Square left three people injured early Saturday morning, with a 17-year-old suspect now in police custody. The incident reportedly began with a fight inside a restaurant that spilled onto the street, where the gunman opened fire. A 19-year-old man was the intended target, while an 18-year-old woman and a 65-year-old man were wounded as innocent bystanders.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly dismissed the upcoming summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, stating that any peace deal made without Kyiv's involvement would be a "dead solution." Responding to suggestions that an agreement could involve territorial swaps, Zelenskyy asserted that Ukraine would not give up its land and that its sovereignty is non-negotiable. European leaders echoed this sentiment, emphasizing that Ukraine's future cannot be decided without its participation. Meanwhile, a US official noted that planning is fluid and Zelenskyy could potentially become involved in the talks.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke's political action committee, Powered by People, from funding Democratic state lawmakers who left Texas. The lawmakers fled the state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan by denying a legislative quorum. The order, a victory for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, prohibits the PAC from paying for travel or lodging for the absent legislators. O'Rourke has responded with a countersuit, accusing Paxton of attempting to suppress dissent and voter registration efforts.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman has revealed she dissented from the central bank's recent decision to hold interest rates steady, advocating instead for three rate cuts this year. Bowman cited signs of fragility in the labor market and slowing economic growth as reasons to proactively move policy toward a more neutral stance. She argued that with inflation moving closer to the Fed's target, beginning to lower rates would hedge against risks of further economic weakening.

          <p>The UK's Justice Secretary has announced new plans that would make foreign criminals eligible for immediate deportation upon receiving a custodial sentence. Under the proposal, offenders with fixed-term sentences would be removed from the UK and barred from re-entry, with their home country deciding whether they serve any remaining prison time. The government argues this will save taxpayer money and protect the public, as foreign offenders constitute about 12% of the prison population.

          <p>A 71-year-old man from Glenwood, Iowa, has died from extensive burn injuries he sustained after shooting and killing two of his neighbors and then setting his own house on fire. Authorities said Dennis Burnell shot 38-year-old Brandon Oman and 35-year-old Stevie Oman following a dispute outside his home. When officers arrived, they found the couple deceased and Burnell's house engulfed in flames. Law enforcement had been called to Burnell's residence for disputes in the past, and he had a prior conviction for harassing another neighbor.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Bollywood's Portrayal of Kashmir Has Shifted from Paradise to Political Battleground</h2>

          <p>The depiction of Kashmir in India's Bollywood film industry has evolved dramatically over the decades, mirroring the region's changing political landscape. Once portrayed as a romantic, idyllic paradise in post-independence cinema, Kashmir's image shifted in the 1990s to a land of conflict and militancy. Contemporary films increasingly reflect a "statist" perspective, aligning with government narratives, especially since the 2019 abrogation of Article 370. This article explores how movies like "Haider" and "The Kashmir Files" capture the complex and often painful realities of the contested Himalayan territory.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has detected North Korea dismantling some of its propaganda loudspeakers along the inter-Korean border. This action follows South Korea's own removal of its speakers earlier in the week, a move initiated by the new liberal government to ease tensions. For months, the two nations had engaged in tit-for-tat psychological warfare, with the South broadcasting K-pop and anti-Pyongyang messages and the North responding with irritating sounds. The removal of the speakers marks a tangible, albeit small, step toward de-escalation on the heavily fortified peninsula.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon denies the existence of a conspiracy to destroy her predecessor and mentor, Alex Salmond. She accuses Salmond of being willing to destroy the Scottish National Party and traumatize the women who made complaints against him rather than accept his political life was over. Sturgeon details the moment their political partnership broke down over his alleged behavior and her refusal to intervene in the investigation. Salmond was cleared of 13 sexual offence charges in 2020 but passed away last year.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a press conference for Monday, claiming it will "essentially, stop violent crime in Washington, D.C." This follows his threats to federalize the city's police force after a government staffer was assaulted. The White House has already initiated a seven-day surge of federal law enforcement in the city. Despite Trump's claims of a crime wave, data from the Department of Justice and D.C. police show that violent crime rates have significantly decreased over the past year.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Friedrich Merz's decision to halt German arms exports to Israel for use in Gaza has sparked division within his own conservative CDU/CSU coalition. Some party members criticized the move as a departure from Germany's long-standing foreign policy and special responsibility toward Israel. However, the decision has also received support from other conservatives and from the junior coalition partner, the Social Democrats, who called it a correct and inevitable reaction to the Israeli government's recent actions. The issue highlights the growing international pressure on Israel over its conduct in the Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been dated to 4.56 billion years ago, making it about 20 million years older than Earth itself. A planetary geologist from the University of Georgia examined fragments of the space rock, which was part of a fireball seen across the region in June. Scientists believe it originated from the breakup of a larger asteroid in the belt between Mars and Jupiter around 470 million years ago. This is the 27th meteorite to be recovered in Georgia's history.</p>
