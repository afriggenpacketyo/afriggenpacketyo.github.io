          <p>Democrats are increasing scrutiny of President Trump's cryptocurrency ventures, focusing on potential conflicts of interest arising from his family's involvement with crypto projects like the $TRUMP meme coin. Representative Maxine Waters and Senator Richard Blumenthal are leading efforts to investigate Trump-connected coins and their backers, seeking financial records and communications with the White House. Blumenthal specifically labeled a dinner contest for top $TRUMP holders as a 'pay-for-play scheme,' highlighting concerns that the Trump Organization controls a significant portion of the $TRUMP token supply. The Democrats are pushing for documentation on ownership, revenue flows, and all communications with the White House, citing unprecedented conflicts of interest and national security risks.</p>

          <p>An interim report indicates that the cause of a fire that led to a shutdown of Heathrow Airport, disrupting hundreds of thousands of journeys, remains unknown. The fire occurred at a nearby electrical substation, causing a power outage at the airport on March 21. The National Energy System Operator (Neso) stated that a transformer disconnected and caught fire at the substation, but the Metropolitan Police found no evidence of suspicious activity. Heathrow Airport has welcomed the interim findings, hoping the final report will clarify the cause of the fire and prevent future incidents, as the airport's management has faced criticism for its decision to close the airport during the power outage.</p>

          <p>For the first time, footage has captured a Powelliphanta augusta snail, a threatened species endemic to New Zealand, laying an egg from its neck. The video was taken at a facility where conservation rangers have been caring for the snails in chilled containers for nearly two decades, mimicking their natural alpine habitat. These snails are hermaphrodites and can reproduce when encased in a hard shell, simultaneously exchanging sperm with another snail, which is stored until each creates an egg. Each snail takes eight years to reach sexual maturity and lays about five eggs a year, with each egg taking over a year to hatch, highlighting the species' slow survival and reproductive habits.</p>

          <p>Pakistani authorities have accused India of launching a drone attack in the disputed Kashmir region, resulting in casualties and escalating tensions between the two nations. According to Pakistani officials, Indian forces deployed multiple drones, most of which were allegedly shot down, but one managed to strike a military target near Lahore, killing a civilian and wounding soldiers. This incident follows a recent missile attack by India on locations within Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which India claimed targeted over 100 terrorists. The situation has fueled fears of war, with both countries possessing nuclear weapons and a history of conflict over the Kashmir region.</p>

          <p>Maersk, a major shipping company, has revised its global container market volume growth forecast for 2025 due to increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, particularly related to U.S.-China trade tariffs. The company reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profit, but cited concerns that current tariff policies could restrict global trade volumes. The Trump administration's policy includes significant import duties on products from China, prompting retaliatory tariffs from Beijing on U.S. goods. Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc noted that the first quarter reflected strong demand, but the company remains cautious due to the complex tariff landscape.</p>

          <p>In a New York Times opinion piece, Senator Chris Murphy discusses the Democratic Party's struggles and potential strategies in the face of a second Trump administration. He argues that Democrats were unprepared for Trump's actions and need a more urgent and effective response, including producing more content and engaging in risk-tolerant tactics. Murphy suggests that Democrats must focus on unrigging the economy and addressing the spiritual crisis in America by reconnecting people with institutions and regulating technology. He emphasizes the importance of a confrontational populism and a broader tent that includes those who may not agree on social issues but support economic fairness.</p>

          <p>A US judge in Boston has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to deport migrants to Libya, citing a violation of their right to due process. The order restricts the administration's ability to quickly deport migrants and requires officials to provide written notice in their language and a meaningful opportunity to file a claim to prevent removal. The US state department advises Americans not to travel there due to factors like crime, terrorism and civil unrest. The deportations were halted after immigration lawyers argued the move would defy a prior injunction protecting migrants' rights.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, signaling a potential win for both countries seeking closer economic cooperation. The agreement would be the first since Trump imposed tariffs on trading partners, later paused to allow for negotiations. The agreement could lower British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, as well as remove British taxes on U.S. technology companies, with British officials eyeing the deal as a way to offset weaker relations with Europe. The agreement would offer vindication for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's cultivation of Trump, but the details remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Political scientists argue that the U.S. has crossed the line into competitive authoritarianism, where opposition comes with a price. The Trump administration's actions, such as deploying law enforcement against critics, targeting law firms, and threatening donors to the Democratic Party, raise the cost of opposition for a wide range of Americans. The authors contend that the cost of opposition has risen markedly, forcing them to think twice about engaging in what should be constitutionally protected opposition. The experts also mention that this has led to self-censorship and retreat from civil society leaders, and that the slide into authoritarianism is reversible, but requires a collective defense of democracy.</p>

As the United States remains Toyota's largest market, the tariffs are projected to reduce operating profit by 180 billion yen. Toyota President Koji Sato noted the difficulty in forecasting the outlook due to the fluid nature of the tariffs, but CFO Yoichi Miyazaki said there are no immediate plans to pass the levies onto customers.</p>

The proposed budget slashes funding for the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and other agencies, which economists say underpin America's economic growth. They argue that government-funded basic research drives private-sector productivity and that industry cannot replace the government's role in funding such research.

          <p>Republican-led states are enacting new restrictions on citizen-initiated ballot measures, citing concerns about fraud. States like Arkansas and Florida are implementing requirements such as reading ballot titles aloud, showing photo IDs, and limiting the number of signatures collected. Opponents argue that these laws make it more difficult for voters to address issues that lawmakers ignore, particularly regarding abortion rights. The Fairness Project notes an increase in such restrictive bills, which they view as a broader failing of the relationship between representatives and their voters.</p>

          <p>California beaches have been visited by hundreds of thousands of glittering Velella velella, also known as by-the-wind sailors, due to a shift in wind patterns. These small, blue, gelatinous creatures are typically found on the open sea, but strong winds have blown them onto the shore. The phenomenon is part of the spring transition when wind direction changes, stranding the Velella along the coastline. Though related to jellyfish, their stinging cells are harmless to humans, and the creatures begin to decompose quickly once out of the water.</p>

The letters, along with comment cards the mother had written about each soldier, revealed a series of sweet and surprising interactions. The find provides a glimpse into a mom and grandma we'd never known, viewed through her interactions with guys she'd never so much as mentioned. The letters revealed her interest in dancing and ping pong skills, and a more serious letter from a commander that expressed his unrequited love for her.</p>

          <p>A new wave of hardline anti-abortion activists, calling themselves 'abortion abolitionists,' are gaining influence within the anti-abortion movement. They are lobbying for legislation that would classify abortion as homicide and establish fertilized eggs as full legal persons. These activists, some of whom are associated with the group Operation Save America, are also leveraging discussions about manhood to broaden their appeal. While these measures face political challenges, some legal experts caution that norms could shift, potentially leading to the criminalization of women who get abortions.</p>

Sources say Fetterman repeated himself, shouted, questioned why everyone hated him, and slammed his hands on a desk, causing distress among the attendees. This incident occurred before a New York Magazine story detailing concerns about Fetterman's mental state and behavior was published. Fetterman's office stated that the meeting was a 'spirited conversation' about education cuts, but the incident adds to scrutiny following his stroke and depression treatment.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to announce a trade deal with the United Kingdom on Thursday, which could calm investors spooked by Trump's global tariffs. The post-Brexit UK is hoping to secure a deal independent of its European partners, and is considering lowering its own tariffs on US cars and cutting digital sales tax affecting US tech companies. Since taking office early this year, the Trump administration has been actively expanding the US tariff policies, and investors will be watching to see if Trump can de-escalate the trade war that he triggered which in turn sparked chaos in US stock markets.</p>

          <p>For Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, the news of an imminent trade agreement with the United States is a much-needed political victory, as well as vindication of his strategy of assiduously cultivating President Trump. While the details of the agreement were not yet clear and could prove contentious with farmers and other interest groups in Britain, the fact that Britain is the first country in the world to conclude a deal with the United States after Mr. Trump imposed an across-the-board tariff of 10 percent on dozens of American trading partners seemed to affirm the “special relationship” often invoked by British and American diplomats.</p>

          <p>A study by leading climate scientists attributes the deadly storms in the central Mississippi valley in early April to the burning of fossil fuels, increasing both the likelihood and severity of the events. The record quantities of rain that caused widespread flooding were made about 9% more intense and 40% more likely by human-caused climate change, which also warmed ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico. The study also highlights the importance of well-resourced forecasting, as the National Weather Service's warnings likely reduced the scope of the damage, while also facing major cuts and staff layoffs.</p>
