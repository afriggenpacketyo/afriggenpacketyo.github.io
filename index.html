          <p>U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem recently visited the Chicago area as federal immigration enforcement operations, dubbed "Operation Midway Blitz," intensified. The operation targets undocumented immigrants accused of crimes, with DHS blaming the city's sanctuary laws for the situation. Noem posted videos of arrests, referencing a fatal incident where an ICE agent was dragged and an undocumented driver was killed. This visit underscores the Trump administration's expanded efforts to deport undocumented individuals nationwide.</p>

          <p>As of September 15, 2025, the price of gold stands at $3,652.25 per ounce, a figure subject to constant market fluctuations. This article details several key factors influencing gold prices, including supply and demand dynamics, global economic conditions, and inflation. Gold is often considered a safe-haven asset during uncertainty and an inflation hedge. Additionally, interest rates, geopolitical instability, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies significantly impact its value. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have recently dropped, with the average 30-year refinance rate at 6.72%, prompting increased homeowner interest in refinancing. Experts suggest considering refinancing if your current rate exceeds 7% or if you seek to improve cash flow or consolidate high-interest debt like credit cards. While rates might decline further, waiting carries risks of market shifts and opportunity costs. The optimal time to refinance aligns with personal financial goals, making consultation with a loan officer advisable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A public inquiry into the Southport dance studio murders heard that a teacher's concerns about teenage killer Axel Rudakubana were hindered by "frightening red tape." Despite a history of violence, knife possession, and disturbing internet searches, various agencies, including social services and counter-extremism programs, failed to intervene effectively. The inquiry will investigate whether agencies took responsibility, if an overall risk picture was assessed, and what systemic changes are necessary to prevent similar tragedies. The killer deliberately targeted women and girls, resulting in three deaths and multiple injuries.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that President Trump's willingness to allow TikTok to be shut down in the U.S. was the decisive factor in China agreeing to a deal framework. Trump prioritized national security over commercial interests, leveraging the looming September 17 divestment deadline for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance. While commercial terms were largely set months ago, China paused negotiations after Trump's tariff announcement. This development suggests a potential turning point in US-China relations, with both presidents expected to finalize the deal soon.</p>

          <p>India and the European Union are nearing a free trade agreement, aiming to finalize negotiations by year-end, driven by US tariffs and the need for stable trade partnerships. This deal offers India tariff-free access for key exports and reduces reliance on volatile US markets, while the EU diversifies supply chains and strengthens geopolitical leverage. US protectionism, including 50% tariffs on Indian goods, has created urgency for both sides. Despite challenges like the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, strategic convergence is pushing for a timely agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bangladesh's Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS), the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, secured significant victories in recent student council elections at major public universities. These polls are the first since the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose government had banned the Islamist party. The interim administration revoked the ban, allowing the party to reorganize. Analysts suggest these results indicate a growing sentiment towards Islamists, especially among young voters, who are expected to play a decisive role in the upcoming February 2026 national elections.</p>

          <p>A New York state judge has dismissed two terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, citing insufficient evidence to meet the state's terrorism definition. While the first-degree murder charge was dropped, a second-degree murder charge against Mangione will stand, carrying a minimum sentence of 15 to 25 years. Prosecutors failed to prove Mangione intended to coerce government policy through intimidation. Mangione also faces federal murder charges, which could potentially lead to the death penalty, with state trial hearings set to begin in December.</p>

          <p>An independent panel of UN-commissioned experts has concluded, on reasonable grounds, that Israel is committing acts of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The report details findings based on the 1948 Genocide Convention, citing acts like killing, causing serious harm, deliberately inflicting destructive conditions, and preventing births. While Israel vehemently rejects the report as "distorted and false," the commission urges international states to prevent further crimes and ensure accountability, including halting arms transfers to Israel. The findings could be used by international courts, intensifying global pressure.</p>

The American Federation of Teachers, seeking class action status, highlights that a 2021 law shielding forgiveness from federal taxation expires this year. With over 1.3 million borrowers stuck in income-driven repayment application backlogs, and nearly 73,000 awaiting Public Service Loan Forgiveness determinations, many could face substantial tax bills.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Accelerating inflation, partly fueled by President Trump's import tariffs, is expected to widen the economic divide between high- and low-income Americans. Government data indicates businesses are passing tariff costs to consumers, particularly affecting prices for clothing and groceries. Lower-income households are disproportionately impacted as they spend a larger portion of their budget on tariff-exposed, typically lower-priced imported goods. This trend creates a "two-tier economy," where higher-income individuals maintain spending power while others struggle with rising everyday costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis will remain disqualified from prosecuting Donald Trump's Georgia election interference case, as the Georgia Supreme Court declined to hear her appeal. This ruling effectively ends Willis's involvement, citing an "appearance of impropriety" from her relationship with a former special prosecutor. An independent body will now appoint a new prosecutor, who will determine the case's future against Trump and the remaining 14 defendants. Trump's legal team celebrated the decision, while Willis expressed disagreement but pledged cooperation.</p>
