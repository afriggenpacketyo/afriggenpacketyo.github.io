          <p>Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell defended the LAPD's response to recent protests against President Trump's immigration policies, citing violent conditions and attacks on officers. He stated that officers acted appropriately, using swift and measured action to quell unrest after demonstrators threw objects and refused to disperse. McDonnell said the department would evaluate each use-of-force incident and address any misconduct, disputing claims of indiscriminate force and failure to issue dispersal orders. Critics allege excessive force against non-threatening individuals, potentially leading to civil litigation and lawsuits from press rights organizations. </p>

          <p>Over 100 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system, which aims to save Â£5 billion annually by 2030 through cuts to disability and sickness-related benefits. The MPs are concerned about the impact on poverty, lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessments. The amendment highlights the need for social security reform but objects to the current bill due to its potential consequences on the job market and people's health. If the amendment is selected and passed, the welfare reform bill will be halted. </p>
