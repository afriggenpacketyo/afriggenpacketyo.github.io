        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial has seen two weeks of testimony from 16 witnesses, with prosecutors aiming to prove Combs used violence and threats to coerce women into sex and protect his music empire. Star witness Cassie Ventura testified for four days, alleging a decade of abuse and coerced participation in drug-fueled sex parties. Other witnesses corroborated Ventura's testimony, including a makeup artist, a male escort, and Ventura's mother, who claimed to have taken out a home equity loan after Combs allegedly blackmailed her daughter. The trial is set to continue with more witnesses, as Combs maintains his innocence, arguing his actions were driven by jealousy and drug addiction.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting is calling on doctors in England to vote against industrial action in an upcoming ballot. He emphasized the risk of strikes disrupting the progress being made in the NHS and urged doctors to collaborate with the government. This appeal follows a 5.4% average pay rise for resident doctors, exceeding the increases for other medical professionals, nurses, and teachers. However, resident doctors argue this is insufficient to compensate for below-inflation pay awards since 2008.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has granted a full pardon to Scott Jenkins, the former sheriff of Culpeper County, Virginia, who was convicted on federal bribery charges. Jenkins was scheduled to begin a 10-year prison sentence, but Trump intervened, calling Jenkins "a wonderful person" and a victim of the "Radical Left." Jenkins was found guilty of accepting over $75,000 in cash payments for appointing businessmen as auxiliary deputy sheriffs, a scheme that violated public trust, according to the Department of Justice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that vitamin D supplements may help slow down biological aging. Researchers at Mass General Brigham and the Medical College of Georgia found that daily vitamin D3 intake could reduce biological wear and tear, equivalent to nearly three years of aging. The study tracked over 1,000 U.S. adults and measured telomere length in white blood cells, with those taking vitamin D3 showing significantly less telomere shortening compared to the placebo group. The research team emphasized that more work is needed to determine how vitamin D impacts aging in different populations and whether these effects endure over longer timeframes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government in England is restructuring apprenticeship funding to focus on individuals under 21, with funding for level 7 apprenticeships (equivalent to a master's degree) limited to this age group. This shift aims to create 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults and those needing retraining. While the government promises more training for under-21s, critics argue that scrapping funding for postgraduate apprenticeships will harm public services, particularly the NHS, and restrict professional entry for those not attending university. Seven new foundation apprenticeships will also be introduced in sectors like health and social care, engineering, and construction.</p>

The visit, marked by traditional ceremonies, is intended to reinforce Canada's independent identity and political traditions.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers have revoked California's authority to set certain mandates on electric vehicles, citing concerns about the state's "superstate system" and "extreme environmental agenda." The move reflects a long-standing resentment of California's outsize influence on national policy, particularly in emissions regulations. While Republicans argue that electric vehicles are impractical for their constituents, Democrats view the action as an attack on California's autonomy and a step backward in the fight against pollution.</p>
