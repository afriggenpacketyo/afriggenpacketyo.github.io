          <p>Gold prices have reached a record high of $3,500 an ounce after President Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve spooked investors and undermined confidence in the U.S. economy. Trump's repeated threats against the Fed's independence and demands for immediate interest rate cuts have led to equity market sell-offs and increased demand for safe-haven assets like gold. Analysts suggest gold is serving as an effective hedge amid ongoing trade uncertainty and central banks are adding to their gold reserves, further supporting the rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>RTX and GE Aerospace anticipate a combined impact exceeding $1 billion due to President Trump's tariffs on imported goods, signaling rising costs for U.S. manufacturers reliant on global supply chains. RTX projects an $850 million hit this year from tariffs, while GE Aerospace aims to save $500 million through cost-cutting and price increases. GE Aerospace CEO Larry Culp discussed the U.S. aerospace sector's trade surplus with Trump, advocating for consideration of the industry's strength under the existing tariff-free regime. Airlines have announced cuts to U.S. domestic capacity plans this year because of softer demand, but executives have emphasized that it is hard to predict the direction of the economy or future trade policies.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office has clarified his position on transgender women following a UK Supreme Court ruling that defines a woman as biologically female under equalities law. Starmer's spokesman stated that the Prime Minister now aligns with the court's judgment, acknowledging that a woman is defined by biological sex. This contrasts with his earlier statement in 2022 when he said that trans women are women. The ruling also clarifies that individuals born male but identifying as women do not have the right to access spaces or services designated for women only, but trans women should be treated with dignity and respect.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Joseph Mallord William Turner, born in 1775, is celebrated as one of the greatest Romantic painters, known for his masterful use of light, color, and atmosphere. Turner found inspiration in nature and his travels, particularly in Venice and the Rhineland, capturing the grandeur of landscapes and the power of machines. His later works became increasingly abstract, influencing Impressionists like Claude Monet and Camille Pissaro. Today, Turner is considered a pioneer of modernism and a forerunner of abstract art.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At least five people have died after gunmen opened fire on a group of domestic tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, specifically in Pahalgam, a popular tourist destination. The attack, described as a "cowardly terror attack on tourists," has prompted a security response, with the army and police deployed to the scene. While no group has claimed responsibility, the incident has raised concerns about the region's security, which has seen a long-running insurgency since 1989, although violence has decreased in recent years. Some reports suggest the gunmen singled out non-Muslims, and multiple wounded tourists have been hospitalized.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has significantly lowered its 2025 U.S. growth forecast to 1.8% from 2.7%, citing the negative impact of President Trump's tariffs on the economy. The IMF also reduced its global growth forecast to 2.8% and increased the odds of a U.S. recession to 40%. The report highlights that tariffs act as a negative supply shock, leading to higher inflation forecasts for advanced economies, including the U.S. The IMF's chief economist noted that the recent trade developments forced a rapid revision of their economic projections.</p>

The parents, who are Muslim, Roman Catholic, and Ukrainian Orthodox, argue that the policy violates their First Amendment right to religious freedom by infringing on their ability to direct their children's religious upbringing. The school board contends that the opt-out policy had become unworkable due to high absence rates and logistical challenges. The Trump administration is backing the parents in the case.</p>

          <p>Several companies, including Abbott Laboratories, Apple, Cra-Z-Art, Johnson & Johnson, Honda Motor, Hyundai Motor Company, Nvidia, and TSMC, have announced plans to expand their manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. This trend comes as President Trump's tariffs take effect, though not all companies explicitly cite tariffs as the primary motivation. Factors such as labor and energy costs, tax rates, political stability, and the regulatory environment also influence these decisions. The White House has touted these moves as supporting job creation on home soil.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has downgraded the U.K.'s 2025 growth forecast to 1.1%, citing the impact of U.S. President Trump's trade tariffs, higher borrowing costs, and increased energy prices. The downgrade reflects a smaller carryover from 2024, the impact of recent tariff announcements, an increase in gilt yields, and weaker private consumption. The IMF also expects the U.K. to grow by 1.4% in 2026, 0.1 percentage points lower than its previous estimate. The downgrade is a blow to the U.K.'s Labour government, which has prioritized economic growth.</p>

          <p>Bath & Body Works is well-positioned to navigate the current tariff environment due to its high percentage of domestic manufacturing, with 80% of its products produced in the United States. This domestic exposure provides a key advantage over competitors who rely on imported goods, allowing Bath & Body Works to avoid import tariffs and maintain prices and profitability. The company's primary U.S. manufacturing facility, Beauty Park, enables quick testing, reaction, and movement to consumer demands, minimizing the need for discounts.
