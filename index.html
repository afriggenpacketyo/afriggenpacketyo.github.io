          <p>Shares of AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave fell 17% after the company reported a wider-than-anticipated quarterly loss. The reported adjusted loss was 27 cents per share, exceeding analysts' expectations of a 21-cent loss. This financial report comes just before the company's post-IPO lockup period expires, which could introduce more volatility as insiders become eligible to sell their shares. Despite the near-term concerns and a slight delay in capital expenditures, CoreWeave raised its full-year revenue guidance, citing that demand for its AI data center services continues to significantly outweigh supply.

Speaking ahead of a U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska, Zelenskyy urged American and European leaders to maintain pressure and sanctions on Moscow. Concurrently, French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed that President Trump indicated he would press Putin for an immediate ceasefire during their meeting.

The incident reportedly involved makeshift weapons and occurred while he was housed in a separation unit.

An analysis by InSight Crime found that the Center for a Secure Free Society's "TdA Activity Monitor" contained multiple false entries about crimes attributed to the gang in the U.S. Humire has publicly promoted the unverified theory that the Venezuelan government directs TdA to destabilize other nations, a claim that U.S. intelligence agencies have reportedly cast doubt on.

          <p>Grocery chain Wegmans has issued a recall for its brand of medium camembert cheese and several products containing it due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the recall, which affects items sold between July 1 and August 12 across multiple northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. The recalled products include the cheese itself, a cheese flight, a grilling camembert kit, and a caramel apple pecan topped brie. While no illnesses have been reported, consumers are advised not to eat the products and can return them for a full refund.</p>

          <p>Visitor numbers to popular pornography websites in the United Kingdom have significantly decreased since the enforcement of new age verification rules under the Online Safety Act. Data from analytics firm Similarweb shows that traffic to major sites like Pornhub and XVideos fell by 47% in late July and early August. The new regulations require sites to implement stricter age checks to prevent access by minors. However, the data also indicates a corresponding increase in traffic to smaller, less-regulated sites, and a surge in downloads of VPN apps, which can be used to bypass the new restrictions.</p>

          <p>Students across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are set to receive their A-level, T-level, and BTec results, with experts predicting a record number of 18-year-olds will secure their first-choice university placement. The head of the university admissions service, Ucas, noted that universities are likely to be more flexible with applicants who narrowly miss their grade offers. This consideration is partly due to this cohort having received lower GCSE grades as part of a national effort to curb grade inflation post-pandemic. The results are expected to be broadly similar to last year, marking a return to pre-pandemic grading standards.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines has warned that it may not have enough cash to continue operations for another year, issuing a "going concern" notice five months after emerging from bankruptcy. The budget airline has been impacted by weak demand for domestic leisure travel and a challenging pricing environment, which have hampered its financial recovery. The company stated it needs to raise additional capital to comply with creditor agreements and avoid potential defaults, and is considering selling assets like aircraft or airport gates. The CEO expressed confidence that ongoing changes will address the risks, but the warning highlights the carrier's precarious financial position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Colorado dentist James Craig has been charged with the first-degree murder of his wife, Angela Craig, who died after being allegedly poisoned. Prosecutors claim Craig researched undetectable poisons online, purchased potassium cyanide and arsenic, and administered them to his wife through her routine protein shakes. An autopsy confirmed Angela died from lethal concentrations of cyanide and had arsenic in her system during earlier hospital visits. The investigation uncovered a potential motive involving an affair with another woman and significant financial problems, including a recent bankruptcy and a $3.4 million life insurance policy on his wife.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services (EWS), the parent company of the Zelle payment network, for allegedly enabling widespread fraud. The lawsuit claims that EWS designed Zelle without crucial safety features, which allowed scammers to steal over $1 billion from users between 2017 and 2023. The AG's office argues that EWS and its partner banks were aware of the platform's susceptibility to fraud for years but failed to implement meaningful safeguards. The suit seeks restitution for victims, damages, and a court order requiring Zelle to enhance its anti-fraud measures.</p>

          <p>With interest rates remaining elevated and potential rate cuts on the horizon, now may be an opportune time for retirees to consider annuities for guaranteed income. This article suggests that the amount to invest depends on personal factors like age, risk tolerance, and existing income sources, rather than a fixed rule. Experts often recommend allocating 20% to 50% of a portfolio to cover essential living expenses not met by Social Security or pensions. Locking in an annuity now could secure higher payout rates for life before the Federal Reserve potentially lowers rates in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents in Fort Collins, Colorado, have reported sightings of cottontail rabbits with unsettling black, horn-like growths on their heads and faces. Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials have identified the cause as shope papillomavirus, a virus specific to rabbits that causes wart-like tumors. The virus, which is not harmful to humans or other animals, is primarily spread by biting insects and typically does not harm the rabbit unless the growths obstruct its vision or mouth. The eerie appearance of the afflicted rabbits has led to them being dubbed "zombie" rabbits and may have inspired the legend of the jackalope.</p>

          <p>Despite sharp criticism from President Donald Trump, a Goldman Sachs economist has stood by the firm's analysis that U.S. consumers will ultimately bear the brunt of recent tariffs. After Trump suggested the bank should get a new economist, David Mericle stated in an interview that the firm's research consistently shows that if current tariffs follow past patterns, consumers would absorb about two-thirds of the cost by the fall. This would push a key inflation gauge higher. The analysis indicates that while exporters and businesses initially absorb the costs, they are eventually passed on to consumers through higher prices.

          <p>The upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will be held at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a major military installation in Anchorage, Alaska. The choice of venue was driven by security requirements and the limited availability of other options during peak tourist season. The meeting, described by the White House as a "listening exercise," aims to address the war in Ukraine, though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is not expected to attend. The location is historically resonant, as the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867, and the base was a key defense site during the Cold War.</p>
