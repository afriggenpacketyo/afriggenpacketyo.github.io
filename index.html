          <h2>Man Exonerated After Serving 38 Years for 1986 Murder Due to New DNA Evidence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 09:34:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Peter Sullivan, now 68, had his 1986 murder conviction overturned by the Court of Appeal after serving 38 years in prison. New DNA evidence surfaced, pointing to an unknown attacker in semen samples preserved from the crime scene where 21-year-old barmaid Diane Sindall was sexually assaulted. Sullivan expressed relief and emphasized the terrible loss of life, while the Crown Prosecution Service agreed that the DNA evidence undermined the conviction and would not seek a retrial. Sullivan's case is believed to be the longest miscarriage of justice involving a living prisoner in British legal history. The court stated that it was impossible to regard the appellant's conviction as safe, and that the injuries to the victim plainly pointed to a sexual aspect of the attack on Miss Sindall.</p>

          <p>The Dallas Mavericks defied odds by winning the NBA draft lottery, securing the No. 1 pick and the opportunity to draft Duke phenom Cooper Flagg, leading to both excitement and conspiracy theories. The improbable win comes after the team's controversial trade of Luka Dončić, which fueled speculation about tanking and a potential move to Las Vegas. Some theories suggest a quid pro quo involving Mavericks GM Nico Harrison, NBA commissioner Adam Silver, and Lakers GM Rob Pelinka, linking Dončić's trade to the Lakers with Harrison being rewarded with the No. 1 pick. Drafting Flagg could provide a fresh start for the franchise and mend the wound left by Dončić's departure, offering fans a homegrown star to rally behind.</p>

          <p>An Argentinian court has issued an international arrest warrant for Aung San Suu Kyi, along with other Myanmar citizens, on charges linked to genocide and crimes against humanity, specifically concerning the Rohingya ethnic minority. The court claims jurisdiction based on the principle that certain serious crimes can be prosecuted regardless of where they were committed. Suu Kyi, who served as Myanmar's top civilian leader before being ousted and imprisoned by the military junta in 2021, is accused of complicity in the discrimination and violence against the Rohingya, despite her denial of genocide. The warrant has not had any practical impact, and Suu Kyi remains imprisoned in Myanmar as the civil war continues.</p>

Shares of UnitedHealth have declined since the death of former CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024, and the company cited increased medical costs for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries as the reason for suspending its outlook.

          <p>Former President Joe Biden underwent evaluation after doctors discovered a "small nodule" on his prostate during a routine physical exam. Further testing is required to determine if the nodule is cancerous or benign. Prostate cancer is common among males, with age being the most significant risk factor. Biden, who is 82, left office in January as the oldest president in history, and the news comes as a new book about his health during his time in the White House is set to be released.</p>

          <p>President Trump's imposition of tariffs on almost every country without Congressional approval is facing legal challenges from businesses and states arguing he has exceeded his power. At least seven lawsuits claim Trump's declaration of a national emergency to enact the tariffs is an overreach of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEPPA). The U.S. Court of International Trade is holding hearings on the challenges, with plaintiffs arguing that trade deficits do not constitute an emergency. The legal battle has united states led by Democratic governors with libertarian groups, potentially leading to a Supreme Court decision.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's military has revised its death toll from recent clashes with India, stating that 51 people were killed by Indian strikes, including 40 civilians and 11 armed forces members. The revised figures follow a series of strikes and counter-strikes between the two nations in response to an attack on Hindu tourists in India-administered Kashmir. Despite claims of early violations, a US-brokered ceasefire appears to be holding, with senior military officials from both countries discussing implementation. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has warned of retaliation if there are further terror attacks on India, while Pakistan has affirmed its commitment to the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Economists and policymakers are anticipating a potential re-acceleration of inflation as companies adapt to President Trump’s trade war, despite a slight cooling of U.S. inflation in April. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.3 percent from a year earlier, but economists predict prices will begin accelerating in the coming months as import taxes take effect. While a temporary reduction in tariffs with China has eased concerns, the scope of the tariffs still in place is expected to stoke inflation while simultaneously impacting growth. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the situation and has put interest rate cuts on hold until the economic impact of Trump’s policies becomes clearer.</p>

          <p>A federal court is hearing arguments in a case challenging President Trump's tariffs, questioning whether he exceeded his power by enacting steep tariffs on over 180 countries. Five domestic businesses filed the lawsuit, arguing that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize the president to impose sweeping duties. The plaintiffs claim the "national emergency" declared by Trump to justify the tariffs is a figment of his imagination. The Department of Justice argues that IEEPA clearly authorizes the president to impose tariffs under specified circumstances.</p>

The author argues that banning the AfD would undermine the democratic process, as it would prevent voters from expressing their views on the party.
