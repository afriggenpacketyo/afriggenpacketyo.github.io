          <h2>Federal Judge Deems Trump's Executive Order Targeting Law Firm Unconstitutional</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 19:52:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional, permanently blocking its enforcement. Judge Beryl Howell stated that the order, which sought to punish the firm for representing clients disliked by the president, violated the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The judge emphasized that using government power to target lawyers for their representation of clients is contrary to the Constitution, referencing the firm's work with Hillary Clinton and its ties to the Steele Dossier, while noting the coercive power of such targeting by the Trump administration. Howell's ruling is a significant victory for Perkins Coie and a rebuke of the president's actions.</p>

          <p>A military parade honoring the US Army's 250th anniversary will be held on June 14, coinciding with President Trump's birthday. The event will feature 6,600 soldiers, 150 vehicles, and 50 aircraft on the National Mall in Washington DC. Trump had previously proposed a military parade, but the idea was scrapped due to high costs. In addition to the parade, Trump announced plans to rename Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I" and VE Day as "Victory Day for World War II", though it is unclear whether he intends for 8 May to become a federal holiday, which would require Congressional approval.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a national election, with President Trump's influence playing a significant role. The center-right Liberal-National Coalition's support has declined since Trump took office, trailing the Labor Party. Opposition leader Peter Dutton's campaign echoes Trump's messaging, focusing on the economy. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has embraced a moderate approach to Trump, avoiding direct criticism, while Australia is a key partner in the AUKUS security partnership, requiring it to show the Trump administration it is a responsible ally in countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>A new report estimates that President Trump's crypto holdings have increased his family's wealth by $2.9 billion in the last six months. This increase is attributed to the release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins and a large stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto exchange affiliated with the Trump family. The SEC has paused investigations into a dozen crypto companies since Trump's inauguration. The president hopes to make the United States the "crypto capital of the world" and has taken steps to unwind regulations on the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Illinois landlord, Joseph Czuba, was sentenced to 53 years in prison for killing a 6-year-old Muslim boy, Wadee Alfayoumi, and severely injuring the boy's mother, Hanan Shaheen, in a hate-crime attack. The attack was motivated by their Islamic faith and the war between Israel and Hamas. Czuba was found guilty of murder, attempted murder, and hate-crime charges, with the judge sentencing him to 30 years for the boy's death and 20 years for the attack on the mother.</p>

          <p>Weekly measles cases have reached a new record, surpassing the peak of the 2019 outbreak, which was the worst since the 1990s. The majority of cases are from an ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states. Officials caution it is too soon to say whether the outbreak is truly ending, and the unusually high severity of this year's wave also suggests many mild cases of spread are going undiagnosed.</p>

          <p>Wall Street stocks have rebounded from losses incurred after President Trump imposed global tariffs. Major US indexes saw gains, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both rising 1.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increasing 1.4%. Shares saw gains for the ninth day in a row for the first time since 2004 after a better-than-expected jobs report and rising hope of US-China trade talks. The Department of Labor said that US employers had added 177,000 new jobs in April.</p>

          <p>President Trump is struggling to effectively defend his tariff policies as Americans begin to feel the impact of rising prices. While acknowledging that tariffs will exact a cost, Trump claims Americans won’t have to go out of their way, a message that contrasts with promises to end inflation and slash taxes. Critics point out that Trump's policies contradict his campaign promises and are inducing an economic slowdown that voters are beginning to question.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will require new vaccines to undergo placebo testing, a policy described as "radical" by a department spokesperson.

It remains unclear what HHS considers a "new" vaccine and whether that includes the flu and COVID vaccines, which are updated annually.
