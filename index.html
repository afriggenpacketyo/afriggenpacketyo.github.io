This federal indictment for violence against a railroad carrier resulting in death could lead to the death penalty.

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing to deploy Border Patrol agents to the San Francisco area, expanding its nationwide immigration enforcement efforts. Sources indicate operations could begin soon, with agents staging at a U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda. California Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie have condemned the plans, calling them divisive and a source of anxiety. This move is part of an aggressive expansion of deportation efforts in Democratic-led cities far from the border.</p>

          <p>Food insecurity is a growing concern in the U.S., particularly in rural areas like Clinton, Missouri, where mobile food banks report a doubling in demand. Rising inflation and over $1 billion in federal food aid cuts have led to fewer donations, despite increasing need. The continued government shutdown and withheld SNAP payments are expected to worsen the situation. The Trump administration's cancellation of the USDA report on food insecurity further hinders efforts to address the problem effectively.</p>

Despite alarming statistics, there are no public health campaigns against smoking, and the government is involved in tobacco sales. Lawmakers are now considering interventions like improved health screening and public smoking bans, but change is expected to be slow.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband's promise to cut UK energy bills by £300 could be "wiped out" by rising electricity costs, according to the economist behind the original savings estimate. Pawel Czyzak of Ember, an energy think tank, stated his 2023 analysis needs updating due to changes in offshore wind costs and other factors. While Miliband's department stands by its commitment, a new report from the Tony Blair Institute urges a shift from "clean power" to "cheaper power" by axing carbon taxes on gas.
