        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has renewed his threat to impose a 100% tariff on all films produced outside the United States, claiming the American movie industry has been "stolen" by other countries. He stated this measure would "solve this long time, never ending problem" affecting California. The proposed levy has generated significant concern from the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, which highlights that American productions frequently utilize Canadian facilities, crews, and talent, warning of increased costs and weakened economies. Investment analysts also question the feasibility and definition of an "American-made" movie under such a tariff, suggesting it could inflate consumer prices for streaming and cinema.</p>

          <p>This opinion article criticizes New Jersey Democrat Rep. Mikie Sherrill's performance in a recent gubernatorial debate, portraying her as hypocritical and unfit for higher office. The author alleges Sherrill voted for a resolution and then denounced it, refused to commit against tax increases, and lied about trading defense stocks while on the House Armed Services Committee. The piece also attacks her stances on immigration, education, and energy, asserting she consistently aligns with President Biden and Governor Murphy's policies. It concludes that Sherrill is a "Washington hypocrite" who dodges questions and sells out taxpayers, contrasting her unfavorably with Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump is engaged in a critical meeting with top congressional leaders in a final attempt to avert a government shutdown, with the deadline rapidly approaching. The White House advocates for a "clean continuing resolution" to fund federal operations, but Democrats are demanding substantial healthcare concessions, including the reversal of $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts and a permanent extension of expiring Obamacare subsidies. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries underscored the unified Democratic stance, while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer expressed hope for serious negotiation. This pivotal meeting, the first bicameral, bipartisan leadership gathering of Trump’s second term, highlights the deep impasse as a shutdown appears increasingly probable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democrats are employing a risky strategy concerning a potential government shutdown, seemingly calling President Trump's bluff regarding his threat to permanently downsize federal agencies. White House budget director Russell Vought had instructed agencies to consider mass firings in departments not vital to Trump's agenda, aligning with conservative "Project 2025" ambitions. While Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer previously feared such an outcome, Democrats now refuse a "clean" funding bill without healthcare concessions. The article explores the legal and political reasons why Trump might be bluffing, yet acknowledges the possibility that a shutdown could still be used to gut the regulatory state.</p>

          <p>Two attorneys from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's anti-discrimination division, Paul Osadebe and Palmer Heenan, claim they were fired after publicly disclosing a whistleblower report. This report alleged that the Trump administration was systematically dismantling efforts to combat residential segregation, deeming anti-discrimination enforcement "not a priority" and targeting their office for downsizing. Both attorneys stated their terminations were a direct consequence of their public statements, citing policy violations for their interviews. Senator Elizabeth Warren condemned these firings, interpreting them as an attempt to silence those exposing systemic attacks on civil rights, particularly impacting vulnerable communities.</p>

It highlights the economic challenges faced by Hollywood, exacerbated by the pandemic and labor strikes, and discusses efforts to retain productions domestically. The piece then critically examines President Trump's renewed threat of a 100% tariff on foreign-made films, raising significant concerns among industry experts regarding its practical implementation, potential for chaos, and the risk of international retaliation.

          <p>Charlie Javice, the founder of the fintech startup Frank, has been sentenced to just over seven years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan Chase. A jury found Javice guilty of three counts of fraud and one count of conspiracy, after she deliberately overstated Frank's customer numbers, claiming five million students when the actual figure was fewer than 300,000. This deception led to JPMorgan acquiring Frank for $175 million in 2021. Javice expressed profound remorse in court, while her attorney sought leniency. The incident proved embarrassing for JPMorgan, raising questions about its acquisition processes and due diligence in the competitive fintech market.</p>

Economists at Barclays and Nomura warn of more severe near-term effects on employment reports.

          <p>This article, based on research by a stress physiologist, challenges conventional stress management advice by suggesting that helping others is the most effective "cure" for stress. Contrary to popular inward-focused methods like meditation, studies show that channeling stress energy outward, known as "stress springboarding," significantly reduces stress. The research highlights that stress triggers oxytocin, the "cuddle hormone," which motivates social connection and support. Engaging in actions like assisting colleagues, volunteering, or supporting family members activates brain reward centers and rewires the brain to handle stress more effectively, benefiting both personal well-being and professional performance.</p>

Sanford reportedly drove his vehicle through the church doors, discharged an assault rifle, and initiated a fire during Sunday services. Further details reveal he served in the U.S. Marines from 2004 to 2008, including an Iraq deployment, and had expressed strong negative sentiments towards the Latter-day Saints church, alongside personal struggles with substance abuse.</p>

This potential delay poses a significant challenge for the Federal Reserve, which relies heavily on BLS data for its monetary policy decisions, including upcoming interest rate considerations.
