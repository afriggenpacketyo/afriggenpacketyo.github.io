          <p>A congressional hearing revealed that Beijing is more likely to employ a blockade or economic warfare against Taiwan rather than a full-scale invasion. Experts believe China would aim to force Taiwan's capitulation through cyber-enabled economic warfare, targeting the island's financial, energy, and telecommunications sectors. While most countries, including the U.S., do not recognize Taiwan as an independent state, the U.S. is committed to providing Taiwan with the means to defend itself against any forceful takeover.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has discovered that a copy of the Magna Carta in its collection, purchased for $27.50 in 1946, is actually a rare version from 1300 issued by King Edward I, potentially worth millions. Researchers identified the document by comparing it to other known copies and using ultraviolet light to reveal faded details. The journey of the document to Harvard has been traced back to a British auction house and a World War I flying ace. The discovery underscores the enduring relevance of the Magna Carta's principles of individual liberty and self-governance.</p>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, has warned that price hikes due to tariffs could begin later this month, despite a recent agreement to lower duties on imports from China.

Despite the tariff concerns, Walmart reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and reaffirmed its full-year forecast.

          <p>The Trump administration is increasingly relying on officials to fill multiple positions, a practice known as dual-hatting. Marco Rubio, for example, serves as secretary of state, acting administrator of USAID, acting archivist of the United States, and acting national security adviser. This practice raises concerns about the effectiveness of government and potential conflicts of interest. The reliance on dual-hatted officials reflects Trump's attempts to learn from his first term and his difficulty in finding qualified people willing to fill administration roles.</p>

          <p>President Trump's easing of tariffs on Chinese goods has provided some relief to businesses, but long-term planning remains uncertain. While the 145 percent tariff was unthinkably high, the overall average tariff rate remains at its highest level since 1934. Smaller companies are struggling to absorb the costs of tariffs, leading to strategies such as cutting the cheapest items, considering layoffs, and putting new product launches on hold.
