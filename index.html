This decision marks the shortest managerial tenure in Premier League history. During his time with the club, Postecoglou failed to secure a single win across eight matches in all competitions. The team's poor performance under his leadership left them just one point above the relegation zone, prompting the club to relieve him of his duties.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces have formally identified the remains of Eliyahu Margalit, 76, as the eighth deceased hostage returned by Hamas under a recent peace agreement. The process of returning all 28 known deceased hostages has been slow, with Hamas claiming that the widespread destruction in Gaza has made locating the bodies extremely difficult. The handover provides a measure of closure for one family, while the fate of at least 20 other deceased hostages remains unresolved.</p>

          <p>Several influential figures from England's Football Association (FA) are departing for Bay Collective, a new U.S.-based multi-club ownership group dedicated to women's football. This includes Anja van Ginhoven, general manager for the England women's team, and former technical director Kay Cossington. The article suggests the move is driven by the appeal of building a new ecosystem from scratch, comparing the agility of a new venture to the slower pace of an established institution like the FA.</p>

          <p>According to a Pew Research Center analysis of federal data, remarriage is a common outcome for divorced Americans, with two-thirds choosing to marry again. The study indicates that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women and that doing so often leads to greater financial stability. The median household wealth of remarried adults was found to be significantly higher than that of divorced adults and comparable to those in their first marriage, highlighting a key social and economic trend.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analytical article posits that the earnest and sometimes unpolished nature of the anti-Trump "Resistance," often labeled as "cringe," is precisely what gives the movement its power. It argues that this sincerity serves as a direct counterpoint to the cynicism and irony prevalent in the Trump era. The piece connects the movement's past successes, like the 2018 midterms, to its current mobilization for "No Kings" protests, framing sincere idealism as an effective tool against authoritarian tendencies.</p>

          <p>During a press conference, President Trump responded to a Russian proposal for a rail tunnel connecting Russia and the U.S. under the Bering Strait, calling the idea "interesting." The concept, which Russia's investment envoy says has been under a feasibility study for six months, envisions a 70-mile link symbolizing unity between the nations. When asked for his opinion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was also present, stated he was "not happy with this idea."</p>
