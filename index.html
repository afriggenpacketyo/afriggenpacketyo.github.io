        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of energy customers are set to receive payouts, potentially reaching £1,000, due to the scandal involving the forced fitting of prepayment meters. Energy companies will provide over £70 million in compensation and financial support after a review by Ofgem revealed suppliers improperly switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without consent. Customers could receive payments ranging from £40 to £1,000, depending on their treatment, and some may have debts written off. A new code of practice is now in place to prevent future inappropriate installations, with stricter conditions for companies seeking to install prepayment meters without customer consent. The intervention seeks to correct mistreatment and prevent the recurrence of such practices.</p>

          <p>Senior police and security leaders, including the head of the Met Police and an MI5 boss, have expressed concerns about the government's proposals to release some prisoners early to ease prison overcrowding. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, they argued that the plans "could be of net detriment to public safety", citing concerns about the costs of electronic tagging and repeat offenders avoiding jail. Metropolitan Police Sir Mark Rowley acknowledged the government had a "difficult problem to fix" but said the proposed solutions would create extra work for the police. The government maintains that the announced proposals addressed many of their concerns, and that terrorists will not be eligible for earlier release.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors will not seek the death penalty against Joaquin Guzman Lopez, the son of the notorious Mexican drug kingpin "El Chapo," if he is convicted of multiple charges in Chicago.

This visit marks his third meeting with Chancellor Friedrich Merz this month, highlighting Germany's increasing role in sustaining Ukraine's war effort. Zelensky stated that securing financing is the biggest issue, needing $30 billion annually to fund arms production at full capacity. The arms race is becoming increasingly important, with the industrial dimension of the war acting as a proxy war between Ukraine and its allies versus Russia and its supporters.</p>

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has rejected President Donald Trump's demand to arrest opposition politician Julius Malema for repeatedly chanting "kill the farmer." Trump showed Ramaphosa a video of Malema chanting and insisted on his arrest, but Ramaphosa stated that South Africa is a sovereign country with its own laws. The Constitutional Court decided in 2022 that the slogan was a decades-old "liberation chant" and not a call for violence. Malema has defied criticism, stating he will sing the chant whenever he likes, amid ongoing debates about freedom of expression and incitement.</p>

          <p>According to new research from Vanguard, having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is the top predictor of financial well-being, surpassing high income or asset levels. The survey of over 12,000 Vanguard investors found that those with emergency savings report greater financial well-being. Behavioral economist Paulo Costa noted that this initial $2,000 makes a significant difference, providing confidence in handling unexpected expenses. The median cost of an emergency is about $2,000, and having this cash readily available reduces financial anxiety and time spent worrying about finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article challenges the notion that high protein intake, particularly from animal products, is essential for muscle building, arguing it's a myth perpetuated by fitness influencers. It cites experts who claim that excessive protein recommendations can make exercise seem unattainable and promote needless dietary rigidity. The author advocates for a more balanced approach, highlighting that plant-based protein is sufficient for muscle growth and is better for the environment. The article suggests that a saner protein goal is between 0.54 and 0.73 grams per pound of body weight per day for weightlifters, and emphasizes the importance of using muscles over solely relying on protein intake.</p>
