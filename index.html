          <p>Walmart announced plans to extend its drone delivery service to 100 stores across Atlanta, Charlotte, Houston, Orlando, and Tampa within the next year, adding Georgia, North Carolina, and Texas to the existing service in Arkansas and Florida. Customers can order through the Wing app, with deliveries taking 30 minutes or less within a six-mile radius of the store. The retailer aims to compete with rivals like Amazon by offering convenience alongside low prices, with frequently delivered items including eggs, ice cream, and pet food. This expansion follows a previous attempt to expand drone deliveries in 2022 that did not achieve its goals, and Walmart has completed over 150,000 drone deliveries since 2021.</p>

Trump expressed disappointment in Musk's criticism, while Musk defended his opposition to the bill, citing concerns about its impact on the national debt and electric vehicle subsidies. The exchange included accusations of ingratitude and claims about Musk's influence on the 2024 election, culminating in a threat from Musk to decommission SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft. </p>

          <p>Witnesses testifying before the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission stated that President Trump's tariff policy is not effectively addressing US supply chain issues related to China's manufacturing dominance. They advocated for comprehensive and structural responses, including rebuilding US industrial capacity in sectors like defense and chips, and ensuring China's exclusion from critical supply chains. Economist Adam Wolfe noted that China's focus on strengthening high-tech manufacturing is partly motivated by US sanctions and tariffs, driving Beijing to prioritize domestic production of key technologies.

The dispute between Trump and Musk stemmed from Musk's criticism of Trump's tax and spending bill, which Musk deemed a "disgusting abomination." Musk responded by suggesting SpaceX would halt its Dragon spacecraft operations, while Trump claimed Musk was upset about the potential elimination of electric vehicle tax credits.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposed legislative agenda, dubbed the "big, beautiful bill," is under scrutiny due to significant cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. The bill includes approximately $600 billion in Medicaid cuts, potentially leading to 10.9 million people losing health coverage over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. SNAP faces an estimated $230 billion reduction over 10 years. Republicans argue that these cuts aim to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in these programs, freeing up funds to support Trump's tax cuts and increased funding for border security and defense. The bill introduces new work requirements, increased eligibility checks, and restrictions on funding for undocumented migrants and abortion providers.</p>

          <p>The government has introduced new regulations prohibiting six water companies from awarding "unfair" bonuses to senior executives. The ban applies to firms that fail to meet environmental and consumer standards, lack financial resilience, or have been convicted of criminal offenses. The move comes amid growing public concern about sewage spills and rising bills, with water companies having paid out Â£112m in executive rewards over the past decade. The affected companies include Anglian Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, United Utilities, Wessex Water, and Yorkshire Water. Regulator Ofwat can now claw back bonuses or take enforcement action, but critics argue that companies could circumvent the ban by increasing base salaries.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses the need for improved diplomatic relations between the Philippines and China, despite ongoing maritime disputes. The article argues that an overemphasis on the sea dispute has hindered broader connections, including economic cooperation and people-to-people exchanges. It suggests that both Manila and Beijing should explore areas of collaboration without compromising their positions, such as economic development, tourism, and renewable energy. By focusing solely on security issues, the relationship risks becoming a dangerous, self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

          <p>The disagreement between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has intensified into a full-blown feud, with both figures wielding their considerable public influence to attack each other. Trump expressed surprise at Musk's criticism of his legislative agenda and downplayed Musk's financial support in the previous election. Musk, in turn, questioned the impact of Trump's economic policies and even suggested that Trump appears in unreleased files related to Jeffrey Epstein.

          <p>President Donald Trump confused German Chancellor Friedrich Merz during a meeting at the White House by describing D-Day, the Allies' 1944 invasion of Normandy, as "not a great day."

The exchange occurred during a discussion about the war in Ukraine, with Merz drawing parallels between Russia's invasion and World War II. The incident highlights Trump's often unconventional interactions with foreign leaders and his sometimes controversial views on historical events.</p>

The prosecution represents a novel approach to targeting individuals involved in the street racing scene who are not drivers.
