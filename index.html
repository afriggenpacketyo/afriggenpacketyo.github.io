          <p>British police are currently interrogating five men, including four Iranian nationals, concerning a suspected terror plot targeting a specific location in the UK. The arrests occurred across various locations, including Swindon and Manchester, with military personnel reportedly involved in at least one raid. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper highlighted the operations as reflecting significant counter-terrorism efforts in recent years, indicating the severity of the perceived threat.

It also covers the 1999 peace talks that came up short, India's crackdown in 2019, and the recent terrorist attack in 2025, highlighting the continued tensions and the potential for military confrontation between the two nuclear-armed countries.</p>

          <p>The offshore yuan has risen to a six-month high against the US dollar, fueled by optimism that the US and China may soon begin negotiating a rollback of tariffs. Experts suggest that the current tariffs are unsustainable and expect both countries to reduce them, though negotiations are anticipated to be lengthy and volatile. Despite renewed interest in Chinese assets, global investors remain cautious and require tangible evidence of China's ability to withstand US challenges before increasing their investments.

Using image processing technology, researchers converted ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, confirming the approximate years of observations around 335BC. If validated, this would predate the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece, previously recognized as the oldest known human record of the stars.

The airline, supported by the Shaanxi provincial government, operates domestic routes connecting smaller cities with regional hubs. The suspension is primarily attributed to a lack of profitable routes, as high-speed railway networks increasingly replace air travel for a cheaper alternative. This situation highlights the financial challenges faced by regional airlines in China amid increasing competition and infrastructure development.</p>

The authors warn that the world needs to choose Americaâ€™s computing stack to reap the benefits of the coming AI revolution and highlight the need for the US to openly share more of its AI technologies and research, innovate even faster, and double down on diffusing AI throughout the economy.</p>
