          <p>President Trump delivered a commencement address at West Point, praising the graduates and highlighting his administration's efforts to strengthen the military. He emphasized national security and border protection, including the "Golden Dome" missile defense system. Trump also criticized past administrations for involving the military in nation-building and bashed diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, stating that critical race theory and transgender issues would no longer be forced upon service members. The president's speech underscored his commitment to a strong military focused on national defense, while also denouncing what he views as divisive social ideologies. The article contextualizes the speech within Trump's broader agenda of reshaping the military and government.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter as it approached for landing, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred due to a temporary antenna's placement during control tower construction. The FAA controllers aborted the landings as a precaution, but the Army asserts that the helicopter adhered to its approved flight path and posed no risk to air traffic. The NTSB expressed disappointment that the Army released its findings to the media before briefing the agency, which is leading the investigation into a prior mid-air collision involving an Army helicopter and a passenger jet in January.</p>

          <p>California has initiated a project to create new wetlands on the shrinking Salton Sea's shore, aiming to provide habitat for fish and birds while controlling harmful dust. Water is being pumped into newly constructed basins, marking the state‚Äôs largest effort to address the sea's environmental issues. The $200-million Species Conservation Habitat Project, originally envisioned to cover 4,100 acres, is now planned for expansion to over 9,000 acres. The project aims to create lower-salinity habitats suitable for fish and birds, utilizing a mix of saltwater from the lake and freshwater from the New River. This initiative comes after years of delays and is seen as a crucial step in fulfilling the state's obligations to mitigate the environmental impacts of the Salton Sea's decline.</p>

          <p>Myanmar's Kachin State is experiencing a boom in rare-earth mineral extraction, causing significant environmental damage and health risks, as activists report. The in-situ leaching technique, involving injecting chemicals into the ground, is polluting water sources and harming local villagers. Chinese companies are sourcing dysprosium from Myanmar, a crucial element for green energy technologies, including electric vehicle batteries and wind turbines. Activists are calling for responsible mining practices and greater oversight to ensure fair distribution of benefits and minimize environmental devastation, as the lucrative trade risks financing conflict in the region. The Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) now controls much of the mineral-rich region and is negotiating with Chinese producers on taxing rare earth extraction.</p>
