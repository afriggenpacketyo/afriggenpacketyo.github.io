Orszag suggests eliminating the debt limit, extending the maturity of Treasury debt, and pursuing fiscal savings in entitlement programs.

          <p>Lewis Pugh, a British-South African endurance athlete, became the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard, completing the 62-mile journey over 12 days to raise awareness about the plight of sharks. Pugh aims to change public perceptions and encourage protections for sharks, which he says have been unfairly portrayed as villains. He noted that humans kill around 274,000 sharks globally each day and emphasized the need for drastic measures to protect these essential apex predators. Pugh called the decimation of sharks an "ecocide" and highlighted their importance in maintaining a healthy ocean ecosystem.</p>

          <p>During a Memorial Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, President Donald Trump made remarks that drew criticism for being self-centered and boastful. While honoring the sacrifices of fallen soldiers, Trump digressed to discuss his accomplishments and the upcoming Olympics, World Cup, and military parade. He also made comments about "unchecked" migration and previously wished a "happy Memorial Day" to those he considers "scum." These remarks were seen by some as inappropriate for the solemn occasion.</p>

          <p>King Charles III arrived in Canada to deliver the Speech from the Throne, which will outline the government's agenda for the new Parliament. Prime Minister Mark Carney said the visit underscores Canada's sovereignty amid U.S. President Trump's talk of annexing its northern neighbor. The visit comes after Trump's meeting with Carney and has been interpreted as a message to the world about Canada's distinct identity. The last time a monarch delivered the throne speech in Canada was in 1977.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent call to wind down the war in Gaza reflects a growing impatience even within Israel's closest alliances. This shift comes amid increasing criticism from foreign leaders and aid groups, and after months of reluctance from allies like the U.S., Britain, and France to censure Israel's actions. Germany and Italy have also voiced unusually strong criticism of Israel's expanded attacks. While these countries continue to support Israel in many ways, the shift in tone indicates that Israel's strongest partners are beginning to lose patience with Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p>

Although he has condemned Putin’s actions as “crazy” and expressed shock at the attacks, he has not taken any action to impose a price on Putin.
