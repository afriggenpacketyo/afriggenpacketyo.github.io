          <p>British tennis player Cameron Norrie was eliminated from the US Open after suffering his seventh career loss to 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic in the fourth round. Djokovic, battling a lower back injury that required on-court treatment, persevered to win 6-4, 6-7 (3-7), 6-2, 6-3. This victory propels the Serb into the last 16 as he pursues a standalone record 25th major title, his first tournament since Wimbledon. Djokovic humorously noted his team wants him to "suffer on the court" to maximize playing minutes, underscoring his enduring competitive spirit despite physical challenges and the high stakes of the tournament.</p>

          <p>The FBI has announced the recovery of bones during a two-day search operation in Washington state, intensifying the manhunt for Travis Decker, who is accused of killing his three young daughters. Decker became a fugitive after failing to return Paityn, 9, Evelyn, 8, and Olivia, 5, from a planned visitation, with their bodies later discovered in his truck near Rock Island Campground. Nearly 100 personnel, including specialty search teams, participated in the extensive search across 250 acres of dense vegetation. The collected bones are now being analyzed to determine their origin, as authorities diligently seek to locate Decker and gather additional evidence in this profoundly tragic case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked the Trump administration's expanded use of expedited removal for immigrants, citing significant due process concerns. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that applying fast-track deportations to a large group of people in the country's interior, particularly those with humanitarian parole status, lacks adequate procedural safeguards. The decision emphasizes that while the expedited removal statute itself isn't questioned, its application must afford due process, protecting noncitizens and citizens alike from arbitrary removal. This ruling significantly curtails a major hallmark of President Trump's immigration enforcement agenda, requiring more robust legal procedures for these individuals and upholding constitutional principles.</p>

The expedition was fraught with challenges, including violent tropical storms and high winds, during which Lachlan was even swept overboard before being rescued.

Cunningham, renowned as the first Navy fighter ace in Vietnam, later served eight terms in the House of Representatives, where his career was tragically marred by a major bribery scandal. In 2005, he pleaded guilty to accepting $2.4 million in illegal gifts from defense contractors in exchange for government contracts, leading to an eight-year prison sentence. His conviction was a significant factor in the establishment of the Office of Congressional Ethics, and he received a pardon from President Donald Trump in 2021, marking a complex legacy.</p>

          <p>A 10-mile stretch of the scenic Angeles Crest Highway (Highway 2) has reopened to the public, just in time for Labor Day weekend, after being closed for years due to extensive storm and fire damage. Heavy rains in 2022-2023 caused slope failures and pavement collapses, with further damage from the 2024 Bridge fire. Repairs, costing approximately $7.9 million, included new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems, significantly restoring vital access. The reopening notably restores access to popular hiking trails and is expected to alleviate overcrowding at other trailheads. However, officials warn of extreme fire danger in the Angeles National Forest, urging visitors to adhere to safety prohibitions.</p>

          <p>Three men were arrested during protests outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, UK, after the Court of Appeal overturned a temporary injunction that had blocked asylum seekers from being housed there. The ruling means 138 asylum seekers will not be forced to leave by September 12. Essex Police reported two officers were injured, emphasizing that the right to protest does not include committing crimes. Tensions in Epping have been high since July, exacerbated by an asylum seeker's arrest for sexual assault on a 14-year-old girl. The council, which obtained the initial injunction, is considering an appeal to the Supreme Court to continue its legal challenge.</p>

Locals express concerns about smoke pollution, health risks, and environmental impact, urging the MoD to ban live-fire training during dry months.

The judges emphasized that Congress designed TPS to be predictable and insulated from political shifts, providing stability for those fleeing dire conditions.

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris will receive protection from the California Highway Patrol (CHP) after President Trump revoked her Secret Service security detail. Trump signed a memorandum ending Harris's protection, which had been extended by President Biden until July 2026, citing an elevated threat level. This decision, described by Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass as "another act of revenge," raises concerns about Harris's safety, particularly as she prepares for a 15-stop book tour for her memoir, "107 Days." California officials are now implementing a plan for CHP to provide dignitary protection, highlighting the politicization of security for former high-ranking officials and the ongoing political climate.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson gave an awkward response when California Governor Gavin Newsom highlighted Louisiana's higher murder rate compared to California's, suggesting federal troops should be deployed there if President Trump is genuinely concerned about crime. Newsom's comments came after Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington D.C., and threatened similar action in other blue states. Johnson dismissed Newsom's remarks as attention-seeking, defending Shreveport's crime reduction efforts while acknowledging the nationwide issue. This article underscores the ongoing political debate over federal intervention in state crime issues and the strategic use of crime statistics in partisan arguments.</p>

          <p>The White House has defended Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. amidst significant turmoil at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), following the firing of CDC Chief Dr. Susan Monarez and the subsequent resignations of at least three senior leaders. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller lauded Kennedy as "a crown jewel of this administration" and an expert dedicated to restoring CDC's credibility. Kennedy, a vaccine critic with a law background, has implemented funding cuts and policy changes that have angered public health experts and led to calls for his resignation from Democratic senators.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has blocked Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and approximately 80 other Palestinian officials from attending the UN General Assembly session in New York by revoking their visas. Secretary of State Marco Rubio attributed the decision to their alleged undermining of peace efforts and pursuit of "unilateral recognition of a conjectural Palestinian state." This unusual move, welcomed by Israel, contradicts the UN Headquarters Agreement, which typically ensures travel for officials to UN headquarters.

          <p>Traditional coffee chains like Costa are struggling to retain market share as evolving consumer preferences, particularly among younger generations, shift towards alternative beverages like matcha. Costa's owner, Coca-Cola, is reportedly considering selling the chain, which has seen its value decline. Newer chains like Blank Street Coffee have gained a cult following, partly through TikTok appeal and offering diverse matcha drinks. Analysts suggest that increased home coffee machine use, higher coffee prices, and a desire for unique "treat" experiences contribute to the decline of middle-ground retailers.
