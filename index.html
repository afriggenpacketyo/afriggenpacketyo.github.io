          <p>Bitcoin has rebounded to over $90,000, driven by investors seeking alternatives to the turbulent stock market and weakening U.S. dollar. The cryptocurrency experienced a 5% increase, fueled by inflows into U.S. ETFs tracking spot bitcoin prices. Analysts suggest Bitcoin is decoupling from traditional risk assets, showing resilience amid macroeconomic uncertainties, but caution that light trading volumes may hinder further gains beyond the $93,000 resistance level. Chart analysts identify $88,000 as a key support level, with potential for further upside if cleared. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cautioned that President Trump's tariffs pose a significant threat to the global economy, potentially triggering a trade war. The IMF has lowered its global growth forecast for the year from 3.3% to 2.8% and reduced its U.S. growth forecast from 2.8% to 1.8%. The increased policy uncertainty stemming from tariffs is cited as a major factor slowing global growth, with fears of retaliatory measures from targeted countries escalating tensions. Treasury Secretary Bessent has said he expects 'de-escalation' in U.S.-China tariff fight in the 'very near future'.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to end the IRS's Direct File program, a free tax-filing tool that saved users an average of $160, prompting criticism from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates.

The IRS is also expected to undergo a cost-cutting overhaul, potentially reducing its workforce by up to 40%.

Some economists are confident about Argentina's economic future, citing the removal of capital controls, while others express caution, pointing to the social costs of austerity measures.

          <h2>Trump Suggests Tariffs Could Replace Income Tax, Economists Express Skepticism</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that revenue generated from tariffs could potentially replace the federal income tax, an idea he previously floated during his presidential campaign. Economists, however, are skeptical of the proposal's feasibility. While tariff negotiations are ongoing, with a temporary pause on sweeping tariffs, some tariffs on Chinese goods remain high. The Tax Foundation's Alex Durante deemed the idea unrealistic, highlighting the challenges of relying solely on tariff revenue to fund the government.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has fired additional immigration judges, raising concerns about due process for migrants and noncitizens, while simultaneously aiming to increase deportations. Critics argue that the firings exacerbate the backlog of millions of immigration cases, as judges review hundreds of cases annually. The administration is also pressuring judges to expedite case reviews and potentially deny asylum claims without hearings. Immigration law experts warn that the system is already overburdened, and the firings will make it more difficult to reach the administration's goals of increasing deportations.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued an executive order targeting a key provision of the Inflation Reduction Act, seeking to modify Medicare drug price negotiation rules in a move that could benefit pharmaceutical companies. The order directs HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to work with Congress to eliminate the discrepancy between small-molecule drugs and biologics in the negotiation process. This change could increase Medicare prescription drug spending and raise medication prices, as small-molecule drugs would be on the market longer before being eligible for negotiation. The executive order also contains proposals opposed by the pharmaceutical industry, such as opening a pathway for drug imports from Canada.</p>
