          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, continuing its strategy of observing the effects of the Trump administration's economic policies. While the central bank anticipates inflation to rise in the coming months, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the relative strength of the economy, noting solid labor market conditions, but also cautioned that new tariffs could increase inflation and slow economic growth. The central bank will continue to monitor tariff developments to inform future rate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Massachusetts, Karen Read was found not guilty of murdering her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, in a retrial after her initial prosecution ended in a mistrial. Read was acquitted of second-degree murder, manslaughter, and leaving the scene after an accident resulting in death, but was found guilty of operating under the influence of liquor and sentenced to one-year probation. The defense argued that O'Keefe was attacked and beaten by others, while prosecutors alleged Read hit O'Keefe with her car. Following the verdict, some witnesses against Read called the result "a devastating miscarriage of justice."</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has implemented new guidelines for VA hospitals that eliminate explicit prohibitions against discriminating against patients based on their political beliefs or marital status. These changes, citing Donald Trump’s executive order, raise concerns about healthcare professionals potentially declining care based on personal characteristics not federally protected. Medical experts express concern that these changes could lead to discrimination against female veterans, LGBTQ+ veterans, and those in rural areas. The VA maintains that all eligible veterans will receive benefits and services, and that the changes were made to comply with federal law.</p>

This shift contradicts his previous criticisms of foreign adventurism and risks alienating voters who supported his peace-oriented platform.

          <p>While there's no minimum debt requirement to file for bankruptcy, it's generally considered when unsecured debt exceeds half of one's annual income. Warning signs include making only minimum payments, borrowing from one card to pay another, and facing collection calls or lawsuits. Alternatives to bankruptcy include debt settlement, debt management plans, debt consolidation loans, and hardship programs. Bankruptcy offers powerful protections but carries long-term consequences, making it essential to explore other options first. (not investment advice)</p>
