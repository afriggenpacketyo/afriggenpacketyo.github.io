          <p>During Liverpool FC's Premier League victory parade, a car collided with pedestrians on Water Street, resulting in 27 people being hospitalized, including two seriously injured, with four children among those hurt. A 53-year-old man has been arrested, and police do not believe the incident is terror-related. Eyewitnesses described the car driving through the crowd at a considerable speed, with some people chasing and attempting to stop the vehicle. The incident occurred about a mile from the parade's finishing point, causing significant disruption to the celebratory event.</p>

He believes that having something outside of cricket helps alleviate pressure, providing a sense of perspective regardless of his on-field performance, allowing him to settle on the field knowing there is something for him after cricket and it takes the pressure off a little bit.</p>

          <p>In response to soaring rice prices, the Japanese government is implementing a revised scheme to sell stockpiled rice directly to major retailers. Twenty companies have applied to purchase 110,000 tons of rice, which is over 30% of the planned release. New Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi stated that the ministry aims to ensure a stable food supply and dispel public anxiety over rising prices, with contracts being finalized and deliveries expected to begin soon. Aeon plans to sell the rice at around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms, aligning with the government's target to lower prices.</p>

          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant drop of 49% in April, attributed to brand damage related to CEO Elon Musk's political involvement and rising competition. While overall electric car sales in Europe rose, Tesla's sales declined, with a nearly 40% year-on-year decrease over the January-April period. The company faces challenges from traditional automakers and Chinese players like BYD, which outsold Tesla in pure electric cars in Europe for the first time. European consumers are also showing a preference for hybrid vehicles, a market segment Tesla does not currently address, and investors have expressed concerns about Musk's dedication to Tesla amidst his other ventures.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has challenged the dominance of Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that acquired traits can be inherited without changes to DNA. Rice plants subjected to cold stress passed on tolerance to low temperatures across multiple generations, bypassing genetic mutations. This research revives the theory of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who proposed that organisms can pass on learned survival traits. The team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences identified heritable DNA methylation changes as the driver of cold adaptation, positioning Lamarckism as a potential force in evolution.</p>

Drivers expressed discomfort with these tactics, and team bosses even apologized for the resulting disruptions.

          <h2>Legal Hurdles Delay Organ Donation Mechanism Between Hong Kong and Mainland China</h2>

          <p>A proposed regular mechanism for organ donation between Hong Kong and mainland China has been delayed due to legal obstacles. According to Wang Haibo, director of the China Organ Transplant Response System (COTRS), revisions to mainland laws, particularly those related to HIV regulations, are necessary. The existing laws prohibit the transfer of organs, blood, and tissue across the border. COTRS is a national system that allocates organs for transplants throughout China, and the specific law preventing the cross-border mechanism is related to controls to prevent the spread of HIV.</p>

Pugh aimed to challenge negative perceptions of sharks, which he says were maligned by the film "Jaws." He endured cold water and rough weather during the 12-day swim, which he described as one of the most difficult in his career. Pugh hopes to promote shark conservation and highlight the need for their protection, emphasizing their importance in the ocean ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were fake. The company's policies on fake reviews changed, leading to a more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews. Tripadvisor uses a three-pronged process of auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and remove fake reviews. Most fake reviews fall into the categories of boosting and member fraud, while paid reviews are a smaller but more pernicious category. (not investment advice)</p>
