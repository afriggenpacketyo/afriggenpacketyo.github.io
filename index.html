          <p>Netflix announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue increasing by 16% year-over-year to $11.08 billion. The company attributed the growth to an increase in members, higher subscription prices, and growing ad revenue. Citing a weaker U.S. dollar and continued growth, Netflix raised its full-year revenue guidance but cautioned that operating margins would be lower in the second half of 2025 due to higher content and marketing costs. This is the second quarter the company has not released specific subscriber data. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk has launched a sustained social media campaign criticizing President Trump's decision not to release additional files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Using his platform X, Musk accused the administration of a "cover up" and has posted or reposted criticisms over 35 times, just weeks after a previous public feud with the president. The article notes that while Musk is leveraging his platform to attack the administration, his posts also contain unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about an Epstein "client list." The White House has responded by directing reporters to previous statements affirming the president's leadership.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House announced that President Trump will not recommend appointing a special prosecutor to investigate the Jeffrey Epstein case, despite calls from some conservative supporters. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the president believes the Justice Department should release any credible new evidence it finds. This decision has angered some of Trump's base, who feel the administration is not being transparent, prompting the president to label the controversy the "Jeffrey Epstein Hoax." The stance contrasts with earlier promises of full transparency from Attorney General Pam Bondi.</p>

          <p>A new legislative proposal from Senator Bernie Moreno aims to impose stricter penalties on executives of publicly traded companies who knowingly violate federal employment verification laws. The SAFE HIRE Act would require CEOs and HR chiefs to personally certify their company's compliance in SEC reports, facing up to 20 years in prison and multimillion-dollar fines for false certifications. The bill is framed as a measure to protect American wages and prevent the exploitation of undocumented workers. This proposal emerges amid ongoing federal crackdowns on illegal immigration and heated political debate over immigration policy.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has secured an agreement to access the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) database, which contains personal information for 79 million Americans. According to the agreement, the purpose is to help ICE find "the location of aliens," a move critics are calling a "weaponization of data" and a betrayal of privacy. The Trump administration defended the action as a measure to combat fraud, despite internal warnings that it could violate statutes. Privacy advocates worry this will deter people, including citizens and eligible immigrants, from seeking necessary medical care.</p>

The legislation, which now heads to the president, establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The bill's passage, which saw significant bipartisan support, is considered a major victory for the crypto industry and the Trump administration, which has advocated for making the U.S. a leader in the sector. Critics, however, argue the regulations are too lenient and were heavily influenced by industry lobbying. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has overturned the 2017 fraud conviction of former HSBC trader Mark Johnson, ending his nine-year legal battle. Johnson was convicted of wire fraud for allegedly "front-running" a $3.5 billion currency exchange for a client, a practice his defense argued was a standard risk-management technique known as "pre-hedging." After serving time in U.S. and U.K. prisons, Johnson's acquittal comes after a law used in his prosecution was overturned. His lawyer stated that the case, which arose amid political pressure to prosecute bank employees, should never have been brought.</p>

          <p>This article explores the history of commercial air travel, challenging the popular notion of a past "golden age" of glamour and comfort. It argues that from its early days of dangerous, unpressurized cabins to the mid-century era of high costs and segregation, flying has always been fraught with unpleasantness. The piece suggests that modern frustrations like cramped seating and extra fees are just the latest evolution in a long history of trade-offs. Ultimately, the article posits that the perceived decline in the flying experience is also a result of the technology becoming mundane, a common cycle for any world-changing innovation.</p>

          <h2>Economic Worries Cause Nearly One-Quarter of Americans Over 50 to Delay Retirement, Survey Shows</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 15:48:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey reveals that nearly one in four Americans over the age of 50 are delaying their retirement plans due to economic concerns, an increase from 14% in 2024. The poll, conducted by F&G Annuities & Life, found that financial uncertainty, inflation, and fears of a recession are the primary drivers for this decision. This trend highlights the financial precarity of many older Americans, with another recent study noting the median savings for a 55-year-old is only $50,000. Experts advise continued saving, even small amounts, to better prepare for retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged a Los Angeles woman with conspiracy and making false statements for allegedly faking her own abduction by ICE agents. Authorities claim the woman orchestrated the hoax to elicit public sympathy and donations, capitalizing on community fears about immigration enforcement. The incident prompted a press conference by activists decrying the supposed "kidnapping." However, investigators say they tracked the woman's movements and found she was never in custody, and had even created doctored photos to support her story. The case arises amid heightened local tensions over federal immigration operations.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has officially authorized Juul to keep its tobacco- and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes on the U.S. market. The decision reverses a 2022 order to ban the products, with the FDA now concluding that Juul's products can be a less harmful alternative for adult smokers who switch completely from traditional cigarettes. The move is a major milestone for the company, which was widely blamed for sparking the teen vaping crisis. Anti-tobacco groups heavily criticized the decision, arguing the product that caused a public health crisis should not be authorized for sale.</p>

          <p>Recent Supreme Court decisions siding with the Trump administration reflect the conservative majority's belief in a strong "unitary executive," according to legal analysis. The court has repeatedly issued brief, unexplained orders to lift lower court injunctions, allowing the administration to proceed with federal agency staff and budget cuts. These rulings align with a long-held conservative legal theory that the president has broad authority to control and dismiss officials within the executive branch. While these emergency rulings allow Trump's policies to take effect, they set the stage for future landmark decisions on the limits of presidential power.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it is rescinding $4 billion in federal funding allocated to California's high-speed rail project, citing a lack of a viable path forward. The Department of Transportation pointed to missed deadlines, budget shortfalls, and a funding gap of $7 billion for the initial segment as reasons for the decision. The project's cost has ballooned from an initial $33 billion to an estimated $128 billion. California officials have disputed the administration's assessment, but the move represents a major financial blow to the long-troubled infrastructure plan.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Maurene Comey, the federal prosecutor who was abruptly fired by the Justice Department, linking her dismissal to her father, former FBI Director James Comey, and her past work on the Jeffrey Epstein case. As a prosecutor, Comey led the successful case against Ghislaine Maxwell. Her firing is seen by some as politically motivated, potentially as a scapegoat amid pressure on the Trump administration to release Epstein-related files. In an email to colleagues, Comey urged them not to let fear, which she called "the tool of a tyrant," influence their work.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced legislation that would amend the Stafford Act to classify extreme heat as a major disaster, making affected areas eligible for federal FEMA assistance. The move follows a record-breaking heat dome in June and aims to unlock federal funds for cooling centers, water infrastructure, and heat adaptation projects. Currently, extreme heat is not explicitly listed as a qualifying disaster, and past requests for such declarations have been denied. Proponents argue the change is vital as heat kills more Americans than any other weather event.</p>
