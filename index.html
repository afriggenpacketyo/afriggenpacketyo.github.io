          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon stated that President Trump's newly announced tariffs are likely to increase prices on both imported and domestic goods, which would negatively impact an already slowing U.S. economy. Dimon highlighted the uncertainties created by the tariffs, including their impact on global capital flows, corporate profits, and responses from trading partners, suggesting that resolving this issue quickly is crucial to prevent cumulative negative effects. He cautioned that the tariffs could be the 'one large additional straw on the camel's back', potentially leading to inflationary outcomes and slower growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Graham Allison, a Harvard professor, cautioned that a war between the U.S. and China is probable, though not inevitable, citing the 'Thucydides trap' as a potential framework for understanding their relationship. Allison's warning comes after President Trump imposed additional tariffs on China, leading to retaliatory measures from Beijing. The scholar suggests that economic and climate interdependence could serve as factors mitigating the risk of conflict. This statement emphasizes the need for careful management of the relationship between the two global powers to avoid escalation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs have caused volatility in global stock markets, raising concerns about a potential recession. While stock market performance does not always directly correlate with economic health, significant market declines can indicate a reappraisal of future profits. Increased tariffs are expected to raise costs and lower profits for companies. Although a recession is not inevitable, the chances are higher due to the severe and wide-ranging tariffs.</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel, reaching their lowest level since 2021, due to fears that President Trump's tariffs will trigger a recession.
