          <p>The Trump administration has opened a new migrant detention facility in Florida's Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," with plans to hold up to 5,000 people as part of an expanded deportation effort. Officials have controversially touted the remote location and surrounding dangerous wildlife as a deterrent to escape, a feature that has drawn sharp criticism from activists. The project, costing Florida $450 million annually, is also facing legal challenges from environmental groups over its construction on protected land.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the Yale Budget Lab concludes that the Republican domestic policy bill would financially harm the lowest-earning Americans while significantly benefiting wealthier households. The report finds that the bottom 20% of households would see an average annual income reduction of 2.9%, primarily due to sharp cuts in Medicaid and SNAP benefits. Conversely, the top 20% would experience a 2.2% income increase, largely from the extension of tax cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK House Prices Experience Largest Monthly Drop in Over Two Years</h2>

          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices saw their largest monthly decrease in over two years, falling by 0.8% in June. This decline may be a reflection of weaker demand following recent changes to stamp duty tax thresholds, which made property purchases more expensive for many. Despite the monthly drop, the annual growth rate remains positive at 2.1%. Economists suggest this market softness is likely temporary, with activity expected to recover in the coming months amid a supportive economic environment.</p>

          <p>This article provides a guide to current interest rates for certificates of deposit (CDs), which offer a safe way to earn returns that can outpace inflation. While national average yields for one-year CDs are around 2.01%, top online banks are offering rates over 4.40%. The piece advises savers to look at online banks, which typically have lower overhead and higher rates, and to consider short-term CDs, as the current inverted yield curve means they often have higher rates than long-term options.
