          <p>Recent newspaper headlines focus on Vladimir Putin's proposed peace deal for Ukraine, which would allow Russia to retain seized territory and lack a US security guarantee for Ukraine, sparking controversy. The death of the Pope is also prominently featured. Concerns about Donald Trump's tariffs are highlighted as the IMF predicts a major negative shock to the global economy, leading to reduced growth forecasts. Additionally, the papers cover Kemi Badenoch's call for Keir Starmer to apologize for his stance on biological sex, and reports of a surge in cash ISA investments due to potential reforms (not investment advice).</p>

The case revolves around whether public schools unconstitutionally burden parents' First Amendment rights to religious freedom.

The FDA is moving to phase out several synthetic food dyes by the end of next year, aiming for an "understanding" with food companies rather than a strict ban. While Democrats have long advocated for additive-free versions of products, the “Make America Healthy Again” movement has gained Republican support. Cracking down on food dyes is a modest step, and Kennedy has warned that “sugar is poison”.</p>
