        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has strongly defended its new export controls on rare earths, asserting their legitimacy under international law while rejecting US claims of economic coercion following Washington's retaliatory tariffs. This move comes as the US imposed significant retaliatory tariffs, leading to a substantial $2 trillion drop in market value and casting doubt on a planned meeting between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Beijing has accused Washington of employing double standards in trade practices and initiated reciprocal port charges, intensifying the ongoing trade dispute. The situation underscores the volatile nature of global supply chains for critical minerals and the deep-seated economic tensions between the two superpowers.</p>

          <p>Harry Kane, England's all-time leading scorer and a prolific striker for Bayern Munich, is often considered an undervalued superstar despite his consistent record-breaking achievements. Experts and former players argue that his quiet demeanor and focus on team performance contribute to this perception, contrasting him with more flamboyant peers like Erling Haaland. While his major tournament performances have faced scrutiny, his overall contribution, versatility, and unique playing style are highly praised by those who have played with or against him. His impact on England's national team and club success is undeniable, making him an irreplaceable asset.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly scrambling to rehire numerous Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staff, many of whom were erroneously laid off amidst government shutdown cuts. These critical personnel included leaders of the federal measles response team, staff combating an Ebola outbreak, and experts in immunization and disease forecasting. Critics, including former CDC officials, warned that these actions severely jeopardize public health and represent a "dismantling" of essential services. The situation underscores a pattern of strained relations and controversial decisions impacting the CDC under the current administration, particularly regarding vaccine policies.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv, expressing gratitude to Donald Trump for his role in brokering a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. US special envoy Steve Witkoff addressed the crowd, confirming hostages were "coming home." However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was met with boos, reflecting public anger over the October 7th attack and the prolonged conflict. Meanwhile, Hamas has mobilized fighters in Gaza to reassert control in areas vacated by Israeli troops, while displaced Palestinians return to find their homes in ruins, highlighting the complex and fragile peace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the second week of the US government shutdown, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) laid off approximately 1,300 employees, but quickly rescinded hundreds of those notices. The Trump administration justified the cuts by targeting "non-essential" workers, aligning with its "Make America Healthy Again" agenda. While staff from critical units like the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report and immunization centers had their dismissals reversed, employees in areas such as workplace safety and the Washington office did not. This marks a pattern, as HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. previously oversaw mass dismissals and rehirings at the CDC.</p>

          <p>Kenya has converted its $5 billion US dollar-denominated Chinese railway loans to Chinese yuan, a strategic move expected to reduce annual debt-servicing costs by $215 million. This decision, announced by Treasury Minister John Mbadi, is seen by analysts as a potential blueprint for other debt-stressed African nations, potentially drawing them closer to China. The original loans from the Export-Import Bank of China funded the Standard Gauge Railway, with a significant portion remaining unpaid. While new yuan loan terms were not fully disclosed, the deal is anticipated to halve the previous interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Shohei Ohtani's Batting Struggles Raise Concerns for Dodgers' NLCS Performance</h2>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani's disappointing performance at the plate during the Dodgers' NLDS, where he went one for 18 with nine strikeouts, has raised significant concerns for the upcoming NLCS. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged that Ohtani's "at-bat quality needs to get better," particularly his aggressive swings outside the strike zone and passive approach within it. While the Phillies' left-handed pitching posed a challenge, Roberts emphasized Ohtani's need to adjust his strategy against various pitchers. The team's World Series aspirations hinge on the $700-million superstar's ability to recalibrate and improve his hitting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Belgium Moves to Ban Kangaroo Meat Imports Over Animal Welfare Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 20:30:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Belgium's Flanders region plans to ban the trade and sale of kangaroo meat, citing severe animal welfare concerns regarding Australia's commercial kangaroo hunting. This move, which could influence broader European Union trade, highlights practices deemed inhumane, including the slaughter of up to 1.3 million kangaroos annually and the euthanasia of orphaned joeys. Concerns also extend to public health, as exotic game meats can transmit zoonotic pathogens. Major Belgian supermarkets previously stopped selling kangaroo meat, but it remains available in pet food and butcher shops. The ban also targets kangaroo skins used in fashion.</p>

          <p>Golf legend Tiger Woods has undergone his seventh back surgery, this time to address a collapsed disc in his L4/5 lumbar spine, casting significant doubt on his return to professional golf. The 49-year-old, who experienced pain and mobility issues, announced the operation was successful, but his recovery timeline remains unknown. This latest procedure adds to a long history of injuries, including a ruptured left Achilles earlier this year and a previous lumbar spine operation in 2024. Woods has had limited appearances recently, primarily in the new TGL indoor competition, leaving fans to wonder about his future on the green.</p>

          <p>A devastating explosion at a Tennessee munitions factory has resulted in the presumed deaths of 16 individuals, with no survivors found. Authorities confirmed the fatalities after initially reporting 18 missing, later locating two people safely off-site. The blast, which completely destroyed one building, rattled homes miles away and prompted a shift from rescue to recovery operations. The FBI and ATF are investigating the cause, complicated by the site's instability and lingering small fires. This tragedy is compounded by a previous fatal explosion at the same location in 2014, leaving the close-knit community deeply affected.</p>
