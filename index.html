          <p>The Republican-led House passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" by a single vote, delivering on President Trump's tax and immigration agenda after weeks of GOP infighting. Speaker Mike Johnson hailed the bill as a victory for Americans, while Trump celebrated its passage on social media. The legislation includes tax cuts, Medicaid reform, and immigration spending, fulfilling campaign promises such as "No Tax on Tips and No Tax on Overtime." The bill now moves to the Senate, where revisions are expected, and faced opposition from some Republicans and the entire Democratic caucus, highlighting the deep divisions within the House. </p>

          <p>CNBC provides an exclusive look at ASML's High NA, a $400 million chipmaking machine that is transforming microchip manufacturing. This machine, bigger than a double-decker bus, is the latest generation of ASML's Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) machines and is critical for producing advanced microchips. The first commercial installation of High NA was at Intel's Oregon chip fabrication plant in 2024, and only a few have been shipped to major chipmakers like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. High NA improves chip performance, speed, and yield by projecting chip designs at a higher resolution. </p>

          <p>Solar stocks experienced a significant drop after House Republicans passed a tax bill that terminates key clean energy credits. The legislation ends tax credits for installers who lease equipment to customers, which negatively impacts companies like Sunrun. Analysts describe the bill as "worse than feared" for clean energy, as it undermines the Inflation Reduction Act. However, First Solar, a major U.S. solar panel producer with a large domestic manufacturing footprint, was less affected due to the manufacturing tax credit remaining relatively untouched. </p>

The Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) remains unratified, and Europe's "de-risking" efforts have fueled escalation.

          <p>Congressional Republicans passed a tax bill centered on permanently extending tax cuts from Trump's first term while creating new deductions that expire in 2028, coinciding with the end of his presidency. The bill includes deductions for overtime, tips, and interest on loans for American-made cars, along with an increased child tax credit and "Trump accounts." However, these deductions expire after 2028, and the bill contains cuts to social safety net programs that could affect millions of poor and disabled Americans. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the wealthy will benefit most, while the poorest taxpayers would see their resources drop. </p>

The sell-off is driven by declining confidence in U.S. assets and a growing unease with worsening fiscal trajectories.

Social media has amplified this phenomenon, with powerful figures leveraging rabid fans to deny abuse, attack credibility, and reverse victim-offender roles. Examples include the harassment of Halle Bailey after she was granted a domestic violence restraining order against DDG, the attacks on Amber Heard during the Johnny Depp trial, and the targeting of Jennifer Hough by Nicki Minaj's fans. This trend is exacerbated by misogynistic online cultures and the weaponization of loyalty, particularly within Black communities. </p>
