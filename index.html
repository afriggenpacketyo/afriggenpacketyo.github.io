          <p>China's consumer spending remains sluggish due to factors such as uncertainty about future wealth, evolving consumer preferences, and a lack of robust social safety nets.  Stagnant income growth is a primary concern, with wage increases lagging behind GDP growth in most sectors.  High youth unemployment and a struggling real estate market further contribute to the issue.  Experts suggest policy interventions like increased pension payouts and consumption vouchers to stimulate spending (not investment advice).</p>
