          <p>During a Coldplay concert at Wembley Stadium, Chris Martin assisted a fan in proposing to his partner, referencing a previous incident where he unknowingly exposed a CEO's affair. Martin engaged with the fan, ensuring the proposal was consensual and lightheartedly referencing the prior viral moment. He then serenaded the couple as the fan proposed, creating a memorable experience for them and the audience. This event occurred one month after Martin's "Jumbotron Song" inadvertently revealed an Astronomer CEO's relationship with an HR executive, leading to the CEO's resignation. The band's involvement in personal moments adds a unique touch to their performances, making each concert special, and the score is secondary to the moment.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer analyzes the stock market's recent surge following signals of potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, highlighting key sectors and stocks to watch. He emphasizes the importance of Monday's trading given the levels stocks have reached, and suggests focusing on housing-related stocks, industrials, and software companies, while cautioning against enterprise software and autos. Cramer points out the non-monolithic nature of the Magnificent Seven megacaps, urging investors to consider individual company issues rather than grouping them together. Cramer advises paying attention to the decline in home prices and recognizing the homestretch of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel launched air strikes against Houthi targets in Sanaa, Yemen, in response to a missile attack by the group using cluster munitions. The Israeli military targeted a military complex, fuel depot, and power stations, resulting in casualties, with the IDF investigating why it failed to intercept the missile. Prime Minister Netanyahu asserted Israel's determination to retaliate against any attacks. The Houthis, backed by Iran, have been launching missiles at Israel and attacking commercial ships since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, claiming solidarity with Palestinians, as the repercussions of the attack and response are being assessed.</p>

          <p>Jerry Adler, known for his roles in "The Sopranos" and "The Good Wife," passed away at the age of 96, after a long career both on and off the stage. Before becoming an actor in his 60s, Adler had an extensive career in theater, working behind the scenes on 53 Broadway productions. He came from a family deeply involved in Jewish and Yiddish theater, which provided him with early opportunities in the industry. Adler's transition to acting was sparked by a casting director's hunch, leading to consistent work in film and television for over three decades, as colleagues remember his legacy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to send federalized National Guard troops to Chicago has been criticized by a leading Democrat who accused the president of manufacturing a crisis.

The White House is reportedly planning to deploy the National Guard to address crime, homelessness, and immigration in the Democratic-leaning city. Governor Pritzker stated that Illinois has not requested federal intervention, as the situation remains tense.</p>

          <p>The author, Juan Sebastian Pinto, discusses the dangers of Istar systems, built by companies like Palantir, which track, detain, and kill people at scale with AI. These tools, used by ICE and the IDF, combine vast data to detect patterns for mass surveillance and urban warfare. Pinto argues that these systems violate civil rights by limiting public expression and enabling warrantless data searches, and he shares his experience working for Palantir and his subsequent activism against AI surveillance, as people try to understand the tech.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, stated that Britain faces an “acute challenge” due to weak economic growth and a drop in the number of workers since the pandemic. He cited a rise in long-term sickness and a decline in young people in work as contributing factors, emphasizing the need to boost economic productivity. Bailey noted that by 2040, 40% of the UK population will be over 64, which is something that requires an assessment.</p>
