          <p>Venezuela is proceeding with an election to select a governor and legislators for Essequibo, a territory internationally recognized as part of Guyana. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's move is seen as an attempt to bolster his rule amidst domestic discontent and concerns about military loyalty. The election stokes nationalistic sentiment, as many Venezuelans believe Essequibo historically belongs to them, disregarding a 19th-century agreement ceding it to Guyana. The dispute has escalated due to the discovery of significant offshore oil reserves in Essequibo, where Exxon Mobil is expanding its operations, transforming Guyana's economy, while Venezuela's oil sector suffers from sanctions and mismanagement. The International Court of Justice has ordered Venezuela to refrain from electing officials in the area, but Maduro has rejected the court's jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched its largest air assault on Ukraine, deploying a record number of drones and missiles in a single night. The attacks resulted in at least 14 deaths, including three children, and numerous injuries across multiple regions.

          <p>A recent Kyodo News poll indicates that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decrease in soaring rice prices following the appointment of a new farm minister. This expectation arises after the previous minister was dismissed for insensitive remarks about receiving gifted rice. The poll also reveals that many believe rice prices should drop below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, a lower target than the one pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The survey reflects public concern over rising rice prices and their hopes for government intervention.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift in UK rail policy. The government emphasizes improving services and investing in infrastructure but refrains from promising fare reductions. Unions have voiced concerns about outsourcing staffing, while the opposition Conservatives are demanding Labour deliver on its promises. The government called the move a "new dawn for rail" but held back from promising lower fares, focusing more on plans to improve services and invest in infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A recent bombing at a Palm Springs fertility clinic has brought attention to the fringe movement of anti-natalism, which posits that procreation is immoral due to the inevitability of suffering.
