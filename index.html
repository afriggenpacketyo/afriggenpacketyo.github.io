        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO leaders have gathered in The Hague for a summit focused on European security, with all 32 members expected to pledge 5% of national output to defense. Secretary General Mark Rutte praised President Trump's handling of the Western alliance and the situation in Iran. The summit, scaled back to accommodate Trump's schedule, includes discussions on increased defense spending and support for Ukraine, where recent Russian attacks have caused numerous casualties, including children. Despite the commitment to increased spending, many NATO members still fall short of the alliance's defense spending targets, but some countries are taking steps to meet these goals by the end of the decade. The commitment includes a portion dedicated to core defense requirements and another portion allocated to defense-related expenditures such as cybersecurity and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is currently holding approximately 59,000 detainees, a record high, as the Trump administration intensifies immigration arrests nationwide. Nearly half of those detained have no criminal record, signaling a broadening of the administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. ICE's detention level is exceeding its capacity, with over 70% of detainees arrested in the U.S. interior. The administration has reversed previous policies that focused on arresting serious criminals and recent arrivals, leading to increased arrests at workplaces and other locations. The rapid expansion of the detainee population raises concerns about deteriorating conditions in ICE detention facilities and the provision of due process to immigrants.</p>

          <p>A heat dome is causing oppressive heat across the eastern half of the United States, with heat warnings and advisories affecting nearly 160 million people. The phenomenon, characterized by high pressure trapping warm air, suppresses clouds and precipitation, leading to extreme high temperatures. Cities like Boston and Philadelphia are experiencing temperatures well above 95 degrees, with heat index values exceeding 100 degrees. Experts warn that the extreme heat poses a particular risk to children and people with existing health issues, emphasizing the importance of adequate cooling and hydration. The current heat wave is expected to persist in the Midwest, while a cold front should bring relief to the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic later in the week.</p>

The victims, ranging in age from 37 to 73, have been identified by the El Dorado County Sheriff's Office.

          <p>New Orleans Saints defensive end Cameron Jordan has voiced his opinion that the NFL should relax its rules on taunting and excessive celebrations. Speaking at Fanatics Fest, Jordan argued that players should be allowed to celebrate touchdowns and sacks without penalty. The NFL has cracked down on taunting in recent seasons, leading to a decrease in flags, but Jordan believes that harmless taunting and celebration should be allowed. He argues that allowing players to express themselves adds to the entertainment value of the game.</p>

          <p>A classified U.S. assessment indicates that recent strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities by the Trump administration caused limited damage and only set back the nuclear program by a few months. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report concluded that key components of the nuclear program, including centrifuges, could be restarted relatively quickly. Much of Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium was reportedly moved before the strikes, possibly to other secret sites. The White House disputed the assessment, while defense officials offered differing accounts of the extent of the damage. The strikes involved B2 bombers dropping GBU-57 bombs on Fordow and Natanz, and Tomahawk missiles launched from a U.S. navy submarine on Isfahan.</p>

          <p>Neera Tanden, former White House Domestic Policy Council Director, appeared before the House Oversight Committee for a closed-door, transcribed meeting investigating former President Joe Biden's mental acuity. The committee, led by Chairman James Comer, is also investigating the use of an autopen for pardons and other executive actions during the Biden administration. Tanden stated that she answered every question and denied any effort to disguise Biden's condition. Additional former Biden senior aides are expected to be interviewed, and Dr. Kevin Oâ€™Connor, Bidenâ€™s former White House physician, will appear under subpoena in July.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping will not attend the upcoming BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro, marking his first absence from the gathering of leading emerging economies. Beijing informed the Brazilian government that Xi had a scheduling conflict and Premier Li Qiang is expected to lead the Chinese delegation. Sources suggest Xi's absence is due to his having met with Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva twice recently, once at the G20 summit and again in Beijing. Xi has never missed a BRICS summit as China's leader, though he did send a commerce minister in his place at the last minute in 2023.</p>

          <p>A new analysis indicates that nearly one in three federal student loan borrowers are at risk of defaulting on payments as early as July, with delinquency rates soaring after the end of pandemic-era repayment relief. Approximately 5.8 million borrowers were 90 days or more past due on their payments as of April 2025, representing 31% of borrowers with a payment due. This is a significant increase from pre-pandemic levels, with approximately 1.8 million borrowers expected to reach default status in July. Borrowers who become delinquent are also experiencing significant declines in their credit scores, averaging a 60-point drop.</p>

          <p>Extreme heat is becoming an increasing threat to rural America, with more than half of rural zip codes in the United States facing "high" heat vulnerability. Factors such as an older population, higher rates of chronic health conditions, and inadequate infrastructure contribute to the risk. Rural areas often lack access to air conditioning, have unreliable power grids, and experience longer emergency response times. Researchers have found that rural areas face heat dangers comparable to those in cities. Addressing this issue requires infrastructure upgrades, healthcare investments, and policy changes to protect vulnerable populations.</p>
