          <p>The UK government plans to reduce the driving test backlog, aiming to eliminate wait times exceeding five months by next summer by providing 10,000 extra tests a month. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander announced plans to double training capacity for examiners and reintroduce overtime pay. The government will also consult on changes to the booking system and crack down on test booking bots exploiting learners, with the goal of reducing wait times to seven weeks by summer 2026.</p>

Tesla reported a 20% drop in car sales and a 70% fall in profits, blaming the boycott of Tesla cars on attacks against Musk and the Doge team.
