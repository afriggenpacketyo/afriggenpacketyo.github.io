The conference brought together Asian and African countries to foster solidarity and promote a fairer international system.

The United States worked to undermine the conference, pressuring countries with which it had significant asymmetrical relationships â€“ Japan, Turkey, South Vietnam, Lebanon, the Philippines and Thailand â€“ on what to say and how to behave.</p>

          <p>Learner drivers in the UK are facing significant challenges booking driving tests due to an ongoing backlog. The process is described as being similar to buying festival tickets, with long online queues and limited availability. The backlog has led to learners paying for apps to find cancellation slots and instructors struggling to align lessons with test dates. The government aims to reduce wait times, but learners are still facing considerable delays.</p>

          <p>The area burned by wildfires in the UK has already surpassed the annual record, fueled by prolonged dry weather. The total area burned is higher than any year in more than a decade, with over 29,200 hectares affected. Most fires are started by humans, but favorable weather conditions have contributed to their spread. Researchers are concerned about the potential for more severe fires later in the year.</p>
