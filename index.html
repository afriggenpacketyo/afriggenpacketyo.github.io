          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, halting the Trump administration's attempt to utilize the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 for deporting Venezuelan nationals.  The judge cited concerns about the administration's actions sidestepping established immigration procedures and protections.  The lawsuit argued the act's historical use was limited to wartime scenarios, a condition not met in this case.</p>

          <h2>UK Government May Abandon Plan to Freeze Disability Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-15 21:51:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is reportedly considering abandoning plans to freeze Personal Independence Payments (PIP), a disability benefit, amid internal party dissent and concerns about the potential impact on vulnerable individuals.  The government is expected to announce welfare reforms, including tightening eligibility criteria for PIP, but the decision on the freeze could avoid a difficult vote in Parliament.  The reforms aim to reduce welfare spending by billions of pounds.</p>
