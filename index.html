          <p>Richard Jefferson, a former teammate of LeBron James on the Cleveland Cavaliers, recently described the intense experience of playing alongside the basketball superstar. He explained that while it can be difficult due to James's extreme competitiveness and demand for excellence, this pressure is a common trait among all-time great athletes. Jefferson acknowledged that the demanding environment is a necessary consequence when striving for championships at the highest level, but it ultimately comes with the significant benefit of playing with a legend.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new law aimed at preventing mass killings by individuals who are not driven by a specific ideology. The legislation intends to close a legal gap, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects who are planning attacks but do not fit the traditional definition of terrorism. This move, prompted by last year's Southport attack, will grant authorities similar powers to those used against terror suspects, enabling them to act on preparatory steps like researching targets.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts gave shortstop Mookie Betts an unplanned day off to help him reset mentally and mechanically amid a season-long slump. Betts's batting average has fallen to a career-low .241, and his performance has not improved since the All-Star break, prompting Roberts to take the decision out of the player's hands. The manager hopes that watching a game from the dugout will provide a different perspective and help the superstar break out of his prolonged struggles at the plate.</p>

Taylor, 46, was inside his tent and died from his injuries, a death his family's attorneys call a tragic and preventable consequence of inhumane city policies toward its unhoused population.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a libel lawsuit seeking at least $20 billion in damages against the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch.

The lawsuit accuses the paper of journalistic failures and making false, defamatory claims, though such suits face a high legal bar for public figures.</p>

          <p>After years of growth fueled by China's economic rise, the popularity of learning Mandarin is declining in several Western nations, including the United States, the UK, and New Zealand. University enrollment in Chinese language studies has dropped significantly from its peak a decade ago, a trend attributed to shifting geopolitical tensions and changing perceptions of China. This marks a significant shift from when Mandarin was widely hailed as the essential language of the future for business and diplomacy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on flights from Mexico, citing a violation of a bilateral aviation agreement. The move is a response to the Mexican government's actions that forced airlines to relocate from Mexico City's main airport, which the U.S. claims gives an unfair advantage to domestic carriers. The order requires Mexican airlines to seek U.S. government approval for their flight schedules and threatens to terminate a long-standing partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico.
