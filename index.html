        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson addressed President Trump's suggestion that California Governor Gavin Newsom should be arrested, stating it's not his place to provide legal analysis but that Newsom should be "tarred and feathered" for obstructing federal law. Johnson asserted Trump's authority to send Marines and National Guardsmen to Los Angeles to maintain order during immigration protests. He expressed support for Trump's actions, emphasizing the need to enforce immigration law. Johnson urged Newsom to focus on governing and upholding the rule of law instead of rebranding efforts. Optimism here is rather low because of the contentious nature of the political debate and the underlying social unrest. </p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to restore public confidence in vaccine science. Kennedy claims the panel has been plagued by conflicts of interest and has become a rubber stamp for vaccines. This move follows Kennedy's earlier decisions to stop recommending routine COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women and to cancel programs intended to discover new vaccines. The overhaul has raised concerns among medical experts about the potential undermining of vaccinations in the U.S. The replacement of the committee members and the future of vaccine recommendations are uncertain. The optimism is low because of the potential impact on public health and the controversy surrounding the decision. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government announced a £14.2 billion investment in the Sizewell C nuclear power plant project, with Prime Minister Starmer emphasizing that it is not a "blank cheque." The project aims to create 10,000 jobs over the next decade and enhance the country's energy security, potentially lowering energy bills. However, the project faces opposition due to potential costs and environmental impacts, with completion expected in the mid-2030s. Critics argue that the government has not been transparent about the total cost, while supporters highlight the need for energy independence. The government is hoping that this public investment will attract additional private funding to help complete the project. Optimism is moderate given the long-term nature of the project and the ongoing debates surrounding its viability. </p>

          <p>More than 300 Foreign Office staff who expressed concerns about the UK's approach to Israel's actions in Gaza were told that they could consider resigning if they profoundly disagreed with government policy. The staff questioned the UK's continued arms sales and perceived disregard for international law by Israel. Senior civil servants responded by emphasizing the need for civil servants to deliver government policies wholeheartedly and that resignation was an "honourable course" for those with deep disagreements. The response has been met with frustration, with some officials feeling that the space for challenging policy is being shut down. The optimism score is low due to the suppression of dissent and the ethical concerns raised by the staff. </p>

This initiative is part of Meta's broader efforts to gain a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving AI landscape, with the company planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure this year.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that unprecedented wealth concentration in the U.S. is distorting democracy and exacerbating societal tensions, citing Elon Musk as an example of unchecked power. It highlights that just 800 families in the U.S. hold nearly $7 trillion, exceeding the wealth of the bottom half of the population. The author proposes a wealth tax on the ultra-wealthy, such as the "Five & Dime tax," to break up this concentration and generate revenue for public investments. The author believes that taxing billionaires could transform American society and grow the economy by discouraging unproductive financial behaviors and promoting fair competition. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting hope for policy changes to address wealth inequality.  (not investment advice)</p>

They allegedly used economic, sexual, and psychological abuse to force members into sexual acts they found uncomfortable, promising "freedom" and "enlightenment." Witnesses testified they were coerced into becoming handlers for an investor, performing demeaning sex acts at his direction.

          <p>UK companies are holding back on hiring, leading to a decline in job vacancies. The number of available jobs fell by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate ticked higher. This trend is attributed to rising employment costs, including increased National Insurance contributions and a rise in the minimum wage. Economists expect the unemployment rate to continue rising. The optimism score is low due to the weakening labor market and the potential for further job losses.  (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration will appeal a court order requiring it to allow hundreds of noncitizens deported to El Salvador to challenge their detentions. The administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged migrant gang members, arguing that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is a "hybrid criminal state" invading the United States.
