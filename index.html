          <p>A military official confirmed that a limited contingent of National Guard members, fewer than 50, would be armed in Washington D.C. starting Sunday night, marking an escalation in President Trump's law enforcement crackdown. This directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reverses an earlier stance that troops would remain unarmed, with nearly 2,000 Guard members already deployed in the city. The move aims to address what Trump describes as an "epidemic of crime," though local data indicates a consistent decline in violent crime over the past year and a half. These armed personnel will operate under strict Rules for the Use of Force, permitting weapons only as a last resort in response to imminent threats of death or serious bodily harm, primarily supporting landmark protection and crowd management.</p>

          <p>France has formally summoned U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner following his letter to President Emmanuel Macron, which alleged France was not doing enough to combat a surge in antisemitism. The French foreign ministry strongly refuted these "unacceptable" accusations, asserting they violate international law and undermine the transatlantic partnership. This diplomatic incident comes shortly after Macron rejected similar criticisms from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding France's plan to recognize a Palestinian state, further highlighting international disagreements. The broader context includes existing U.S.-France tensions over trade tariffs and the future of U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon, indicating complex diplomatic challenges between the allies.</p>

          <p>Chinese property developer Evergrande has been delisted from the Hong Kong stock market, marking a significant milestone in its spectacular collapse from a $50 billion valuation. Once China's largest real estate firm, it accumulated over $300 billion in debt, leading to a liquidation order in January 2024 after failing to present a viable debt restructuring plan. The company's downfall, exacerbated by Beijing's 2020 rules on developer borrowing, has severely impacted China's economy, contributing to weak consumer spending and massive layoffs in the property sector. Experts believe the delisting is final, with the property crisis expected to continue for at least two more years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two young brothers, a 10-year-old and a toddler, who vanished from their Los Angeles foster home early Thursday morning, have been safely located. The Los Angeles Police Department confirmed their recovery on Sunday, stating both children were in good health, bringing significant relief after an Amber Alert was issued due to concerns for their imminent danger. Police had suspected they were taken by their biological mother, Jackeline Hernandez-Torres, following reports from foster parents who heard a door opening around 1:30 a.m. The successful resolution highlights the critical role of community vigilance and coordinated law enforcement efforts in ensuring child safety.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-24 20:39:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scotland's A9, the 113-mile trunk road connecting Inverness and Perth, has been the site of 48 fatal crashes over the past decade, including a tragic incident in 2022 that claimed three members of a U.S. family. The road's design, which frequently switches between single and dual carriageways, is cited as a major factor, prompting dangerous driving behaviors. A government commitment to dual the entire route by 2025 has been postponed until 2035, drawing criticism from campaigners who emphasize the ongoing risk to lives. While interim safety measures have been implemented, the significant delay in infrastructure improvement continues to fuel public concern and grief.</p>

          <p>Selena Gomez's fiancé, music producer Benny Blanco, sparked considerable online outrage after a TikTok video featured him boasting about a $200 box of exceptionally large blueberries.

Fox News, currently facing a defamation suit from Smartmatic, is seeking records suggesting LA County's registrar-recorder, Dean Logan, received undeclared gifts from the company.

          <p>Mississippi has declared a public health emergency due to its infant mortality rate rising to 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024, nearly double the national average and its highest in over a decade. Black infants are disproportionately affected, dying at more than twice the rate of White infants. Leading causes include congenital malformations, premature birth, and SIDS. The state's plan includes expanding prenatal services, regionalizing obstetric care, and strengthening community health programs, but experts caution that structural inequities like poverty and lack of healthcare access, compounded by federal funding cuts to programs like PRAMS, are key drivers that individual interventions alone cannot solve.</p>

Although the Biden administration has rescinded some Trump-era restrictions, the legal framework remains challenging for these individuals.

This move follows Trump's deployment of armed Guard members in Washington D.C. and earlier in Los Angeles, drawing fierce criticism from Democrats who label it an "abuse of power." Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson condemned the plan as "the most flagrant violation of our constitution in the 21st century," noting significant drops in the city's crime rates. The controversy underscores a pattern of Trump's domestic military deployments targeting Democratic-led cities, despite contradicting crime statistics, and sparking legal and political challenges.</p>

          <p>Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse has been abruptly ousted as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), with Deputy Director Christine Bordine stepping in as acting director. While no official reason was provided to Congress, the removal follows the DIA's assessment that military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities only delayed Tehran's program by months, a finding that contradicted President Trump's assertion of complete obliteration. Senator Mark Warner criticized the firing as indicative of the Trump administration's "dangerous habit" of prioritizing loyalty over objective intelligence. This incident is part of a recent pattern of senior military official removals, fueling concerns about the politicization of intelligence within the defense establishment.</p>

          <p>A homeowner's association (HOA) issued a warning to a resident for charging a Tesla in their driveway with the vehicle's standard Level 1 cable, not due to safety concerns but because the "electrical chords running along the ground" were considered unsightly. The HOA referenced National Electrical Code (NEC) 625, but experts and online commenters quickly clarified that NEC 625 does not prohibit standard Level 1 charging when equipment is used as intended. This incident underscores the prevalent perception of HOAs' micromanagement tendencies and prompts questions about their interpretative authority over regulations, often prioritizing aesthetic uniformity over practical homeowner requirements and rights.</p>

This incident represents the first new human case in the U.S. this year of the parasite, which is fatal if left untreated and poses a devastating threat to livestock. Concerns are mounting over the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's lack of transparency regarding the case, as well as the potential economic impact on the already tight U.S. cattle market. The USDA is planning a new sterile fly facility in Texas, aiming to replicate the successful eradication of screwworms from the U.S. in the 1960s.</p>

          <p>A fiery multi-vehicle crash on Interstate 15 in Temecula tragically killed four people when a BMW M4, driven recklessly, veered over the concrete median into oncoming southbound traffic. The BMW collided with a Nissan Sentra and immediately burst into flames, resulting in the deaths of all three passengers in the BMW—a 23-year-old woman, a 14-year-old boy, and a 15-year-old girl—and the 35-year-old driver of the Sentra. The 25-year-old BMW driver survived with major injuries, pulled from the wreckage by Good Samaritans. Alcohol is not considered a factor, but charges against the BMW driver are pending as authorities investigate the devastating incident.</p>
