          <p>South Korea is holding a snap presidential election following the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol. The two main candidates are Lee Jae-myung from the liberal Democratic Party, who leads in the polls despite facing ongoing corruption investigations, and Kim Moon-soo from the conservative People Power Party, who is trailing behind. Lee Jae-myung is a former mayor, governor, and lawmaker, while Kim Moon-soo previously served as a governor and a member of the National Assembly, attempting to distance himself from the ousted president Yoon. The Democratic Party already holds a parliamentary majority, adding significance to this election amid political turmoil.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to close eight U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offices in California, following pressure from Democratic lawmakers. These lawmakers argued that the closures would negatively impact farmers who rely on these offices for essential services like loans, grants, and technical assistance. The initial plan to close the offices was part of a broader effort to cut costs across government agencies, but the reversal reflects the importance of these services to California's large agricultural sector. The USDA will continue discussions regarding the Mt. Shasta office, the only one not being reopened, to determine if its services can be provided elsewhere.</p>

          <h2>Economists Warn Budget Bill Would Increase Debt and Inequality</h2>

          <p>Six Nobel laureate economists have criticized a budget bill passed by the House and supported by President Trump, stating it would weaken safety-net programs while significantly increasing the federal debt. The economists argue that the bill, dubbed the "one big beautiful bill," would harm millions by cutting Medicaid and food stamps, while also leading to a $3 trillion increase in public debt. They also claim that the tax cuts included in the legislation, combined with the cuts to social programs, would exacerbate income inequality (not investment advice). The Senate is expected to consider the bill amid opposition from Democrats and some Republicans.</p>

          <p>Credit card interest rates are unlikely to decrease in June due to the Federal Reserve's pause on interest rate cuts and persistent economic uncertainty. The average credit card interest rate remains high, hovering around 22%, exacerbating debt burdens for consumers. Despite potential future rate cuts, their impact on credit card rates is expected to be muted, influenced by factors beyond the Federal Reserve.

          <p>Human remains have been discovered in Derby as part of a murder inquiry following the disappearance of Izabela Helena Zablocka, who was last seen 15 years ago. Derbyshire Police launched an investigation after receiving a missing persons report in May, leading to a search of an address in Princes Street. The remains were found in the garden, and police believe they belong to Ms. Zablocka, who moved to the UK from Poland in 2009. Four people have been arrested in connection with the case, and detectives are seeking information about Ms. Zablocka's life and activities before her disappearance.</p>
