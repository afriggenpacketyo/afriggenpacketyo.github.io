          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced its second air traffic control outage in two weeks, causing significant flight delays and cancellations. The FAA confirmed the 90-second telecommunications outage impacted communications and radar display at the Philadelphia TRACON Area C. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to overhaul the U.S. air traffic control system, but upgrades could take up to four years with congressional funding. United Airlines is limiting flights to and from Newark due to the ongoing issues, with the CEO stating the airport cannot handle the scheduled number of planes. Travelers expressed frustration over the growing delays and cancellations.</p>

          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending habeas corpus for migrants, which would curtail the constitutional right to challenge detention in court. Miller justified this potential suspension by claiming the U.S. faces a national security threat from undocumented migrants "invading" the country. Legal experts argue that a president cannot suspend habeas corpus without authorization from Congress, citing historical precedents like Abraham Lincoln seeking congressional approval during the Civil War. The Constitution allows for the suspension of habeas corpus in extraordinary circumstances such as an invasion or rebellion when it would be necessary to protect public safety.</p>

The Menendez brothers were convicted of killing their parents in 1990, claiming years of sexual assault by their father and complicity by their mother. District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposes resentencing, arguing the brothers haven't shown ‚Äúfull insight‚Äù into their crimes, while their lawyers sought to have the district attorney's office recused from the case.</p>

Some Democrats welcome Biden's return, advocating for him to defend his accomplishments, while others believe he should remain out of the spotlight to allow new leaders to emerge. Critics argue that Biden's focus on past campaigns is stagnating the party and that he should follow the example of other former presidents by focusing on his presidential library and foundation. Despite differing views, many Democrats agree that Biden should play some role in the party's future.</p>

          <p>Cities are using local laws to thwart the reopening of immigrant detention centers, focusing on zoning and permitting regulations. The city of Leavenworth, Kansas, is challenging CoreCivic's plan to reopen a former prison as an immigration detention center, arguing the company needs to follow a formal process with public input. Newark, New Jersey, is suing GEO Group over access and inspection rights at the Delaney Hall facility. Advocates and former prison employees raise concerns about the pace of ICE's detention expansion plans and potential violations of local laws.</p>

          <p>Fifteen states, largely Democratic, are suing the Trump administration over efforts to fast-track energy projects, claiming the administration is bypassing environmental protection laws. The lawsuit alleges that agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Interior are circumventing required reviews under federal laws like the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act. The states argue the permitting process will harm natural and historic resources. The White House defends the actions, stating the president has the authority to determine what constitutes a national emergency.</p>

Guardiola has led City to six Premier League titles since joining the club in 2016, while he also won both La Liga and the Bundesliga three times apiece with Barcelona and Bayern Munich respectively. Guardiola has had to contend with a lengthy injury list, contributing to City relinquishing their four-year hold on the top-flight trophy, and they were also knocked out of the Champions League at the play-off phase. City can end a disappointing season on a high by finishing in the top five, as well as having an FA Cup final to play for against Crystal Palace on Saturday 16 May.</p>
