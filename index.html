        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates are showing little movement despite economic uncertainty and overseas conflicts, remaining in a narrow range around 7% since early April. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased slightly to 6.88% last week. This lack of fluctuation has not incentivized homebuyers, who continue to face high house prices and limited inventory. Applications for mortgages to purchase homes decreased slightly, though they are up 11% from a year ago, and the average loan size for purchase applications has declined to the lowest level since January.

          <p>This article examines the claim that NATO expansion drove Russia to war in Ukraine, a justification frequently used by the Kremlin. While Russia views NATO's eastward expansion as a threat to its national security, NATO insists it is a defensive alliance. The article explores historical context, including alleged promises made to the Soviet Union regarding NATO expansion, and analyzes differing interpretations of these events. Experts debate whether NATO's actions, or lack thereof, contributed to the current conflict, but all agree that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is unjustifiable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British pound has reached its highest level in over three years, currently trading around $1.36, but analysts disagree on whether it will continue to rise. Much of the pound's recent strength is attributed to a weakening U.S. dollar, rather than inherent strength in the British currency, as evidenced by its depreciation against the euro. The pound's recovery follows a period of extreme lows after the 2022 mini-budget crisis, but it remains uncertain if it can sustain its gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump asserted that U.S.-Israeli strikes had "totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear program, contradicting an early Pentagon analysis suggesting limited damage. The article details Trump's remarks alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, where he insisted Iran's program had been set back "basically decades." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio supported Trump's assessment, while Democratic senators called for answers and a return to negotiations. Despite continued exchanges, Trump expressed optimism about future U.S.-Iranian relations, likening the strikes to the atomic bombings of Japan.</p>

Kokubun's suspension stems from behavior considered sexual harassment, though details remain undisclosed.

Ryanair argued the aid discriminated against other airlines, but the court found no evidence of this.

          <p>Republican lawmakers in Congress are considering substantial Medicaid cuts as part of a budget bill that could leave millions without health insurance. The proposed legislation would reduce Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years, resulting in 10.3 million fewer enrollees by 2034. An analysis suggests that these coverage losses could lead to thousands of additional deaths annually, along with reduced access to preventive care. Even with potential modifications in the Senate, the bill's work requirements and financing limitations are expected to negatively impact Americans' health.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Europe experienced a fifth consecutive month of decline in May, with a nearly 28% year-on-year drop, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. This decline is attributed to a shift among European consumers towards cheaper Chinese electric vehicles. Tesla's market share in Europe also decreased from 1.8% to 1.2% during the same period. Factors contributing to this trend include brand damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's political activities and increasing competition from traditional automakers and Chinese EV manufacturers.</p>

The high-speed rail operator is advising passengers to cancel or postpone their trips, with cancellations and delays affecting routes serving London, Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam. The initial closures were caused by the deaths on the LGV Nord high-speed line, while the cable theft near Lille has further compounded the delays.</p>

          <p>A U.S.-brokered cease-fire has brought a tentative end to the recent conflict between Iran and Israel, though without a formal agreement between the two nations. While Israel demonstrated its intelligence capabilities by targeting Iranian military leaders and nuclear scientists, it failed to destroy Iran's nuclear program. Iran, despite suffering damage and humiliation, proved resilient, though the war has exposed vulnerabilities within the regime. The cease-fire may lead to renewed talks on limiting Iran's nuclear program, but hard-liners within Iran continue to advocate for rejectionism.</p>

          <p>A tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Iran has slightly reduced the threat of further U.S. involvement in an international conflict, but concerns remain about potential domestic repercussions. Experts worry that moments of anxiety and fear can provide fertile ground for authoritarians to increase domestic power, potentially eroding civil rights. The Trump administration's immigration policies and the deployment of federal troops in Los Angeles highlight the intersection of international and domestic policy. The situation raises concerns about the potential for increased government control and the targeting of specific communities.</p>

          <p>Residents of Southern California, particularly Latinos, are expressing heightened fear due to recent immigration raids. The Department of Homeland Security denies racial profiling, but concerns persist that darker-skinned individuals are more likely to be targeted. Latino parents are warning their children to be cautious, and some are carrying their passports as a precaution. The raids have underscored the impact of skin color on daily life for Latinos, adding another layer of anxiety amid President Trump's immigration crackdown.</p>
