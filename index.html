        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's core inflation for August eased to 0.3%, its lowest level since February 2021 and below economists' expectations, primarily due to a decrease in services costs like holiday expenses and airfares. Headline inflation also fell slightly to 0.5%, with the main upward pressure coming from rising car prices. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has maintained its full-year inflation forecast, suggesting that disinflationary pressures from weaker global demand will likely offset potential impacts from ongoing trade conflicts. The nation is also bracing for slower economic growth in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, President Donald Trump signed an executive order designating the left-wing Antifa movement as a domestic terrorist organization. The order cites a "pattern of political violence" and directs federal agencies to investigate and dismantle the group, which it describes as a "militarist, anarchist enterprise." While the administration has linked the action to rhetoric surrounding Kirk's death, critics and legal experts express concern over the lack of legal precedent for such a domestic designation and warn it could be used to curb free speech and target political opponents.</p>

          <p>The third week of the NFL season delivered a series of dramatic finishes, with five games decided on the final play, often by kickers and backup quarterbacks. The Cleveland Browns secured a major upset over the Green Bay Packers with a walk-off field goal, while the Philadelphia Eagles staged their largest home comeback since 1988 against the Los Angeles Rams, blocking a game-winning field goal attempt and returning it for a touchdown to remain undefeated. Other notable results included the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Indianapolis Colts also moving to a 3-0 start with last-minute victories, highlighting a weekend of unpredictable outcomes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The main airports in Copenhagen, Denmark, and Oslo, Norway, were forced to suspend all flights for approximately four hours on Monday night due to multiple drone sightings. Danish police stated the drones were likely operated by a "capable operator" but found no indication of malicious intent, though the armed forces were activated as a precaution. The disruption impacted around 20,000 passengers in Copenhagen alone, with at least 35 flights being diverted. While authorities have not confirmed the origin of the drones, the incident has heightened security concerns regarding unauthorized activity in critical European airspace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Writing in response to recent comments from U.S. President Donald Trump linking paracetamol to autism, Australian pediatrician Mike Freelander emphasizes that the medication is safe for use during pregnancy. He argues there is no scientific evidence of causation and points to large-scale studies that have disproved a causative link, despite some noted associations. Dr. Freelander warns that such unscientific claims from political figures cause significant distress and can lead to poor health outcomes if pregnant individuals avoid necessary medication for safer, but less effective, alternatives.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation has highlighted the industrial scale of unauthorized ticket reselling for Premier League football matches, leaving many fans out of pocket. The report followed a fan from South Korea who paid £900 for a ticket to a Brighton vs. Tottenham match, only to be denied entry because the ticket was illegitimate. Brighton & Hove Albion is now using new technology to combat the black market, blocking hundreds of touted tickets for that single match and cancelling season tickets of identified touts. The Premier League is also introducing new encrypted digital barcodes to make unauthorized reselling more difficult for operators.</p>

          <p>During a visit to China, U.S. Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, warned that a lack of regular communication between the American and Chinese militaries is dangerous. He stressed that as China's military strength and nuclear arsenal grow, greater engagement is necessary to prevent miscalculations and misunderstandings that could lead to conflict. Smith stated that while China's desire for a strong military is logical, its new status as a major military power requires more dialogue with other large militaries for basic deconfliction, especially given rapid advancements in AI and cyberspace.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis suggests that modern football coaching is increasingly embracing tactics once championed, and often criticized, by manager Sam Allardyce. Strategies such as a more direct, long-ball style of play, a focus on set-pieces, and the use of a large center-forward are becoming more common in the Premier League. The article notes that even analytical approaches, like a coach watching from the stands for a better tactical overview, were pioneered by Allardyce decades ago. Allardyce himself comments that he was "ahead of the game" and that the sport is now seeing the statistical benefits of these pragmatic approaches.</p>

Harris also reveals that her first choice for a running mate was Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and describes her vetting process for other candidates, including Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.

With the transatlantic relationship unmoored, particularly under a potential Trump administration, Europe's traditional policy of aligning with Washington on China is no longer viable. The author contends that Europe must now define its own stance on critical issues like trade, technology, and security, especially concerning the war in Ukraine, where China's implicit support for Russia poses a direct challenge to European interests. The piece concludes that Europe cannot afford to confront Russia while also being in China's crosshairs without a reliable U.S. ally.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have announced that U.S. doctors will soon be advised against prescribing Tylenol (paracetamol) to pregnant women, citing a disputed link to autism. Trump claimed the drug "is no good" and should only be used for extreme fevers during pregnancy. This announcement has been met with significant pushback from medical experts and professional groups, who state there is no conclusive scientific evidence of a causal relationship and that Tylenol remains one of the only safe pain relievers for pregnant women. Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, strongly disagreed with the administration's claims.</p>

          <h2>Political Analyst Critiques Stephen Miller's Eulogy for Charlie Kirk</h2>

          <p>This opinion article analyzes a eulogy delivered by White House adviser Stephen Miller for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, describing it as a purely ideological and divisive speech. The author argues that Miller's rhetoric framed the political landscape as a battle of pure good versus pure evil, depicting opponents as worthless and destined for destruction. The piece contrasts Miller's confrontational tone with Barack Obama's eulogy after the 2015 Charleston church shooting, which focused on forgiveness and reconciliation. The author concludes that Miller's speech used the tragedy as a pretext to escalate a state-sponsored war on the administration's perceived political foes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new ITV drama series titled "The Hack" will explore the phone hacking scandal that rocked the British media, starring David Tennant as the investigative journalist who exposed the practice. Writer Jack Thorne, known for "Mr Bates vs The Post Office," praised the real-life journalists whose work uncovered a troubling relationship between the press, politics, and the police. Thorne noted that unlike the Post Office scandal, which gained widespread attention only after being dramatized, the phone hacking story is a celebration of journalism successfully holding its own industry to account. The series will tell the story from both journalistic and police perspectives.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed: China's Rejection of Modified Nvidia Chips Signals Push for Tech Independence</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that China's decision to halt purchases of Nvidia's stripped-down B40-series AI chips represents a major turning point in global technology politics. The author contends that by rejecting the less powerful chips offered as an alternative to those banned by U.S. restrictions, Beijing is refusing to accept a position of dictated technological inferiority. The move signals a strategic shift from reliance on global supply chains to an unavoidable national push for indigenous innovation and self-sufficiency. This rejection demonstrates that what was once a debate about the desirability of tech independence has now become a national necessity for China.</p>

          <p>France has officially recognized a Palestinian state, with President Emmanuel Macron declaring at the United Nations that "the time for peace has come." This move is part of a growing wave of recognition from Western nations, including the UK, Canada, and Australia, aimed at advancing a two-state solution. The announcement increases international pressure on Israel regarding the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and settlement activities. Israel has condemned the recognitions, arguing they reward Hamas for its October 7th attack. The United States did not attend a French-hosted summit focused on the two-state solution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's announcement linking Tylenol to autism, arguing it showcases a disregard for the scientific process in favor of sensational, unproven conclusions. The author notes that Trump pushed ahead with his claims based on a handful of disputed studies while ignoring larger, more robust research that found no connection. The piece highlights that the president's rhetoric, including his advice to "fight like hell" to avoid the drug, goes beyond that of his own health officials. This approach to public health, based on personal feeling rather than consensus evidence, is presented as a concerning departure from established norms.</p>

          <p>New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has agreed to participate in a televised town hall after previously withdrawing in protest of ABC's suspension of host Jimmy Kimmel. Mamdani had initially pulled out to stand against what he called corporate cowardice in the face of government pressure on free speech. Following Disney's announcement that Kimmel's show would be reinstated, Mamdani reversed his decision. The incident became a notable event in the mayoral race, where Mamdani holds a significant lead in polls against opponents including former Governor Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Eric Adams, who are both running as independents.</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old boy in Sacramento County, California, was taken into custody after allegedly stealing his parents' truck and leading sheriff's deputies on a high-speed chase. The pursuit began after the boy reportedly took the vehicle to his former school, knocked over traffic cones, and then fled from authorities. Speeds reached up to 70 mph before the chase ended with the boy crashing the truck into a patrol car and another parked vehicle. No injuries were reported, and the minor was booked on several charges, including vehicle theft and assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer.</p>

          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air on Tuesday, ending a suspension that followed the host's jokes about the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. The suspension, which came after the FCC threatened to revoke ABC's broadcast licenses, ignited a nationwide debate over free speech and censorship, drawing criticism from media figures and civil liberties groups. In its statement, Disney said the decision was reached after "thoughtful conversations" with Kimmel. However, Sinclair, a major ABC affiliate group, stated it would replace the show with news programming and is still evaluating its potential return.</p>
