        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than 100 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to reject the government's welfare reform bill, which aims to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments. The MPs cite concerns about the number of people the plans are expected to push into poverty, a lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessment. Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden insists on the need for reform, noting the projected doubling of people on long-term sickness and disability benefits by the end of the decade. The success of the amendment could inflict a parliamentary defeat on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer if all opposition parties oppose the plans.</p>

          <p>German lawmakers are set to vote on a budget that sharply increases public spending, enabled by easing the country's debt brake. The plan calls for new debts to fund record investments in defense and infrastructure projects. The defense budget is expected to more than double by 2029, reaching â‚¬152.8 billion amid security concerns due to the Russia-Ukraine war and pressure from the US to increase military spending. Net borrowing is projected to rise significantly, jumping to â‚¬81.8 billion in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republicans are proposing a tax deduction of up to $10,000 on annual interest for new auto loans, but the structure of the bill means few households would receive a substantial financial benefit. To fully utilize the deduction, a loan of approximately $112,000 would be required, translating to a vehicle purchase price of around $130,000. These loans are typically associated with luxury vehicles such as Rolls-Royce, Ferrari, and Porsche. The tax break's value is also reduced for individuals earning over $100,000 annually or married couples earning over $200,000, and qualifying cars must be assembled in the U.S.</p>
