          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, is moving northward in the Atlantic Ocean, creating a significant threat of dangerous rip currents along the U.S. East Coast. While the hurricane is not projected to make landfall, its large size is prompting warnings and evacuation orders for coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks, which face potential flooding. The National Hurricane Center has issued tropical storm warnings and storm surge warnings for the region, urging residents and visitors to exercise extreme caution. The dangerous surf conditions are expected to affect beaches from Florida to New England for several days.</p>

          <p>A Yosemite National Park ranger, Shannon "SJ" Joslin, has been terminated from their position after participating in hanging a transgender pride flag from the El Capitan rock formation. Joslin stated the act was done on their own time as a private citizen to celebrate their identity and that the flag was displayed for only two hours. The National Park Service cited "failing to demonstrate acceptable conduct" as the reason for dismissal and noted that several employees are facing administrative action for violating regulations on demonstrations. The incident has sparked a debate over free speech rights on public lands, as regulations require permits for such displays in non-designated areas.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement officials have revealed new, disturbing details in the case of Travis Decker, a father accused of killing his three young daughters in Chelan County, Washington. DNA analysis confirmed Decker's DNA was present on the plastic bags and cable ties found with the bodies of Paityn, 9, Evelyn, 8, and Olivia, 5. This evidence reinforces the police's belief that he is the sole suspect in their deaths, which were determined to be caused by suffocation. Despite the new evidence, Decker's whereabouts remain unknown nearly three months into the search, and authorities are continuing to ask for public assistance in locating him.</p>

          <p>Julio César Chávez Jr., the son of the legendary Mexican boxer, has been deported from the United States and is now in Mexican custody. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested him in July for making fraudulent statements on his permanent residency application. In Mexico, Chávez faces serious charges, including organized crime affiliation and arms trafficking, with U.S. authorities having previously labeled him an "affiliate" of the Sinaloa cartel. His career has been consistently overshadowed by personal struggles, including substance abuse and legal issues, which have prevented him from reaching the heights of his famous father.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's commemoration of its victory against Japanese aggression during World War II is about remembering historical truth, not inciting hatred against modern Japan. The author contends that it is possible to condemn the brutality of the wartime military while simultaneously appreciating contemporary Japanese culture, citing their own childhood filled with Japanese pop culture like manga and anime. The piece suggests that these historical remembrances serve as a necessary reflection on the sacrifices made for peace. It pushes back against critics who view these commemorations as a tool for cultivating ongoing hostility between the two nations.</p>

          <p>A High Court judgment has granted a temporary injunction preventing the UK Home Office from housing asylum seekers at a hotel in Epping, creating both practical and political difficulties for the government. The ruling forces the government to find alternative accommodations for asylum seekers and could set a precedent for other local councils to launch similar legal challenges. The decision has been praised by opposition figures like Nigel Farage, potentially encouraging more local protests and increasing pressure on the government's immigration policies. This legal and political headache complicates the government's pledge to stop using hotels for asylum seekers by the end of the current parliament.</p>

Crews are using helicopters to drop water on the flames, as falling debris makes it too dangerous for climbers to engage the fire directly. The cause of the fire is under investigation, but officials note that the ancient tree's height makes it a natural target for lightning strikes.</p>

This move is intended to close loopholes and prevent circumvention of the original tariffs, further supporting domestic steel and aluminum industries.

          <p>Federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department over allegations of systematically manipulating crime statistics. The probe by the U.S. attorney's office is examining whether police officials intentionally misclassified crimes to make the city appear safer than it is. The investigation reportedly began after a police commander was suspended for altering data, but it has since expanded to include multiple officials. The police union has supported the claims, stating that there was a directive from command staff to keep crime stats down, directly contradicting official reports of falling violent crime rates.</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Dunkin' are increasingly relying on new and customized beverage offerings to boost sales, particularly among Gen Z consumers. Data shows a significant increase in the variety of drinks on menus, with a strong emphasis on cold, flavorful, and customizable options. Consumers are now more frequently visiting these establishments specifically for a "pick-me-up" beverage rather than as an add-on to a meal. This trend has led to a wave of innovation, from protein-infused cold foams to "dirty sodas," as companies compete to capture this profitable and growing segment of the market.

          <p>The Kremlin has downplayed the likelihood of an imminent summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, despite President Trump's recent diplomatic push. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated that any such meeting would require gradual and extensive preparation, suggesting a longer timeline than what was implied by the White House. This cautious response from Moscow comes as Trump acknowledged that Putin might not genuinely want a deal to end the war. The differing stances highlight the significant diplomatic gap that still exists between the involved parties, casting uncertainty on the immediate future of the peace process.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak has publicly stated that his relationship with the club is untenable due to "broken promises," as he seeks a transfer this summer. In a social media post, Isak claimed the club had long known his position and that he believed he would be allowed to leave if a suitable offer from a large club was made. This statement comes after Newcastle rejected a £110m bid from Liverpool for the Swedish international. The standoff puts Newcastle in a difficult position, as they now must decide whether to sell their star player or attempt to reintegrate a disgruntled Isak back into the team.</p>

          <p>General David Allvin, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, has announced he will retire in November, just two years into his four-year term. Allvin did not provide a specific reason for his early departure in the official statement released by the Air Force.

A source familiar with the situation characterized the retirement as a mutual decision between General Allvin and the Secretary of the Air Force, Troy Meink.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced that it will expand its vetting process for immigration applicants to include screening for "anti-American" and "anti-Semitic" ideologies, including by reviewing social media activity. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services stated that immigration benefits are a "privilege, not a right" and should not be granted to individuals who "despise the country." This policy builds on previous measures targeting international students and others deemed to have views contrary to U.S. foreign policy interests. The move raises concerns about free speech and the subjective nature of what constitutes "anti-Americanism" in immigration decisions.</p>

The Trump administration had previously halted the sale of advanced AI chips to China over national security concerns. Nvidia confirmed it is evaluating various products to remain competitive within the bounds set by government regulations, emphasizing that all offerings are designed for commercial use.

While the detected levels were below the FDA's threshold for acute health hazards, the agency noted that repeated low-dose exposure could elevate cancer risk over time.
