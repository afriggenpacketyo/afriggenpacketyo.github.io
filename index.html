            <p>A US judge indicated he might hold the Trump administration in contempt of court for ignoring his order to halt deportation flights to El Salvador.  The administration used a 227-year-old law to justify the mass deportations, escalating the conflict between the White House and the judiciary.  The judge offered the administration a chance to avoid contempt charges by explaining their actions and complying with the order.
