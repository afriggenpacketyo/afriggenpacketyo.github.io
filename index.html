          <p>Approximately 700 active-duty Marines have been deployed to the Los Angeles area to assist the National Guard in responding to protests against federal immigration enforcement. California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the deployment of troops onto city streets, arguing it causes irreparable damage to the city and its residents. The Marines are intended to protect federal personnel and property, and have been trained in de-escalation and crowd control, although they lack arrest authority. Local officials, including Senator Alex Padilla, have criticized the deployment, arguing it escalates the situation and is counterproductive.</p>

          <p>Argentina's highest court has upheld the corruption conviction of former President Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner, sentencing her to six years in prison and barring her from holding public office. The conviction stems from her involvement in steering public works contracts to a close friend's construction company during her presidency from 2007 to 2015. Kirchner, who served as vice president from 2019 to 2023, has denounced the ruling as politically motivated and an attempt to silence her. Due to her age, Kirchner is likely to serve her sentence under house arrest, as permitted by Argentine law.</p>

Homes and businesses were attacked, leading to condemnation from political figures and a call for reflection from law enforcement. Two teenagers have already appeared in court charged with sexual assault, and a third man was unconditionally released.</p>

The panel argues that preventing the Chagossian people from returning to Diego Garcia infringes upon their cultural rights.
