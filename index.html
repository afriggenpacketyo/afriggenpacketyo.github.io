          <p>Ten car manufacturers and two industry groups were fined nearly Â£78 million by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for concealing vehicle recycling information from consumers.  The CMA found that these companies colluded to withhold data on the recyclability of their vehicles and the percentage of recycled materials used in manufacturing. This deceptive practice deprived customers of crucial information needed to make informed purchasing decisions, highlighting a failure of transparency within the automotive industry.</p>
