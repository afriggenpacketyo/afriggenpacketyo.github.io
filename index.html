          <p>The New York Liberty have announced they will not be renewing the contract of head coach Sandy Brondello, just one season after she led the team to its first-ever WNBA championship. The decision comes after the reigning champions were unexpectedly eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Phoenix Mercury. In a statement, the team's general manager thanked Brondello for her historic contributions, while Brondello expressed that winning the championship for New York will always be an amazing feeling. The move surprised some, including star player Breanna Stewart, who had strongly defended her coach against questions about her future.</p>

          <p>Icelandic artist Björk's 2015 album 'Vulnicura,' which chronicles her emotional journey through a painful breakup, has been remastered as a virtual reality experience. Now available on the Apple Vision Pro, the 'Vulnicura VR' project allows users to navigate an austere Icelandic landscape and interact with visual metaphors representing the artist's heartbreak. Originally conceived for museum installations with clunky technology, the updated version offers enhanced graphics, spatial audio, and intuitive hand-based navigation. The release comes at an inflection point for the VR industry, with some developers seeing stagnation while market forecasts predict significant growth.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from CDC scientists reveals a nearly 70% increase in infections from drug-resistant "nightmare bacteria" in the United States between 2019 and 2023. The surge is primarily driven by bacteria containing the NDM gene, which are resistant to most antibiotics and require expensive, intravenous treatments. Researchers suggest the increase may be linked to higher antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic and warn that many unrecognized carriers could lead to wider community spread. This trend threatens to make common ailments like urinary tract infections far more difficult to treat in the future.</p>

          <p>Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group, two of the largest U.S. broadcast station owners, have announced they will not air "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" despite ABC's decision to return the show to its lineup. The stations preempted the program following host Jimmy Kimmel's comments linking the alleged killer of a conservative activist to the MAGA movement. The situation has drawn comments from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who suggested station licenses could be at risk, raising broader questions about free speech and regulatory pressure on media companies during a period of high political tension.</p>

          <p>In a fiery speech at the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump criticized allies, including Australia, for their moves to recognize a Palestinian state, urging them instead to focus on demanding the release of hostages held by Hamas. He also dismissed international climate change initiatives as a "scam" and a "con job," mocking carbon tracking and renewable energy sources like wind turbines.

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has terminated the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, claiming it was promoting a "divisive feminist agenda." A Pentagon spokesperson stated that the committee's focus was hurting combat readiness and that the department is instead focused on advancing uniform, sex-neutral standards. Established in 1951, the committee was instrumental in recommending changes to laws and policies affecting women in the armed forces, with a majority of its suggestions having been implemented. The move follows a broader review of advisory committees to ensure they align with a "warrior ethos."</p>

Luther Campbell of the rap group 2 Live Crew, who successfully fought obscenity charges in the 1990s, advises Kimmel to fight back against what he sees as a politically motivated attack on free speech. The situation escalated after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr threatened regulatory action against networks airing Kimmel's program, prompting ABC affiliates Nexstar and Sinclair to pull the show.

          <p>A Missouri woman, Lisa Jeanine Findley, has been sentenced to more than four years in federal prison for her role in a sophisticated scheme to fraudulently sell Elvis Presley's iconic Graceland estate. Findley pleaded guilty to mail fraud, admitting to creating a fake company and using forged documents to falsely claim that Presley's late daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, had used Graceland as collateral for a non-existent $3.8 million loan. She then threatened to foreclose on the historic Memphis property. The scheme was halted after Elvis Presley Enterprises and Presley's granddaughter, Riley Keough, took legal action.</p>

          <p>The 2026 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival has sold out all passes for both of its weekends just three days after they went on sale, a significant rebound from slower sales in recent post-pandemic years. The rapid sellout is a positive sign for promoter Goldenvoice, as the festival had previously taken longer to sell out, sometimes having tickets available right up to the event. Headliners for next year's festival include Justin Bieber, Sabrina Carpenter, and Karol G. This strong demand serves as an interesting data point for the concert industry, which has seen other major festivals canceled due to a soft market.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, the strongest storm of the year, has caused two deaths in eastern Taiwan after a mountain lake, swollen by heavy rainfall, burst its banks and flooded a nearby township. The resulting surge of water washed away a bridge and trapped hundreds of residents, prompting a large-scale rescue operation. With wind gusts equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane, the typhoon is now moving towards southern China, where authorities have evacuated 370,000 people in Guangdong province. Hong Kong has also issued high-level warnings, anticipating significant flight disruptions and storm surges as the powerful storm makes landfall.</p>

          <p>During a wide-ranging speech to the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump took a moment to mock the organization's headquarters and recall his own failed bid to manage its renovation years ago. He told the assembly of world leaders that as a real estate developer, he had offered to rebuild the complex for $500 million with superior materials like marble and mahogany. Trump claimed the UN chose a "much more expensive" and inferior option, demonstrating that they "did not know what they were doing when it came to construction." His remarks were part of a broader critique of the UN's effectiveness.</p>

          <p>A new study predicts that Americans will face higher costs to heat their homes this winter, with the average energy bill expected to rise by 7.6% to $976. The increase is driven by soaring electricity and natural gas prices, which have outpaced the overall rate of inflation. According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, households using electricity could see a 10.2% jump in their bills. This follows a costly summer of high air-conditioning use, compounding financial strain and causing a significant increase in the number of households falling behind on their utility payments.

The slowdown was observed across most major metropolitan areas and at all price tiers.

Throughout the speech, Trump made numerous false claims about his accomplishments, attacked allies, promoted conspiracy theories about climate change, and renewed his personal lobbying for a Nobel Peace Prize. Unlike a 2018 speech where diplomats laughed at his boasts, the reaction this time was one of stunned silence and concern. The performance was seen by observers as an encapsulation of a dishonest and arrogant president with a strained relationship with reality.</p>

          <p>President Trump has abruptly canceled a planned meeting with top congressional Democrats that was intended to negotiate a deal to avoid a government shutdown on October 1. The president called off the meeting shortly after Democratic leaders announced it, stating on social media that their funding proposal was "unserious and ridiculous" and that a meeting would not be productive. Democratic leaders accused Trump of throwing a tantrum and running away from his responsibilities, asserting that he will "own the shutdown." With the funding deadline looming, the cancellation significantly raises the probability of an interruption in government services.</p>
