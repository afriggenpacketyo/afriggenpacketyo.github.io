          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-21 23:27:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is creating both opportunities and challenges for central banks worldwide. While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and lower inflation by making imports cheaper, it also complicates export competitiveness and can trigger capital flight. Central banks are cautiously avoiding currency wars, balancing the need to support economic growth with the risks of higher inflation and potential retaliation from the U.S. government. The European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank are examples of institutions adjusting monetary policy in response to these currency dynamics, attempting to manage inflation and maintain export competitiveness.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dropshipping businesses, which rely on sourcing products from China and selling them in the U.S., are experiencing significant revenue decreases due to increased tariffs and stricter border inspections. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, which previously allowed duty-free entry for shipments valued at $800 or less, has further squeezed profit margins. Dropshippers are shifting their focus to European markets and diversifying their supply chains to mitigate the impact of these trade policies. The situation has created pessimism among Chinese small and medium-sized enterprises involved in cross-border e-commerce, with many adopting a wait-and-see approach or exploring alternative markets.</p>

The European Space Agency (ESA) is funding research to assess the feasibility of growing lab-grown food in low gravity and high radiation environments. The goal is to reduce the high costs of sending food to the International Space Station and enable long-term space missions. Researchers are exploring the possibility of creating factories in orbit and on the Moon, potentially using 3D printers to produce customized meals for astronauts.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil's wife, Noor Abdalla, gave birth to their son without him present, as ICE denied his request for temporary release. Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist, is being held in a Louisiana detention facility. Abdalla expressed her disappointment and accused ICE of deliberately causing suffering to their family. Khalil's lawyers had proposed alternatives such as a two-week furlough with an ankle monitor, but the request was denied. Supporters claim Khalil's detention is an attempt to silence voices advocating for Palestinian rights.</p>
