          <p>Residents in Gaza have cautiously welcomed an Israeli plan for a temporary humanitarian pause to allow aid convoys into the besieged territory. While expressing some relief, many fear it is an insufficient, short-term measure for a deepening crisis marked by severe shortages of food, water, and medicine. Gazans, including those with specific dietary needs like celiac disease, emphasize the need for a lasting solution and an end to the war, not just sporadic aid drops.</p>

          <p>Commercial fishermen at Florida's Port Canaveral are increasingly worried about the economic impact of the escalating number of rocket launches from the Space Coast. Groups like the Southeastern Fisheries Association report that launch-related maritime security zones cause lost income, while underwater rocket debris damages expensive fishing nets. They are calling for a compensation program from companies like SpaceX, which plans a significant increase in launches, to cover economic losses and equipment damage for the local seafood industry.

          <p>A new biography by J. Randy Taraborrelli claims that while Jackie Kennedy was aware of her husband's infidelities, she considered his connection to Marilyn Monroe to be uniquely dangerous. The book alleges that the First Lady warned President John F. Kennedy that Monroe "could be trouble," prompting her to skip his 1962 birthday celebration at Madison Square Garden where the actress famously sang. However, the author also presents testimony from Monroe's publicist suggesting that a romantic affair between the president and the actress may not have actually occurred.</p>

          <p>Comedians Jon Stewart, the creators of "South Park," and Stephen Colbert himself have publicly pushed back against Paramount following the announced cancellation of "The Late Show." The pushback came after regulators approved Paramount's merger with Skydance, sparking speculation that the cancellation was politically motivated to appease the Trump administration. Stewart's monologue, a pointed "South Park" episode, and Colbert's own jokes are seen as a defiant stand against potential corporate censorship and an assertion of creative independence.</p>

          <p>An Apple Valley, California mother has experienced an extraordinary coincidence after giving birth to her fourth child on July 7th, the same birth date as her three older children. Nauzhae Drake, 26, welcomed her newborn son Kailowa on the same day as his siblings, who were born on July 7th in 2019, 2021, and 2022 respectively. None of the births were induced, making the shared birthday a statistical marvel that a mathematics professor described as less likely than winning the Powerball lottery 100 times.</p>

She advises visitors to always ask for free tap water ("une carafe d'eau"), learn basic polite phrases in French, and carefully check the bill before paying. While acknowledging that upselling is common, she confirms that more dishonest tactics exist and suggests that if a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.</p>

          <p>Fan Chunli, a 50-year-old woman from rural China, has become a stand-up comedy sensation by telling jokes about her abusive ex-husband and patriarchal norms. Her viral performance has resonated with audiences but has also drawn a warning from at least one provincial government, which cautioned against jokes that "provoke" gender conflict. Fan's background and subject matter are seen as challenging to the Communist Party's promotion of traditional gender roles and its crackdown on feminist discourse.</p>

          <p>Four people have been arrested in Fort White, Florida, on charges of aggravated child abuse after being accused of horrific acts against nine children. Authorities allege the children, aged 7 to 16, were beaten, given non-prescribed medication, and punished by being locked in plywood cages built under bunk beds. The investigation began after a church member reported concerns, revealing that the adopted children in the home were treated particularly unfairly compared to the biological children.</p>

          <p>A senior official in China's Jilin province has reignited a sensitive historical dispute with South Korea by calling for a clearer presentation of ancient kingdoms from a Chinese perspective. The official referred to the kingdoms of Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae by their Chinese names, which arose in an area covering modern-day northeastern China and the Korean peninsula. This contested history has long been a point of friction, as both nations claim historical lineage from these kingdoms, raising the spectre of diplomatic tension.</p>
