          <p>Emma Raducanu revealed that her emotional reaction to winning her first-round match at Eastbourne was due to receiving "some really bad news" prior to the game, which affected her mental presence during the first set. Despite trailing against Ann Li, Raducanu managed to regain control and secure the victory with the support of her coach and Billie Jean King Cup team-mate Fran Jones, who knew about her situation. Raducanu expressed gratitude to the crowd for their support and acknowledged the tough, up-and-down nature of the match, before adding that she found another gear to push through. Raducanu is set to face Maya Joint in the next round as she continues her Wimbledon preparations.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders argues against American involvement in a war with Iran, emphasizing the unconstitutionality of President Trump's attack on Iranian nuclear facilities without congressional approval. Sanders contends that Iran does not pose a military threat to the U.S., citing intelligence assessments, and criticizes Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's influence on U.S. foreign policy. He also condemns Netanyahu's government for its actions against Palestinians and stresses the importance of upholding international law. Sanders concludes by highlighting the financial burden of wars and advocating for investments in domestic priorities rather than unnecessary military interventions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beginner gold investors should consider several key decisions before July, including whether to wait for a price drop, how much to invest, and their portfolio needs. Gold is seen more as an income protector than an income producer, holding steady value during economic turmoil. With the potential for gold prices to surge, investors need a strategic approach, carefully monitoring the market for opportunities. Determining the appropriate investment amount, often around 10% of the portfolio, depends on individual goals and portfolio volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A court in Nantes ruled that the French government bears partial responsibility for the 2016 death of Jean-Rene Auffray, who died after inhaling toxic hydrogen sulfide from rotting algae on a beach in Brittany. The court cited the state's negligence in implementing regulations to protect waters from agricultural pollution, the main cause of green algae proliferation. Brittany is a major agricultural region in France, and excessive use of nitrate fertilizers and runoff from pig farms have led to massive algae bloom. Auffray's widow will receive â‚¬277,343, and his children and brother will also receive compensation.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Social Media Diplomacy During Iran-Israel Conflict</h2>

          <p>President Trump managed the Iran-Israel conflict with a unique approach, using social media to provide real-time commentary that was at times bellicose and at times conciliatory. He announced the U.S. raid on Iranian nuclear sites, suggested regime change in Iran, and demanded lower oil prices via Truth Social. After a ceasefire was announced, Trump warned both countries to respect the agreement, and even after violations, he continued to push for peace. Experts predict challenges to any lasting ceasefire, citing Trump's impulsiveness, but also note a desire for de-escalation among Gulf states.</p>

          <p>A series of events over a 24-hour period, including U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites and Iranian missile attacks on a U.S. air base in Qatar, led to a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. The U.S. mediated the ceasefire, and President Trump announced the agreement on social media. Despite initial violations, the ceasefire appeared to hold after Trump spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. The events highlight the complexities and rapid escalations in the Middle East conflict.</p>

          <p>Florida officials are developing a migrant detention center in the Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," due to its remote location surrounded by wildlife. The facility, located at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, aims to house migrants apprehended in Florida and around the country, with a capacity of 5,000 beds by early July. The project has drawn criticism from environmental organizations and immigration advocates who express concerns about the ecosystem and the well-being of detainees. The project will be funded in large part by FEMA's Shelter and Services Program, with the state potentially spending $450 million for one year.</p>
