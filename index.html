          <p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated that Israel's military actions against Iran are focused on eliminating its nuclear program, not pursuing regime change. Speaking to CNBC, Herzog accused Iran of attempting to rapidly develop nuclear weapons and emphasized the necessity of taking strong measures to address imminent threats. He noted that diplomatic efforts are ongoing through back channels and dialogue with world leaders to de-escalate the situation. Herzog highlighted international support for Israel's position, contrasting it with China's condemnation of Israel's actions and support for Iran's sovereignty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with increasing tariffs, businesses are creatively altering products to fit into lower-tariff categories, a practice known as "tariff engineering." This legal tactic involves modifying a product's materials or dimensions to qualify for a different harmonized system code, potentially saving companies significant amounts in duties. For example, some manufacturers bundle steel and aluminum to qualify for lower duties, while others are removing those elements to ship them separately based on tariff changes. Columbia Sportswear adds small zippered pockets to women's shirts to avoid higher duties, and Converse adds fuzzy felt to its All-Stars sneakers to classify them as slippers.

          <p>The Israeli military announced it was conducting a series of strikes around Tehran and other areas of Iran, targeting locations not immediately disclosed. These strikes followed Israel's interception of what it described as a "suspicious aerial target" launched from Iran. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) advised Iranians in the vicinity of the Arak heavy water reactor to evacuate immediately, as the IDF prepared to target military infrastructure. Heavy water is used in reactors and can be used to produce plutonium, a key component in nuclear weapons, escalating fears of nuclear proliferation in the region.</p>

Buyers also favor classic navy walls in bedrooms, willing to pay approximately $1,815 more for a home with this color. Dark gray living rooms are also preferred over lighter colors, potentially boosting an offer by about $2,600, while bright, playful colors like lemon yellow in kitchens or scarlet red in bedrooms can decrease a home's sale price.</p>

Trump is reportedly considering a strike on Fordo, an underground uranium enrichment facility in Iran. Meanwhile, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected Trump's demand for unconditional surrender, leading Trump to declare his patience had run out. Israel has also launched additional attacks on Iran, targeting missile sites and nuclear facilities, to which Iran responded by firing hypersonic missiles.</p>

A new assessment indicates that the "carbon budget" has shrunk significantly due to continued record emissions and improved scientific estimates. If global CO2 emissions remain at current rates, the world has roughly three years until the carbon budget is exhausted, potentially committing the world to exceeding the Paris Agreement's target.
