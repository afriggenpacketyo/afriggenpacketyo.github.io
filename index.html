          <p>Following Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, airspace was closed over Israel, Jordan, Iran, and Iraq, leading to the shutdown of Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport. Numerous international carriers, including Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways, Air India, and Lufthansa, canceled, delayed, or redirected flights, affecting travelers across the region and beyond. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the military operation, "Operation Rising Lion," aimed at rolling back the Iranian threat, while Iran responded by launching over 100 drones at Israel. Tensions remain high as both countries brace for further action.</p>

          <p>The Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) reported assisting approximately 50 households following unrest in Ballymena, including providing emergency accommodation for 14 families. The disorder began after a peaceful protest concerning an alleged sexual assault, escalating into violence with injuries to police officers. NIHE anticipates a rise in those seeking help, citing an unprecedented number of families feeling unsafe in their homes, with concerns about vulnerable households being exploited. While Ballymena is reportedly calmer, racially motivated attacks and anti-immigration graffiti have been reported elsewhere in Northern Ireland, highlighting ongoing tensions.</p>

          <p>Stock markets experienced a downturn as oil prices surged following Israel's military strike on Iran, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both declining. The market slide was triggered by Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, prompting Iran to launch over 100 drones in response. Airlines, heavily reliant on fuel and customer confidence, suffered significant losses, while defense stocks saw a rally. The conflict has introduced uncertainty into the global economy and has impacted various sectors beyond oil, including Bitcoin and airline stocks (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley announced that reauthorization and expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) has been included in the Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill." This expansion would allow individuals in regions of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska, along with existing "downwinders," to receive compensation for nuclear waste exposure. The proposal also includes claims for increased atmospheric testing and eligibility for uranium mine workers from 1971-1990. Hawley hopes this inclusion demonstrates the country's support for those affected by nuclear exposure, calling it a measure of vindication and appreciation.</p>

          <p>Following Israeli strikes on military leaders and nuclear sites, Iran has characterized the attacks as a "declaration of war," with officials warning of a "severe, wise and strong answer." The situation has escalated due to the lack of effective diplomacy between Iran and the US regarding nuclear negotiations, creating an environment for Israeli military action. Iran's first response was to fire more than 100 drones at Israel, all of which were intercepted outside Israeli territory, according to the Israeli military. The US is urged to condemn Israel's actions to prevent further escalation and a major war.</p>

          <p>President Trump's military parade, coinciding with the Army's 250th birthday and his own birthday, raises concerns about the militarization of American society and the politicization of the military. Trump's speech at Fort Bragg, framed as a political rally rather than a discussion of military matters, further blurs the lines between civilian and military spheres. The deployment of Marines to immigration protests in Los Angeles and the planned parade in Washington D.C. contribute to a narrative of military power being used for domestic control, potentially undermining the traditional separation of powers and the military's role in a democracy.</p>

          <p>An Air India plane, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, crashed shortly after takeoff in western India, killing all but one person on board, marking the first crash of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the deadliest plane crash in years. Preliminary data indicates the plane lost signal shortly after takeoff, reaching a maximum altitude of 625 feet. Investigators will examine the plane's black boxes, maintenance records, pilot maneuvers, and weather conditions to determine the cause of the crash. The incident has raised questions about the Dreamliner's safety record, though experts suggest it is too early to link the crash to previous manufacturing concerns.</p>

          <p>Psychological research suggests that far-right narratives about social breakdown could lead to more support for President Trump and authoritarianism. Trump has compared images of protests in Los Angeles to a "foreign invasion" and deployed the National Guard, which critics say is manufacturing a crisis for political gain. Studies suggest that people who perceive society as unstable are more receptive to authoritarian leaders who promise order and control. Democrats can reduce this appetite by addressing the uncertainty caused by perceived social breakdown and improving communication on the meaning and purpose of politics.</p>

The Alabuga Start program, promising well-paid careers, lures women to the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, where they face long hours and exposure to dangerous chemicals. Labor shortages in Russia, coupled with recruitment of migrant workers, have led to a surge in African workers, with some parents expressing concerns about their children being trapped in exploitative conditions.

The reforms aim to cut £5bn a year by 2030, including making it harder for disabled people to claim personal independence payment (Pip). Those losing Pip will receive a 13-week transitional payment, and recipients with the most severe health conditions will not be reassessed. Despite these changes, many Labour MPs remain discontented, arguing that poverty delayed is still poverty and that the reforms will push more people into poverty.</p>

Despite being Iran's best-equipped militia group, Hezbollah issued a statement condemning the attack but did not offer to join in retaliation. Analysts suggest that Hezbollah may be too weak to attack due to losses in a recent war with Israel or that it is prioritizing internal restructuring, including leadership changes and local arms production. The group's diminished state reflects Iran's security concerns and the growing pressure on Hezbollah within Lebanon.</p>
