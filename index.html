          <p>English footballer Trent Alexander-Arnold is confronting significant career challenges after being dropped from the national team by coach Thomas Tuchel for upcoming World Cup qualifiers. This international setback coincides with a difficult start to his tenure at Real Madrid, where he has struggled to secure a starting position over club veteran Dani Carvajal. Tuchel has publicly expressed reservations about Alexander-Arnold's defensive capabilities, a concern that has followed him from his time under previous England manager Gareth Southgate. The confluence of these events has placed the 26-year-old's future for both his new club and country in a precarious position.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has revoked an executive directive that extended Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris beyond the legally mandated six-month period. The protection, which had been prolonged for an additional year by her former boss Joe Biden, is now set to end on September 1. This move, which follows the cancellation of protection for other former officials and Biden family members, has drawn criticism from figures like California Governor Gavin Newsom, who described it as an act of political retaliation. The White House confirmed the decision, citing a threat assessment that found no alarming concerns.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced the initial phase of an offensive into Gaza City, declaring it a "dangerous combat zone" and suspending humanitarian pauses in the area. Alongside this operational expansion, which includes a call-up of 60,000 more reservists, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that the bodies of two hostages seized on October 7, 2023, have been recovered from Gaza. The move to enter Gaza City has drawn international condemnation and fueled domestic protests from hostage families who fear for the safety of those still held captive. Despite the pressure, Israeli leadership has vowed to intensify military operations to dismantle Hamas.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has reported a nearly 30% drop in its second-quarter profits, earning 6.4 billion yuan ($894.6 million) as intense domestic competition offset a surge in overseas sales. The company cited an aggressive price war and excessive marketing within China as factors that negatively impacted the industry's development. Despite the profit slump, revenue grew by 14% to 201 billion yuan for the quarter.

          <p>Although the median price for condominiums in the U.S. has fallen by 2.1% year-over-year, this decrease does not necessarily make them an affordable option for buyers. A market oversupply, particularly in states like Florida and Texas, is driving prices down, but hidden costs are a significant concern. Rising homeowners association (HOA) dues, surging insurance premiums, and new building reserve requirements can quickly offset the lower sale price. Real estate agents advise that these additional monthly expenses can make the long-term cost of a condo comparable to that of a more expensive single-family home, urging buyers to scrutinize financials beyond the sticker price.</p>

          <p>Gold remains a popular investment commodity, often sought as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation during periods of economic uncertainty. The article explains that the price of gold is subject to constant fluctuation, influenced by a variety of factors including supply and demand, global economic conditions, and interest rates. Other key drivers include geopolitical instability, which can increase its appeal, and the strength of the U.S. dollar, as gold is priced in the currency. Central bank policies and overall market sentiment also play a significant role in determining the precious metal's short-term value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates in September, savers looking for high-yield certificates of deposit (CDs) may need to be more strategic. While rates have declined from their recent peaks, it is still possible to find CDs with annual percentage yields around 4.50%. The article suggests three key tactics: considering online-only banks, which typically offer higher rates due to lower overhead costs; using online marketplace sites to easily compare offers from multiple institutions; and focusing on short-term CDs of one year or less, which currently tend to provide the most competitive rates in the volatile interest rate environment.

The report comes as President Trump's tariffs on imports begin to influence the economy, though the data was in line with economists' expectations.

Farley calls for a renewed focus on workforce development, vocational training, and cutting red tape to close this gap. He argues that investing in these skilled workers is crucial for national prosperity, warning that shortages will lead to higher costs for housing and food.</p>

The Federal Reserve has not taken a side but urged a prompt ruling to resolve the dispute over its independence.

The Ministry of Local Government based its savings estimates on a 2020 report that projected £2.9 billion in savings over five years. However, the group that commissioned the report has since revised its analysis, now suggesting the mergers could result in no savings or even cost taxpayers money, depending on the structure of the new authorities. Critics have called the lack of independent government analysis "astonishing" for such a significant and potentially costly reform of public services.</p>

Prosecutors claim Mangione poses an ongoing danger by inspiring others and are using this reasoning to support their pursuit of the death penalty.

          <p>Scottish Labour MSP Colin Smyth has been barred from the parliament building after being charged in connection with hiding a secret camera in a Holyrood toilet. Smyth, who was already suspended from the party over a separate charge of possessing indecent images of children, denied the new allegation, calling it an "utter shock." The Scottish Parliament confirmed that a police search found no recording devices but has enhanced security sweeps as a precaution. Smyth criticized Police Scotland for releasing details of the investigation, stating it has been devastating for his family and forced him to leave his home.</p>

          <p>A boat carrying approximately 160 migrants, primarily from The Gambia and Senegal, has capsized off the coast of Mauritania. At least 49 people are confirmed dead, with around 100 others still missing, while 17 individuals have been rescued. The vessel, a dugout canoe, was en route to Spain's Canary Islands, a perilous but increasingly common migration route across the Atlantic. Survivors reported that the boat overturned when passengers shifted to one side after spotting coastal lights, highlighting the extreme dangers faced by those attempting to reach Europe.</p>

          <p>India's economy expanded at an annual rate of 7.8% for the quarter ending in June, surpassing economists' forecasts of 6.7% growth. The strong performance was driven by the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors, which grew by 7.7%, 7.6%, and 9.3% respectively. However, some economists point to a potential slowdown, as nominal GDP growth, which isn't adjusted for inflation, fell to 8.8% from 10.8% in the previous quarter. The robust growth comes as the country braces for the potential economic impact of new 50% U.S. tariffs on Indian imports that recently took effect. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Gulf Coast, the storm is remembered as one of the costliest and deadliest in U.S. history, causing nearly 1,400 deaths. The catastrophe was compounded by the failure of the levee system in New Orleans, which led to at least 80% of the city being flooded and stranding thousands of residents. The federal response was widely criticized as slow and inadequate, creating a humanitarian crisis. Decades later, communities like the Lower Ninth Ward have yet to fully recover, still facing inadequate infrastructure and a fraction of their pre-storm population.</p>

          <p>The share prices of major UK banks, including NatWest, Lloyds, and Barclays, dropped significantly following a proposal for a new windfall tax on their profits. The left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) suggested the tax could raise up to £8 billion annually to compensate taxpayers for losses incurred by the Bank of England's quantitative easing program. The IPPR claims a flawed policy design is allowing public money to flow into commercial banks' coffers. While the Treasury has not commented, the proposal has sparked investor concern about the future profitability of the UK's financial sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Premier League transfer market is poised for a series of interconnected deals, all dependent on Liverpool's anticipated second bid for Newcastle striker Alexander Isak. After Newcastle's recent signing of Nick Woltemade, they are also pursuing Brentford's Yoane Wissa, which would pave the way for Isak's potential record-breaking move to Anfield. Brentford, in turn, is targeting Borussia Dortmund's Max Beier to fill the gap left by Wissa. This complex chain reaction demonstrates the intricate negotiations and dependencies that characterize the final days of the football transfer window, with each club's move contingent on another's.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has indicated his support for a 0.25% interest rate cut in September but stated he is open to a larger, half-point reduction if upcoming labor market data shows substantial weakening. Waller expressed concern that economic conditions could deteriorate rapidly and believes the Fed should act preemptively rather than wait for a downturn to be underway. His comments suggest a growing urgency among some policymakers to lower borrowing costs to support the economy. Waller also anticipates that forthcoming revisions to jobs data will reveal weaker employment growth than previously reported. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested two firefighters battling a wildfire on Washington's Olympic Peninsula after discovering they were in the country illegally. The arrests occurred during an identity check requested by the Bureau of Land Management as part of a criminal investigation into the contractors the men worked for. The incident drew sharp condemnation from Democratic Senator Patty Murray, who called the administration's immigration policy "sick" and dangerous for detaining firefighters on the job. Federal authorities stated the action did not interfere with firefighting operations, but critics argue it stokes fear and undermines public safety.</p>

          <p>The Cracker Barrel restaurant chain has reportedly agreed to restore its classic "Old Timer" logo after facing an intense backlash from right-wing media figures and Donald Trump. The company's recent rebranding effort, intended to modernize its image and attract younger customers, was framed by critics as a "woke" attack on American tradition. The campaign against the company was amplified by figures like Donald Trump Jr. and activist Christopher Rufo, who called for making an example of the company. After President Trump publicly weighed in, the White House announced that Cracker Barrel executives had surrendered and would revert to the original logo.</p>
