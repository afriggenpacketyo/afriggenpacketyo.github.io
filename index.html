          <h2>Global Markets React to Universal Tariffs Implemented by Trump Administration</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global markets experienced a significant downturn following President Donald Trump's implementation of universal tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted, and the S&P 500 experienced its largest one-day slump since March 2020. China retaliated by announcing tariffs on American goods, leading to concerns about a potential global trade war. The universal 10% tariff against all countries went into effect early Saturday, further unsettling investors and economists who are revising downward their forecasts for U.S. economic growth.

          <p>The stock market experienced a sharp decline as concerns mounted over the economic fallout from new U.S. tariffs and the increasing likelihood of a global trade war. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq had their biggest two-day drop since the pandemic's start, erasing trillions in investor wealth. Economists are downgrading U.S. growth forecasts due to the tariffs, which are expected to raise inflation and reduce consumer spending. China's retaliatory tariffs and restrictions add to the market's unease, with analysts warning of a potential U.S. recession if tariffs are not eased.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A veteran Wall Street trader advises investors to exercise caution when employing the "buy the dip" strategy, emphasizing that not all price declines represent genuine opportunities. Kenny Polcari argues that some dips occur because stocks are fundamentally overvalued or broken, citing Enron and Lehman Brothers as cautionary examples. He recommends that investors carefully evaluate a company's earnings, revenue growth, debt levels, and overall market conditions before investing. He also suggests that doing research into the company and its projections should reveal if buying at the dip is a smart financial move or if the stock was “overpriced from the start.”

          <p>Former President Barack Obama has called on Americans to defend democratic values in the face of the Trump administration's policies, urging citizens, colleges, and law firms to resist actions he views as undermining the international order and eroding civil liberties. Obama expressed concern over the government's threats to universities regarding free speech and its economic policies, including widespread tariffs. He emphasized the need for individuals and institutions to stand up for their values, even if it means facing potential sacrifices, such as the loss of federal funding. Obama's remarks underscore a growing sense of unease among some about the direction of American politics and the importance of safeguarding democratic norms.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's persistent interest in acquiring Greenland has raised serious legal and military concerns, with some experts suggesting his actions could violate both American and international law. Trump's administration has begun estimating the costs of controlling Greenland, indicating a concrete effort to pursue this ambition. Critics argue that attempting to seize Greenland against the will of its people and the Danish government could precipitate a civil-military crisis, as it would involve attacking a NATO ally and engaging in a war of conquest. The situation highlights the potential for conflict between the president's desires and established legal and diplomatic norms.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new hacking technique called "doubleclickjacking" is turning ordinary double-clicks on websites into opportunities for attackers to compromise accounts and devices. This method exploits the common action of double-clicking to trigger hidden malicious commands, potentially granting hackers access to webcams, microphones, browser settings, and even cryptocurrency transactions. Experts warn that many websites are not adequately protected against doubleclickjacking, making it essential for users to exercise caution, keep their browsers updated, and use strong antivirus software to mitigate the risk. This emerging threat underscores the importance of staying informed about evolving cybersecurity risks and adopting proactive measures to protect personal information online.

The Trump administration is accused of pre-emptively arresting these legal immigrants, possibly in preparation for mass deportations if TPS is eventually revoked.

          <p>A new book by political scientists Stephen Macedo and Frances Lee argues that liberals may have been wrong about certain aspects of the pandemic response, specifically questioning the efficacy and cost-benefit analysis of Covid lockdowns. The authors suggest that public health authorities and the media pushed pandemic measures without adequately weighing their costs and ostracized those who disagreed. The book highlights potential groupthink and partisan bias in the handling of the pandemic, raising questions about whether some policies were as grounded in empirical evidence as believed. The study offers a controversial perspective on the pandemic response, suggesting that it may have been influenced by political factors and groupthink.

The unprecedented scale of the test signals China's growing confidence in its military technology and its capacity to counter advanced threats.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inactive investors, who adopt a "buy and hold" strategy, often outperform active traders due to lower costs, taxes, and reduced emotional decision-making. Experts say human behavior is the biggest threat to investor returns, as emotional impulses to sell during downturns or buy into trending assets can lead to significant losses. While investors shouldn't do nothing, they should review their asset allocation, rebalance periodically, and avoid impulsive decisions driven by market fluctuations. Financial advisors often recommend basic steps like reviewing one's asset allocation (ensuring it aligns with investment horizon and goals) and periodically rebalancing to maintain that mix of stocks and bonds.

The statement comes as U.S. stock markets experience steep declines in response to Trump's tariffs, with China becoming the first country to retaliate with its own tariffs.

          <p>The Senate approved a Republican budget plan involving trillions in tax breaks and spending cuts, despite opposition from Democrats and warnings about potential economic fallout. The vote fell along party lines, with two GOP senators dissenting. The plan aims to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts and increase spending on border security and defense. Democrats argue that the plan will disproportionately benefit the wealthy and lead to cuts in key safety net programs, creating a point of contention between parties.

          <p>Theodore McCarrick, a former cardinal who was defrocked by Pope Francis for molesting adults and children, has died at the age of 94. McCarrick's death follows a Vatican investigation that revealed decades of sexual abuse and a cover-up by church leaders. The scandal surrounding McCarrick created a crisis of credibility for the Catholic Church, with evidence suggesting that Vatican and U.S. church leaders were aware of his misconduct but failed to take action. His death marks the end of a controversial figure in the history of the Catholic Church.

          <p>Experts are skeptical about President Trump's claim that his tariffs will lead to a resurgence in manufacturing in the United States. While Trump asserts that the tariffs will bring jobs and factories back, experts cite factors such as uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, a strong dollar, and the need for workforce development as potential obstacles. Some believe that businesses will proceed cautiously due to the unpredictable nature of trade policy. The analysis suggests that reshoring may not be as simple or immediate as the president suggests.
