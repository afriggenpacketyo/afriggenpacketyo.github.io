          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following the Department of Homeland Security's decision to revoke the university's ability to enroll international students, which affects over 7,000 current visa holders. The lawsuit claims the revocation is a blatant violation of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause, arguing it's retaliation for Harvard exercising its rights to reject government demands to control its governance and curriculum. Harvard asserts that international students contribute significantly to the university's mission, and without them, Harvard would not be the same. The lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order to immediately block the administration's action.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields stumbled from recent highs as President Trump escalated trade war rhetoric, proposing a 50% tariff on the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S. These announcements sent investors seeking safety in bonds, driving yields down. The 30-year Treasury yield decreased by 5 basis points to 5.013%, while the 10-year Treasury shed 7 basis points to 4.479%. This move follows a volatile week for bonds, initially triggered by concerns over Trump's budget bill worsening the U.S. deficit and Moody's downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy staffers has left the American Jewish community reeling after more than a year of surging antisemitism. Yuval David, a filmmaker and Jewish activist, expressed that the murders of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim were "too close by for every Jew in America." David had met Lischinsky just one day before the shooting and discussed Islamism in the West. The Jewish activist added that "all it takes" to be at risk is for someone to be perceived as Jewish and urged Americans to realize that the hatred and attacks go beyond the Jewish community.</p>

          <p>Saving money can be a challenge in an economy with persistent inflation, but certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn returns that outpace inflation. Investors can lock in today's high rates for the term of the CD, and these investments are generally FDIC or NCUA insured up to $250,000. Current national averages for CD yields are 1.99% APY for 1-year CDs, 1.69% APY for 3-year CDs, and 1.70% APY for 5-year CDs. However, top CDs from online banks offer much higher rates, with some short-term options exceeding 4.40% APY (not investment advice).</p>

Netanyahu also blamed UN officials for spreading lies regarding the situation in Gaza, which he claims led to the deadly attack on Israeli embassy staff in Washington.

Despite states and cities enacting new policies such as banning chokeholds and mandating body cameras, killings by police officers have risen from just over 1,000 in 2019 to around 1,200 in 2024. The article notes that the Trump administration dropped efforts to investigate or oversee police departments, and attributes the lack of significant change to lawmakers not embracing all proposed changes and the changes not going far enough to transform American policing.</p>

The proposal would strip Medicaid benefits from working-age adults without children unless they prove they work at least 80 hours a month, potentially causing 7.7 million Americans to lose health insurance by 2034. The editorial argues that health care is a right and that work requirements don't work, as evidenced by studies showing no increase in workforce participation in states that have implemented such requirements.

          <p>China's escalating protests against new US restrictions targeting Chinese-made microchips signal Beijing's determination not to cede ground in its tech and trade standoff with Washington. The US announced a global ban on advanced AI-powered chips made by Chinese companies, prompting China to threaten punishment for those enforcing the ban using an anti-sanctions law. This strong reaction reflects China's growing confidence and aims to force Washington to back down over the chip rules. Analysts suggest this move is also due to the US announcing the policy during a 90-day truce in the trade war.</p>

          <p>A global study involving 20 institutions has found compelling evidence that the coronavirus causing COVID-19 did not originate in Wuhan, China, contradicting the lab leak theory. Researchers analyzed 167 bat coronavirus genomes, tracing the virus's origins to bat populations in northern Laos and southwest China's Yunnan province. The findings indicate that the virus's most recent ancestor circulated five to seven years before the pandemic emerged. The study challenges claims by the White House, which suggested a Chinese lab leak was the "real source" of the pandemic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered that clownfish are shrinking in response to severe heatwaves in the ocean. During a heatwave in Papua New Guinea in 2023, researchers measured clownfish and found they got shorter by a small percentage over a few months. The study suggests this shrinking may be an adaptation to help clownfish survive hotter ocean temperatures. The fish that shrank had a higher chance of survival, indicating that being smaller has advantages in a hot climate, and the study adds a layer of complexity to the story of the worldâ€™s oceans.</p>

Community groups like RISE St. James argue the law silences science and enables polluting industries to avoid accountability.
