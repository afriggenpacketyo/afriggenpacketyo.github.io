          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have reached an agreement to reset their relations after Britain's exit from the EU in 2020. The deal includes reciprocal access to fishing waters until June 30, 2038, energy cooperation, and a security and defense partnership. Additionally, both sides aim to create a "balanced youth experience" scheme for young people to work, study, volunteer, or travel in each other's countries for a limited time. The UK and EU will also consider allowing UK passport holders to use e-gates at European airports, potentially easing travel for Britons. The agreement comes amidst shifting global dynamics and a desire for closer cooperation on security and defense policy. </p>

          <p>Five years after Brexit, Britain and the European Union are holding their first summit, signaling a potential reset in relations. Despite a majority of Britons now regretting the decision to leave the EU, reversing Brexit is unlikely. The summit focuses on smaller-scale issues such as fishing rights and youth mobility, while topics like the single market and freedom of movement are off the table. The renewed ties are driven by geopolitical factors like the war in Ukraine and a less reliable United States, leading both sides to recognize the need for cooperation. </p>

          <p>A downgrade by Moody’s amplified existing worries about the cost of President Trump’s policies and the health of the U.S. economy. The United States’ loss of its last triple-A credit rating and mounting concerns about government debt are threatening to disrupt the relative calm in financial markets that has prevailed since President Trump began pausing tariffs early last month. The ratings firm Moody’s cited legislation, along with broader concerns about the fiscal deficit and growing debt costs, when it downgraded the credit rating of the United States. The move by Moody’s means that all three major rating agencies no longer consider the United States qualified for their top credit ratings. </p>

          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to fall in July, marking the first drop in the regulator Ofgem's price cap for a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will see their annual bill fall by £129, a drop of nearly 7%. This decrease would bring the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit to £1,720, down from the current level of £1,849. </p>
