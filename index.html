          <p>Oakland Athletics outfielder Brent Rooker humorously responded on social media to an ESPN reporter's suggested lineup for the MLB All-Star game's inaugural swing-off, which had excluded him. The reporter, Jeff Passan, had listed several power-hitting stars he would have preferred to see compete. Rooker jokingly asked if he wasn't "good enough" before clarifying he was not genuinely upset and would have made the same picks. The article also notes another instance of Rooker engaging with critics on social media, defending his choice to feed his young daughter a bottle during the Home Run Derby.</p>

          <p>Ten Americans, including former Navy SEAL Wilbert Joseph Castaneda, have been freed from Venezuelan custody and are returning to the United States. Their release was part of a complex prisoner swap involving the U.S., Venezuela, and El Salvador. The deal saw El Salvador repatriate 252 Venezuelan nationals who had been deported from the U.S. to a Salvadoran prison. In exchange, Venezuela also released dozens of its own political prisoners. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that every wrongfully detained American in Venezuela is now free, crediting President Trump's leadership for the outcome.</p>

          <p>Over 200 Venezuelan migrants, who were deported from the U.S. to a high-security prison in El Salvador in March, have been sent to Venezuela. This move was part of a broader prisoner exchange that also secured the release of 10 Americans held in Venezuela. The Trump administration had used a rare 18th-century law to deport the migrants, accusing them of gang ties, a claim many families and an ACLU lawyer contest. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele confirmed the exchange, which also included the release of Venezuelan political prisoners, framing it as a resolution to a complex international situation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress has approved a proposal to eliminate $1.1 billion in federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS stations nationwide. This move is expected to cause significant harm, leading to layoffs and reduced programming, with the most severe impacts felt by smaller, rural stations that rely heavily on these funds. Acclaimed filmmaker Ken Burns warned that many educational projects will no longer be possible, and local accountability in news will diminish. Leaders at PBS and local affiliates, including those in Southern California, are now preparing for difficult financial decisions that will affect their ability to serve their communities.</p>

This diplomatic engagement is seen as a "stiffening of Canberra's spine" against U.S. pressure to take a harder line on Beijing. Analysts note that Australia, like other nations in the region, faces a predicament in balancing its major economic partnership with China and its crucial security alliance with the United States. The approach acknowledges that making a binary choice between the two global powers is not a realistic or beneficial option for the country.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has been privately debating how to handle the persistent public and media furor surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case. President Trump, feeling betrayed by his own base's refusal to move on, was initially adamant about not fueling the story further. However, an explosive Wall Street Journal report about a letter Trump allegedly sent Epstein forced a change in strategy, leading the president to request the unsealing of grand jury transcripts. The article details the internal frustration and the president's rage at "disloyal" MAGA influencers, highlighting the administration's difficulty in managing a scandal that directly involves Trump's past association with the convicted sex offender.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that the U.S. Congress has increasingly abdicated its constitutional responsibilities, allowing the executive branch to seize more power. The article points to recent votes where Republican senators criticized White House legislative priorities, such as Medicaid cuts or budget rescissions, only to vote in favor of them. This "Vote Yes/Hope No" approach, driven by a fear of political backlash, has enabled the Trump administration to advance its agenda with little resistance. The author contends that this congressional cowardice, as foreseen by architects of Project 2025, ultimately weakens the legislative branch and undermines the principles of governance.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a strong majority of Americans, about two-thirds, favor the U.S. returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly high among younger Americans who did not witness the original Apollo missions. The survey also found that the 1969 moon landing is still viewed as a worthwhile achievement by a large majority, consistent with views from previous anniversaries. Americans generally believe the space program contributes to national pride and produces technological benefits for everyone, showing broad, bipartisan backing for continued space exploration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The stock of online real estate company Opendoor surged nearly 190% in one week, largely driven by the enthusiastic social media posts of hedge fund manager Eric Jackson. Jackson, whose firm EMJ Capital had taken a new position in the beaten-down stock, predicted it could be a "100-bagger" in the coming years. The rally occurred despite no fundamental improvements in the company's business, which remains a cash-burning operation. The story highlights the growing influence of social media on stock prices and how Jackson, who nearly shut down his fund in 2022, is leveraging a successful past bet on Carvana to build a reputation for identifying comeback opportunities.

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump establishes a $250 "visa integrity fee" for many nonimmigrant visitors to the U.S., including international students and temporary skilled workers. The fee, part of a larger tax and spending bill, is effective for the current fiscal year. While the law suggests the fee could be reimbursed if visitors comply with their visa terms, such as departing on time, the mechanism for collection and reimbursement has not yet been established. Immigration advocates argue this fee, along with a new $100 charge for asylum seekers, creates additional financial hurdles that could put legal pathways to the U.S. out of reach for many people.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler shot a 64, the lowest round of the tournament so far, to take a one-shot lead at the 153rd Open Championship.

The leaderboard remains congested, with past champion Brian Harman and China's Li Haotong tied for third at eight under. Rory McIlroy is at three under par, keeping his hopes alive heading into the weekend.

Hakimi was in a crosswalk with a green light when the truck made an unsafe right turn and struck him. The city admitted the driver was at fault but disputed the amount of damages, arguing Hakimi's comatose state minimized his pain and suffering. Hakimi's attorneys criticized the City Attorney's office for refusing reasonable settlement offers and forcing the case to trial, contributing to the city's escalating legal liability payouts.</p>

The article argues that late-night shows no longer hold the cultural power they once did, as viewers turn to streaming and content clips online.
