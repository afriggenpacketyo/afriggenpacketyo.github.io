          <p>Columbia University's commencement ceremony was a mix of celebration and protest, reflecting the tumultuous year experienced by the class of 2025. Acting President Claire Shipman was booed by some graduates as she spoke, while others chanted in support of Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate detained by immigration authorities. Shipman affirmed the rights of international students to free speech amid a clampdown on pro-Palestinian activism. Jewish students expressed mixed feelings, citing experiences of antisemitism during campus protests. Demonstrators outside the gates protested, resulting in arrests, while inside, graduates held symbols representing their schools as degrees were conferred. The Trump administration has also pulled funding from Columbia over antisemitism concerns.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, Speaker Mike Johnson, and House Republican holdouts met to address sticking points in the "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act," which includes changes to Medicaid, state and local tax deductions, SNAP food assistance, and immigration policy. Hard-liners are primarily concerned with Medicaid work requirements and the cap on state and local tax deductions. Despite Johnson's optimism, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris stated that the bill would not pass on Wednesday due to the worsening of the bill overnight. The White House Office of Management and Budget released a letter calling for the bill's passage, emphasizing that failure to do so would be a betrayal of promises made to the American people.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are pushing forward with legislation that could trigger international tax and trade wars, potentially disrupting a global tax agreement brokered by the Biden administration in 2021. The bill aims to penalize foreign companies operating in the U.S. if their home countries enforce the global minimum tax, increasing their tax rates by up to 20 percentage points. This move is expected to be a key topic at the upcoming G7 finance ministers' meeting in Canada, raising concerns about retaliatory measures and chilling foreign investment. Experts warn that the legislation could violate international tax treaties and harm U.S. consumers and businesses.</p>

          <p>Deborah Rutter, the former president of the Kennedy Center, is disputing President Trump's claims of "bad management" during her tenure. Trump, who ousted Rutter and other board members, alleged the previous leadership spent millions of dollars without visible improvements. Rutter countered that such allegations are false and disregard the complexities of nonprofit arts management. The Kennedy Center's current president, Richard Grenell, has claimed to have found "$26 million in phantom revenue" and plans to refer this to the U.S. attorney's office, allegations that Rutter also refutes.</p>

          <p>The FDA has cleared the first blood test for detecting amyloid plaques, a key marker of Alzheimer's disease, offering a faster and more accurate diagnosis for individuals aged 55 and older with cognitive symptoms. This test, the Lumipulse assay by Fujirebio, is expected to revolutionize Alzheimer's care by enabling primary care physicians to quickly assess patients and improve diagnostic accuracy. The availability of a readily accessible blood test is likely to lead to earlier diagnoses, allowing more patients to access amyloid-reducing drugs and participate in clinical trials, particularly in underserved communities.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are aiming to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, Joe Biden's signature climate law, with approaches ranging from surgical precision to brute force. The president reinforced this by dropping in on a private party caucus on May 20th to strong-arm waverers and threaten dissenters with a MAGA primary challenge. Pressure from companies and congressmen with clean-energy projects benefiting from its subsidies in their districts (most are found in Republican counties) suggested surgical precision would prevail. But relentless pressure to abolish the IRA from the president, who is a fan of drilling, baby, drilling and denounced the law as the “Green New Scam,” pointed instead to brute force.</p>

FEMA stated that the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program was "wasteful and ineffective," prioritizing political agendas over helping Americans affected by natural disasters.
