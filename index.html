          <p>The article explains secondary sanctions, a US foreign policy tool that pressures third-party countries or entities doing business with sanctioned parties like Russia, primarily through leveraging the US dollar's global importance and access to its financial system. While the US Senate proposes 500% tariffs on goods from countries buying or selling Russian energy, experts debate the effectiveness and risks of such sanctions, including potential retaliation or pushing targeted countries closer. Historically, the US used them successfully against Iran's nuclear program and more recently against China and Venezuela, but their enforcement is complex and not always effective.</p>

          <p>A recent study reveals that 60% of Singaporean workers are living paycheck to paycheck in 2024, a notable increase from 53% in 2021 and higher than the Asia-Pacific average. This trend is attributed to Singapore's high cost of living, including expensive housing and import reliance, alongside shifting cultural priorities towards experiences over long-term savings, particularly among younger generations. Economists note that real median employment income has declined, making saving more challenging despite cooling inflation. The article highlights a societal shift towards instant gratification and lifestyle signaling, contributing to financial strain for many. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article delves into the historical context and development of the 25th Amendment, which provides clear instructions for presidential succession and disability. It highlights the efforts of a young lawyer, John Feerick, who embarked on a mission to address the constitutional void regarding a president's inability to serve, a concern amplified after events like JFK's assassination. The amendment, a crucial addition to the Constitution, ensures governmental stability by outlining procedures for transferring power, temporary or permanent, and has become a vital component of American political continuity.</p>

          <p>The UK economy grew by a better-than-expected 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, according to preliminary estimates from the Office for National Statistics, surpassing Reuters' forecast of 0.1%. Growth was primarily driven by the services sector, with computer programming, health, and vehicle leasing showing momentum, while construction also increased. Despite this positive data, economists caution that this rebound is unlikely to continue into the third quarter due to a softening labor market and ongoing inflation pressures. The Bank of England recently cut interest rates, balancing sticky inflation with subdued growth and a loosening job market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reported the detention of Jimmy Anderson Ayala Mayuri, an illegal migrant from Peru, in Washington, D.C. After being stopped by federal officers in his food truck on National Park Service property, Mayuri allegedly brandished a large butcher knife and threatened to harm himself. He briefly barricaded himself inside the vehicle before being apprehended. Mayuri will remain in detention pending a deportation decision. This incident follows President Donald Trump's initiative to increase federal law enforcement presence in D.C. to combat crime, a move that has drawn local government commentary.</p>

          <p>Thirteen children and one adult sustained minor injuries after an accident on the "Wacky Worm" roller coaster at Coney Beach Pleasure Park in Porthcawl, Wales. A cart on the ride reportedly left its track, and a metal railing fell, injuring a one-year-old in a pram. Emergency services responded, and seven patients were hospitalized for treatment. The park, which is slated to close in October for redevelopment, was instructed by police to clear the site and will remain closed for investigation by officers and health and safety personnel.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has dismissed a copyright infringement claim against Pinkfong's viral "Baby Shark" song, ruling that the plaintiff's 2011 rendition was not original enough to warrant protection. US composer Jonathan Wright had claimed the 2015 hit copied his version, but the court upheld earlier decisions, stating the song is based on a traditional melody popular at US summer camps. This ruling confirms Pinkfong's stance that "Baby Shark" is derived from a public domain singalong chant, solidifying its status as a global phenomenon with over 16 billion YouTube views.</p>

          <p>Over 115 education scholars have denounced Harvard University publisher's cancellation of a special issue of the Harvard Educational Review dedicated to Palestine, calling it "censorship" and "anti-Palestinian discrimination." The issue, planned to address Palestinian education and related debates amidst the Gaza conflict, was scrapped after the publisher demanded an unprecedented "risk assessment" review by Harvard's legal counsel. Critics argue this decision sets a dangerous precedent and exemplifies the "Palestine exception" to academic freedom, particularly as Gaza's educational infrastructure faces destruction. The scholars assert the cancellation undermines academic integrity and the dissemination of critical knowledge.</p>

Israel denies restrictions, asserting rules ensure aid bypasses Hamas.

          <p>A lawsuit by environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe challenging the construction and operation of an immigration detention center, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," in the Florida Everglades has concluded its trial. The plaintiffs argue that the rushed construction violated federal environmental laws by lacking public input and impact assessments, and seek its shutdown. A key unresolved question is who controls the facility, as Florida claims it's a state center under ICE authority, while plaintiffs contend its function is purely federal. Concerns were raised about the center's impact on endangered Florida panthers, water quality, and tribal communities.</p>

          <p>A New York man, Shane Daley, has been charged with cyberstalking a family member of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, allegedly leaving threatening voicemails expressing satisfaction over Thompson's fatal shooting and wishing similar harm upon his family. The calls began hours after Thompson was killed in December 2024. Daley was arrested and released with GPS monitoring, facing up to five years in prison if convicted. Prosecutors stated Daley "gleefully welcomed this tragedy" and aimed to increase the family's suffering. The CEO's shooting suspect, Luigi Mangione, pleaded not guilty to charges motivated by corporate greed.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at easing regulations for commercial rocket launches, directing the transportation secretary to expedite or eliminate environmental reviews for FAA launch licenses. The order cites inefficient permitting processes as hindering US leadership in global space markets. Critics, particularly environmental groups, condemn the move, warning it puts people and wildlife at risk from private companies' rocket launches, which can explode and devastate surrounding areas. The order could benefit companies like SpaceX, whose Starship rockets have faced delays due to environmental impact studies and licensing reviews.</p>

          <h2>Percentage of Americans Drinking Alcohol Reaches Record Low, Gallup Poll Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 23:10:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who consume alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, coinciding with increased public concern about the health risks of even moderate drinking. Experts suggest this shift is driven by greater awareness of alcohol's negative health effects, including increased risks of cancer and mental health issues. Younger generations, in particular, show lower consumption rates and higher awareness of moderation's harm, influenced by social acceptability of sobriety, rising alcohol costs, and changing social interaction patterns. The article also notes a significant drop in alcohol use among women.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings that popular mousse sunscreen products, like those from Supergoop! and Vacation Inc., may not provide adequate UV protection. The FDA also highlighted a safety concern: these products are often packaged to resemble whipped cream, increasing the risk of accidental ingestion. Several companies received warning letters for selling these products as over-the-counter drugs without required FDA approval and for "misbranded" packaging. Supergoop! stated it is working to resolve the "product labeling" matter, while other companies are also addressing the FDA's concerns.</p>

          <p>China's Xiluodu hydropower station, the world's fourth-largest dam, has stopped using Western industrial chips from companies like Siemens and Schneider due to growing national security concerns over vulnerabilities in industrial control systems. This move follows historical cyberattacks, such as the Stuxnet virus, which exploited Siemens PLCs. The decision reflects a broader alarm regarding potential weaknesses in critical infrastructure components. With a total installed capacity of 13.86 gigawatts, the dam's shift to domestic chip suppliers underscores China's strategic efforts to enhance its technological autonomy and security in vital sectors.</p>

          <p>As President Donald Trump prepares for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, the family of David Barnes, an American serving a 21.5-year sentence in Russia, hopes for his release through a prisoner exchange. Barnes, accused by Russian prosecutors of crimes in the US that American law enforcement found unsubstantiated, has been detained since January 2022. His family maintains his innocence and seeks his designation as wrongfully detained. This comes after a previous prisoner exchange and a letter from a recently released American ballerina urging Barnes' release, highlighting the ongoing diplomatic efforts for Americans held abroad.</p>

His son has urged international leaders to intervene, expressing concern for his father's health.

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump has threatened to sue Hunter Biden for over $1 billion after he claimed she was introduced to Donald Trump by sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Her lawyers described the assertion as "false, disparaging, defamatory, and inflammatory," demanding a retraction and apology. Biden made the comment during an interview, attributing it partially to a journalist whose related story was later retracted. The First Lady's legal team asserts she has suffered "overwhelming financial and reputational harm." This legal threat follows weeks of pressure for the White House to release the "Epstein files," which the FBI states do not contain an incriminating client list.</p>

She reiterated North Korea's lack of interest in reviving negotiations with the US and South Korea, blaming upcoming joint military drills for perceived hostility. While South Korea maintains it detected some speaker removals and hopes for dialogue, the North's firm stance, including a future constitutional amendment to fix this position, signals a continued rejection of reconciliation efforts.

This final, "utterly foolish" raid in the firebombing campaign, masterminded by Gen. Curtis LeMay, aimed to cripple Japan's war machine.
