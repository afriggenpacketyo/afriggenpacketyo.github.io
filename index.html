          <h2>CBO Analysis Indicates Trump's Megabill Favors Wealthy, Reduces Resources for Poor</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office reveals that President Trump's proposed megabill would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans while negatively impacting the poorest households. The report estimates that the lowest-earning 10% of households would experience a 3.9% income cut, amounting to approximately $1,600 per year. Conversely, the top 10% of households would see gains of around $12,000 annually, highlighting a significant disparity in the bill's impact. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is also scheduled to testify before the House Armed Services Committee amidst ongoing debate regarding the deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles.

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, is spearheading an initiative to lower rice prices amidst rising household burdens, reminiscent of his father, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. This move comes after Koizumi's unsuccessful leadership race, where he was perceived as lacking experience. Analysts suggest his communication skills and reformist approach could be beneficial for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) as they face a national election with public frustration over price hikes. Koizumi has implemented measures such as releasing government rice stockpiles at half the market value, drawing attention to agricultural sector issues, aiming to capture the public's imagination and potentially boosting his leadership prospects within the LDP.</p>

          <p>Kodai Senga, starting pitcher for the New York Mets, left Thursday's game against the Washington Nationals after appearing to injure his right leg. The injury occurred when Senga covered first base on a ground ball, landing awkwardly after a throw from first baseman Pete Alonso. Senga was visibly in pain and held his hamstring as team medical staff attended to him. Prior to the injury, Senga had allowed only one hit and the Mets held a 4-0 lead, with Senga earning the win to improve his record to 7-3 and ranking second in the majors with a 1.47 ERA.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration's Renaming of Military Bases Sparks Controversy</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for its handling of military base renamings, initially claiming to restore Confederate-linked names but later stating the bases would be named after veterans with the same surnames. This discrepancy has been interpreted as a veiled attempt to honor Confederate figures while avoiding direct acknowledgement. The original name changes occurred after a thorough process to identify deserving military figures, but the current administration's approach seems superficial. Critics argue that this move is an insult to those previously honored and a reflection of Trump's broader campaign against initiatives perceived as "woke."</p>

          <p>Elected officials in California are urging FEMA and the Newsom administration to fund soil testing on properties destroyed in the Eaton and Palisades wildfires, citing public health risks and financial burdens for survivors. FEMA has declined to test properties for contaminants, a departure from past practices in California, where soil sampling was conducted after major wildfires to detect unhealthy levels of lead and other toxic metals. State legislators are recommending that California environmental regulators step in and conduct soil sampling if federal agencies continue to resist, using funds from a $2.5-billion emergency relief package. Critics argue that leaving burned-down homes untested reverses precedent and lowers standards for future disasters.</p>

Center Theatre Group canceled performances due to the curfew, while L.A.

          <p>Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles. Padilla attempted to ask questions about the administration's immigration enforcement actions, but was physically removed and handcuffed. Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS, claimed Padilla interrupted the conference without identifying himself, while Noem stated that a civil discussion would have been more appropriate. California Governor Gavin Newsom and other Democrats have expressed outrage over the incident, while the Congressional Hispanic Caucus is demanding an investigation.</p>
