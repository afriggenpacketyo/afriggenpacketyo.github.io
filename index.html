          <p>Donald Trump reacted to a major military parade in Beijing attended by leaders Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un. On social media, Trump questioned if China would acknowledge the U.S. role in its WWII victory and accused the three leaders of conspiring against the United States. A Kremlin aide dismissed the conspiracy allegations, stating the leaders had no such intentions during the event commemorating the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender. The gathering occurs amid Western concerns over the three nations' collaboration, particularly regarding Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A portrait of Confederate General Robert E. Lee has been returned to display at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point's library, reversing a 2022 Department of Defense directive to remove Confederate commemorations. The move aligns with a Trump administration executive order to restore historical names and monuments, with an Army spokesperson stating, "we honor our history and learn from it - we don't erase it." Critics, including a retired brigadier general who served on the removal commission, argue that honoring Lee contradicts West Point's values because he committed treason against the United States to defend slavery.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted a strike on a vessel in the southern Caribbean, killing 11 individuals identified as "narcoterrorists" from the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The operation, which Trump stated he ordered, targeted the boat in international waters as it was allegedly transporting illegal narcotics to the United States. This action is part of the administration's increased pressure on Venezuela and its designation of certain criminal groups as terrorist organizations. A Venezuelan official suggested a video of the strike shared by Trump could be AI-generated, a claim Reuters could not immediately verify.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's stock value rose by 6% after a U.S. court ruled against the most severe penalties in its antitrust case, avoiding a forced divestiture of its Chrome browser and Android operating system. While Google was found to have an illegal monopoly in internet search, the ruling allows it to continue making payments to companies like Apple to be the default search engine, though exclusive contracts are now barred. This outcome is seen as a significant victory for Google, removing a major financial uncertainty and bolstering investor confidence in the long-term stability of its core business.

President Xi Jinping was joined by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a gathering widely interpreted as a challenge to the U.S.-led global order. The event demonstrated Beijing's growing geopolitical influence and its deepening alliances with nations facing Western sanctions.

          <p>The United States is confronting a significant shortage of skilled workers in the shipbuilding and semiconductor manufacturing sectors, impacting national security and economic competition with China. Experts and officials, including the Navy Secretary, are calling for a renewed focus on vocational training to fill crucial roles like shipfitters and semiconductor technicians. Decades of decline in the manufacturing workforce have left critical industries understaffed, despite recent investments and a boom in these sectors. The article argues that addressing this labor gap is essential for maintaining America's maritime and technological dominance.</p>

          <p>California's ambitious high-speed rail project is progressing in the Central Valley, but its future is threatened as the Trump administration attempts to revoke billions in federal funding. The project has been plagued by delays, cost overruns, and criticism for currently only connecting areas far from its ultimate goals of Los Angeles and San Francisco. The California High-Speed Rail Authority's new CEO acknowledges past mistakes but insists the project is now on better footing and is suing to protect the federal grants. While local infrastructure benefits are visible, skepticism remains about whether the full vision can be realized.</p>

The museum features paintings of America's founders and over 40 AI-generated videos where historical figures narrate their stories. Historians have raised concerns about the project, particularly the AI videos blurring historical fact with modern fiction, such as an AI John Adams using a phrase popularized by a contemporary conservative commentator. Critics argue the exhibit presents a narrow and sometimes inaccurate view of history, glossing over complex aspects of figures' lives.</p>

          <p>The filler word "um" serves multiple crucial functions in conversation, such as holding one's turn to speak, filling pauses while thinking, and softening tone for politeness. Its simple vowel sound makes it easy to produce, and similar filler words exist across many languages, reflecting neutral sounds in different dialects. While traditionally absent from formal writing, "um" is increasingly used in informal digital text to convey humor or confusion. Experts note that although often perceived negatively in professional contexts, its use is a natural and important part of the social contract of real-time verbal communication.</p>

Furthermore, Google will be required to share portions of its valuable search index data with qualified competitors.

          <p>The head of Russia's state nuclear corporation, Rosatom, announced that Russia will help China achieve its goal of overtaking the United States as the world's largest producer of nuclear power. China aims to exceed 100 gigawatts of installed capacity, a significant increase from its current level, to surpass the U.S. network of reactors. This cooperation involves Russia building new reactors in China and supplying uranium and nuclear fuel. The partnership will also focus on developing a new generation of closed nuclear fuel cycle reactors based on Russian technology, deepening the energy and strategic ties between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid has demonstrated a consistent ability to sign world-class football players for little to no transfer fee, a strategy that has proven highly successful. The recent acquisition of Trent Alexander-Arnold from Liverpool follows similar moves for stars like David Alaba, Antonio Rudiger, and Kylian Mbappe in previous years. The club's immense prestige and relentless pursuit of trophies create a powerful allure that convinces top talent to run down their contracts at other major European clubs. This approach allows the Spanish giants to acquire elite players while avoiding massive transfer expenditures, solidifying their competitive advantage.</p>

          <p>Thailand's ruling Pheu Thai party is seeking royal approval to dissolve parliament, paving the way for a new election, as the nation faces a political crisis. The move came after the largest opposition party shifted its support to a rival prime ministerial candidate, conservative tycoon Anutin Charnvirakul. This political maneuvering follows last week's dismissal of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra by the Constitutional Court. Anutin now appears to have enough support to form a government, but his elevation is conditioned on holding fresh elections within four months, signaling continued instability in the country's leadership.</p>

The 23-year-old revealed she played through a great deal of pain in the semi-final and final, which affected her ability to perform at her best. James also spoke about the fear of receiving racist abuse after missing a penalty in the quarter-final shootout, expressing relief that other teammates also missed.

          <p>BBC correspondents analyzed China's massive military parade as a significant display of geopolitical power and a clear message to the West, particularly the Trump administration. The unprecedented public appearance of Xi Jinping with Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un was described as political theater designed to showcase a counterweight to the U.S.-led global order. The event highlighted China's rapid military modernization, with new weapons systems intended to rival Western capabilities. Analysts noted that the spectacle demonstrated China's intent to fill a perceived vacuum left by U.S. isolationist policies and to establish a new world order.</p>

          <p>China's largest-ever military parade showcased a diverse range of new weaponry, from an upgraded nuclear missile with near-global reach to hypersonic weapons and sea drones. Military analysts interpret the display as a broad message of deterrence aimed at the United States, its allies, and regional powers. The unveiling of a full nuclear triad and advanced systems for dominating its near seas is intended to complicate the strategic calculations of any potential adversary. The parade signaled significant technological advancement across all military fronts, reinforcing China's ambition to compete with and, in some areas, overtake Western military capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cement production in the United Kingdom has fallen to its lowest level since the 1950s, a decline that a leading trade body warns could jeopardize the government's housing and infrastructure plans. The Mineral Products Association attributes the drop to high energy, regulatory, and labor costs, which have made domestic production uncompetitive against cheaper imports. With the UK producing just 7.3 million tonnes in 2024, about half of 1990 levels, there are growing concerns about the ability to source materials for major projects like new homes, hospitals, and power plants, potentially leading to increased reliance on foreign supply.</p>

          <p>The high-energy environment of the US Open in New York has reignited debates over on-court tennis etiquette, with several contentious incidents drawing scrutiny. Arguments have erupted over players not apologizing for net-cord winners, the use of underarm serves, and aiming shots directly at an opponent's body. While some players view these as legitimate tactics within the rules, others consider them disrespectful and unsportsmanlike. The incidents, involving players like Stefanos Tsitsipas and Jelena Ostapenko, highlight differing cultural and personal standards of conduct in the high-stakes atmosphere of a Grand Slam tournament.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration cannot use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of individuals accused of belonging to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The court found that the wartime statute was not intended for use against criminal gangs in peacetime, blocking a key administration immigration policy. This decision is a significant setback for the administration's efforts to use executive power for swift removals and is likely to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling reaffirms judicial oversight on the executive branch's interpretation of historical laws.</p>
