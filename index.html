          <p>A security guard at Endeavor Health Evanston Hospital, near Chicago, was wounded during a struggle in the emergency room. The incident began when the Crisis Alternative Response Evanston (C.A.R.E.) team approached a man experiencing a mental health issue near a Taco Bell and brought him to the hospital for evaluation. While in the ER, the man became agitated, leading to a confrontation with hospital staff and security. During the ensuing struggle, the man lunged for his belongings, a weapon was revealed, and shots were fired, wounding the security guard; the man is now in police custody and the hospital is no longer under lockdown.</p>

          <p>A report details the challenges that rising global temperatures pose to roads, railways, and bridges. Extreme heat reduces road traction, buckles rail tracks, and stresses bridge joints, increasing maintenance needs and the risk of infrastructure failure. Solutions include heat-reflective coatings for roads, white paint for rail lines, and bridge designs that accommodate thermal expansion. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for maintaining transport, trade, and travel in a warming world.</p>

Proceeds will be converted into yuan and deposited in designated accounts. This marks the first time a mainland agency has detailed a process for disposing of confiscated cryptoassets through Hong Kong's virtual asset regime, as mainland China enforces a strict ban on crypto trading.</p>

Despite ongoing geopolitical tensions, the ruble has performed well this year due to capital controls and policy tightening.
