          <p>Maryam Rajavi, leader of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, addressed European lawmakers, advocating for regime change in Iran by its own people and organized resisters as the only path to regional peace. Rajavi criticized both monarchist factions supporting Reza Pahlavi and historical interventions like the 1953 coup. She emphasized that the Iranian people desire freedom and will reject any form of dictatorship, advocating for a democratic and secular republic. The NCRI, recognized as the political arm of the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran, has garnered support from prominent U.S. figures who share a hardline stance on Iran.</p>

          <p>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, threatened the U.S. with "irreparable damage" if it intervenes militarily in the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel. Khamenei stated that any American military involvement would backfire, causing greater harm to the U.S. than to Iran. Tensions have escalated following Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, prompting warnings from both sides. The U.S. has been attempting to broker a deal over Iran's nuclear program, but Trump's recent comments have fueled speculation about a potential direct U.S. military attack against Iranian sites.</p>

          <p>Oil market analysts are struggling to predict the potential impact of the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran on oil prices. Israel's recent attack on Iran's military and nuclear infrastructure has led to increased warfare between the two nations. Analysts are considering the possibility of direct U.S. involvement in the conflict and potential disruptions to oil supplies, including the potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz. An analyst at oil broker PVM described a "blanket of unease" settling upon oil markets due to the unpredictable nature of the situation.</p>

          <p>A resort town in North Carolina is facing uncertainty in its rebuilding plans following Hurricane Helene due to potential budget cuts under Donald Trump's administration. The town had been seeking federal funding for an ambitious rebuilding plan after the hurricane damaged the town's century-old dam. Trump's proposals to reduce or eliminate FEMA and shift disaster response costs to states have cast doubt on the town's recovery efforts. The initial response from FEMA had been encouraging during Joe Biden's presidency, but the future of the funding is now unclear.</p>

          <p>The Senate's tax plan for Trump's spending package aims to permanently extend the tax cuts introduced in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), while introducing new tax breaks. According to the Tax Foundation, most taxpayers will see a tax cut under the plan. Both the House and Senate versions of the bill seek to prevent tax increases that would occur if the 2017 provisions expire. The Senate bill raises the nonrefundable Child Tax Credit to $2,200 starting in 2025, and both versions eliminate taxes on tipped income, though the Senate caps the deduction at $25,000 a year.

          <p>Israel and Iran are engaged in an existential battle that could reshape the Middle East, with Iran's regime weakened and Israel determined to neutralize what it perceives as an Iranian threat. Israel seeks U.S. support to address Iran's nuclear and ballistic capabilities, aiming for a government in Tehran that does not threaten its survival. While Israel insists its mission is to remove the threat of nuclear war and terror proliferation, the conflict could destabilize the theocratic rule in Iran.

While sectors like tourism and manufacturing have suffered, high-tech, defense, and retail food industries remain strong.

          <p>New York City Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested by masked ICE agents while observing court proceedings at the federal immigration court in Lower Manhattan. He was later released, and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul stated that the charges against him were dropped. Lander's office said he was taken into custody while escorting a defendant out of immigration court, a practice he has been doing to prevent ICE arrests. Lander criticized the Trump administration for targeting New York City and its immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>British lawmakers voted to decriminalize abortion in England and Wales, approving an amendment to a crime bill that would prevent women from being criminally punished for ending a pregnancy. The amendment was introduced after police investigated over 100 women for suspected illegal abortions in the past five years. Supporters of the bill said it would keep women from going to prison for ending their pregnancy, while opponents argued it would open the door to abortion on demand at any stage of pregnancy. Changes during the COVID-19 pandemic allowed women to receive abortion pills through the mail for at-home terminations within the first 10 weeks.</p>

The Japan Tourism Agency Commissioner noted the strong momentum but highlighted the issue of visitor concentration in major metropolitan areas. Travel demand has been supported by school holidays and a surge in visitors from China, the Philippines, and the United States.

Studies suggest men and women gossip positively and negatively at similar rates, but women engage in neutral gossip more frequently. The article suggests that men's reluctance to gossip openly may stem from societal expectations and fears of appearing "messy." It also explores whether improving men's gossiping skills could help address the male loneliness epidemic, as sharing stories fosters intimacy and builds relationships.</p>

President Trump issued a warning to Tehran, demanding "unconditional surrender," while Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei rejected the ultimatum.
