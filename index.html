          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal is churning off the southeastern U.S. coast, prompting tropical storm warnings for parts of North and South Carolina. With maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, the storm is expected to make landfall before sunrise on Sunday, bringing heavy rainfall and potential flash flooding. The National Hurricane Center has warned of dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast, from Florida to the Mid-Atlantic. This system is the third named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, forming ahead of the typical early August average.</p>

          <p>In a jailhouse interview, Robert Baker, who was convicted for the 2017 murder of hairstylist Fabio Sementilli, has asserted that his former lover and the victim's wife, Monica Sementilli, was not involved in the crime. Baker, sentenced to life without parole, claimed Monica had no knowledge of the murder plot, a statement that could significantly impact her upcoming trial. Despite evidence of their affair and communications, Baker maintained her innocence, suggesting her grief was sincere and that their relationship ended after she learned he was the killer. His potential testimony remains a critical and risky element for the defense.</p>

          <p>An Alvarado, Texas, police officer was shot and injured Friday night while responding to a call near a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center. The officer, who was struck in the neck, has since been released from the hospital, and several armed suspects were arrested after fleeing the scene. In response to this and similar incidents in other cities, the Trump administration has announced a "zero tolerance" approach to any attacks on federal officers or property. The Department of Justice is coordinating with law enforcement partners to address the situation.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors are using intercepted love letters and secret recordings from jail as key evidence in the murder conspiracy case against Monica Sementilli, who is accused of plotting to kill her husband, Fabio. The communications with her lover and co-conspirator, Robert Baker, allegedly reveal an ongoing affair and a "secrecy pact" even after their arrest, featuring coded language and discussions of marriage. Authorities argue this demonstrates their commitment to the conspiracy, which they believe was motivated by love and a substantial life insurance policy. The defense maintains that the details of the affair are irrelevant to proving a murder plot.</p>

          <p>After a nearly eight-year legal saga, Monica Sementilli was found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy in the killing of her husband, celebrity hairdresser Fabio Sementilli. Prosecutors successfully argued she orchestrated the murder with her lover, Robert Baker, to collect on a life insurance policy, staging the crime to resemble a robbery. The case against her was built on extensive circumstantial evidence, including her affair with Baker, suspicious behavior on the day of the murder, and incriminating statements recorded by police. Her daughters have continued to support her, and she plans to appeal her life sentence.</p>

          <p>The recovery effort in central Texas continues after catastrophic flash floods killed at least 50 people, including 15 children, with dozens more still missing from a summer camp. As rescuers search for survivors, questions are emerging about the accuracy of weather forecasts and the potential impact of budget cuts at the National Weather Service. The disaster, which saw the Guadalupe River rise 26 feet in 45 minutes, is also being discussed in the context of the climate crisis, which makes such extreme rainfall events more common. Officials have defended their response, stating the intensity of the downpour was not predicted.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have discovered that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping the brain's "criticality," the crucial balance between excitement and inhibition in neural activity. This state of equilibrium is known to be vital for optimizing the brain's information processing capabilities. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, established a link between this genetically-influenced brain state and cognitive functions. These findings identify brain criticality as a heritable biological trait, paving the way for new research into brain function and related disorders.</p>

          <p>In a surprising turn, prosecutors dropped all charges against Barry Morphew just days before he was to stand trial for the 2022 murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew. The dismissal, made without prejudice, came after the judge barred key prosecution witnesses due to repeated discovery violations by the district attorney's office. The case has been marked by bizarre details, including a "chipmunk alibi," a spy pen, and mystery DNA evidence linked to unsolved sexual assault cases. While prosecutors stated they needed more time to find Suzanne's body, Morphew's defense declared his innocence, arguing the case was manufactured.</p>

Forensic analysis of her remains also found a mixture of tranquilizer chemicals used on wildlife, a compound to which Barry Morphew had access.

Despite a flood watch being issued hours earlier, the sheer intensity of the deluge in the pre-dawn hours caught many, including those at Camp Mystic, by surprise. The National Weather Service issued a "particularly dangerous situation" alert, but with most people asleep, the warning had limited effect.

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made his first public appearance on Saturday since the beginning of a 12-day war with Israel, which included U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Khamenei attended a religious ceremony in Tehran, ending speculation that he was in seclusion in a bunker during the conflict. The war, which Israel initiated over fears of Iran's nuclear program, resulted in hundreds of deaths, significant damage to Iran's nuclear facilities, and a retaliatory missile barrage against Israel.

Despite MI5's initial apologies and internal reviews, a High Court ruling found the inquiries "deficient," uncovering that the agency continued to withhold key evidence.

          <h2>New Communist Party Rules in China Suggest Xi Jinping Is Delegating More Authority</h2>

          <p>China's Communist Party has introduced new regulations that appear to standardize and formalize the work of its central commissions and leading groups, powerful bodies that coordinate policy. According to state media, the new rules emphasize that these organs should focus on major strategic planning and oversight. Analysts interpret this as a potential move by President Xi Jinping to delegate more authority to his deputies. This could streamline governance and may also offer a hint at his long-term plans for succession within the party's leadership structure.</p>

          <p>Australian police have arrested and charged a 34-year-old man with multiple offenses, including reckless conduct endangering life, after a synagogue in Melbourne was set on fire. The attacker doused the front doors of the East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation with an accelerant and ignited them while worshippers were inside for a Shabbat meal. No one was injured as they evacuated through a rear exit. The incident has been condemned by Australia's Prime Minister as a "cowardly" act of antisemitism, coming amid a rise in such incidents since late 2023.</p>
