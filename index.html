          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting an extensive series of votes on President Trump's significant tax and spending bill, aiming for passage by a self-imposed July 4 deadline. The legislation, dubbed "One Big, Beautiful Bill," includes increased funding for border security and defense, offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. Democrats are utilizing a "vote-a-rama" to propose numerous amendments and highlight controversial provisions, while Republicans work to secure enough votes despite internal dissent. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" has garnered support from some banks, who view it as a necessary economic stimulus. Experts from Nomura and Citi suggest the bill could boost the U.S. economy in the near term by preventing a fiscal contraction and encouraging investment, especially as provisions from the 2017 tax act are set to expire. However, critics, including the Congressional Budget Office and the Tax Foundation, express serious concerns about the bill's projected $3 trillion addition to the federal deficit and its fiscally irresponsible nature.

          <p>Iowa has become the first state to remove gender identity from its civil rights code, eliminating protections against discrimination for transgender and nonbinary residents in areas like employment and housing. The new law also defines female and male based on reproductive organs at birth and prevents changes to sex designation on birth certificates. Additionally, Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming surgery and hormone therapy is no longer provided. This legislative action, supported by Governor Kim Reynolds, faces strong opposition from LGBTQ+ advocates and has prompted some families to consider leaving the state.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit a new, remote immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, informally known as "Alligator Alcatraz." The White House emphasizes the site's isolation and dangerous wildlife as a deterrent to escape, signaling a harsh stance on immigration enforcement. The facility, which could house 5,000 detainees, has drawn criticism from immigrant activists and Native American leaders concerned about human rights and environmental impact. State officials are spearheading its construction, with significant federal funding, as the administration continues its aggressive approach to deportations.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger has agreed to plead guilty to all charges in the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, accepting a deal that spares him the death penalty.

          <p>A surge in cartel violence in Sinaloa, Mexico, has resulted in 20 deaths in less than a day, including four decapitated bodies found hanging from a bridge in Culiacan.

The city has become an epicenter of daily violence, with authorities struggling to regain control. The conflict, triggered by a dramatic kidnapping and extradition last year, has normalized intense fighting for civilians, underscoring the severe security challenges in the region.</p>

The organizations allege that Israeli forces and armed groups "routinely" fire on aid recipients, a claim Israel denies. Critics argue the GHF system violates humanitarian norms by forcing two million people into militarized zones and replacing existing distribution networks with only four military-controlled sites.

The Hargreaves Lansdown Savings and Resilience Barometer suggests that relative measures offer a better reflection of personal income needs for maintaining living standards.

The trust, which funded influential research into inequality and its financial causes for 16 years, was unexpectedly shut down, raising concerns about a shifting business attitude away from environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles. The author highlights the significant impact on social research infrastructure and the potential for a backlash from distinguished economists and academics.

          <p>China's yuan has shown unexpected strength against the US dollar, with its daily reference rate strengthening and cumulative gains observed in the second quarter. Goldman Sachs analysts attribute this to a less bearish outlook on China's near-term growth and increasing investor concerns about the sustainability of US government debt. The article notes that fading confidence in "US exceptionalism" and rising long-term financing costs are contributing to expectations of dollar depreciation. Forecasts suggest the yuan could break the 7 per dollar level in six months and 6.9 in 12 months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Four employees of Turkey's satirical magazine LeMan have been arrested for publishing a cartoon allegedly depicting the Prophet Muhammad, whose depiction is forbidden in Islam. Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya condemned the drawing as "shameless," leading to protests and an investigation for "publicly insulting religious values." LeMan denies the cartoon refers to the Prophet Muhammad, stating it intended to portray the righteousness of oppressed Muslims and never to insult religious values. The incident draws comparisons to the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack, raising concerns about freedom of expression and societal peace in Turkey.</p>

          <p>China's factory activity unexpectedly expanded in June, according to the Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI), rebounding significantly from its previous contraction. This growth, primarily seen in export-oriented manufacturers, is attributed to improved trade conditions and promotional activities. While diverging from the official PMI report, analysts suggest the Caixin survey reflects a delayed response to US-China tariff reductions.

          <p>The suspect in the fatal ambush of two firefighters and critical injury of a third in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, has been identified as 20-year-old Wess Roley, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. Kootenai County Sheriff Robert Norris stated that Roley allegedly sparked the Nettleton Gulch Fire to lure the firefighters, then opened fire with a shotgun. The deceased firefighters are Battalion Chiefs Frank Harwood and John Morrison, with engineer Dave Tysdal recovering from surgery. Authorities are investigating Roley's background, including a past desire to be a firefighter, but his motive remains unknown.</p>
