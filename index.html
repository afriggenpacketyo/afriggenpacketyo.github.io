          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of "fabricating a new war" by deploying the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, to the Caribbean. The U.S. states the deployment is part of an enhanced counter-narcotics operation, having already conducted ten air strikes on vessels in the region. However, critics and analysts suggest the significant military buildup is intended to intimidate the Maduro regime, which the U.S. does not recognize as legitimate, potentially signaling a move toward regime change rather than just disrupting drug trafficking. The action has drawn condemnation and raised fears of escalating conflict in the region.</p>

He emphasized the need to deepen cross-strait integration and foster a shared Chinese national identity. The address is seen as part of Beijing's ongoing efforts to assert its sovereignty over the self-governed island. State media quoted Wang, highlighting the Communist Party's commitment to achieving what it terms the "complete reunification of the motherland," reinforcing its firm position on the issue.</p>

A hurricane warning is currently in effect for Jamaica. While the storm is expected to bring devastating rain and winds reaching up to 140 mph to the Caribbean islands, it is not anticipated to have a major impact on the mainland United States.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly called for the prosecution of several former high-ranking Justice Department officials, including former Attorney General Merrick Garland and special counsel Jack Smith. He accuses them of illegally spying on Republican lawmakers by obtaining their phone records during the "Arctic Frost" investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. While the investigation did obtain call metadata, it did not include the content of conversations. This demand is the latest in a series of Trump's calls to prosecute political adversaries, escalating his rhetoric against the officials who investigated his actions following the election.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he is open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the demilitarized zone (DMZ) during his current trip to Asia. Speaking to reporters, Trump highlighted his previously positive relationship with Kim and acknowledged North Korea as "sort of a nuclear power," signaling a potential shift in diplomatic tone. A White House official clarified that while a meeting is not currently scheduled, the administration remains open to dialogue without preconditions, referencing the three historic summits held during Trump's first term. This development comes amid ongoing tensions and recent North Korean ballistic missile launches.</p>

          <p>A significant economic divide is emerging in the U.S., where massive spending on artificial intelligence is boosting GDP and stock market highs for tech giants like Nvidia and Alphabet. In contrast, many small and medium-sized businesses in sectors such as retail, construction, and hospitality are struggling with higher costs from tariffs and reduced consumer spending. This divergence is masking underlying weakness in the broader economy, with manufacturing and construction sectors contracting. While the AI boom propels a portion of the market, many companies remain in "survival mode," contending with inflation and a negative consumer outlook for the upcoming holiday season.</p>

Subsequently, three of her older sisters—Amelia, Aubrey, and Adalee—were also diagnosed with the condition, with some also having a tethered spinal cord.

Authorities confiscated tens of thousands of empty pens, raw ingredients, and over 2,000 unlicensed Retatrutide and Tirzepatide pens.

Local businesses and service providers report increased strain from tariffs on imported goods and federal funding cuts, which have impacted the local food bank's budget amid rising demand.

When factoring in inflation, transaction costs, and renovations, the actual losses for sellers are likely even higher.

          <p>A study by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC) indicates that mercenaries from the Russian Wagner Group systematically used military equipment intended for Mali's armed forces. The report, based on interviews and open-source intelligence, found that Wagner fighters operated armored vehicles, heavy machine guns, and drones supplied to Mali by countries like China and Turkey. This diversion of equipment could constitute a violation of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), which requires signatories to ensure weapons are not used for human rights abuses. The findings raise questions about the accountability of Mali's military junta and its Russian partners.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called off a planned deployment of federal agents to San Francisco following a direct phone call with Mayor Daniel Lurie and lobbying from prominent tech CEOs. The president's decision, which he announced on social media, was attributed to being asked "very nicely" and to the influence of his local "friends." The sudden reversal has quelled an immediate crisis but raised concerns about the arbitrary nature of basing domestic military deployments on personal relationships and politeness. While San Francisco is spared for now, the situation highlights the unpredictable governance style that can create and resolve crises with little warning.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the progressive Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, has been the target of numerous racist and Islamophobic attacks from his opponents and their allies. Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo has repeatedly made comments linking Mamdani, who would be the city's first Muslim mayor, to terrorism, while a pro-Cuomo ad used racist AI-generated imagery. Mamdani has condemned the attacks as desperate and bigoted, while observers have noted the unusually personal and vitriolic nature of the campaign. Despite the barrage of insults, supporters credit Mamdani with handling the situation with grace and staying focused on his grassroots platform.</p>

          <p>A new California law, effective January 1, will permit the year-round hunting of non-native mute swans to control their expanding population and protect the state's fragile wetlands. Wildlife officials argue the large, aggressive birds degrade habitats by overconsuming aquatic vegetation and displacing native waterfowl. The bill, sponsored by California Waterfowl Association, adds mute swans to the list of invasive species that can be hunted with few restrictions. While supporters see it as a necessary conservation tool, some animal advocacy groups have condemned the law as inhumane and an attempt to expand hunting opportunities.</p>

          <p>As the federal government shutdown extends into its fourth week, federal employees are facing growing economic hardship and stress, with many about to miss their first full paycheck. Union representatives report that workers are becoming increasingly desperate, making arrangements to liquidate assets or find secondary income to survive. The stalemate in Washington continues, with the Trump administration threatening to withhold back pay and enact cuts to federal programs. This prolonged uncertainty is causing significant psychological distress for employees who are furloughed or working without pay, exacerbating concerns about attrition in critical agencies like the EPA.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has euthanized four gray wolves from the Beyem Seyo pack following an unprecedented increase in livestock kills in the Sierra Valley. Officials stated that these specific wolves were responsible for 70 cattle losses and had become dangerously reliant on livestock for food, a habit they were passing to their offspring. The decision was made after non-lethal methods, such as hazing, failed to deter the attacks. The move highlights the ongoing conflict between the state's conservation goals for the rebounding wolf population and the economic concerns of local ranchers.</p>

          <p>Low-income residents in the rural South, particularly in Louisiana and Mississippi, are facing anxiety over significant cuts to Medicaid included in a new federal law signed by President Trump. The legislation will introduce work reporting requirements and more frequent eligibility checks, which researchers estimate could cause over 300,000 Louisianans to lose their health coverage. In communities like East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, where Medicaid expansion has been a critical lifeline, the impending changes threaten to reverse gains in health coverage. Local healthcare providers and residents express fear that the cuts will devastate already struggling rural areas with limited job opportunities.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece argues that the Trump administration's recent air strikes against suspected "narco-terrorist" boats off the coast of Venezuela and Colombia are part of a long, problematic history of U.S. intervention in Latin America. The author contends that these extrajudicial actions, framed as part of a war on drugs, serve as a political distraction and rally support by scapegoating Latinos. This approach, rooted in the Monroe Doctrine, has historically treated the region as a subordinate territory for U.S. interests, leading to instability and justifying aggressive policies.

Female tarantulas are known to be cannibalistic, sometimes eating their suitors before or even after mating. While their venomous bite is not dangerous to humans, these large, hairy arachnids can defend themselves by flicking irritating hairs from their abdomens, adding another layer to their dramatic annual ritual.</p>
