          <p>WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert has publicly denied making comments suggesting rookie star Caitlin Clark should be grateful for the league's platform, calling Clark a "transformational player." The allegations arose from player Napheesa Collier, who also claimed Engelbert made disparaging remarks about players' appreciation for a media rights deal. While Engelbert called reports inaccurate, she acknowledged a need to improve if players feel unappreciated, especially as the league and players' union negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 300,000 Venezuelan migrants. This action freezes a lower court's ruling that had found the termination illegal, allowing the administration to end protections that let migrants live and work in the U.S. without immediate deportation threats. The Department of Homeland Security praised the decision as a win for "commonsense," while immigrant advocacy groups criticized it, warning it will upend hundreds of thousands of lives. This decision marks the second time the high court has sided with the administration on this issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom saw a record number of electric vehicle (EV) sales in September, with pure battery electric vehicles growing by nearly a third. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers (SMMT), electrified vehicles, including hybrids, accounted for over half of all new car registrations for the month. This growth is attributed to manufacturer discounts, a wider variety of models, and a government grant scheme aimed at encouraging the transition from petrol and diesel cars. Despite the surge, the majority of these purchases were made by businesses for fleet use rather than private buyers.</p>

          <p>Newly released court records reveal that a Kansas sheriff’s deputy, now charged with second-degree murder, knelt on a handcuffed Black man's back for 86 seconds. The incident occurred in the Wyandotte County detention center and led to the death of Charles Adair, who was incarcerated for misdemeanor traffic violations. An autopsy determined Adair died from complications of mechanical asphyxia, and his death was ruled a homicide. The deputy’s attorney claims his client acted reasonably, describing the death as a tragic accident, while attorneys for Adair's family are demanding the public release of body camera footage.</p>

          <p>Following a court order for PPE Medpro to repay £122 million for supplying substandard medical gowns, a company spokesperson stated that most of the funds were passed to partner firms. The spokesperson argued that administrators should pursue these other companies, including Loudwater Trade and Finance, for the £83 million they received as part of the consortium. PPE Medpro, which was connected to Baroness Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman, has initiated administration proceedings but has assets of only £666,000. The Department of Health and Social Care has pledged to recover as much money as possible.</p>

          <p>A memo from the Department of Health and Human Services reveals a Trump administration plan to offer unaccompanied migrant children aged 14 and older a $2,500 stipend to voluntarily depart the U.S. This new policy, which excludes minors from Mexico, is a significant shift from established protocols that typically require judicial and legal oversight for such decisions. Immigration advocates and legal experts have expressed alarm, suggesting the incentive could exploit vulnerable children and pressure them to waive their legal rights and return to dangerous conditions. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed the plan, framing it as a way to give minors a choice about their future.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to parts of a peace proposal outlined by President Trump, including the release of all hostages and handing over administrative control of Gaza to an independent Palestinian body. However, the group indicated that other aspects of the 20-point plan require further negotiation. In response, President Trump urged Israel to immediately halt its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe release of hostages, stating he believes Hamas is "ready for a lasting PEACE." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed preparations to implement the first phase of the plan.</p>

          <p>Music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs was sentenced to 50 months in prison for prostitution-related offenses, a term significantly shorter than what prosecutors sought but longer than his defense requested. During the hearing, Combs expressed remorse, stating he took full responsibility for his actions and had gotten "lost in excess." The judge, however, was not fully persuaded by claims of reform, pointing to continued abusive behavior even after a public apology. The sentence concludes a high-profile trial where Combs was acquitted of more serious sex-trafficking and racketeering charges but convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.</p>

          <p>A California resident has been sentenced to eight years and one month in federal prison after pleading guilty to the attempted assassination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2022.

After seeing U.S. Marshals outside the residence, Roske called 911 on herself and was arrested.

This concern is bipartisan and is particularly strong among older Americans, who almost universally condemn such acts. The findings also highlight a growing pessimism about the ability of people with differing political views to unite, with fewer than half of respondents feeling comfortable expressing their political opinions publicly. The survey suggests that while most people believe politics drives division, they see little hope for bridging the partisan gap.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally or on a temporary basis. This decision upholds a lower court's injunction against the president's executive order, marking the fifth time a federal court has blocked the policy. The court determined that the order likely violates the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment, which has historically been interpreted to grant birthright citizenship. The Trump administration has already appealed to the Supreme Court, setting up a potential definitive ruling on the matter.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government shutdown is set to continue into a second week after the Senate failed for a fourth time to pass spending proposals from either party. The central point of contention remains healthcare, with Democrats seeking to protect low-income insurance subsidies and Republicans accusing them of trying to fund healthcare for undocumented immigrants. With negotiations deadlocked, the White House has warned of potential mass layoffs of federal workers to maintain essential services if the shutdown persists. The impasse has led to the suspension of billions in federal infrastructure funding for several cities and states.</p>

          <p>Omaha's police chief acknowledged that Black individuals are disproportionately subjected to forceful police stops nationwide, following public outrage over the treatment of boxing champion Terence Crawford. Crawford, who is Black, was pulled from his car at gunpoint during a traffic stop just hours after a city-wide celebration in his honor. The chief stated that an internal investigation found the officers did not violate department policy, as the stop was initiated for reckless driving and escalated when officers saw a firearm in the vehicle. The incident has intensified existing tensions between Omaha's Black community and its police force.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired Navy chief of staff Jon Harrison, a powerful aide known for restructuring the service's bureaucracy. The abrupt dismissal occurred shortly after the confirmation of Navy Undersecretary Hung Cao.

This move is part of a series of leadership changes within the Pentagon under Hegseth, who has also replaced the heads of several military branches.</p>

          <p>An Arkansas man from India is fighting to restore his visa status after being detained by ICE for a month due to a misunderstanding during a traffic stop. Police arrested Kapil Raghu after finding a perfume bottle labeled "Opium," mistaking it for illegal narcotics despite his protests. Although a state crime lab confirmed the substance was perfume and charges were dropped, the arrest triggered an immigration hold because of an error with his visa paperwork. Now classified with a "deportation" status, Raghu is unable to work and is asking immigration authorities to resolve his case.</p>

          <p>Police have revealed that Jihad Al-Shamie, the man who killed two people in a knife and car attack at a Manchester synagogue, was on bail after being arrested on suspicion of sexual assault. The victims, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, are being hailed as heroes for protecting others during the attack on Yom Kippur. Authorities believe Al-Shamie may have been influenced by extremist ideology and have arrested three more individuals on terrorism-related suspicions. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is investigating the use of lethal force by officers, which resulted in the attacker's death and the accidental shooting of a victim.</p>

          <p>The creator of ICEBlock, an app for tracking sightings of immigration enforcement agents, is demanding that Apple reinstate the app on its online store. Developer Joshua Aaron criticized the Trump administration for pressuring Apple into the ban, framing the issue as an infringement on constitutional rights. Apple removed the app citing "safety risks" communicated by law enforcement, a move that Google later mirrored with similar apps. Aaron compared his app to traffic-monitoring tools like Waze and stated he created it to help immigrants fearful of deportation, drawing parallels to historical persecution.</p>

The Danish Defence Intelligence Service has accused Russia of using hybrid warfare tactics to undermine the state.
