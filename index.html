          <p>French cinema star GÃ©rard Depardieu has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in 2021 and given an 18-month suspended jail term. The court found that one of the women, a set designer named AmÃ©lie, had given consistent evidence while the actor's accounts had changed over time. He has also been convicted of assaulting an assistant director called Sarah. Several other women have made similar allegations in the media, and an alleged sexual assault case could come to trial.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK jobs market continues to show signs of weakening, with the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5% and the number of workers on company payrolls falling. Job vacancies have also declined, suggesting a cooling labor market. Analysts believe that the recent increase in employer National Insurance contributions and the National Living Wage may be contributing to this trend. Wage growth remains relatively strong, which may cause the Bank of England to proceed cautiously with future interest rate cuts.</p>
