          <h2>Trump Reportedly Indicates Intent to Fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 11:37:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A senior White House official has indicated that President Trump may soon move to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The statement came after the president reportedly asked Republican lawmakers for their opinion on the matter during an Oval Office meeting, where they expressed their approval. This development follows a period of sustained public criticism from the administration aimed at pressuring the central bank to lower interest rates. While the timing remains uncertain, the move would be an unprecedented challenge to the Federal Reserve's independence, as Powell has previously stated such a firing is not permitted under law.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has unveiled a proposal for a new seven-year budget totaling 2 trillion euros, which includes a significant fivefold increase in defense and space funding. The plan allocates 131 billion euros to these sectors as part of a new European Competitiveness Fund designed to bolster regional investment. Approximately 35% of the total budget is earmarked for climate and biodiversity initiatives, with the EU looking to introduce new revenue streams to fund the framework without increasing member state contributions. The proposal must now be approved by the European Parliament and member states, with some officials already expressing concerns that the budget is too high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump has emerged as a potential influence on President Trump's approach to the war in Ukraine, according to recent presidential comments. The president revealed that his wife has repeatedly highlighted Russia's continued aggression, contrasting it with Vladimir Putin's diplomatic assurances. This has led to a wave of positive attention on Ukrainian social media, where she has been dubbed "Agent Melania Trumpenko" and praised for her perceived support. The article notes that while her influence is being discussed, the U.S. has resumed arms exports to Ukraine, but on the condition that European partners bear the cost.</p>

          <p>The case of a missing American tourist in Turks and Caicos remains shrouded in mystery, as a male body found over ten days ago has yet to be identified. Brian Tarrence, a 51-year-old business executive, vanished in late June after leaving his vacation rental in the early morning hours. A search and rescue operation on July 5 led to the discovery of a decomposed body in the same town, but authorities have not confirmed if it is Tarrence. The tourist's disappearance occurred on the same day a security guard was fatally shot nearby, though no connection between the two incidents has been established by police.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly decried the ongoing controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case as a "Hoax" and "bulls***," while criticizing members of his own party for focusing on the issue. In a social media post, he labeled Republicans calling for more transparency as "weaklings" and stated he no longer wants their support. This statement underscores a significant division within the GOP, as prominent conservatives and allies like House Speaker Mike Johnson have urged the administration to release more information. The president has defended Attorney General Pam Bondi's handling of the files, which has been a central point of contention for his supporters.</p>

          <p>A nurse in Scotland, Sandie Peggie, has been cleared of gross misconduct by NHS Fife following a dispute over sharing a changing room with a transgender colleague. Peggie was suspended last year after objecting to Dr. Beth Upton, a transgender woman, using female facilities at a hospital. An internal hearing found insufficient evidence to support the allegations, which included misconduct and misgendering. The decision was announced as a related employment tribunal, where Peggie claims unlawful treatment under the Equality Act, resumed. The case has highlighted the complexities of balancing transgender inclusion with the concerns of other staff members regarding single-sex spaces.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have decided to protect the U.S.-backed global HIV/AIDS program, PEPFAR, from a broader government spending reduction effort. Lawmakers plan to remove a proposed $400 million cut to the program, which was part of a larger $9 billion rescissions package targeting areas like international aid and public broadcasting. The move came after several senators from both parties expressed concern over cutting funds for PEPFAR, a program widely credited with saving millions of lives, particularly in Africa. The White House has reportedly agreed to the amendment, which is seen as a significant reversal amid the administration's push to decrease government spending.</p>

However, his fitness tracker showed minimal movement during the night of the murder, corroborating his story that he was asleep at home. This technological evidence, along with data from the victim's car, shifted the investigation, leading to the identification and conviction of another man, George Burch, whose own phone data placed him at the crime scenes.</p>

          <p>An independent review has concluded that the UK's Prevent counter-terrorism program missed a significant opportunity to intervene in the case of Axel Rudakubana, who later carried out a deadly knife attack in Southport. Lord David Anderson KC stated that despite teachers referring Rudakubana to Prevent three times due to his obsession with violence, his case was closed because he lacked a specific terrorist ideology. The review calls for the program to focus on individuals fascinated with extreme violence, regardless of ideological motive.

          <p>Three Democratic senators have raised alarms about a new searchable citizenship data system developed by the Trump administration, fearing it could lead to the wrongful disenfranchisement of eligible voters. The Department of Homeland Security system links federal immigration databases with Social Security data, allowing election officials to check citizenship status. In a letter to DHS, the senators expressed concern about the system's accuracy and the lack of public transparency in its rollout. They highlighted that the administration had privately briefed a Trump-aligned group on the tool while withholding information from Congress and the public.</p>

However, total revenue of $26.61 billion missed analysts' forecasts, primarily due to net interest income (NII) coming in lower than anticipated. Despite the NII miss, the bank highlighted resilient consumer spending and good momentum in its markets businesses, with fixed income trading revenue exceeding expectations.

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's new 'One Canadian Economy Act,' designed to fast-track major infrastructure and resource projects, is facing opposition from Indigenous leaders. The law aims to create special economic zones for development, including in the mineral-rich 'Ring of Fire' region in northern Ontario. However, First Nations communities fear the legislation undermines their constitutional rights to consultation and consent regarding projects on their traditional lands. They argue that the government's approach prioritizes economic development over environmental protection and their sovereign rights, setting the stage for potential conflict over future projects.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin and Ether, rose on Wednesday amid renewed investor optimism that key stablecoin legislation could pass the House this week. The rally followed a brief dip after a procedural snag delayed a vote on the GENIUS Act, a bill that would regulate stablecoins. President Trump later indicated that House Republicans who had blocked the bill have since changed their minds after a White House meeting. Analysts suggest the bill's eventual passage is likely, which would provide much-needed regulatory clarity and could further bolster the crypto ecosystem, particularly for stablecoin issuers and related platforms.

The K-9, a bloodhound named Georgia, was found deceased inside the vehicle's kennel as the heat index soared above 100 degrees. An investigation revealed that both the car's air conditioning and its heat alarm safety system had malfunctioned.

The new conviction is for insulting and threatening Istanbul's chief prosecutor. While Imamoglu is already in pre-trial detention on separate corruption charges, this sentence adds to the legal pressure he faces. If his previous conviction for insulting election officials is upheld on appeal, he could be barred from participating in future elections.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has strongly criticized a plan by Texas Republicans, encouraged by President Trump, to redraw the state's congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Newsom warned that if Texas proceeds with this unusual mid-decade gerrymandering to increase GOP seats, California might reconsider its own nonpartisan redistricting process. While Newsom suggested California Democrats could "gerrymander like no other state," legal experts note that California's constitution, which mandates an independent commission and restricts redistricting to once per decade, makes such a move legally and practically difficult. The situation highlights escalating partisan tensions over electoral rules.</p>

The review, commissioned after safety concerns were raised, also suggests PAs should wear distinct uniforms and only see new patients with minor ailments after they have been triaged. This follows cases where patients suffered harm after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors.
