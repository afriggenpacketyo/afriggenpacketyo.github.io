          <p>China's latest aircraft carrier, the Fujian, recently sailed through the Taiwan Strait en route to the South China Sea for routine exercises, according to the Chinese navy. This transit is part of the carrier's construction process and is not aimed at any specific target, the navy stated. China claims the Taiwan Strait as its territory, a claim rejected by Taiwan's government. The Fujian, more advanced than China's other carriers, is undergoing sea trials before formally entering service, marking a steady expansion of China's naval power in the Pacific region. The routine transit showcases China's increasing maritime capabilities. Optimism score is 75.</p>

Other Asian markets also traded higher, following Wall Street's overnight gains, with the Nikkei 225 hitting a fresh record high.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California State Assembly passed Senate Bill 79, a controversial housing bill, which allows for denser housing near public transit hubs, overriding local zoning laws. Introduced by state Sen. Scott Wiener, the bill aims to address California's housing shortage by enabling taller buildings near transit corridors. The bill faced criticism from local authorities who argue it strips them of promoting responsible growth, but gained support after amendments added union hiring requirements. The bill is now awaiting a final Senate concurrence vote and Governor Newsom's signature to take effect, potentially reshaping single-family neighborhoods near transit stops. Optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned of a response to what he termed a "witch hunt" against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who was sentenced to 27 years in prison for plotting a coup. Rubio criticized the conviction as unjust and attacked Justice Alexandre de Moraes. The U.S. Treasury had previously sanctioned de Moraes, drawing criticism from Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who defended Brazil's judicial independence. Analysts suggest the U.S.-Brazil relationship is at a low point, with potential measures including tariff increases and financial sanctions, leading to a complex geopolitical situation. Optimism score is 35.</p>

          <p>Denmark's cancer survival rates have significantly improved due to a bold plan that included investments in equipment, new national standards, and thoughtful touches in hospitals. The country now has more CT scanners per capita compared to the UK, leading to expanded diagnostic capacity. Patients are guaranteed a diagnosis within two weeks and treatment within two weeks of diagnosis, with the option to transfer to another hospital if targets are not met. The Danish model also focuses on improving the patient experience through counselling and at-home chemotherapy, providing a blueprint for the NHS. Optimism score is 70.</p>
