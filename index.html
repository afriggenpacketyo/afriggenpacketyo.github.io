          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren SÃ¡nchez are celebrating their wedding in Venice, Italy, drawing a host of high-profile celebrities. Guests including Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kim Kardashian were seen arriving for the pre-ceremony events. The influx of stars has sparked some local backlash, with a "No Space for Bezos" campaign emerging amidst broader European protests against over-tourism. This marks the second marriage for both Bezos, 61, and SÃ¡nchez, 55, who both divorced their previous spouses in 2019.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has dismissed Omead Afshar, Tesla's vice president of manufacturing and operations, as the company grapples with declining car sales in key markets. Afshar, who reported directly to Musk, had previously been the subject of an internal investigation in 2022 but was later promoted. This termination follows another high-level departure and comes as Tesla's stock has underperformed this year.

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has publicly declared victory over Israel, claiming to have crushed the "Zionist regime" and dealt a "big slap in the face" to the U.S. However, these claims are starkly contrasted by reports from U.S. and Israeli intelligence, which indicate Iran's nuclear program was set back by years and its missile attacks caused minimal strategic damage. While Iran's government maintains it will continue its nuclear program, the IAEA has expressed grave concern over new legislation halting cooperation, warning of a potential major crisis.</p>

          <p>Arizona's iconic saguaro cactus, a symbol of the American Southwest adapted to desert life, is now struggling to survive due to rising temperatures. Researchers at the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix report a significant increase in the saguaro death rate, jumping from 1-2% to nearly 7% annually in recent years. This mortality rate far outpaces the century-long reproductive cycle of the cactus, leading to "graveyard conditions" in some areas. Scientists are now working to identify and cultivate more resilient saguaro varieties to help the species withstand a hotter, drier future.</p>

Tucker, who was released by the Ravens in May, will be eligible for reinstatement in November.

          <p>The Trump administration is considering deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a country other than his native El Salvador if he is released from jail, according to a government lawyer. Abrego Garcia was previously deported to El Salvador in what was called an "administrative error," violating a court order that barred his removal there due to fears of gang persecution. After being returned to the U.S. to face smuggling charges, a judge ordered his pre-trial release, but he remains in custody as legal battles continue over his fate and potential future deportation.</p>

While the House passed the bill by a narrow margin, its fate in the Senate is uncertain, with several moderate Republicans uncommitted. Democrats have strongly opposed the bill, citing massive cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs. A recent ruling by the Senate parliamentarian against a key Medicaid provision further complicates the bill's path, potentially increasing its already substantial projected addition to the national deficit.</p>

An analysis by BBC Verify reveals that despite some overall improvement, over a third of hospital trusts have seen their performance worsen since an improvement plan was announced. The 18-week waiting time target has not been met since 2015, and patient groups express skepticism about whether the rapid progress needed is achievable.
