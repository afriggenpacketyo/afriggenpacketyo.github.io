          <p>Nearly 4,000 NASA employees, constituting about 20% of the agency's workforce, have opted to leave through a deferred resignation program. This significant reduction in staff coincides with administration proposals for substantial budget cuts for the space agency, though Congress is considering maintaining current funding levels. The move has drawn criticism from scientists and space organizations who worry about its impact on American leadership in space exploration and scientific research.</p>

          <p>The father of a fallen IDF major is publicly advocating for a broader military draft in Israel, specifically calling for the inclusion of the Haredi community. He highlighted that the Israeli army has significantly downsized over the past 15 years, creating an unsustainable burden on current soldiers amid growing threats. Citing the high casualty rates among military leaders in the current conflict, he argued that all sectors of society must share the responsibility of national defense.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to better protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from residents of new property developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing, a policy known as "agent of change." The reforms also aim to make it easier to open new bars and promote outdoor dining and performances to help revitalize struggling town centers and support the hospitality industry.</p>

          <p>Opposition lawmakers in Taiwan have successfully survived a recall vote, allowing them to retain their controlling majority in the legislature and prolonging the island's political gridlock. The recall campaign was initiated by groups accusing the opposition parties of being "pro-China" and intentionally undermining national security by blocking the ruling party's agenda. The failure of the recall effort means President William Lai will likely face an emboldened, opposition-controlled parliament for the remainder of his term.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered how a convicted fraudster orchestrated an elaborate plan for a massive, fake music festival in Wales called Monmouth Rising. The man, described as a "fantasist," created a fictitious lineup of major headliners like The Killers, claimed non-existent investors, and used allegedly forged documents to lend credibility to the scheme. The hoax unraveled when he failed to pay employees and suppliers, leaving a trail of financial losses and broken promises.</p>
