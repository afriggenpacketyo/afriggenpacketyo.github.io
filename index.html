          <p>Investors are showing a preference for short-term Treasury investments, driven by concerns about market volatility and the stability of yields on the shorter end of the fixed-income market. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 T-Bill ETF (BIL) have seen substantial inflows, indicating a trend towards ultrashort opportunities. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has also increased its holdings in T-bills, now owning 5% of all short-term Treasuries. This shift suggests a lack of confidence in long-duration investments amidst current economic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An attack near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip resulted in the deaths of over 50 people and numerous injuries, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and witnesses. Witnesses reported gunfire from multiple directions, including naval warships, tanks, and drones, while the Israeli military denied firing at civilians in the area. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) stated it delivered aid without incident, dismissing reports of casualties, but the incident occurred amidst faltering ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas. International aid agencies have criticized the new aid system, citing violations of humanitarian principles and Israeli control over aid distribution.</p>

Root surpassed Eoin Morgan to become England's leading run-scorer in one-day internationals, leading a recovery from a shaky start. Keacy Carty's century and half-centuries from Brandon King and Shai Hope set up West Indies' total, but England's sloppy fielding aided their efforts. Root's partnership with Will Jacks proved crucial, despite a late scare from Alzarri Joseph, ultimately sealing the win for England.</p>

          <p>Ukraine launched a large-scale drone attack into Russian territory, reportedly destroying 40 military bombers, as it prepares for another round of ceasefire talks in Istanbul. Ukrainian security sources claimed the operation, supervised by President Zelenskyy, took over a year and a half to execute. The drones hit airfields, including the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk region, marking the first time a Ukrainian drone has been seen in the area. The attack occurred as Kyiv announced a Russian military strike killed at least 12 soldiers at an army training site.</p>
