          <p>Consumer advocates are raising concerns about the increasing debt burden associated with Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services, as credit card debt in the U.S. exceeds $1 trillion. BNPL companies, like Klarna and Affirm, are partnering with major retailers, making it easier for consumers to accumulate debt through installment payments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has recently decided not to enforce regulations against BNPL companies, raising concerns about consumer protection. Research indicates that BNPL users are prone to overspending and may experience early signs of financial distress. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>A study of Brazilian football fans suggests that the collective rituals surrounding a match, such as the arrival of the team bus and collective chanting, can be more emotionally intense than the game itself. The study, based on heart rate monitoring, highlights the importance of football as a collective ritual and a public theatre of identity. Sociologists argue that watching football elicits a diverse range of emotions and psychological states, and understanding these requires examining the cultural and historical context. In an increasingly individualized world, football's communitarian cultures offer a sense of belonging and authenticity. </p>

The scholars argue that criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza should not be conflated with antisemitism.

          <p>Following immigration raids in Los Angeles, families, including those with young children, have allegedly been held in cramped conditions with insufficient food and water. Lawyers from the Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef) reported that one family of five was given minimal provisions over a 48-hour period. The situation unfolds as the U.S. prepares to deploy Marines to Los Angeles to assist with immigration enforcement, a move prompted by protests against the raids. A federal judge also ruled that the Trump administration could no longer detain a Palestinian activist based on claims of being a threat to foreign policy. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants has led to a radical escalation in enforcement tactics, including targeting undocumented workers and employing violent methods. While Trump has successfully deterred immigration, this has resulted in lower deportation figures, prompting the administration to intensify enforcement against long-term residents. The slowdown in new arrivals is hurting the US economy by exacerbating labor shortages and slowing economic growth. Despite the political popularity of immigration restriction, the current policies are causing social tension and economic disruption. </p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced a sharp contraction of 0.3% in April, according to data from the Office for National Statistics, following a 0.2% growth in March. The decline is attributed to the implementation of global trade tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump and domestic tax increases. The ONS noted a significant fall in goods exports to the United States due to the newly introduced tariffs. Despite the initial economic downturn, Britain has since established a trade agreement with the U.S., becoming the first nation to do so. (not investment advice) </p>
