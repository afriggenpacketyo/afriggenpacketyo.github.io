        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung expressed concern that a recent US immigration raid on a Hyundai factory could negatively impact future South Korean investments in the United States. The raid, which involved the detention of approximately 300 South Korean workers in Georgia, has raised questions about the risks of establishing plants in the US. Lee stated that South Korean companies may hesitate about making direct investments in the US under the current circumstances and that Seoul is in talks with Washington to ease tensions, including securing additional visa quotas for investment-related purposes. The incident has caused outrage in South Korea, especially after a major trade agreement between the two countries. The situation is being closely monitored as it could influence future economic relations. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>A shooting at Evergreen High School near Denver, Colorado, resulted in two students being wounded and the suspect, believed to be a student, fatally shooting himself. Deputies responded to numerous 911 calls and made contact with the shooter within five minutes, and no law enforcement officers fired any weapons. The shooting took place both inside and outside the school building, and a handgun was used. Jefferson County Schools set up a reunification center for parents and guardians, but the reunification process was reportedly bumpy. School was canceled for several schools in the area for the remainder of the week, and officials urged community members to check in with their loved ones. The optimism score is 10.</p>

          <p>NBA commissioner Adam Silver announced that the league is investigating allegations that the Los Angeles Clippers circumvented the salary cap by orchestrating an endorsement deal for Kawhi Leonard with a fraudulent sustainability firm called Aspiration. The investigation will focus on whether Clippers owner Steve Ballmer's investment in Aspiration was a quid pro quo for the firm to give Leonard $28 million in cash and $20 million in Aspiration stock. Silver stated that the NBA would need to uncover clear evidence that the Clippers violated rules for Ballmer to be punished. The investigation will be conducted by a law firm specializing in internal investigations, and the NBA will act based on provable evidence to protect the integrity of the league. The optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion brands are diversifying their product lines by introducing less expensive items, such as $160 lipsticks and $1,400 accessories, to attract a broader consumer base amid an industry-wide slowdown. Louis Vuitton's beauty collection is a recent example of this trend, with other brands like Prada and Celine also expanding into cosmetics. This strategy aims to engage with aspirational consumers without diluting the exclusivity of core offerings, and the beauty category offers high gross margins. Brands hope that these lower-priced entry points will foster brand loyalty among younger shoppers, but they must balance broadening appeal with maintaining exclusivity. The optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>UK ambassador to the United States, Lord Mandelson, faces scrutiny over his friendship with the late Jeffrey Epstein, with new revelations surfacing about their correspondence. A cabinet minister expressed surprise at the news, and questions are being raised about the Prime Minister's decision to appoint Mandelson given his past controversies. Bloomberg reportedly approached Mandelson with over 100 emails between him and Epstein, including one from 2008 where Mandelson encouraged Epstein to "fight for early release" as the financier prepared to be jailed for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Mandelson has acknowledged the emails but stated he relied on assurances of Epstein's innocence. The situation has sparked criticism from Labour MPs and calls for Mandelson's resignation, but Downing Street insists it has full confidence in him. The optimism score is 30.</p>

          <p>Nathalie Tocci argues that the transatlantic relationship between Europe and the US may never recover to its previous state, regardless of whether Donald Trump remains in power. She suggests that the rift is structural rather than temporary, and even under Joe Biden, the relationship is unlikely to return to its former closeness. Tocci outlines two potential scenarios: one where Europe and the US engage in transactional relationships based on converging interests, and another, more ominous scenario, where the world is divided into empires with the US, Russia, China, and potentially India vying for influence. She emphasizes that Europe must accept the changing dynamics and pursue strategic autonomy to avoid being caught between competing imperial ambitions. The optimism score is 35.</p>

          <p>The campus killing of Charlie Kirk has laid bare America's broken politics, highlighting the increasing political violence and divisiveness in the country. Kirk, a conservative activist, was shot while debating political opponents at a university in Utah, and the incident has prompted shock, grief, and anger across the political spectrum. The shooting is seen as another episode of gun violence and the latest in a series of recent political attacks, and some experts fear it will inflame an already-fractured country. President Trump blamed the "radical left" for Kirk's murder, while others called for a cooling of rhetoric and condemned political violence. The optimism score is 10.</p>

          <p>A report claims that San Francisco's housing costs have returned to "normal," referring to July 2018 levels, based on a mortgage payment-to-income ratio. While home-price growth is slowing and mortgage rates are falling, this does not mean the city is affordable. The analysis indicates that the market is returning to a pre-pandemic equilibrium due to high tech salaries. However, this trend does not reflect the reality for renters, as the artificial intelligence boom is spiking rents and crowding out lower-wage tenants. The optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has discovered rocks in a dry river channel that may contain potential signs of ancient microscopic life. Scientists emphasize that in-depth analysis is needed before drawing any conclusions. The rover cannot directly detect life, but it carries a drill to collect samples from areas suitable for hosting life billions of years ago. The sample, collected from reddish, clay-rich mudstones, contains organic carbon and specks enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide, which are byproducts of microorganisms on Earth. The retrieval of the samples to Earth is currently on hold as NASA seeks cheaper options. The optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has appealed a federal judge's order that prevents him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The appeal follows a judge's ruling that Trump's attempted removal of Cook likely violated the Federal Reserve Act, which requires legal cause for such actions. Trump claimed he was firing Cook due to mortgage fraud allegations, which she denies, but her attorneys argue this is a pretext for pressuring the Fed to cut interest rates.
