          <p>The Buss family is reportedly selling a controlling interest in the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter, the current owner of the L.A. Dodgers, in a deal valued at $10 billion, making the Lakers the most valuable sports franchise globally. Jeanie Buss will retain the title of governor, representing the team in league matters. Walter also owns the Professional Women's Hockey League, the Los Angeles Sparks, and has interests in Premier League soccer club Chelsea and the Cadillac Formula 1 racing team. The Lakers have won 11 NBA titles since the Buss family's acquisition in 1979 and this deal marks the second time in six months the Lakers have stunned the sports world, following the acquisition of Luka Dončić. </p>

          <p>Chinese ambassador Xie Feng addressed the US-China Business Council, calling the trade relationship "generally balanced" but criticizing US tariffs on Chinese imports as "unreasonably high." He argued that US export controls, visa denials, and barriers to Chinese firms hinder deficit reduction. Xie stated China is willing to buy more from America, but the US restricts exports of competitive products like semiconductors. Earlier in June, the US agreed to ease some restrictions in exchange for increased exports of critical minerals from China, with talks ongoing to implement a trade consensus reached in May.

The Dodgers' silence had drawn criticism from fans, prompting calls for the team to address the situation. Manager Dave Roberts hoped the team could be a positive distraction, while utilityman Kiké Hernández expressed solidarity with the affected communities. The announcement follows controversy over a Spanish version of the national anthem sung at a game as a protest against the raids, and the silence on the situation will soon be broken.</p>

Park Sae-hwan, the head of the circus, worries about its potential disappearance and hopes to preserve it as part of South Korea's performing arts legacy. The circus now employs only Chinese acrobats, as the job is generally avoided by South Koreans, and Dongchoon is performing at a big top at a seaside tourist area in Ansan.</p>

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp. CEO Eiji Hashimoto stated that U.S. Steel is of growing strategic importance, as higher U.S. tariffs on steel products are likely to remain in place. He believes Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel should help the U.S. economy, but trade levies will not revive its manufacturing sector. Nippon Steel finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary, following approval from President Trump and a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government.

The trial ended in a not-guilty verdict after the first proceedings collapsed due to the jury being unable to reach a verdict.</p>
