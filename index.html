          <p>Miki Sudo has once again won the women's division of the annual Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, a Fourth of July tradition in Coney Island, New York. The 39-year-old champion consumed 32 hot dogs and buns in ten minutes to claim her 11th victory in the event. While she fell short of her 2024 world record of 51 hot dogs, she comfortably beat her closest competitor, Michelle Lesco, who finished with 22. The contest, which offers a $20,000 prize, continues to be a major holiday spectacle, with the men's competition following later in the day.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new trade pact with Vietnam, imposing a 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods and a 40% tariff on items transshipped through Vietnam from other countries. This move directly targets Chinese manufacturers who have been using Vietnam to bypass hefty US tariffs, a practice the White House claims accounts for a third of Vietnam's exports. Economists and trade experts question how Vietnam will enforce the distinction between locally manufactured goods and transshipments, as the impact could range from minimal to highly disruptive for supply chains depending on the interpretation of the rules.

          <p>The sentence given to a 15-year-old boy for the killing of 80-year-old Bhim Kohli in Leicestershire is set to be reviewed. The boy, who was convicted of manslaughter, received a seven-year custody sentence for the attack, which occurred while Kohli was walking his dog. A 13-year-old girl who filmed and encouraged the assault was given a youth rehabilitation order. The Attorney General's Office has referred the case to be examined under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme following public concern over the perceived lightness of the punishment for the racially aggravated crime.</p>

          <p>Despite Chinese state media criticizing the addictive nature of "blind box" toys and calling for tighter regulations, analysts believe Pop Mart, maker of the popular Labubu dolls, will remain resilient. The company's primary demographic consists of young adults and millennials, not the children under eight that the proposed regulations target. Furthermore, Pop Mart has seen explosive international growth, with overseas sales in 2024 surpassing its total sales from 2021, which is expected to cushion any potential impact from domestic policy changes. The brand's success highlights a unique consumer trend in an otherwise sluggish Chinese economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia has officially recognized the Taliban's government in Afghanistan, becoming the first country to do so since the group seized power in 2021. The move, which involved accepting credentials from a new Afghan ambassador in Moscow, was welcomed by China and hailed as a "historic step" by the Taliban. While the recognition provides diplomatic legitimacy, former Afghan officials and analysts expressed concern, calling it a strategic move by Russia that prioritizes interests like rare earth minerals over human rights. The Taliban remains internationally isolated, largely due to its severe restrictions on women's rights and education.</p>

The legislation extends tax cuts and increases spending on border security while making cuts to green energy incentives, which directly impacts Musk's companies like Tesla.

Pape suggests that this approach of fostering university-industry collaboration outside of traditional tech hubs like Silicon Valley could offer a pathway for economic revival in struggling American regions.

While the US State Department has downplayed the halt as a "one-off event," analysts believe it signals a significant challenge for Ukraine, especially regarding irreplaceable air defense systems. The move is seen by some experts as a reflection of a sober new reality for European NATO members: that relying indefinitely on US military assistance is not a viable strategy. This underscores the growing pressure on Europe to increase its own defense production and investment.</p>

          <p>In response to recent US and Israeli airstrikes targeting its nuclear facilities, Iran has announced it is suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Iranian officials stated that collaboration will not resume until the security of their nuclear sites is guaranteed. This move raises questions about the future of international monitoring and whether Iran will remain in the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The attacks have fueled debate within Iran over the value of the NPT, especially since the targeted facilities were under IAEA safeguards, potentially pushing the nation closer to developing a nuclear weapon for deterrence.</p>

          <p>Despite Elon Musk's threats to create a new "America Party" in response to President Trump's spending bill, political and legal experts say the process is extraordinarily difficult. Launching a national third party would require navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are heavily biased towards the two major parties. The effort would likely face intense legal challenges from Republicans and Democrats, costing hundreds of millions of dollars and taking years to establish. While Musk's immense wealth could fund such a venture, the legal and logistical barriers make it a daunting, multi-year project rather than an immediate political force.</p>

A UN spokesperson stated that it is "not appropriate to return people to Afghanistan" due to ongoing and documented human rights violations in the country. The German government, facing domestic pressure, has indicated a willingness to make direct agreements with the Taliban to facilitate deportations. The UN's non-return advisory for Afghanistan remains in place, with officials urging countries not to forcibly return individuals as conditions on the ground are not yet ready.</p>

          <p>A new peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, brokered by the United States, is being met with skepticism despite being hailed as a historic milestone by the governments involved. The deal aims to end hostilities in eastern DRC, but key rebel groups like M23 have rejected its binding nature. Observers warn that significant hurdles remain, including a lack of inclusivity for local communities and armed groups, and no clear mechanism for accountability for past atrocities. Critics, including Nobel laureate Denis Mukwege, also fear the deal could legitimize the plundering of the region's vast mineral resources.</p>

It is partially funded by imposing work requirements on Medicaid and SNAP recipients, which the CBO projects will lead to millions losing coverage.

He initially pleaded guilty to voyeurism and received a community order, but repeatedly breached a restraining order by tweeting about Ms. Hunt.

While scientists are still determining its precise trajectory, the comet poses no danger to Earth, with its closest approach expected to be about 240 million kilometers away in October.
