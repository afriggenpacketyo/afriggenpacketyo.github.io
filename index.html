          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has signaled its willingness to engage in deeper dialogue with other nations regarding export controls on rare earth minerals, while also approving export applications for qualified companies.

China emphasizes its role as a responsible major power, taking into account the legitimate civilian needs of other countries. This development coincides with Vice-Premier He Lifeng's upcoming trip to London for economic and trade consultations with the United States, where rare earths are expected to be a key topic of discussion. </p>

He emphasized his commitment to his new position and indicated that he is content with his present responsibilities.

          <p>President Trump has bypassed California Governor Gavin Newsom's authority by deploying 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to escalating immigration protests. This decision follows recent citywide Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations that resulted in numerous arrests. Governor Newsom has criticized the move as inflammatory and unnecessary, stating that local law enforcement is capable of managing the situation. The deployment is authorized under Title 10, a rarely used law, and has sparked concerns about federal overreach and potential escalation of tensions in the region. </p>

Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has also supported the idea of more schools offering flexible hours, as pay and working conditions have been key drivers for teachers leaving the profession. Data suggests a decline in the number of new teachers joining the profession, with targets for trainee teacher recruitment being missed for several years. </p>

          <p>The UK's plans to modernize and potentially expand its nuclear arsenal, as outlined in the 2025 strategic defence review, undermine international non-proliferation efforts and fuel a global nuclear arms race. This decision, driven by perceived threats from Russia, will likely encourage other nations to expand their nuclear capabilities, increasing the risk of tactical nuclear weapons deployment. Critics argue that this policy is a costly and ineffective illusion of global power, diverting resources from essential public services. The move contradicts the spirit of the non-proliferation treaty and sends a concerning message to countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia. </p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, restoring sight to blind animals and granting them the ability to see infrared light. The study, published in Science, demonstrates the potential for treating human blindness with this biocompatible device. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, possesses excellent photoelectric properties, converting visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy. This breakthrough offers hope for future advancements in vision restoration and the treatment of related conditions. </p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has clarified that Costco cards are not acceptable forms of identification for boarding domestic flights, as travelers are now required to present REAL ID-compliant driver's licenses or state IDs. The announcement was made via a Facebook post, humorously emphasizing that despite the agency's affinity for Costco's food offerings, the membership cards do not meet the necessary security standards. The confusion likely stems from the presence of gold stars on Costco cards, similar to those found on REAL ID-compliant documents. The REAL ID Act, passed in 2005, aims to establish uniform standards for identification sources. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles has sparked legal debate, with experts questioning the president's authority to federalize the Guard without the governor's request. The deployment is authorized under Title 10, which allows the activation of National Guard troops for federal service, but its use in this context is considered rare. Critics argue that the move is an overreach of federal power and a dangerous use of the military to suppress dissent. Concerns have also been raised about the potential invocation of the Insurrection Act, which could further escalate the situation. </p>

          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help address China's declining birth rates. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, indicates that subsidies for fathers lead to greater long-term fertility gains compared to subsidizing mothers alone. This policy proposal comes as China grapples with a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce. The findings challenge traditional expectations that place the primary burden of childcare on women, particularly in East Asian countries. </p>
