            <p>England's head coach John Mitchell has announced three changes to the team facing Ireland in the Women's Six Nations, notably welcoming back Alex Matthews after her suspension.

Maud Muir and Hannah Botterman will also start in the pack, while former captain Marlie Packer remains out of the squad.

            <p>The stock market experienced a downturn, partially reversing the gains from the previous day following President Trump's announcement of a tariff pause, excluding China. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all saw significant drops, reflecting market volatility amid ongoing trade war uncertainties. Analysts suggest that despite the tariff pause, the escalating tensions between the U.S. and China could significantly impact global trade, while positive CPI data offers some reassurance regarding inflation.

            <p>Democratic senators Adam Schiff and Ruben Gallego are requesting an investigation into potential insider trading related to President Trump's tariff rollbacks and social media posts. They are concerned that Trump's allies may have used non-public information for investment decisions, especially after Trump posted on Truth Social, "THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!" hours before announcing tariff changes that caused the market to surge. The senators are seeking answers regarding whether White House officials or Trump's family members were informed of the decision beforehand and if any financial transactions were made based on this information.</p>

While Trump backed off from imposing higher-rate tariffs worldwide, he escalated the trade war with China and maintained a lower 10% tariff rate globally. Supporters like Bill Ackman lauded the move as "brilliantly executed," while some Republicans expressed reservations about the baseline tariff rate. The situation reflects the ongoing debate and differing perspectives on trade policy within the Republican party.</p>

            <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that Republicans have secured the necessary votes to pass a budget resolution, aiming to advance President Trump's agenda. The agreement follows negotiations to address concerns from fiscal conservatives who sought deeper spending cuts. The budget plan aims to enact at least $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction while prioritizing Trump's domestic policy goals, including border security, defense, and energy initiatives. The approval of the budget plan is a crucial step in the reconciliation process, enabling Republicans to pass legislation with a simple majority.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs on goods imported from China, now at 125%, could significantly increase the cost of iPhones in the US, with some analysts suggesting prices could rise by hundreds of dollars. While Apple has been diversifying its supply chain, a large portion of iPhones intended for US sale are still made in China. The impact on iPhone prices remains uncertain, and consumers may consider rival handsets or older models if costs rise. The analysis suggests that Apple's brand loyalty may allow it to pass some costs to consumers.</p>

While inflation eased due to lower fuel prices and travel costs, President Trump's tariffs are expected to lift inflation later in the year. Economists suggest that the Federal Reserve may face a difficult trade-off as tariff-driven price increases impact inflation data, potentially affecting future interest rate decisions.
