          <p>Authorities in Chesapeake, Virginia, are searching for a 39-year-old man considered armed and dangerous in connection with a fatal shooting. Police responded to a domestic assault call where they found a woman with gunshot wounds who later died at a hospital. As officers tried to enter the residence to help the screaming woman, a suspect shot through the door, injuring two officers with non-life-threatening wounds. The investigation is active, and the suspect is sought for questioning regarding the incident.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor has reduced its annual operating profit forecast by 600 billion yen, attributing the revision to the impact of U.S. tariffs. Despite beating June-quarter estimates, the company's operating profit fell 11% year-on-year, with 450 billion yen in losses directly linked to the American import taxes. The automaker has seen strong global demand and record sales, but margin pressures from tariffs and exchange rate fluctuations in Japan are weighing on its financial outlook. These challenges are common among Japanese carmakers navigating the current trade environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major retrospective in Bonn, Germany, celebrates the career of filmmaker Wim Wenders as he approaches his 80th birthday. The exhibition covers his five decades of work in film, photography, and writing, all centered on themes of movement, discovery, and finding oneself by getting lost. Known for influential films like "Paris, Texas" and "Wings of Desire," Wenders has consistently explored the emotional and physical journeys of his characters. His work, including recent films like "Perfect Days" and documentaries, continues to resonate for its quiet, profound observations on life and human connection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that modern political leaders, like UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, are too focused on maintaining control, which stifles the creativity needed to solve complex global crises. The author suggests that in an era of "polycrisis," characterized by climate change and political instability, a rigid, top-down approach is ineffective. Instead, leaders and institutions should embrace uncertainty and "let go," fostering collaboration and pluralistic thinking. The piece contends this cultural shift is essential for renewing democracy and tackling existential threats like fascism and ecological collapse.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a crackdown on unregulated cosmetic procedures following several incidents of serious harm and at least one death. The proposals aim to curb "cowboy" practitioners by introducing new restrictions on who can perform high-risk treatments like Brazilian butt lifts and Botox injections. Measures include requiring providers to be regulated by the Care Quality Commission, implementing age restrictions, and imposing financial penalties for rule violations. Health officials and industry bodies have welcomed the move as a crucial step toward protecting public safety and professionalizing the sector.</p>

          <p>SoftBank Group has reported its second straight quarter of profit, exceeding analyst expectations with a net income of 421.8 billion yen. The positive result was largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Fund technology investment arm. This financial performance comes as the Japanese conglomerate continues its significant spending spree on artificial intelligence, including investments in OpenAI and the proposed acquisition of AI chip firm Ampere Computing. Investors are closely watching how SoftBank will finance these ambitious AI-related projects moving forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is widely expected to cut its main interest rate from 4.25% to 4%, which would be the fifth reduction since last August. This move aims to stimulate the UK economy, which has shown signs of stagnation, but it will likely result in lower returns for savers. The decision comes even as inflation recently rose to 3.6%, above the Bank's 2% target. However, indicators of a cooling labor market, such as falling payroll numbers and slowing wage growth, may be giving the Bank room to ease borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

NASA ultimately deemed it too risky for Wilmore and his crewmate Suni Williams to return on the Starliner, instead bringing them home on a SpaceX capsule.

          <h2>Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 Named America's Most-Stolen Vehicle</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 00:01:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Highway Loss Data Institute identifies the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 as the most stolen vehicle in the United States. The high-performance muscle car has a theft rate 39 times higher than the average vehicle for model years 2022 to 2024. The report notes that thieves often target powerful, expensive vehicles and pickup trucks, but the Camaro's vulnerability is exacerbated by an on-board data port that can be exploited for theft. In contrast, electric vehicles are among the least stolen, likely because they are often parked in garages and are more easily tracked.</p>

          <h2>Critic Argues Celebrity Photographer's Book on Auschwitz is Banal and Narcissistic</h2>

          <p>This critical review condemns a new coffee-table book about Auschwitz by famed fashion photographer Juergen Teller. The author argues that the book, featuring over 800 simple iPhone photos of the memorial site today, contributes nothing to the understanding of the Holocaust and is a "vanity project." The critique highlights one instance where Teller photographs pages in the "Book of Names" that list his own surname as evidence of narcissism. The piece contends that in a time when the Holocaust's legacy is politicized, such a detached and banal artistic treatment is irresponsible and fails to capture the horror it depicts.</p>

          <p>United Airlines has resolved a technology issue that led to a nationwide ground stop and significant flight delays on Wednesday evening. The airline requested a halt to its departures due to an outage in its Unimatic system, which manages critical flight information. The disruption affected major hubs like Chicago, Denver, and Newark, leaving planes stuck on tarmacs and passengers waiting for hours. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the issue was specific to United, and the airline is treating it as a preventable delay, covering customer expenses like hotels where applicable.</p>

          <p>An intense and deadly wildfire is raging in the Corbieres hills of southwestern France, described by officials as the largest in the region in nearly 80 years. The blaze has burned through 16,000 hectares, killed one person, injured at least 13, and left one person missing. Over 2,100 firefighters, supported by aircraft and helicopters, are battling the flames, but unfavorable weather with high temperatures and strong winds is hampering their efforts. The French Prime Minister called the fire a "catastrophe of unprecedented scale" and linked the event to the impacts of global warming and drought.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a potential 100% tariff on imported computer chips has sent mixed signals through Asian semiconductor markets. The tariff would exempt companies building manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Consequently, shares of Japanese chip-related companies like Tokyo Electron fell sharply, while South Korea's Samsung and Taiwan's TSMC, both with major U.S. investment plans, saw their stock prices rise. The move is seen as a way to force domestic production, with analysts noting that large companies with the capital to invest in the U.S. are the clear potential winners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers at Harvard Medical School have discovered that lithium, a metal known for treating mood disorders, is naturally required by the body and may play a critical role in preventing Alzheimer's disease. Experiments on mice showed that depleting lithium accelerated brain changes associated with Alzheimer's, while maintaining normal levels was protective. The study suggests that beta-amyloid plaques, a hallmark of the disease, bind to and deplete the brain's available lithium, creating a downward spiral of degeneration. This finding could open doors to new diagnostic tests and treatments, though researchers caution against self-medicating with lithium supplements.</p>

          <p>Actor Dean Cain, known for playing Superman in the 1990s, appeared in a video encouraging people to join U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The "South Park" creators responded with mockery, questioning the department's use of their satirical content. The incidents highlight the politically charged nature of the administration's ICE hiring campaign and the unusual cultural artifacts being drawn into the debate.</p>

          <p>Louisiana officials have scrapped a major $3 billion coastal restoration project, the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion, which was designed to rebuild the state's rapidly disappearing wetlands. The project aimed to divert sediment from the Mississippi River to naturally create 17,000 acres of marshland over 30 years, providing a critical buffer against hurricanes. Despite years of planning and support from scientists, the project was canceled by Governor Jeff Landry's administration following strong opposition from local fishing communities in Plaquemines Parish. Critics of the cancellation argue that short-term fixes are insufficient and that doing nothing will lead to the eventual collapse of both the wetlands and the fisheries that depend on them.</p>
