          <p>Shares of Block, the fintech company formerly known as Square, surged over 10% after S&P Global announced its inclusion in the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron, with the change taking effect on July 23. This addition reflects the growing influence of the technology sector within the benchmark index. Despite this positive development, Block's stock has underperformed this year, and the company issued a cautious outlook in its last earnings report, citing challenging macroeconomic conditions.

          <p>Following a directive from President Trump, the Justice Department has formally requested a federal judge to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The move aims to increase transparency amid public interest and political pressure regarding the extent of Epstein's criminal network. Prosecutors have indicated they will work to redact victim-related and personal identifying information from the documents. The final decision rests with the presiding judges, and the process of releasing the materials, if approved, could take weeks or months.</p>

          <p>In an interview, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons stated he will continue to allow agents to wear masks during operations, citing an over 800% increase in attacks against personnel. While acknowledging concerns about potential impersonators, he prioritized officer safety. Lyons also confirmed that the agency plans to use government data, including from Medicaid, to locate and arrest immigrants in the U.S. illegally, particularly those with criminal records or deportation orders. He attributed the increased visibility and tension to sanctuary policies limiting local law enforcement cooperation.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is currently in a state of uncertainty as it negotiates with the Trump administration to avoid significant tariffs on its exports to the United States. The administration had previously announced a 32% tariff on Taiwanese goods but paused it for 90 days to allow for talks. As a key supplier of advanced semiconductors to American tech firms, Taiwan has a substantial trade surplus with the U.S., which is the primary reason for the tariff threat. Analysts suggest the ongoing negotiations indicate both sides are working towards a manageable solution, but no final deal has been announced.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has initiated a libel and slander lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, News Corp, and two Wall Street Journal reporters. The suit stems from an article alleging that Trump sent a bawdy note and a sketch of a naked woman to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003. Trump has vehemently denied the report, calling the letter a "fake" and a "scam" on his Truth Social platform. The legal action follows Trump's public threat to sue after he claimed Murdoch failed to stop the publication of the story.</p>

The lawmakers are calling for transparency, suggesting the public deserves to know if the cancellation was an attack on free speech.

Despite a star-studded voice cast including Rihanna and James Corden, the film is seen as an incoherent collection of scenes lacking emotional depth.

The piece highlights senators like Josh Hawley and Lisa Murkowski, who criticized aspects of major bills but ultimately voted for them, hoping for later changes. This trend is seen as a departure from the traditional legislative process, where lawmakers use their votes to shape policy.

          <p>This analysis posits that CBS's cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" reflects the broader decline of the late-night talk show genre, regardless of any potential political motivations. The article notes that changing viewership habits, the rise of streaming, and the high cost of production have made these programs less valuable to networks. While Colbert successfully took over from David Letterman and became the highest-rated show in the time slot, the cultural power of the late-night desk has diminished significantly. The decision underscores that even a top-rated, established brand is no longer immune to the harsh financial realities of modern television.</p>

          <p>Netflix's strong quarterly results, which showed double-digit revenue growth and a positive outlook, are being interpreted as welcome news for investors in Disney. Netflix's success in growing its member base while also implementing price hikes and expanding its ad-supported tier suggests a healthy market for premium streaming content. This provides a positive read-through for Disney, which is pursuing a similar strategy of raising prices and growing advertising for its Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ services. Analysts believe this demonstrates that consumers are willing to pay for quality content, bolstering Disney's path to streaming profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man in New York is in critical condition after being forcefully pulled into an active MRI machine by his large metal necklace. The incident occurred at a Nassau County clinic when the man entered the MRI room during a scan. The powerful magnetic force of the machine attracted the necklace, causing the accident and what police described as a "medical episode." MRI machines exert extremely strong forces on magnetic materials, and this rare but dangerous accident highlights the strict safety protocols required around such equipment.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that gives it a significant stake in Guyana's vast offshore oil reserves. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the Stabroek Block oil development. Chevron's CEO expressed pleasure with the outcome, stating it affirms the industry practice that such rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers. The resolution removes major uncertainty that had been weighing on the transaction.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece argues that the reaction of many MAGA-aligned social media influencers to the Jeffrey Epstein case demonstrates a fundamental ignorance of how journalism works. The author criticizes influencers for expecting the government to hand them scoops and then trusting the administration's official line when it suited them. The article contrasts this with the work of traditional news outlets like the Miami Herald and The Wall Street Journal, which conducted painstaking, independent investigations to uncover key facts. It concludes that real reporting requires skepticism and evidence-gathering, not just amplifying official narratives or unsubstantiated speculation.</p>

Forecasters predict that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours on Saturday morning. The danger is amplified because the ground is parched from a recent heatwave, which will reduce its ability to absorb the sudden downpour.
