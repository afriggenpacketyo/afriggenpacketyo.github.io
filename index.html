          <p>Russia reports that a Ukrainian drone attack caused a major fire at an oil depot near the Black Sea resort of Sochi. The attack prompted a massive firefighting response and brief flight suspensions at the nearby airport. This incident is part of a broader pattern of Ukraine targeting Russian energy infrastructure in retaliation for sustained attacks on its own grid. Meanwhile, fighting continues elsewhere, with Russia bombing a key bridge in Kherson and Ukraine reporting numerous civilian casualties from recent strikes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 401(k) plan, a cornerstone of modern American retirement savings, was created almost by accident in 1981 by benefits consultant Ted Benna. While working on a client's plan, Benna discovered an obscure provision in the tax code, Section 401(k), that he realized could be used to create tax-advantaged employee savings accounts with employer contributions. This innovation quickly led corporations to shift away from traditional pension plans, placing more responsibility for retirement planning on individual employees. The article reflects on how this single interpretation of a tax clause fundamentally reshaped financial planning for millions of Americans.</p>

          <p>The UK is bracing for Storm Floris, with an amber weather warning issued for most of Scotland, indicating a potential danger to life from high winds. Gusts are expected to reach up to 90 mph in exposed areas, threatening damage to buildings and trees, which are in full leaf and more vulnerable. The storm, the sixth of the season, has led to travel advisories, with rail and ferry services anticipating significant delays and cancellations. Officials are urging the public, including holiday travelers, to plan ahead and avoid unnecessary risks.</p>

          <p>The British government has confirmed it is rapidly advancing a plan to evacuate seriously ill or injured children from Gaza to the UK for medical treatment. While the exact number is unconfirmed, reports suggest up to 300 children could be brought over, accompanied by a guardian, following security checks. This official government scheme follows a private initiative by Project Pure Hope, which has already brought three children to the UK for privately funded care. The move comes amid a dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with its health system devastated by the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake centered in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across parts of the tri-state area on Saturday night. This is the second seismic event to strike the state in less than two weeks, though no immediate damage was reported from the relatively weak tremor. Officials have advised residents to be aware of potential aftershocks in the coming days. The event highlights the presence of the Ramapo Fault line, which, while not as active as those in California, periodically causes minor quakes in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement is gaining traction among those seeking to leave the traditional workforce decades ahead of schedule. Proponents achieve this by practicing extreme frugality, maximizing savings, and investing aggressively to build a nest egg 25 times their annual expenses. The philosophy, popularized by bloggers like Mr. Money Mustache and the book "Your Money or Your Life," emphasizes valuing time and freedom over material possessions. The goal is not just to stop working, but to gain the liberty to pursue personal passions and live a more intentional life. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, author Rebecca Solnit contends that recent high-profile sexual abuse cases, such as those involving Jeffrey Epstein and Sean Combs, should not be viewed as isolated incidents.

Solnit suggests that treating these as individual aberrations prevents a deeper understanding of the root causes and hinders the development of effective, societal-level solutions.

While companies see this as a way to improve efficiency and loss prevention, it raises concerns about fairness, customer trust, and the erosion of human judgment.

          <p>In a recent interview, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended the Trump administration's broad use of tariffs, stating they are a tool for both reducing trade deficits and achieving geopolitical objectives. Greer indicated that tariffs on some countries are set and unlikely to be negotiated down, viewing them as an effective way to incentivize reshoring of manufacturing. He also affirmed the president's strategy of linking trade policy to non-trade issues, such as Canada's foreign policy or what the administration terms "lawfare" in Brazil, viewing tariffs as a lesser tool than full sanctions.

          <p>A third 19-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the fatal stabbing of another 19-year-old man in Bury, Greater Manchester. The suspect was apprehended at Manchester Airport, while two other teens were arrested earlier. The attack occurred in a public car park and was witnessed by numerous people. Greater Manchester Police believe it was a targeted incident and not a random act of violence with a wider threat to the public. The investigation remains active as authorities continue to piece together the events leading to the tragic death.</p>

          <p>Survivors of David Berkowitz's 1976-77 shooting spree, which terrorized New York City, continue to live with the physical and emotional scars of his attacks. Robert Violante, whose first date with Stacy Moskowitz ended when Berkowitz shot them both, was blinded and lost Stacy, who died from her wounds. Carl Denaro was shot in the head and survived with a metal plate, but his military career was derailed and he lived for years with the notoriety of being a "Son of Sam" victim. Both men expressed relief at Berkowitz's capture but carry the lifelong burden of a crime that shattered their lives.</p>

          <p>Prominent WNBA players, including Kelsey Plum and Angel Reese, are increasingly vocal in their criticism of the league's officiating, citing what they see as inconsistent and unreliable foul calls. Players argue that the lack of consistency is not only frustrating but also dangerous, potentially contributing to injuries. While the league's head of referee development expressed overall satisfaction with the officiating, he acknowledged some high-profile misses. The debate highlights structural challenges, as the WNBA relies on part-time referees who also work in other leagues and lacks a centralized replay center.</p>

          <p>Over 30 years after four teenage girls were murdered in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, the case remains unsolved, continuing to haunt the city and the victims' families. The 1991 crime saw Eliza Thomas, Amy Ayers, and sisters Jennifer and Sarah Harbison killed. While four men were arrested and two were convicted years later, those convictions were overturned due to constitutional issues and new DNA evidence. A male DNA profile found on one victim did not match any of the suspects, and a potential match in an FBI database later proved to be a false lead, leaving investigators still searching for justice.</p>

Berkowitz, now a born-again Christian, expressed remorse for his actions, which he attributed to demonic influence and a "break from reality." He stated he despises the "Son of Sam" name and carries the pain of what he did, though he now works to minister to young people from behind bars.

          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is facing criticism from environmental groups after declining to reappoint a clean energy advocate to the state's public utilities commission. The outgoing member, Alessandra Carreon, was known for her support of clean energy and opposition to rate hikes by utility giant DTE Energy. She has been replaced by Shaquila Myers, a former chief of staff to a pro-business legislative leader, a move that campaigners allege is a concession to utility companies. Critics fear the appointment could slow Michigan's clean energy transition and favor corporate interests over public concerns.</p>

The article argues that after speaking out about these "conditions created to kill," Israeli authorities are attempting to silence humanitarian voices by revoking visas and restricting NGO operations.

This shift comes as the U.S. dismantles its primary aid agency, creating a massive funding gap for global health programs.
