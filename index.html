        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Taliban administration in Afghanistan has enacted a complete shutdown of internet and telecommunication services across the country. This move follows weeks of severing fibre-optic connections and has led to a "total internet blackout," according to watchdog Netblocks, disrupting news agencies, flights, and potentially banking systems. While no official reason has been provided, the action is seen as part of the Taliban's broader implementation of restrictive morality measures, severely impacting businesses, education, and communication for Afghan citizens.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Northern Ireland's communities minister, Gordon Lyons, has stated that a severe shortage of social housing is exacerbating racial tensions in the region. He explained that long waiting lists for local residents create resentment when asylum seekers are provided with accommodation, leading to concerns in deprived areas. Community leaders echo this sentiment, emphasizing that the core issue is the lack of available housing for everyone, not the placement of a few families. The minister is exploring using surplus public land to build more homes to address the critical shortage.</p>

          <p>An Islamic boarding school building in Indonesia's East Java province collapsed, resulting in at least one death and trapping dozens of students and workers. The collapse reportedly occurred due to the weight of an unauthorized fourth-floor construction project while students were inside for afternoon prayers. Rescue operations are underway, with officials providing oxygen and water to those still stuck in the debris over 12 hours later. The focus remains on saving survivors, though the unstable structure is complicating the use of heavy machinery in the effort.</p>

          <p>The West Bank, occupied by Israel since the 1967 Six-Day War, remains a central and contentious element in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This article provides historical context, detailing its division into Areas A, B, and C under the Oslo Accords, which dictates varying levels of Palestinian and Israeli control. The continuous expansion of Israeli settlements, deemed illegal by most of the international community, and rising violence are significant obstacles to a two-state solution. These factors create a complex reality for the 3.2 million Palestinians living there, restricting movement and access to resources.</p>

          <p>The UK's Prime Minister is set to announce a new digital hospital service, NHS Online, intended to be operational in England within two years to help reduce patient waiting times. The service will feature its own dedicated doctors and nurses for virtual assessments, consultations, and follow-up appointments accessible through the NHS app. Officials hope this initiative will deliver up to 8.5 million appointments in its first three years, focusing initially on conditions like ophthalmology and gynaecology that may not require inpatient treatment. However, questions remain about staffing and ensuring digital inclusion for all patients.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's public statements argues that the indictment against former FBI Director James Comey is a vindictive prosecution driven by personal animus. The article chronicles a timeline of Trump's escalating rhetoric, where he repeatedly accused Comey of crimes, called for his arrest, and publicly demanded the firing of a prosecutor who was hesitant to bring charges. The piece contends that this pattern, culminating in the appointment of his former personal lawyer to oversee the case, provides strong evidence that the prosecution would not have occurred without the president's direct and retaliatory pressure.</p>

          <p>During a visit to New Zealand, FBI Director Kash Patel presented senior security officials with 3D-printed replica pistols that were illegal to possess under the country's strict gun laws.

Pistols are tightly restricted weapons in New Zealand, requiring special permits that the officials did not have for the gifts.

This "50-50" proposal aims to reduce U.S. reliance on Taiwan, which currently produces over 90% of the world's advanced chips. Lutnick argued that a more balanced production would enhance Taiwan's security, countering the "Silicon Shield" theory that its chip dominance deters a Chinese invasion. The administration's goal is to reach 40% domestic production by the end of the current term, requiring substantial local investment. (not investment advice)</p>

In its statement, the RBA acknowledged that inflation might be higher than previously expected and noted that the economic outlook remains uncertain due to both domestic and international factors.

In a court filing, they argued for at least 135 months, citing what they describe as Combs' "decades of unchecked violence" and abuse, even though he was acquitted of more serious racketeering and sex trafficking charges. The prosecution's recommendation is significantly longer than the 14-month sentence sought by the defense, which would amount to time served.

          <p>Major grocery chains in China, including Walmart and Alibaba's Freshippo, are revamping their stores to compete for frugal shoppers by emphasizing their own private-label brands. This strategy mimics the model used by European discounters like Aldi and Lidl, offering quality comparable to name brands at lower prices. The shift comes as Chinese consumers become more price-sensitive amid economic uncertainty, which has led to flat sales and a decline in store counts for top retailers. By streamlining operations and focusing on store brands, these companies hope to regain momentum in a competitive market.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has drawn sharp criticism for sharing a deepfake video that insults Democratic leaders Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer following a meeting about the potential government shutdown. The altered video depicts Jeffries in a sombrero and Schumer making vulgar, AI-generated remarks, while also promoting a racist conspiracy theory. Both lawmakers condemned the post, with Jeffries calling it "disgusting" and Schumer stating it proves Trump can only "throw tantrums" instead of negotiating. Critics on social media have labeled the act a "national embarrassment" that fuels political division and bigotry.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, currently a major Category 3 storm, is expected to bring life-threatening surf and rip currents to most of the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda this week. While the storm's center is forecast to pass to the north of Bermuda, its powerful swells will impact a wide area. The National Hurricane Center has warned that Humberto will remain a dangerous major hurricane into Tuesday, even as it begins a gradual weakening trend. It is one of two storm systems in the western Atlantic, with Tropical Storm Imelda also being closely monitored.</p>

The company maintains that the product is effective when used correctly and has not admitted liability, stating it is prepared to defend itself in the English courts.

Qian fled China and used the stolen funds in the UK to purchase property with the help of an accomplice.

          <p>The Miami Dolphins defeated the New York Jets 27-21 for their first victory of the season, but the win was overshadowed by a severe injury to star wide receiver Tyreek Hill. Hill suffered a dislocated left knee in the third quarter, an injury that is likely to be season-ending. Before the injury, quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw for 177 yards and two touchdowns, leading the Dolphins to a much-needed win. Despite the victory, the loss of Hill, one of the league's most productive receivers, is a devastating blow to the team's prospects for the remainder of the season.</p>

He was rescued and transported on a 36-hour journey to a hospital in the capital, where he arrived in stable condition. Experts noted that such attacks are extremely rare, particularly involving a researcher with extensive experience in shark conservation.</p>
