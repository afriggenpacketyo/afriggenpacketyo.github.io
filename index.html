          <p>Negotiating teams from the U.S. and China concluded two days of trade talks in Switzerland, citing substantial progress amid ongoing tensions between the world's two largest economies. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted the positive atmosphere and the creation of a new consultation mechanism involving senior officials from both countries. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng acknowledged remaining friction but described the conversations as candid and constructive. Investors are likely to react positively to this development, viewing it as a sign that disruptions to trade between the two countries could soon ease.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Hamas would release Edan Alexander, the last living American hostage held since October 2023. The announcement followed claims from the terror organization that it was in contact with the U.S. administration. Fifty members of Congress sent Trump a letter urging him to prioritize getting the remaining hostages out. Alexander, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, was kidnapped during the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel, and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters also released a statement following the announcement of Alexander's release, saying that they "are embracing and supporting the Alexander family.</p>

          <p>CVS Caremark has decided to stop offering Zepbound in favor of Wegovy for weight loss, a decision that will force many Americans to switch obesity drugs, despite research indicating Zepbound results in more weight loss. This move highlights the consequences of deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers, which can limit treatment options for patients. Caremark claims the decision was made to lower drug prices for employers, but some patients and doctors are concerned about the impact on individual treatment plans. The decision will not affect patients who take versions of the drugs for diabetes, and Caremark will offer a case-by-case medical exception process.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has offered refugee status to 49 white South Africans, citing racial discrimination against them by the Black-led government. The group, consisting of families and small children, departed from Johannesburg on a private charter plane bound for Washington D.C. The South African government disputes claims of persecution, asserting that Afrikaners are among the most economically privileged in the country. The Trump administration's decision has drawn criticism from refugee groups questioning the prioritization of white South Africans over those fleeing war-torn countries.</p>

          <p>A head-to-head trial comparing weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy has revealed that Mounjaro is more effective. The trial, involving 750 obese individuals, found that Mounjaro led to a 20% weight reduction compared to Wegovy's 14% after 72 weeks of treatment. Researchers suggest both drugs have a role, but Mounjaro may be more beneficial for those needing to lose significant weight. Mounjaro flips two appetite switches in the brain, while Wegovy flips one, explaining the difference in effectiveness.</p>

          <p>NeuroRestore, a lab in Lausanne, Switzerland, has developed a digital bridge to help people with severe spinal cord injuries regain the ability to walk and restore other bodily functions. The digital bridge circumvents the injury by wirelessly sending signals from the brain to the intact part of the spinal cord. Spinal cord stimulators may also show promise in helping people with Parkinson's Disease regain mobility. The goal is to provide therapies that can fix various issues, such as hand function, blood pressure, incontinence, and sexual function.</p>
