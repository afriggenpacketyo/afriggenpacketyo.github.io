        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump asserted that U.S. airstrikes had completely destroyed Iran's nuclear program, contradicting a preliminary intelligence assessment suggesting the damage was less severe. The intelligence report indicated that the strikes likely set Iran's nuclear program back by a few months, not years, as initially claimed by Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Trump acknowledged the existence of the Defense Intelligence Agency's report but argued that the data informing it was insufficient, suggesting the assessment was made too soon after the attacks. He also highlighted that the assessment mentioned the damage "may be very severe," a component he felt was ignored by news outlets.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man previously deported and then returned to the U.S. for federal prosecution, will remain in jail as lawyers debate whether the Justice Department can prevent his deportation if released. A magistrate judge had ordered Abrego Garcia's release with conditions, but acknowledged he would likely be detained by immigration authorities for removal proceedings. The Justice Department appealed the release order, arguing that deportation would hinder the prosecution of his human smuggling charges. Abrego Garcia's lawyers countered that the deportation concerns were a "self-inflicted injury" by the Department of Homeland Security, highlighting that his initial deportation was an "administrative error" since he had been granted legal status in 2019.</p>

          <p>Gunmen killed 11 people and injured at least 20 during a religious festival in Irapuato, Guanajuato, a Mexican city plagued by cartel violence. The attack occurred during celebrations marking the Nativity of John the Baptist, leaving bloodstains and bullet holes at the scene. Guanajuato is a thriving industrial hub and tourist destination, but also Mexico's deadliest state due to ongoing gang turf wars, particularly between the Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the Jalisco New Generation cartel. President Claudia Sheinbaum condemned the shooting, describing it as a "confrontation," and authorities have launched an investigation into the incident.</p>

Mamdani's platform includes rent freezes, free public transit, city-owned grocery stores, universal childcare, and a $30 minimum wage by 2030.

          <p>Plans to open a large federal immigration processing center in California City have ignited controversy among advocacy groups, who argue it will have "long-term costs" and "fuel harm." ICE has partnered with CoreCivic to transform a shuttered prison into a 2,500-bed immigrant detention center. The development has raised concerns among residents and advocacy groups, who argue that the facility will lead to more raids, deportations, and broken families. While some residents believe the facility will boost the local economy, others urge the city to invest in housing, healthcare, education, and job training instead.</p>

          <p>Immigrant rights activists are criticizing the LAPD after officers were filmed separating a crowd from masked federal agents during an apparent ICE raid in downtown Los Angeles. The LAPD insists they were responding to a kidnapping report and only sought to de-escalate tensions between the crowd and the federal agents. Activist groups argue that the LAPD was effectively assisting ICE by holding back the crowd, contradicting Los Angeles' sanctuary city ordinance that prohibits using municipal resources for immigration enforcement. The LAPD stated that the federal agents did not notify them of their planned enforcement activity and that no arrests were made by LAPD officers.</p>

          <p>President Trump maintained his claim that U.S. strikes had "totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear sites, despite an early intelligence report suggesting the program was only set back by months. Trump stated he was "not happy" with either Israel or Iran after the opening hours of a ceasefire were marred by reported exchanges. The president and his administration continued to push back on the intelligence report, with Trump suggesting the data was insufficient.</p>

The agency is reopening the claims submission process for gamers eligible under a $245 million settlement with Epic Games, due to deceptive online practices that tricked players into unauthorized purchases. The FTC will send nearly 970,000 checks and PayPal payments to consumers who filed a valid claim, with a deadline extension to July 9 for new claims.

News publishers are responding with legal action and by making licensing deals with AI companies, but the power imbalance at the negotiating table is significant. The modest income from these arrangements is not going to save publishers, and the industry may need to invent different business models and find new revenue streams.
