          <p>In a recent interview, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended the Trump administration's latest executive order raising tariffs on approximately 70 countries. Greer stated the rates are largely set and are intended to reduce the trade deficit and reshore American manufacturing, arguing that tariffs create incentives for companies to invest in the U.S. He also addressed the use of tariffs as a geopolitical tool, particularly with Canada and Brazil, asserting that the president has the authority to use economic measures for foreign policy and national security reasons. The administration remains in sensitive negotiations with China to avoid a snapback of tariffs to higher levels.</p>

          <p>Renewed hope has emerged in the unsolved 1991 murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, thanks to advancements in DNA technology. A key piece of evidence, a male DNA profile found on one of the victims, previously led to the exoneration of two convicted men but has remained unidentified. An initial promising lead in 2017 from a public database was later ruled out after more advanced testing. Despite this setback, investigators and officials like Congressman Michael McCaul remain optimistic that as DNA science continues to improve, the limited existing sample will eventually identify the killer and bring closure to the decades-old case.</p>

          <p>A theory in the 30-year-old unsolved Austin yogurt shop murders focuses on two unidentified men who were seen in the shop shortly before the crime. Eyewitnesses described the men as acting suspiciously, and they were reportedly the last customers to be seen before the four teenage girls were killed. Defense attorneys for the men who were wrongfully convicted and later exonerated by DNA evidence argue that these two individuals are the most likely suspects. Despite extensive investigation, the identities of these men remain a mystery, representing a frustratingly cold lead in the haunting case.</p>

Violante was on his first date with Stacy Moskowitz, who was killed in the attack, and was left permanently blind in one eye. Denaro was shot in the head and survived, though his planned military career was derailed. Both men recount the sudden violence that shattered their young lives and express relief that Berkowitz was captured, though the trauma of the events continues to affect them profoundly.</p>

Her father, Craig Glassman, was a volunteer deputy sheriff who suspected Berkowitz and even helped police identify him upon his arrest in 1977. Shayna explains that connecting with Berkowitz, who has been imprisoned for nearly 50 years, is her way of processing her family's history and feeling closer to the father she lost at a young age. She describes their relationship as complex and non-romantic, driven by a need to understand this chapter of her life.</p>

This request comes on top of a contract that pays her more than the U.S. president and includes a car allowance. Parents and school safety experts have questioned the necessity of the position, which would pay up to $143,880, labeling it an unnecessary luxury. The school district defends the role as a formalization of existing security measures and part of a broader safety framework, though the job description focuses heavily on the superintendent's personal protection.</p>

          <p>More than 30 years later, the brutal and unsolved murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop continue to haunt the victims' families and the original investigators. The case saw convictions of two men overturned years later due to new DNA evidence that did not match them, compounding the families' grief and frustration. John Jones, the first investigator on the case, and Sonora Thomas, sister of victim Eliza Thomas, reflect on the indelible pain and the ongoing torture of not having closure. The Homicide Victims' Families' Rights Act, motivated by this case, now offers a path for federal review of cold cases with new technology.</p>

          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is facing backlash from environmental groups after deciding not to renew the appointment of clean energy advocate Alessandra Carreon to the state's public services commission. Carreon is being replaced by Shaquila Myers, a former chief of staff to a pro-business Democrat, a move critics allege was influenced by utility giants DTE Energy and Consumers Energy. Campaigners fear the change will slow Michigan's clean energy transition and favor utility interests over public good, especially as the commission considers over $1 billion in proposed rate hikes.

          <p>An opinion piece from the National Immigration Law Center argues that a new law providing $170 billion to the Department of Homeland Security represents a grave threat to democracy. The author contends the massive funding will turbocharge the Trump administration's brutal immigration enforcement agenda, leading to more abductions, family separations, and violent crackdowns on dissent. The article warns that the militarization of communities, already seen in some areas, will become widespread, impacting all Americans, not just immigrants. It concludes with a call to action for the public to resist these authoritarian trends and protect the nation's democratic values.</p>

          <p>A concerning trend is emerging as major global powers, including the United States and the United Kingdom, significantly cut their foreign aid budgets, creating a multi-billion dollar funding gap for global development. In a notable counter-movement, countries like Spain, Ireland, South Korea, and Italy are increasing their aid commitments. Spain, for instance, has passed a law to more than double its aid budget by 2030, driven by a long history of public support for development. This shift could lead to a new, more collaborative and less paternalistic future for foreign aid, with former recipient nations playing a larger role.</p>

This poses a danger to life from flying debris and falling trees, which are more vulnerable while in full leaf.

Washington's quiet work transformed a chaotic assembly of colonial militias into a cohesive Continental Army. By overcoming his own prejudices against the New England soldiers, establishing discipline, and promoting talented men regardless of their background, he demonstrated the character and judgment that would define his command.

While the book is long and detailed, it provides a fascinating account of Parker's pre-Elvis life as a carny and his cunning strategies in building the Elvis empire.

          <p>In a drastic move to combat endemic violence and corruption, the mayor of Celaya, Mexico, has fired over half of the city's police force and called in federal troops to take over security. The city had become one of the world's most dangerous due to a bloody cartel war, with the local police seen as either powerless or complicit. This action reflects Mexico's broader, two-decade-long strategy of militarizing public security in response to failing local law enforcement. While officials report a drop in homicides, the long-term effectiveness of replacing local police with soldiers remains a subject of intense debate and criticism.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece critiques a recent decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals under the Trump administration, which rules that a "particular social group" for asylum claims cannot be defined by gender. The author argues this is a profound and troubling reversal of decades of legal progress that had recognized gender-based violence as a form of persecution. The ruling is seen as an attempt to return to an era when violence against women was dismissed as a private, personal matter, not a basis for human rights protection. This change erects a significant new barrier for women and girls seeking refuge in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Despite the chaos of President Trump's escalating trade war and new tariffs on numerous countries, the U.S. economy has proven surprisingly resilient, with Wall Street remaining near record levels. Analysts suggest this is partly due to businesses stockpiling goods in anticipation of tariffs and a continued belief that the worst threats will be negotiated away. However, the article warns this stability may be temporary. The full impact of the latest tariffs has yet to be felt, and underlying data, such as a slowdown in GDP growth and rising uncertainty, suggests an economic storm may still be brewing.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of demonstrators, including WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge for a pro-Palestinian protest, calling for a ceasefire and more humanitarian aid for Gaza. The event, dubbed the "March for Humanity," went ahead after a last-minute Supreme Court authorization, which overruled police objections based on safety concerns. The massive turnout caused major disruptions across the city's transport network. The march highlights growing public pressure on the Australian government, which has so far resisted calls to recognize a Palestinian state without conditions ensuring Israel's security.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that a significant divide is emerging between Western and Arab nations regarding Palestinian statehood. While countries like Britain, France, and Canada are signaling a willingness to recognize a Palestinian state, Arab leaders are taking a more cautious, pragmatic approach, and in some cases, deepening ties with Israel. The author contends that Arab states, who live closest to the conflict, better understand Hamas's destabilizing ideology and are prioritizing regional stability over symbolic gestures. The piece criticizes what it sees as selective outrage in the West that is detached from the region's complex realities.</p>

          <p>Chile's total fertility rate has plummeted to 1.1 children per woman, one of the lowest in the world and significantly below the population replacement level. This rapid demographic shift, which may foreshadow trends in the U.S., is driven by the high cost of living and, crucially, the growing autonomy and educational and career opportunities for women. While progressive leaders see this as a sign of hard-won progress, conservatives express alarm about an aging population and the erosion of traditional family structures. The trend raises profound questions about the future of key social systems like labor markets and pensions.</p>

This move is part of a broader effort to rein in federal costs and improve government efficiency.

This escalation comes as Russia continues its own bombardment of Ukrainian cities, including a recent missile strike on Mykolaiv that injured at least seven civilians.

          <p>The UK government is planning to introduce a new criminal offense to combat people-smuggling gangs that advertise illegal Channel crossings on social media. The proposed law, part of the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, would make creating such promotional material a crime punishable by up to five years in prison. Home Office analysis shows that around 80% of migrants arriving by small boat used social media to contact criminal agents. The government believes this new offense will provide agencies with more power to disrupt the business model of these gangs.</p>

While the rate cut would provide relief for mortgage holders and businesses, it highlights the challenge of stagflation, as inflation remains high at 3.6%, well above the Bank's 2% target.
