          <p>New research indicates that two well-preserved mummified "puppies" found in Siberia are actually 14,000-year-old wolf cubs, not early domesticated dogs as previously believed.  Analysis of their stomach contents and genetic data revealed their diet and lack of interaction with humans.  The findings offer insights into the lives of ice age wolves and the challenges of tracing dog domestication.</p>
