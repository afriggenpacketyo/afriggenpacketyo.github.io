          <h2>Trump Reportedly Considers Firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell</h2>

          <p>President Trump has reportedly told Republican lawmakers he is likely to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell soon, following their approval of the move. This potential action comes amid sustained criticism from the White House aimed at pressuring the central bank to lower interest rates. While some administration officials have publicly downplayed the possibility, reports suggest a letter for Powell's dismissal has already been drafted, raising concerns about the Fed's independence.

          <p>A ProPublica climate reporter describes the recent devastating floods in Texas as an "early warning" of future chaos driven by climate change. The article highlights how the undermining of climate science and budget cuts to agencies like FEMA and NOAA are compounding the risks from increasingly erratic weather patterns. This situation, the reporter argues, should be a significant cause for concern regarding the nation's preparedness for more frequent and intense natural disasters.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a new seven-year budget of €2 trillion, featuring a fivefold increase in defense and space funding to €131 billion. This "European Competitiveness Fund" aims to bolster regional investment and strategic autonomy. The budget, which also allocates 35% to climate projects, would be financed through new revenue streams rather than increased member state contributions, though some nations like the Netherlands have already criticized the proposal as too high.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing its largest measles outbreak in over 30 years, with more than 1,300 cases confirmed across at least 39 states. A significant portion of the infections are linked to an outbreak in West Texas, which has resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Health officials attribute the surge to declining vaccination rates, as community immunity is compromised when vaccination levels fall below the critical 95% threshold, making the highly contagious disease a renewed public health threat.</p>

A 401(k) offers investment flexibility and growth potential, making it suitable for those comfortable with market risk, while an annuity provides a guaranteed income stream, appealing to risk-averse individuals seeking stability. The article suggests that instead of an either-or choice, a hybrid approach can be effective, using a 401(k) for growth and converting a portion to an annuity later to create a secure income floor in retirement.
