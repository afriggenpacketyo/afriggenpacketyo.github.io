          <p>President Trump claimed that former FBI Director James Comey was advocating for the assassination of the president through a social media post featuring the numbers '8647.' Trump asserted that Comey knew the hidden meaning behind the numbers and was deliberately making a violent threat. Comey denied that the post was intended as a threat and stated that he opposes violence of any kind, leading him to delete the post. Homeland Security and the Secret Service initiated an investigation into the matter following the post.</p>

          <p>A Fox News article criticizes Bruce Springsteen and Robert De Niro for disparaging President Trump overseas while highlighting the Kennedy Center's thriving arts scene. The author contrasts the artists' negative portrayal of America with the positive experiences of Americans attending performances at the Kennedy Center. The article emphasizes the Kennedy Center's focus on providing art that unites rather than divides, contrasting this with what the author perceives as progressive indoctrination. The piece concludes by encouraging readers to support artists who speak to their souls, not their politics.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers initiated a strike at 12:01 a.m. Friday, causing a complete shutdown of train service and affecting over 300,000 daily commuters. The strike stems from a dispute between NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) over pay raises, with the union claiming they haven't received a raise in five years. NJ Transit has implemented a contingency plan, including additional bus service, but it can only accommodate a fraction of the usual train riders. New York City is coordinating with NJ Transit to mitigate the impact on commuters, while NJ Transit rail tickets and passes will be cross-honored on its bus and light rail lines.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy and Ozempic, announced that its CEO, Lars Fruergaard JÃ¸rgensen, will step down due to recent market challenges and a decline in the company's share price. The company's stock has fallen significantly due to increased competition in the weight-loss drug market, particularly from Eli Lilly's Zepbound and compounded replica drugs. Jorgensen will remain in his position to support a smooth transition, and the company is actively searching for a successor.

          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction in the January-March period, marking the first decline in a year with an annualized real decrease of 0.7 percent, according to government data. The contraction underscores sluggish domestic demand, even before the full impact of increased U.S. tariffs. Real gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, fell 0.2 percent from the previous quarter, as weak consumer spending and increased import costs negatively affected growth. The Japanese government is taking measures to ease rice prices and has enacted laws for preemptive cyberdefense and digital arrest warrants.</p>

This follows recent negotiations with major trading partners, including the U.K. and China, regarding tariffs set in April.

This case highlights the limitations of Japan's jurisdiction over crimes involving U.S. military personnel under the Status of Forces Agreement, which grants the United States primary jurisdiction over offenses involving its service members and their dependents.

          <p>Police in Salt Lake City have solved the 1985 cold case murder of 18-year-old Christine Gallegos by identifying her alleged killer as Ricky Lee Stallworth, a U.S. airman who died in 2023. The breakthrough came after re-examining the case and using DNA samples sent to Othram Labs, which specializes in genealogy. Stallworth, who was stationed at Hill Air Force Base at the time of the murder, was never previously identified as a suspect. Gallegos's mother expressed gratitude to the police for their continued investigation, bringing some measure of justice after 40 years.</p>

          <p>Thames Water and other water companies may be prevented from paying bonuses under new rules set to be implemented by the industry regulator, Ofwat. The Environment Secretary stated the new measures aim to prevent water companies from polluting rivers while awarding themselves millions in bonuses. Ofwat's new powers, contained in the Water (Special Measures) Act, will enable it to ban undeserved bonuses when environmental and financial standards are not met, and could even claw back bonuses paid in the last financial year. Thames Water, however, argues that the upcoming payments are "retention payments" rather than performance-related bonuses.</p>

          <p>India's decision to put the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) "in abeyance" following a ceasefire with Pakistan raises concerns about water security in South Asia. The IWT, a 64-year-old agreement on water-sharing, is now suspended after an attack claimed by a group linked to a UN-designated terrorist organization. Experts worry that this unilateral action could erode trust among neighbors and set a harmful precedent for transboundary water treaties. The decision also has implications for India's relationships with Bangladesh and China, particularly concerning the Ganges River basin and China's investments in Pakistan's hydroelectric infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Speculation is rising in Israel about a potential rift between President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu over the handling of the war in Gaza. Trump's recent Gulf visit, which excluded Israel, and his administration's direct negotiations with Hamas and Iran have fueled these concerns. Israeli analysts suggest that Trump may be sidelining Netanyahu due to disagreements on Iran and Gaza, and that Trump is prioritizing a broader regional reshaping, including normalization with Saudi Arabia and Syria. Trump's interest in resolving the conflict in Gaza appears to conflict with Netanyahu's continued military offensive.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that a majority of Americans do not earn enough to afford a basic standard of living, considering costs beyond necessities like food and shelter to include technology, education, and healthcare. The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) found that a "minimal quality of life" is out of reach for the bottom 60% of U.S. households, with earnings falling short of the required $67,000. The study also reveals that the official unemployment rate understates economic distress, with a "functionally unemployed" rate exceeding 24%.</p>

Despite expressing their desire to return home, North Korea has ignored all attempts at contact, reflecting strained relations between the two countries.

Experts say the investments and costs would increase exponentially, making vehicles unaffordable for many consumers. While President Trump has pressured automakers to increase U.S. production through tariffs, many parts and materials are cheaper to manufacture overseas. The average new-car price of a U.S.-assembled vehicle is already more than $53,200, compared to roughly $40,700 in Mexico, for example. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Naval Academy freshmen celebrated after successfully completing the annual Herndon Monument climb in Annapolis, Maryland. The tradition involves plebes scaling the greased 21-foot monument to replace a "Dixie cup" hat with an upperclassman's hat. This year's class of 2028 completed the climb in two hours, 27 minutes, and 31 seconds. The event symbolizes the transition and challenges faced by the freshmen as they integrate into the academy, and showcases their persistence and teamwork.</p>
