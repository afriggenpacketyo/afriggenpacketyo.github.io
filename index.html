          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest rocket ever built, achieved a significant milestone by reaching space during its ninth test flight, surpassing previous attempts that ended in explosions. However, a propellant leak caused the spacecraft to spin out of control during re-entry, leading to its disintegration over the Indian Ocean. Despite the loss of the vehicle, SpaceX considers the flight a valuable learning experience, noting improvements in ascent and heat shield performance. Elon Musk indicated that the next three test flights would occur more rapidly, although past schedules have often been unrealistic, while also describing the goals of the Artemis program as objectively feeble.</p>

          <p>Auto giant Stellantis has appointed Antonio Filosa, previously North American chief operating officer and Jeep CEO, as its new chief executive officer. Filosa, a 25-year veteran of the company, will assume his role effective June 23, succeeding Carlos Tavares, who resigned unexpectedly in December. This change comes amidst financial challenges for Stellantis, including a 14% year-on-year decrease in first-quarter net revenues and the withdrawal of full-year financial guidance due to trade uncertainties. The company's executive chairman, John Elkann, expressed confidence in Filosa's understanding of the company and the industry to lead Stellantis in its next phase of development.</p>

          <p>A series of violent kidnappings and attempted kidnappings targeting individuals connected to the cryptocurrency sector in France has prompted increased security measures and calls for regulatory changes. High-profile figures in the French crypto industry are concerned that new European cryptocurrency regulations may inadvertently provide criminals with access to sensitive personal data, making them easier targets. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau has announced new safety measures for crypto executives, including special access to emergency services and security training, after meeting with crypto executives under tight security.

          <p>Japan's bond market is causing concern about potential capital flight from the U.S. and a carry trade unwind as long-dated yields rise near record highs. Higher Japanese government bond yields could incentivize Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., potentially triggering global financial market instability. Analysts warn that this shift could strengthen the yen, negatively impacting U.S. tech stocks and increasing global borrowing costs. While some analysts anticipate a gradual unwinding of carry trades, others caution that the impact could be more severe than previous instances, potentially leading to a significant sell-off in global markets (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Ukraine reportedly launched almost 300 drones in a large-scale attack on Russia, including several targeting Moscow, according to Russian authorities. The Russian defense ministry stated that its anti-aircraft systems intercepted 296 aerial drones, with at least 42 shot down over the Moscow region. This attack follows a record drone attack on Russia over the weekend, which Kyiv claimed resulted in at least 13 fatalities. Ukraine claimed that Russia launched over 900 drones in the three days leading up to Monday, escalating tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration pursues a nuclear deal with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been reportedly threatening military action against Iranian nuclear facilities. This disagreement over how to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons has caused friction between President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu. Israel, not a participant in the U.S.-Iran negotiations, fears that Trump's eagerness for a deal will allow Iran to maintain its uranium enrichment capabilities. Israeli officials have indicated that Netanyahu could order a strike on Iran even if a diplomatic agreement is reached, although U.S. military officials are skeptical of the effectiveness of a unilateral Israeli strike.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship experienced a "rapid unscheduled disassembly" during its ninth flight test, although the vehicle successfully reached orbit before an apparent propellant leak caused a loss of control. The upper stage of Starship likely disintegrated over the Indian Ocean, but the company noted the test as a valuable learning opportunity for future missions. Mounted atop a Super Heavy rocket, the uncrewed Starship lifted off from South Texas, but the heavy booster appears to have exploded while splashing down in the Gulf. The company intends to make Starship fully reusable and capable of frequent launches with minimal maintenance.</p>

          <p>The head of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, has warned that the government's pledges on crime will not be fulfilled without substantial additional funding for policing. Rowley and five other senior police chiefs highlighted a decade of underinvestment and increasing pressures on police forces. He stated that without significant investment, there would be no restoration of neighborhood policing and no halving of knife crime or violence against women and girls. The Home Office responded that it is backing the police with significant funding, including money to put additional neighborhood police officers on the streets.</p>

          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan concludes that possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use should be decriminalised. The report, by the London Drugs Commission, recommends removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act. Khan stated that current rules "cannot be justified" and that the commission's findings provide "a compelling, evidence-based case" for decriminalisation. The report also suggests improving public health services for cannabis-related harm and enhancing cannabis education, while critics argue that any reduction in legal consequences would wrongly signal that cannabis is less harmful.</p>

CEO Margherita Della Valle argues that Vodafone is now a simpler business outperforming rivals in some areas, but the company continues to face challenges, including hyperinflation in Turkey and write-downs in Romania.

The WHO has designated NB.1.8.1 as a variant under monitoring, and while it is present in 22 countries, the U.S. has reported too few sequences for inclusion in the CDC's dashboard. Though the public health risk is evaluated as low at the global level, there is some evidence that the variant may infect people more easily than previous strains. The FDA said it would shift to narrow approval for updated COVID vaccines, but currently-approved shots are expected to remain effective against the NB.1.8.1 variant.</p>

          <p>Ilham Ahmed, chair of the foreign relations department of the Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, argues that true freedom in Syria requires an inclusive, democratic state. Ahmed criticizes Syria's new interim Constitution for failing to fully protect the rights of minorities and women and for prioritizing Islamic law. She proposes that the democratic model established in her region, Rojava, which includes power-sharing arrangements and guarantees equal rights for all, could serve as a model for the entire Middle East. Ahmed emphasizes the need for a new constitutional process to guarantee power sharing, safeguard political freedoms, and decentralize governance.</p>

          <p>John Dramani Mahama criticizes Donald Trump's unfounded accusations of white genocide in South Africa as an insult to all Africans. Mahama emphasizes that Trump's claims conflict with the historical truths of racial persecution and massacres during colonization and apartheid. He argues that such language can extend the effects of previous injustices and must be met with resistance. Mahama highlights the interconnected fates of African nations and the importance of solidarity against subjugation and discrimination, referencing historical events such as the Sharpeville massacre and the Soweto uprising.</p>
