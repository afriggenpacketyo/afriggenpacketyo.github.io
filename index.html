          <h2>Tungsten Producers Panic as China Restricts Exports</h2>

          <p>Developed nations are realizing their over-reliance on China for tungsten, a critical industrial metal, after Beijing imposed export restrictions. The restrictions, part of a trade retaliation against the U.S., have caused panic among tungsten product producers, including those in the defense sector, who have depended on China for 30 years. The element, essential for cutting tools, machinery, and ammunition, has not been commercially mined in the U.S. for a decade, making the reliance on China even more apparent. US defense contractors face a deadline to stop using Chinese tungsten by January 1, 2027.</p>

          <p>President Trump abruptly terminated Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, the first woman and African American to hold the position, via an email from the White House’s Presidential Personnel Office. Hayden's dismissal, which occurred before her term was set to expire, has sparked outrage among congressional Democrats, who see it as part of Trump's effort to suppress books and whitewash history. Hayden had faced criticism from a conservative advocacy group accusing her of promoting woke content, including children's books with radical content and literary material authored by Trump opponents.

          <p>China's latest stimulus measures, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, have failed to boost the stock market, as investors remain concerned about the ongoing trade war with the U.S. While the People's Bank of China announced measures to support the tech sector and boost domestic consumption, analysts view these as stopgap measures rather than long-term solutions. Investors are awaiting more targeted fiscal policies that directly improve consumer sentiment and support the struggling real estate sector. Unlike previous stimulus efforts, this round is more focused on industrial and social needs rather than direct market support.</p>

          <p>An Iranian mechanical engineering student at the University of Alabama has decided to self-deport after being detained for six weeks, even though the government dropped the initial charge against him. Alireza Doroudi's visa was revoked in 2023, and despite the university advising him that he was legally allowed to stay, he was detained by immigration officials. His lawyer accused authorities of denying Doroudi due process and forcing him to choose between indefinite detention and self-deportation.

          <p>President Trump has announced a trade agreement with Britain that will increase market access for American farm exports. In return, the U.S. has agreed to allow Britain to export 100,000 cars per year into the U.S. market with a 10 percent tariff and remove its additional tariffs of 25 percent on steel and aluminum. The agreement leaves in place a 10 percent baseline tariff that Trump imposed in April on almost all countries, signaling that he does not intend to scrap or grant exemptions from the universal tariff. The deal with Britain provides some hints for other countries on where the Trump administration stands on its tariff approach.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has taken a tougher stance on pro-Palestinian protests, intervening aggressively during an occupation of Butler Library, leading to arrests. This contrasts with the university's response to previous protests, including the occupation of Hamilton Hall a year prior. The university's new approach has drawn praise from the Trump administration's antisemitism task force, but criticism from those who believe unarmed demonstrators should not be met with force. The recent events highlight the growing tensions and shifting dynamics surrounding pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.</p>

          <p>President Trump has asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax hike on rich Americans in the upcoming fiscal package, proposing a new top income bracket for those earning over $2.5 million per year. This would tax income above that level at 39.6 percent, reversing a tax cut from 2017. The move is aimed at offsetting the cost of tax cuts and protecting Medicaid spending. Republicans are considering other tax hikes with a populist flavor, including raising taxes on stock buybacks and limiting executive compensation deductions.</p>

          <p>India appears ready to strike a trade deal with the U.S., potentially eliminating tariffs on steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals. This shift signals a move away from India's protectionist stance, prompted by recent tariffs imposed by the U.S. While a deal could boost bilateral trade, concerns remain about the impact on India's domestic manufacturing. Experts debate whether the deal will significantly harm Indian industries, with some suggesting that certain sectors may not be heavily affected.
