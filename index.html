          <p>The UN secretary-general is urging an independent investigation into the deaths of Palestinians near a Gaza aid distribution center following conflicting accounts of whether Israeli forces opened fire. Witnesses reported being shot at while awaiting aid in Rafah, with the Red Cross reporting numerous casualties. The Israeli military denied firing at civilians, accusing Hamas of spreading rumors, while the US ambassador to Israel dismissed the reports as fabrications. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation stated that there were no injuries or fatalities during their operations, and the UN is seeking clarity amid these contradictory claims to determine accountability for the tragic incident. The optimism score reflects the serious nature of the event and the uncertainty surrounding the circumstances. </p>

          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack during a pro-Israel demonstration, faces federal hate crime charges and state charges, including attempted first-degree murder. Soliman admitted to researching and constructing Molotov cocktails for the attack, stating he wanted to kill all Zionist people. He allegedly planned the attack for a year, targeting a Run for Their Lives walk, which aims to raise awareness about the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The attack injured 12 people, and Soliman had 16 unused Molotov cocktails within reach when arrested, highlighting the premeditated and violent nature of the incident. </p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine concluded a second round of direct peace talks without a major breakthrough, agreeing only to exchange sick and heavily wounded prisoners of war, as well as those aged under 25. Ukraine is insisting on a full and unconditional ceasefire for at least 30 days on land, at sea and in the air to end the killings now. Russia rejected the unconditional ceasefire, preferring to talk about lasting peace and repeating its previous tough demands, which Ukraine and its allies say are tantamount to Kyiv's de facto capitulation. Despite the lack of progress on a ceasefire, both sides committed to returning the bodies of soldiers, with Russia handing over 6,000 Ukrainian soldiers next week and Ukraine returning the bodies of 6,000 Russian soldiers. </p>

          <p>A runway at Newark Liberty International Airport has reopened nearly two weeks ahead of schedule after undergoing renovations, which is expected to alleviate recent flight delays and cancellations. The airport has faced challenges including staffing shortages and technical issues, exacerbated by the runway closure. The Port Authority accelerated the construction timeline by hiring additional crews and coordinating with contractors to ensure the runway met FAA safety standards. While the runway is now open for use, the Port Authority said that to fully complete the project by the end of the year, it would still close the runway on some weeknights and weekends in the coming months.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security emphasizes the importance of removing criminal illegal aliens from the country, referencing the suspect in the Boulder attack who overstayed his visa. The tip line aims to collect information from the public and authorities nationwide, with plans to add more staff. The announcement follows increased scrutiny of Biden-era immigration policies, as the Boulder attack suspect was granted work authorization after applying for asylum while in the country on a tourist visa. </p>

          <p>Senators are intensifying calls for a severe Russia sanctions bill, with Senator Lindsey Graham claiming the Senate will advance legislation imposing strict tariffs on Moscow. The proposed measure would slap 500% tariffs on any country that buys Moscow's energy products, aiming to cripple Russia's war machine. Graham coordinated with the White House on the "Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025," which has bipartisan support. The bill seeks to isolate Russia economically, particularly by targeting countries like China and India that continue to purchase Russian oil, and the move comes as Ukrainian officials claim their drones struck and damaged more than 40 warplanes in attacks on four military airports inside Russia.</p>

The economists also state that higher debt and deficits will put noticeable upward pressure on both inflation and interest rates.

          <p>The Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 calls for a 15% funding cut to the Education Department, reflecting the president's commitment to closing the department. While Title I funding remains consistent, several K-12 programs would be consolidated into one grant with reduced funding. Special education funding appears to increase but remains essentially flat after accounting for program consolidation. On the higher education side, the budget proposes cuts to Federal Pell Grants and a dramatic shift in the Federal Work-Study program, reducing federal support for students pursuing postsecondary education. </p>
