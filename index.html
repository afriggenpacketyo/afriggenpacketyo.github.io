          <p>Grant Hardin, known as the ‚ÄúDevil in the Ozarks,‚Äù was apprehended on Friday near the prison from which he escaped nearly two weeks prior. Hardin, who was serving a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual assault, had impersonated a corrections officer to facilitate his escape. Law enforcement officials, including tracking dogs and a U.S. Border Patrol tactical unit, located Hardin approximately 1.5 miles west of the Calico Rock North Central Unit. Hardin's capture brings an end to a widespread manhunt and assuages fears of potential harm to the community.</p>

          <p>Achieving longevity requires more than just individual optimization through diet and exercise; it necessitates a collective responsibility towards public health. The author, a public health scientist, argues that societal factors, such as public policy, infrastructure, and community, play a crucial role in determining health outcomes. Countries with longer, healthier lives often have governments and cultures that normalize healthy living through policies like nutritious food programs and clean air initiatives. The focus should shift from individual self-help to supporting policies that create healthier environments for everyone.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom will host the second round of trade talks between the United States and China, marking a diplomatic victory for the UK. The Trump administration approached the UK government to facilitate the talks, which aim to address trade war tensions. The UK's role as host is potentially advantageous as it seeks to secure its own trade agreement with the US. The talks provide an opportunity for key players to engage in face-to-face conversations and potentially foster mutual understanding amid ongoing trade disputes.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit filed by three residents against Sonoma County alleges that code enforcement is using drones to conduct warrantless aerial surveillance of private properties. The ACLU claims that the county has used drones over 700 times to find code violations without seeking a warrant. Residents allege that the drones have resulted in privacy concerns and loss of enjoyment of their property. The lawsuit raises questions about the balance between government surveillance and individual privacy rights.</p>

          <p>Federal law enforcement agencies have issued an intelligence bulletin warning of potential threats to Israeli and Jewish institutions and their supporters in the U.S. The warning follows recent attacks, including those in Boulder, Colorado, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. The bulletin highlights concerns that online messaging promoting violence and praising attackers could motivate others to engage in similar acts. Law enforcement agencies advise security partners to remain vigilant for targeted violence.</p>
