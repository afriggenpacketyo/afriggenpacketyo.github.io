            <p>Solicitor General John Sauer challenged the Supreme Court's temporary block on deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act, deeming it "unprecedented." Sauer argued the detainees lack standing for an injunction, as the government has paused deportations and is allowing legal processes. He urged the justices to limit the order to AEA removals, emphasizing lower courts haven't fully assessed the government's notice and appeal process. The legal dispute underscores the complexities of immigration enforcement and the balance between national security and individual rights. Optimism score: 40</p>

            <p>Israel on Sunday said "professional failures" were made after the Israeli mllitary killed 15 Palestinian paramedics in the Gaza Strip last month. The paramedics were killed early on March 23, when the Israeli military opened fire on ambulances near the southern Gaza city of Rafah. With the incident sparking international criticism, Israel had ordered an internal investigation into the deaths. The probe found no evidence to "support claims of execution," according to the Israeli military. Optimism score: 25</p>
