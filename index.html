The promotional tour is seen as a White House effort to highlight legislative achievements and bolster support in key swing districts ahead of midterm elections.

          <p>A tariff simulator from The Observatory of Economic Complexity projects that the new U.S.-EU trade deal will cause a dramatic shift in global trade flows. The model forecasts a 46% drop in global exports to the U.S. by 2027 compared to recent years, as the 15% tariff framework encourages countries to trade more with each other and less with America. While some European nations may see increased exports to the U.S., major partners like China, Canada, and Mexico are expected to see significant decreases.

          <p>Tyler Boebert, the 20-year-old son of U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, has received a misdemeanor citation for child abuse related to an incident with his infant son. The citation for "criminal negligence" notes that no death or injury occurred. Rep. Boebert stated the event stemmed from a "miscommunication on monitoring" her grandson, who got out of the house. This is the latest in a series of legal issues for Tyler, who was previously arrested on felony charges for property theft. The congresswoman acknowledged her son must take responsibility for his actions as an adult and father.</p>

          <p>Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has firmly rejected diplomatic outreach from South Korea's new liberal government. In a statement, she asserted that Seoul's "blind trust" in its alliance with the U.S. and its underlying hostility make it no different from the previous conservative administration. The comments signal that North Korea, which is increasingly focused on its cooperation with Russia, has no immediate interest in resuming dialogue with South Korea or the United States. This stance effectively dashes hopes for a near-term improvement in inter-Korean relations.</p>

          <p>The LAPD's Pacoima station was temporarily evacuated after a couple brought in a box of military-grade explosive devices they had found while cleaning a deceased relative's home. The bomb squad was called to the scene and used a robot to assess the ordnances before deeming them safe to transport. The devices were moved to a secure facility for military collection. This incident occurred shortly after a separate explosion killed three Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives, highlighting the ongoing dangers law enforcement faces from explosive materials in the community.</p>

The tour's success reflects a broader resurgence in rock music and the band's enduring influence on a generation of artists with their blend of theatricality, emotional honesty, and gender-fluid expression. The concert featured the full concept album, presented as a satirical take on political authoritarianism, before the band played a set of other fan favorites. The performance solidified their status as a band that has reached a new career peak deep into their reunion.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has won his fourth Tour de France title, solidifying his position as one of the sport's all-time greats. Despite having the victory virtually secured, Pogačar displayed his characteristically aggressive style by attacking on the final stage in Paris, even in treacherous rainy conditions. He ultimately finished fourth on the stage, which was won by Wout van Aert, but easily claimed the overall victory by a margin of over four minutes. This win marks Pogačar's return to the top after two consecutive second-place finishes, continuing his intense rivalry with Jonas Vingegaard.</p>

          <p>Five Eastern Caribbean nations—including Antigua and Barbuda, and St. Kitts and Nevis—are experiencing a surge in demand for their "citizenship by investment" programs, largely fueled by wealthy Americans. For as little as $200,000, individuals can purchase property that comes with a passport, offering visa-free travel and significant tax advantages. Real estate agents report that political and social volatility in the U.S. is a major driver for applicants seeking an "insurance policy" passport. These programs, while a vital source of revenue for the islands, face scrutiny from the EU and U.S. over security and financial crime concerns.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have announced a major trade deal, averting a potential trade war just before a U.S. deadline. The agreement establishes a 15% baseline tariff on most EU exports to the U.S., which is half the threatened rate but higher than previous levels. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to investing hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S., including significant purchases of American energy and military equipment. The agreement brings a measure of stability to the massive transatlantic trade relationship, though some key sectors like steel still face high tariffs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The RSPCA is calling for mandatory licensing of all dog rescue organizations in the UK amid growing concerns about imported pets. Thousands of dogs are brought in annually from countries like Romania and Ukraine, often with minimal vetting, leading to issues with infectious diseases and aggressive behavior. The BBC found owners facing serious difficulties, including one dog testing positive for Brucella canis, a disease transmissible to humans. Experts describe the current system as a "ticking time bomb," putting pressure on UK shelters and posing a risk to public and animal health.</p>
