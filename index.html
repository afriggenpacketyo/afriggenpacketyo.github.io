          <p>Republicans in Congress plan to use a controversial budget maneuver to pass their $5 trillion tax cut package, potentially disregarding Senate rules.  Their strategy involves using a "current policy" baseline, which would minimize the apparent cost of the tax cuts.  Democrats strongly oppose this approach, calling it a "nuclear" option that would break Senate norms.<br><i>(not investment advice)</i></p>
