          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, has resigned after mistakenly arresting Ximena Arias Cristobal, an undocumented college student, on May 5th. The officer pulled Arias Cristobal over for an improper turn and driving without a license, leading to her detention by ICE. However, after reviewing dashcam footage, officials dismissed the charges on May 12th, realizing the mistake. Arias Cristobal, who came to the U.S. from Mexico at age 4, was released from ICE custody on bond on May 22nd, and faces deportation proceedings along with her father, who was also detained by ICE after a traffic stop in April. The Department of Homeland Security maintains that both should face consequences for being in the U.S. illegally.</p>

Jelly Roll and Bunnie Xo first met in 2015 and eloped in 2016, and the country star emphasizes open communication and a sense of humor as keys to their strong marriage.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man, identified as O.C.G., who was wrongly deported to Mexico despite his fears of persecution there. O.C.G., who is gay, had applied for asylum in the U.S. after experiencing homophobic violence in Guatemala. Despite an immigration judge's order protecting him from deportation, he was sent to Mexico, where he was subsequently returned to Guatemala and is now living in hiding, fearing for his safety. The judge criticized the government's handling of the case, noting that O.C.G. poses no security threat and faces potential torture or persecution if returned to Guatemala.</p>

          <p>Scientists have released unprecedented images of the USS F-1, a U.S. submarine lost at sea during a 1917 training accident off the coast of California, which resulted in the death of 19 crew members. The high-definition pictures were captured using advanced deep-sea imaging technology during an expedition earlier this year, revealing the final resting place of the World War I-era sub more than 1,300 feet below the ocean's surface. The team utilized a human-piloted submersible and a remote underwater vehicle to conduct meticulous surveys of the submarine, which collided with its sister ship, USS F-3, and sank in just 10 seconds. During the expedition, images were also captured of a U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo bomber that crashed nearby in 1950.</p>

The doctor's husband, also a doctor, was severely wounded and is in intensive care, while their only surviving child was also injured. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that their aircraft struck suspects operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area and that the claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review. The Nasser Medical Complex, where the pediatrician works, expressed condolences, noting the tragedy and the dire reality faced by medical staff in Gaza.

          <p>A new food aid system in Gaza, presented as neutral, was conceived and largely developed by Israelis aiming to undermine Hamas and bypass the United Nations. The plan involves private contractors, including a security group run by a former C.I.A. officer, distributing aid in areas under Israeli military control. While supporters claim it will prevent aid from falling into the wrong hands, critics warn it could restrict aid to limited areas and endanger civilians forced to travel long distances to reach food. The UN contends that the system could facilitate an Israeli plan to displace civilians out of northern Gaza.</p>

The ruling criticized the government for claiming O.C.G. was not afraid of being sent to Mexico, where he had been raped and held captive, and for errors that exacerbated his risk of persecution. The judge noted that facilitating O.C.G.’s return should be less complicated than in other cases, as he is not held by any foreign government.

          <p>Iranian director Jafar Panahi, who has previously been imprisoned and banned from film-making in his home country, spoke out against the restrictions of the regime after winning the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Panahi picked up the prestigious Palme d'Or for It Was Just an Accident, described by BBC Culture as "a furious but funny revenge thriller that takes aim at oppressive regimes". He was cheered as he urged fellow Iranians to "set aside" differences and problems. "What's most important now is our country and the freedom of our country," he said.</p>

          <p>President Trump is putting pressure on US universities, specifically targeting Harvard University by threatening to block it from enrolling foreign students. The Trump administration has already frozen billions in federal funding, citing concerns about left-wing content and ideologies, as well as pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Harvard is resisting these demands, arguing that the government is overreaching and interfering with academic freedom. If the administration succeeds, it would deprive Harvard of international talent and revenue, as well as potentially impacting the residence permits of thousands of foreign students.</p>
