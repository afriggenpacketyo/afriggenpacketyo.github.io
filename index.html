Animal rights groups advocate for their relocation to a whale sanctuary in Nova Scotia, Canada, where they can enjoy more space and freedom.

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, survivors and families are gathering to commemorate the horrors of the Nazi concentration camp. British and Canadian troops discovered the camp in April 1945, finding thousands of unburied corpses and emaciated survivors. Bergen-Belsen became notorious due to the chilling accounts of journalists and soldiers and the intact evidence of Nazi atrocities, with between 50,000 and 70,000 people dying at the camp, mostly Jews.</p>

          <p>Despite making no splashy selections in the 2025 NFL draft, the Los Angeles Rams strategically positioned themselves for future drafts by acquiring an additional first-round pick in 2026.

This move provides them with significant draft capital to potentially replace veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford or acquire other key players.

          <p>Arne Slot's seamless transition as Liverpool's manager has led the team to the brink of winning the Premier League title. Liverpool is close to securing their 20th championship with Slot's impressive record of 24 wins in 33 games. Slot's success is unexpected, considering he replaced the iconic Jurgen Klopp. If Liverpool avoids defeat against Tottenham, they will be champions of England with four games to spare.</p>

          <p>Australia's universal healthcare system, once a national treasure, is facing a crisis due to inadequate government funding, worker shortages, and rising costs for patients. Australians are increasingly delaying or forgoing necessary care. Both major parties are promising additional funding ahead of the upcoming election, but experts say sweeping changes are needed. The core of the crisis lies in GP services, with a growing number of patients now paying a "gap fee" for regular appointments.</p>
