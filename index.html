          <p>Rivian Automotive exceeded Wall Street's first-quarter expectations but adjusted its 2025 delivery target downward to between 40,000 and 46,000 units and increased its capital spending to between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. The electric vehicle manufacturer cited the uncertain global economic landscape, particularly evolving trade regulations, policies, and tariffs, as factors influencing consumer sentiment and demand. Despite these adjustments, Rivian reaffirmed its plans to achieve a modest positive gross profit this year and anticipates losses of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion on an adjusted basis before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The company also noted it ended the quarter with $8.5 billion in liquidity, including $7.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS News Confirmed has uncovered a disturbing trend of AI-generated accounts impersonating individuals with Down syndrome across social media platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. These fake accounts, often using deepfakes or AI faceswaps, mimic real disability advocates' language and gain followers rapidly, sometimes monetizing their content through adult sites or fabricated fundraising efforts. Disability advocates express concerns about the exploitation and monetization of their stories, emphasizing that individuals with Down syndrome should be the ones sharing their experiences. While platforms like Meta, TikTok, and YouTube have removed some identified accounts, the ease with which new AI-generated profiles can be created poses a challenge in combating this issue.</p>

          <p>Starting Wednesday, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will enforce Real ID requirements, potentially causing disruptions for travelers without compliant identification. While other forms of ID, such as passports and military IDs, will be accepted, those without Real IDs may face additional screening. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem assured lawmakers that travelers will still be allowed to fly, but should expect extra steps, and the TSA recommends arriving at least three hours before domestic flights for identity verification. The Real ID Act, passed in 2005, aims to improve security and minimize fraud, and a Real ID card has a star marking at the upper-right part of the card, according to the Department of Homeland Security.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported first fiscal quarter earnings that surpassed expectations, with overall sales surging by 36%. The company's data center segment, which includes server CPUs and GPUs, saw a 57% increase in sales, driven by demand for both Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs. The Client and Gaming segment also experienced growth, with laptop and PC chip sales rising 68% due to strong demand for Zen 5 chips, though gaming sales declined 30% due to reduced console chip revenue. AMD's forecast included $800 million in costs due to U.S. export restrictions on some of its artificial-intelligence chips.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz was elected Germany's 10th postwar chancellor on Tuesday, but only after failing to secure enough votes in the first parliamentary ballot. This unprecedented stumble raised concerns about his ability to project strength and pass critical legislation, particularly amid economic challenges and geopolitical tensions. Despite winning on the second ballot, rival parties and analysts cautioned that his credibility had suffered, and his opponents questioned his legitimacy.

          <p>Collection debt can be more costly than the original balance due to added fees, interest charges, and legal costs.

          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction against President Trump's attempt to eliminate the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), which provides federal funding to libraries and museums. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by attorneys general from 21 states, who argued that the executive order violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The IMLS is the main source of federal funding for public libraries, and its dismantling would have had significant consequences for these institutions.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that the prehistoric Chavín people in the Peruvian Andes used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals. Archaeologists discovered artifacts, including snuff tubes, containing traces of hallucinogenic substances like DMT, at Chavín de Huántar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The small size of the rooms where these artifacts were found indicates that only certain members of Chavín society were invited to partake in these rituals. Researchers suggest that these rituals may have played a role in establishing social and political hierarchies.</p>
