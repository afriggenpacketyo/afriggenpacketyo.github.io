        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A California woman, Linda Duffey Gwozdz, was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2007 shooting death of her husband, Patrick Duffey. Her defense bizarrely claimed the shooting was an accident that occurred while they were reenacting a Bugs Bunny cartoon, with her husband allegedly saying "No more buwwets" in an Elmer Fudd voice, leading her to believe the gun was unloaded. After an initial trial ended in a hung jury, prosecutors streamlined their case in a second trial, focusing on forensic evidence that contradicted her story. The second jury returned a guilty verdict, and she was sentenced to 40 years to life in prison.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a remarkable case of digital forensics, a Wisconsin man initially suspected of murdering his girlfriend was exonerated by data from his Fitbit activity tracker. The device proved he was asleep during the time of the murder in May 2016. Investigators then pivoted, using DNA evidence from the crime scene to identify a new suspect, George Burch. Authorities ultimately used Google Dashboard location data from Burch's phone to place him at the crime scene, where the victim's body was dumped, and at his own home, securing his conviction for the murder. The case highlights how personal technology can be pivotal in both clearing the innocent and convicting the guilty.</p>

          <h2>U.S. to Implement New $250 'Visa Integrity Fee' for Many International Visitors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 23:07:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is introducing a new "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for visitors requiring nonimmigrant visas, set to begin in the 2025 fiscal year. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and applies to tourists, business travelers, and international students. While the provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if visitors comply with their visa terms, such as not overstaying, significant confusion remains about the implementation. Travel industry and immigration law experts have noted a lack of clarity on how the fee will be collected and how the complex reimbursement process will work. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese voters are participating in a crucial upper house election that poses a significant challenge to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and his ruling coalition. Polls suggest his Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner could suffer major setbacks, potentially falling short of a majority and worsening political instability. The election is dominated by voter frustration over soaring prices, stagnant incomes, and the rising cost of social security. The outcome is also being watched amid the emergence of a right-wing populist party campaigning on a strict anti-foreigner platform, reflecting a shift in the political landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Motorists across the United Kingdom are increasingly avoiding steep airport drop-off fees by parking in nearby lay-bys and waiting for arriving passengers to walk to them. A recent survey found that more than half of the country's busiest airports have increased their "kiss-and-fly" charges, with some now charging £6 or more for a brief 10-minute stay. This practice highlights public frustration with what many see as extortionate fees for a basic service. In contrast, most major airports in the European Union do not charge for dropping off passengers.</p>

          <p>In Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, a systematic campaign is underway to indoctrinate children and erase their national identity. The efforts involve forcing students to use a Russian curriculum that justifies the invasion, participating in pro-Russian parades, and engaging with military-style youth groups like Yunarmia. Russian soldiers give "bravery lessons" in schools, and children are taken on state-sponsored tours of Russia to instill pro-Kremlin sentiments. This campaign of cultural and psychological re-education is considered a violation of international law, with thousands of children having been forcibly deported to Russia.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway in the UK about the potential benefits and drawbacks of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday. Proponents argue that a shorter break could help mitigate learning loss, especially for disadvantaged students, and ease the childcare and financial burden on working parents. However, opponents, including many teachers, warn that it could compress demand for family vacations, potentially driving up costs, and take away crucial recharge time for educators. Some school districts have already moved to a five-week summer break with a longer two-week half-term in October, reflecting a growing re-evaluation of the school calendar.</p>

          <p>The global transition to green technology is creating a severe environmental crisis in Chile's Atacama Desert, home to the world's largest lithium reserves. Lithium is essential for batteries in electric cars and solar energy storage, but its extraction process is draining the region's scarce water resources. This is devastating local ecosystems, shrinking lagoons, harming native flora, and threatening the livelihoods of indigenous communities who have lived there for generations. The situation highlights a major paradox where the solution to one environmental problem, climate change, is directly causing another.</p>

          <p>The UK's chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has expressed a desire to shift the nation's financial habits from risk-averse saving to more active investing in stocks and shares. The government plans to send information about investment opportunities to people with funds in low-interest cash savings accounts (ISAs). This initiative aims to unlock some of the £300 billion held in cash ISAs for investment in UK companies, though it faces hurdles like public apprehension about risk and a notable gender gap in investing. A proposal to reduce the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to push this change has been met with resistance. (not investment advice)</p>

This decline marks a notable shift from a time when Mandarin was widely promoted as the language of the future.
