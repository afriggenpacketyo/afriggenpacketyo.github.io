          <p>Unsealed court documents reveal more about Vance Boelter, the suspect in the deadly shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses. Boelter's wife told investigators they were "preppers" and he gave her a "bailout plan" to go to her mother's home. Investigators found empty rifle cases and gun-cleaning supplies in a storage locker rented by Boelter. The Hoffman family released a statement recounting the terrifying attack where they were shot after someone impersonated an officer. The family is grappling with the reality that public service carries such risks and hope for a return to civility.</p>

          <p>Recent assassinations targeting senior Iranian military officials, including Saeed Izadi and Behnam Shahryari of the Quds Force, indicate a potential breach within Iran's intelligence community. Izadi was reportedly responsible for coordinating support to Palestinian armed groups, while Shahryari headed a unit involved in smuggling weapons and funds. In response to these security concerns, Iranian officials have ordered protection personnel to avoid using internet-connected smartphones.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked a Louisiana law requiring public schools to display the Ten Commandments, citing its unconstitutionality. Civil liberties groups argued the mandate violates the separation of church and state and would isolate non-Christian students. The ruling is considered a victory for religious freedom advocates, although the state plans to appeal, potentially taking the case to the Supreme Court. Similar laws in Arkansas and Texas are facing legal challenges, setting the stage for a potential landmark Supreme Court decision on religion in schools.</p>

          <p>Neighborhoods across Los Angeles have become quiet as aggressive immigration raids by federal agents have intensified. Immigrants are weighing the risks of going outside, leading to closed businesses and reduced activity in Koreatown, the fashion district, and East LA. Residents express fear and anxiety, with some unable to work or send money to their families. Community organizations are providing support, but the raids have disrupted daily life and created a sense of unease throughout the region.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Afghans who fled to the U.S. after the Taliban regained power are facing potential deportation due to the Trump administration's anti-immigration policies. The loss of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, effective July 14, has caused fear and trauma within the community. Advocates and lawmakers argue that Afghanistan remains dangerous, particularly for women and minorities. While the U.S. government has not announced a deportation plan, they encourage Afghans to self-deport, offering limited assistance.</p>

          <p>Enrollment in computer science programs is declining as the job market for entry-level coders weakens due to advancements in artificial intelligence.

Graduates from top programs are struggling to find work, leading some to consider alternative career paths. While some argue that AI will create new demand for software engineers, others fear it will eliminate the bottom rung of the career ladder.</p>

          <p>This essay analyzes a controversial plotline in Celine Song's film 'Materialists,' drawing comparisons to Paul Verhoeven's 'Showgirls.' The author focuses on the inclusion of a sexual assault subplot involving a client of the protagonist, a matchmaker, and its impact on her character development. The author argues that the film uses the trauma of a secondary character as a means of getting from point A to point B for the protagonist. While acknowledging it's not as exploitative as other films, the author finds it cynical as a means of getting from point A to point B.</p>
