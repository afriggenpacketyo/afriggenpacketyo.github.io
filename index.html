          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, born in Uganda to Indian parents, faces scrutiny over his self-identification as 'Asian' and 'Black or African American' on a university application. While Ugandans of Indian descent are widely considered African in their home country, this identity is complex within US racial classifications, often reserved for descendants of the transatlantic slave trade. The article highlights the historical presence and contributions of Indians in Uganda, alongside the challenges of fitting multi-hyphenated identities into rigid American categories. Mamdani's heritage and his father's activism underscore a broader discussion on the fluidity of 'African' identity beyond race, challenging binary perceptions.</p>

          <p>Poland reported downing drones that entered its airspace during a large-scale Russian aerial attack on Ukraine, marking a significant escalation and a first for a NATO country. Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed the operation, stating he informed NATO's Secretary General. The Polish military scrambled aircraft and used weapons against the 'hostile objects,' which they described as an 'act of aggression' posing a real threat. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed at least eight Iranian-designed drones were aimed towards Poland, calling it an 'extremely dangerous precedent' for Europe.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the city of Hamtramck, Michigan, can enforce its policy banning LGBTQ+ flags and other private flags from public property. The lawsuit against the city was dismissed, two years after the all-Muslim city council voted to restrict public flag displays to only five official flags. Opponents argued the policy violated free speech, but the judge found it constitutional because it bans all private flags, not just specific ones. Businesses and residents are still permitted to display Pride flags on their private properties.</p>

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk, known for its Wegovy weight-loss medication, plans to cut approximately 9,000 jobs, representing 11.5% of its global workforce. This restructuring aims to simplify the organization, accelerate decision-making, and reallocate resources towards growth opportunities in diabetes and obesity. The job reductions, with about 5,000 in Denmark, are expected to incur a one-off cost of $1.26 billion, impacting full-year operating profit growth.

The main issue lies in their inefficiency in both scoring and saving goals, with players underperforming historically expected conversion rates.

          <h2>Australia Approves Vaccine to Combat Chlamydia Epidemic in Koalas</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 23:22:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has approved a vaccine to curb a rampant chlamydia epidemic that is decimating wild koala populations across eastern Australia. Scientists at the University of the Sunshine Coast spent over a decade developing the single-dose jab, which has shown to reduce the likelihood of koalas developing symptoms and decrease mortality by at least 65%. Chlamydia causes severe health issues, including blindness and infertility, and conventional antibiotic treatments can be fatal to koalas. While the vaccine offers a crucial tool, experts stress that habitat loss remains the most significant threat, necessitating broader conservation efforts alongside the medical breakthrough.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has reportedly asked the European Union to levy tariffs of up to 100% on China and India for their purchases of Russian oil. The proposal, confirmed by sources, aims to intensify pressure on Moscow to end the war in Ukraine, with Washington prepared to 'mirror' any tariffs imposed by Europe. The US has already imposed a 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising total duties to 50%. This request follows Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which yielded little progress towards a ceasefire, and highlights ongoing efforts to use economic leverage in the conflict.</p>

          <p>Newly released documents, including Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th-birthday book, offer a sickening glimpse into the convicted sex offender's elite social circle and the nature of his relationships. The 238-page book, compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell, contains lurid tributes, crude drawings, and sexually explicit references from powerful individuals, including a now-infamous letter from Donald Trump. The content suggests that Epstein's predatory lifestyle and attraction to 'girls' were an open secret among some associates, who sometimes alluded to it humorously. This document intensifies long-held suspicions about the complicity of powerful figures and the extent to which Epstein's crimes were enabled.</p>

          <p>Hamas stated that its negotiating team survived an Israeli airstrike in Qatar's capital, Doha, but confirmed the deaths of five members, including Khalil al-Hayya's son. The group claimed the attack, which severely damaged a residential compound where ceasefire talks were underway, was an attempt to assassinate its leaders and thwart international peace efforts. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the strike as 'fully justified,' targeting senior Hamas figures responsible for the October 7, 2023 attack. Qatar condemned the strike as a 'cowardly' violation of international law, reporting one security force member killed and others injured.</p>

          <p>Two former Meta safety researchers testified before a US Senate committee, accusing the social media giant of covering up potential harms to children from its virtual reality (VR) products. They claimed Meta lawyers intervened to shape internal research and demanded researchers erase evidence of sexual assault risks on VR platforms. One whistleblower alleged identifying coordinated pedophile rings using Roblox within Meta's VR ecosystem. Meta denies the allegations, calling them 'nonsense' and based on selectively leaked documents. This testimony follows previous whistleblowers who claimed Meta prioritized profit over user safety, particularly concerning teenagers' mental health.</p>

          <p>Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has resigned amid escalating youth-led anti-corruption protests that have resulted in 22 deaths and nearly 200 injuries in clashes with police. The demonstrations, initially sparked by a now-repealed social media ban, reflect deep-rooted dissatisfaction with government corruption. Protesters, largely identifying as Gen Z, have attacked government buildings and politicians' homes, defying an indefinite curfew. While the army has called for dialogue and committed to controlling the situation, the leaderless nature of the movement makes future outcomes uncertain. Students and civil society groups are joining, potentially escalating unrest if meaningful engagement with the government fails.</p>

Forty victims testified, detailing how they were lured with modeling promises but then coerced and forced into sexual acts on camera, often under threat of lawsuits or public exposure. Many victims, typically young women aged 18-21, suffered severe psychological trauma, disownment, and even attempted suicide. Their powerful testimonies underscored the profound and lasting impact of being sexually assaulted and recorded, with one victim stating, 'I am not your victim. I’m your reckoning.'</p>

          <p>Plans to distribute the remaining £25 million fortune of the disgraced Jesus Army evangelical sect could see individuals accused of child abuse receive significantly larger payments than their alleged victims. Legal submissions reveal the money is intended for loyal members, sparking outrage among survivors who received compensation from a previous scheme largely funded by insurers. A review identified 539 alleged perpetrators, including former leaders, some of whom are likely among the listed beneficiaries. Survivors describe the proposals as 'sickening' and 'massively insulting,' arguing the majority of funds should go to victims of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse.</p>

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement to resume cooperation, including restarting inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. The deal, mediated by Egypt, is described as a technical step towards indispensable inspection work under the non-proliferation treaty. Iran's Foreign Minister warned that the agreement would be terminated if any 'hostile act,' including the reimposition of UN sanctions, occurs. This progress comes after Germany, France, and the UK initiated a process to reimpose sanctions due to Iran's non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal and its suspension of IAEA cooperation following attacks on nuclear facilities.</p>
