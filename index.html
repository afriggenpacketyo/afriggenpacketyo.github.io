        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly called for the immediate termination of the legal proceedings against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, labeling the trial as politically motivated. In a letter, Trump expressed concern over attacks on free speech in both Brazil and the U.S., threatening significant tariffs on Brazilian products. Bolsonaro is facing charges related to an alleged coup attempt following his 2022 election loss, which could result in a lengthy prison sentence if he is convicted. The situation highlights the ongoing political alliance between the two conservative leaders.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 21:09:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has authorized Juul to keep its tobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes on the market, rescinding a 2022 ban. The agency concluded that the company's products could benefit adult smokers by offering a less harmful alternative to traditional cigarettes. This decision, which makes Juul one of only two companies permitted to sell menthol vapes, has drawn sharp criticism from anti-tobacco groups who blame the brand for fueling the teen vaping crisis. The authorization is not an endorsement, and the FDA maintains that non-smokers should not use any e-cigarette products.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna has stated his department has "no choice" but to honor judicial warrants from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for inmates in county jails. Luna clarified that these are federal judicial warrants for criminal charges, not civil immigration detainers, which the department does not honor due to state and local sanctuary policies. He emphasized that the transfers involve individuals with probable cause for significant crimes, seeking to reassure immigrant communities that the department is not assisting with routine ICE street operations. The statement addresses community fears following recent ICE activity in the region.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has claimed that Coca-Cola agreed to reformulate its iconic soda using cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup, a move he promoted on social media. The company has not fully confirmed the deal, stating only that details on new product innovations are forthcoming. While proponents argue cane sugar offers a better taste, public health experts note that from a health perspective, the two sweeteners are nearly identical and equally contribute to health issues like diabetes and obesity. The announcement is seen by some as a political maneuver to score points with his base.</p>

          <p>According to two U.S. intelligence sources, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian was injured during a recent Israeli airstrike on Iran. The sources confirmed Iranian state media reports that Pezeshkian sustained leg injuries while escaping a Supreme National Security Council meeting targeted in the attack. It remains unclear whether the president was an intentional target of the strike, which occurred during a 12-day conflict that also saw the deaths of several high-ranking Iranian military commanders. The White House and the Israeli government have not commented on the incident.</p>

The plan, announced by President Trump, is to house the nation's "most ruthless and violent" offenders. The proposal has been met with strong criticism from local officials and politicians like Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, who highlighted the significant economic loss from tourism revenue and called the idea foolish. The former prison was closed in 1963 due to high operating costs and is now a popular National Park Service attraction.</p>

Speaking at a conference, Noem stated she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the liquid size restrictions could be the next policy to change, following the recent elimination of the shoe removal requirement. The current "3-1-1" rule was implemented in 2006 after a foiled terrorist plot involving liquid explosives. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanning technology at airport checkpoints that can better detect threats.</p>

          <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee has advanced the nomination of Emil Bove, a former defense lawyer for Donald Trump, for a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals. The vote proceeded along party lines after Democrats walked out in protest, angered by the refusal to delay the vote and hear testimony from a Justice Department whistleblower who accused Bove of unethical conduct. Bove's nomination has faced staunch opposition due to his alleged role in a quid pro quo scheme involving the NYC mayor and claims he suggested ignoring court orders.

This research aims to provide new insights into a mysterious period known as the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, when the planet's glacial cycles changed dramatically. The data could revolutionize our understanding of climate change and help predict how our planet will respond to current levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, slowed to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a slight moderation in the rapid increase of rice prices, which had surged due to poor harvests. Despite the cooling, inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months, fueling arguments for a potential interest rate hike. However, concerns over economic growth, exacerbated by potential U.S. tariffs, may lead the central bank to delay any policy changes. (not investment advice)</p>

As a result, some consumers may be denied BNPL credit, but the rules will also grant users rights to complain to the Financial Ombudsman and receive clearer information.

Her recent refusal to express regret for those words was deemed inconsistent with the party's stance, leading to the new suspension.

          <p>CBS has announced the cancellation of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” with its final season concluding in May 2026. Colbert informed his audience during a taping, confirming that the entire franchise, which began with David Letterman in 1993, will be retired. CBS executives stated the move is a “purely a financial decision” driven by the challenging advertising landscape for late-night television and is unrelated to the show's content or high ratings. The decision comes as parent company Paramount Global awaits approval for a sale to Skydance Media, which is expected to lead to further cost-cutting measures.</p>

          <p>A 72-year-old man, Mark Sanfratello, has been arraigned on a second-degree murder charge in Oregon for the 1983 disappearance and death of his then-girlfriend, Teresa Peroni. Sanfratello was recently extradited from California after a grand jury indictment. The cold case was reopened in 2024 when investigators used modern forensic testing and new DNA evidence to confirm that a human skull found in 1997 belonged to Peroni. Authorities say Peroni was last seen with Sanfratello at a party before she vanished, and the breakthrough brings a long-awaited development in the decades-old case.</p>

          <p>In a personal account, an Australian doctor describes the harrowing conditions and immense suffering, particularly of children, witnessed while working in a Gaza field hospital. The article highlights the heroism of local Palestinian healthcare workers who risk their lives daily, continuing to work despite losing their own homes and families. The author contrasts this with the safety that international staff can return to, rejecting the "hero" label for themselves. The piece is a powerful call for an end to the blockade, the bombing of hospitals, and a permanent ceasefire to prevent further loss of life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers are facing record-high prices for beef, with the cost of ground beef and steaks soaring due to a convergence of factors. The U.S. cattle herd has shrunk to its lowest level since 1951, a decline exacerbated by years of drought, which raised feed costs and led ranchers to sell off cattle. Higher cattle prices incentivize selling over breeding, further tightening supply. Additional pressures include a ban on cattle imports from Mexico due to a parasite outbreak and the potential impact of widespread tariffs on imported beef, suggesting that significant price relief is unlikely in the near future.</p>

Both Democrats and many of Trump's own supporters are demanding transparency, putting the administration in a difficult political position.

Fico stated that Slovakia received necessary guarantees from the EU regarding future gas prices and supply, making it "counterproductive" to continue the blockade.

The sentencing memo, which also calls for credit for time served, effectively means Hankison would serve no additional jail time.

The court's majority opinion argued that it was likely impossible to draw a non-diminishing district in the area without improperly making race the predominant factor.
