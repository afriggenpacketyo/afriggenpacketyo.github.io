            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has fallen to its lowest point during his presidency, driven by widespread dissatisfaction with his handling of tariffs, inflation, and government spending. A recent CNBC survey reveals a significant shift towards economic pessimism among Americans, including key demographics like independents and blue-collar workers. While Trump's base remains supportive, concerns are rising about the negative impact of tariffs, particularly regarding trade with countries like Canada, Mexico, and the European Union. The survey also indicates growing fears of a potential recession. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case challenging the Affordable Care Act's requirement for insurers to cover preventative services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The case, *Kennedy v. Braidwood Management*, centers on the constitutionality of the task force's structure and whether its members are properly appointed. Based on the arguments, Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett seemed likely to side with the court's Democrats, potentially preserving the mandate for insurers to cover services like cancer screenings and HIV-prevention drugs. The court may also send the case back to a lower court for further review.</p>

            <p>Elon Musk suggested he is looking to put a "proper value" on his AI startup xAI during a recent investor call. While Musk didn't directly discuss a funding round, sources interpreted his comments as a sign that xAI is preparing for a significant capital raise. The company also reportedly discussed a potential revenue run rate of $1 billion or more. This comes after reports that xAI was raising up to $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation to acquire Nvidia chips.</p>

            <p>Simone Biles experienced the "twisties" prior to the 2016 Olympics, according to her former coach Aimee Boorman. This revelation comes years after the condition disrupted Biles' performance at the Tokyo Games. Boorman's new book describes how Biles lost her orientation in the air, causing her to fear getting lost in the air, but the gymnast eventually regained her ability to twist in time for the 2016 Olympic trials. The twisties, along with mental health concerns, caused Biles to withdraw from all but one final at the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
