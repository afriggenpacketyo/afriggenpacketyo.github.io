          <p>A historic hotel in the California Delta is grieving the theft of several dozen of its resident peacocks, with a witness reporting two men forcing a bird into a truck. The Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the incident as a felony, given the high monetary value of the birds. Hotel staff and authorities are concerned the peacocks may have been stolen for the black market exotic animal trade or even for their meat. The hotel has since installed additional security cameras to protect the few remaining birds as the community mourns the loss of the beloved local icons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>National Archives documents show that former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie received tens of thousands of pounds in discounts on designer clothing while in office. Between 2001 and 2002, the couple paid just £31,000 for clothes valued at over £75,000, raising concerns among Downing Street officials about potential conflicts with the ministerial code. Memos reveal officials advised the Blairs to repay a portion of the discounts to manage public perception, though it remains unclear if this occurred. A representative for the Blairs stated that advice was sought and followed at the time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hunter Biden has suggested that his father Joe Biden's widely criticized debate performance was a result of taking the sleep aid Ambien. In a recent interview, he explained that the former president was exhausted from extensive international travel and was given the medication to help him sleep, which led to him appearing like a 'deer in the headlights' on stage. This performance was a pivotal moment, triggering significant backlash and ultimately contributing to Joe Biden stepping aside as the Democratic presidential candidate. The former president's team had previously attributed the poor showing to jet lag.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from property portal Zoopla indicates that the average monthly rent for new tenancies in the UK has increased by £221, or 21%, over the past three years. This surge, driven by high demand and a shortage of available properties, has pushed the average monthly rent to £1,283. The report highlights the severe financial pressure on tenants, with some forced to turn down job opportunities or move due to unaffordable housing costs. While the rate of rent increases has recently slowed, particularly in major cities, affordability remains a significant challenge for many renters across the country.</p>

          <p>Newly circulated air-to-air photographs of China's J-35 stealth fighter are providing strong evidence that the aircraft is nearing operational readiness. The images clearly show the jets with official naval markings, including the 'Flying Shark' insignia, and serial numbers indicating they are from an initial production run. Military analysts suggest these details confirm the fifth-generation fighter has been integrated into the People's Liberation Army Navy's carrier aviation force. The development signals a significant advancement in China's military capabilities, with the J-35 expected to be deployed on the country's newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian.</p>

          <p>The family of a 61-year-old man who died after being pulled into an MRI machine is claiming the technician was at fault for the fatal accident. Keith McAllister was accompanying his wife for a scan when the technician allegedly invited him into the room without warning him to remove a metal chain, which caused the machine's powerful magnet to pull him in. McAllister was stuck to the machine for nearly an hour and later died from multiple heart attacks following the incident. His family has disputed reports that he was unauthorized to be in the room, stating he was brought in by the technician to assist his wife.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appellate court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 immigrants from Afghanistan and Cameroon. The decision lifts a temporary block, allowing the government to end the program that provides deportation relief and work permits to individuals from countries deemed unsafe. While the court acknowledged the plausibility of the legal challenge against the termination, it found insufficient evidence to halt the policy change.

          <p>Critics are accusing President Trump of attempting to distract from the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files by making a series of unrelated and provocative statements. Recent social media posts, including a demand for the Washington Commanders to revert to their old name, are being interpreted as efforts to shift public focus away from his administration's handling of the case. The accusations come after the Justice Department announced it would not release more Epstein files, a move that angered some of Trump's own supporters. Political opponents and commentators suggest these actions are a deliberate strategy to manage the political fallout.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that while President Trump's universal tariffs are widely criticized, they may have a positive side effect by exposing and prompting the removal of self-defeating internal trade barriers in other countries. Nations and trading blocs like Canada, China, and the European Union have long-standing domestic regulations that hinder their own economic potential. The pressure from U.S. tariffs has reportedly spurred significant movements to dismantle these internal barriers, particularly in Canada and China. This could lead to greater economic freedom and efficiency, representing an unforeseen silver lining to the contentious trade policies.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has highlighted a group of four stocks—Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase—dubbing them 'PARC' for their strong momentum driven by retail investor enthusiasm. He noted that these companies represent a separate track in the market, where passionate belief from individual investors has relentlessly pushed their prices up, often without regard for traditional metrics. While acknowledging their potential for gains, Cramer advised investors to exercise discipline and take profits when they occur. He believes these names are likely to continue their rally until a wave of new IPOs increases market supply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Earth's Faster Spin Could Force Timekeepers to Consider Unprecedented 'Negative Leap Second'</h2>

          <p>Scientists have observed that Earth's rotation has been speeding up, causing days to become marginally shorter. This trend, influenced by factors like the moon's gravity and the planet's liquid core, could eventually require an unprecedented adjustment to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). If the acceleration continues, timekeepers may need to introduce a 'negative leap second'—subtracting a second from the clock—to keep atomic time aligned with Earth's rotation. This has never been done before and raises concerns about potential disruptions to computer systems, satellites, and telecommunications that rely on precise timekeeping.</p>

          <p>A Bangladeshi air force training jet crashed into a school campus in Dhaka, killing at least 20 people and injuring over 170. The F-7 jet reportedly experienced a mechanical fault shortly after takeoff before slamming into a two-story building at the Milestone School and College. The pilot was among those killed. Eyewitnesses, including students and teachers, described a horrific scene of fire and smoke, with one student recounting that his friend was killed directly in front of him.

          <p>An analysis suggests President Trump is uniquely using the judicial system and a blizzard of executive orders to push his agenda, fundamentally altering the balance of power in the U.S. government. Recent Supreme Court rulings have emboldened the administration, which has launched what some former judges call an 'unprecedented' attack on lower federal courts that attempt to block its policies. This confrontation, marked by inflammatory rhetoric and threats against judges, raises questions about whether the judiciary can maintain its authority and what the long-term consequences will be for the separation of powers in the United States.</p>

          <p>Former Kentucky police officer Brett Hankison has been sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the fatal 2020 raid on her home.

The judge's sentence rejected a controversial recommendation from the Trump-led Justice Department for only one day of prison time. Taylor's family expressed that while the sentence was not what they hoped for, they were grateful for the measure of accountability it represented in a case that sparked nationwide protests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's second term is characterized not by a guiding policy belief, but by a culture of pettiness, anger, and retribution. The author points to several examples, from renaming military bases to barring former officials from government property, as evidence of a small-minded vengefulness that taints the executive branch. Even major foreign policy decisions, such as a recent shift on aid to Ukraine, are framed as emotional reactions to personal slights rather than coherent strategy. The piece concludes that this focus on grievance and culture-warring creates a dysfunctional and capricious style of governance.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is set to use military bases in New Jersey and Indiana to detain immigrants, according to correspondence with the Pentagon. The Defense Department approved the request, which also includes increasing detention capacity at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The plan calls for space for up to 1,000 people at Camp Atterbury in Indiana and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey. This move is part of the Trump administration's broader push to arrest and detain more people in the country without legal status, drawing condemnation from Democratic lawmakers as an inappropriate use of military resources.</p>

          <p>President Trump is restarting the judicial nominations process for his second term, with controversial lawyer Emil Bove now one step away from a federal judgeship. During his first term, Trump successfully reshaped the federal courts by appointing numerous conservative judges, often selected with the help of the Federalist Society. Bove's nomination is seen as indicative of the administration's ongoing effort to install judges who align with its political and legal philosophy. This process continues to be a central and contentious part of the administration's agenda to influence the judiciary for decades to come.</p>
