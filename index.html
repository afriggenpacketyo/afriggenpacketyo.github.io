          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels have sunk a second cargo vessel in the Red Sea within a week, resulting in multiple casualties. The Greek-operated ship, Eternity C, was attacked by small boats, leading to its sinking and the deaths of at least three crew members, with others still missing. Ten crew members were rescued, but the Houthis claim to have taken an unspecified number of survivors to a "safe location," which the US has condemned as kidnapping. This attack further escalates the threat to international shipping in the region, where the Iran-backed group has targeted dozens of vessels since November.</p>

          <p>Detectives in Wales are investigating new historical sexual abuse allegations against a recently convicted former bishop and another former vicar from the Church in Wales. Four individuals have come forward, alleging a culture where abuse was ignored, and are calling for a full independent inquiry. The investigation reveals that concerns about the bishop, Anthony Pierce, were first reported in 1986 but were not acted upon, allowing him to rise through the Church's ranks. The Church in Wales has issued an apology for its failings and promised a review of its culture and safeguarding procedures.</p>

          <p>A potentially tragic situation in Los Angeles ended safely after all 31 workers trapped in a collapsed tunnel were rescued without injury. The partial collapse occurred in an 18-foot diameter wastewater tunnel under construction, leaving the workers over five miles from the sole entry point. The crew was able to climb over the debris and get shuttled out in groups. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and the fire chief praised the outcome as a blessing and a testament to the effective response from rescue teams.</p>

          <p>An analysis in China's official military newspaper, the People's Liberation Army Daily, has called for careful ethical and legal research into the use of humanoid robots in warfare to avoid "moral pitfalls." The article references Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, noting that armed robots inherently violate the principle of not harming humans. The authors argue that any militarized humanoid robots must be designed to obey, respect, and protect humans in accordance with the fundamental principles of the laws of war.</p>

An agency official acknowledged the incident as an "operational failure" and stated they are focused on fixing systemic deficiencies that led to the lapse. The disciplinary action follows heavy criticism and a bipartisan House report which concluded that the incident, where one attendee was killed, was preventable and cited leadership and training issues.</p>

          <p>A Global Witness investigation has revealed that some of the world's poorest countries, including Somalia, Haiti, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are paying millions to lobbying firms with close ties to Donald Trump.

          <p>An analysis of UK politics notes that Reform UK is gaining significant momentum, highlighted by the recent defection of several former Conservative MPs, including a one-time party chairman. This trend is forcing the ruling Labour party to shift its strategic focus toward countering Nigel Farage's party, which it now views as a serious, sustained threat. This realignment marks an extraordinary shift in the political landscape, as Labour increasingly targets Reform UK instead of its traditional Conservative rivals.</p>

The new controls are causing disruptions and frustration for residents, commuters, and businesses in the closely integrated German-Polish border region, highlighting growing EU tensions.</p>
