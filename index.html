          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after sparking public outrage by stating he had never bought rice, as he received it from supporters, amid soaring rice prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted Eto's resignation and appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister. The comment drew attention to the government's struggle to address the rice shortage, which has driven up costs for Japanese households. The resignation underscores the political sensitivity of food prices and the government's response to economic challenges.</p>

          <p>Scientists are warning that a 1,000-foot-tall mega-tsunami could potentially devastate America's West Coast if a strong earthquake strikes the Cascadia subduction zone. A study estimates a 15% chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years, potentially sinking coastal land and inundating cities like Seattle and Portland. Unlike gradual climate-driven events, this earthquake would occur within minutes, leaving little time for adaptation. The most severe effects are projected for southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California.</p>

          <p>Manchester United and Tottenham are set to compete in the Europa League final, with both teams experiencing disappointing seasons. While Tottenham's struggles have been attributed to injuries, Manchester United's issues are largely self-inflicted, including managerial changes and inconsistent performance. Despite periods of fluid play, United's overall season has been marred by defensive errors and a lack of threat in attack. The outcome of the final could determine the future of Tottenham's manager, while United seeks to salvage their season with a victory.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has criticized US export controls on artificial intelligence chips to China, stating that they have been a failure as Chinese companies are turning to locally-developed technology. The US restrictions have pushed China to invest aggressively in developing its own supply chain, reducing Nvidia's market share in China. Huang noted that Nvidia's share of China's AI chip market has plummeted significantly due to the export controls. The US government has rolled back some curbs amid concerns that they were hindering the development of AI.</p>
