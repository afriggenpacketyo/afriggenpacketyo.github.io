        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department has abruptly halted the issuance of visitor visas for children from Gaza seeking urgent medical care, announcing a review of its "medical-humanitarian" visa process. The decision followed an online pressure campaign by Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer who spread false claims about injured Palestinian children arriving in the U.S. for treatment, including amputees needing prosthetic limbs. Humanitarian groups have condemned the move as cruel, stating it will endanger the lives of children with severe injuries and illnesses who have no other options for care due to the collapse of Gaza's healthcare system.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles has a new architectural landmark in the form of a five-story vertical mausoleum at the historic Hollywood Forever Cemetery. The Gower Mausoleum was designed to address the growing demand for burial space in the dense urban environment by building upwards rather than outwards. The modern structure, which features marble, natural light, and views of the city, provides permanent housing for approximately 13,000 people. This development is part of the cemetery's broader effort to integrate itself into the community by hosting cultural events, making it a place for both the living and the deceased.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The youth-focused accessory chain Claire's has appointed administrators in the UK and Ireland, signaling severe financial distress as it struggles with declining sales and intense competition. Once a staple for tweens and teens known for its affordable jewelry and ear-piercing services, the brand has failed to keep pace with the rapidly changing retail landscape. Analysts point to the rise of online fast-fashion giants like Shein and Temu, which can replicate social media trends at lower prices and faster speeds. The company's struggles reflect a broader shift in how young consumers shop, influenced more by online trends than traditional brick-and-mortar experiences.</p>

          <p>Authorities in San Bernardino County, California, are actively searching for a seven-month-old boy who was allegedly kidnapped after his mother was attacked outside a shopping plaza. The mother reported that she was struck from behind and lost consciousness, and when she awoke, her son, Emmanuel Haro, was gone. Investigators have noted inconsistencies in the mother's initial statement and have not ruled out foul play in the case. The parents have made a public plea for the safe return of their child, as law enforcement continues to seek information from the public.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing hot weather, parts of the UK are showing signs of an early autumn, such as trees shedding leaves and berries ripening prematurely. Experts explain this is not a true seasonal shift but rather a stress response from nature due to a prolonged hot and dry summer, which is on track to be one of the warmest on record. This "false autumn" has significant ecological consequences, potentially disrupting food sources for wildlife like birds and badgers, who rely on a predictable seasonal cycle. The phenomenon is seen as another chaotic impact of climate change on the natural world.</p>

          <p>A homeless man in Washington D.C. was forced to move from his tent encampment just four days after President Donald Trump posted a photo of him on social media, using it to demand the immediate removal of such sites.

The incident provides a personal perspective on the human impact of the administration's crackdown on homelessness in the nation's capital, which has displaced residents with little notice.</p>

          <p>A group of students in the UK have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds, just after returning to school from a COVID-19 lockdown in 2021. The letters captured their fears about the pandemic and their hopes for the future, with questions ranging from whether they had a girlfriend yet to their dreams of attending university. The emotional exercise, organized by their teacher, allowed the now 16-year-old students to reflect on their personal growth and the unique challenges they faced during their disrupted secondary school education as they prepared to receive their GCSE exam results.</p>

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, U.S. President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday to discuss a direct peace agreement to end the war, rather than a ceasefire. Trump stated the proposal would be discussed in the Oval Office, adding that if successful, a subsequent meeting with Putin could be scheduled to finalize the terms. The announcement came after a late-night call with Zelenskyy and European leaders, where Trump conveyed that Putin was prepared to make unspecified concessions to secure a deal and save potentially millions of lives.</p>

This culinary expansion is driven by intense competition in China's domestic market and reflects a broader rise in Chinese soft power.

The collection features hits like “Burning Love” and soulful ballads such as “Separate Ways,” showcasing his expressive vocal abilities in his later years. According to his longtime friend Jerry Schilling, this period also included a significant disappointment when Presley lost the co-starring role in “A Star Is Born” opposite Barbra Streisand. Schilling believes this missed opportunity marked a turning point that contributed to the decline preceding Presley's death in 1977.</p>

The success of these premium devices, along with a wide range of products at various price points, has renewed the competitive dynamic between the two tech giants, pressuring Apple to innovate its own device lineup.

The author refutes the argument that the law has been so successful that regulations can be loosened, pointing to new dangers facing marine life, such as climate change, ship strikes, and pollution. Citing the crashing gray whale population and threats to North Atlantic right whales, the piece contends that the health of marine mammals serves as a critical indicator for the overall health of the oceans.

          <p>Six senior Senate Democrats have formally objected to the Trump administration's decision to allow Nvidia and AMD to sell advanced AI semiconductor chips to China. The deal permits the sales in exchange for the U.S. government receiving a 15% share of the revenue, a move the senators described as "trading away U.S. technology leadership" for a commission. In their letter, the lawmakers expressed serious alarm that providing China with this technology could enhance its military capabilities and undermine U.S. national security, urging the administration to reverse its "reckless plan."

          <p>Following the U.S.-Russia summit, reports have emerged that President Donald Trump is prepared to support a peace plan that involves Ukraine ceding the unoccupied parts of its Donbas region to Russia. In exchange, Vladimir Putin allegedly offered to freeze the current frontlines in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, a proposal Trump reportedly relayed to European leaders and President Zelenskyy. This potential concession of sovereign Ukrainian territory, which includes key defensive cities, marks a significant departure from the stance of Ukraine and its European allies, raising concerns about the terms of the proposed deal.</p>

          <p>Thirteen people have been arrested in Norwich, UK, on suspicion of supporting a proscribed organization after displaying placards for Palestine Action. The arrests occurred just a day after London's Metropolitan Police announced 60 more prosecutions related to the group. Palestine Action was recently designated a terrorist organization by the UK government following acts of criminal damage, making it illegal to be a member or show public support. Civil liberties groups have expressed concern over the mass arrests, while the group's lawyers are challenging the ban in court, arguing it infringes on the right to free speech and legitimate protest.</p>

          <p>The summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin has been met with widespread disappointment in Ukraine, with many viewing it as a public relations victory for Moscow that offered no tangible benefits for Kyiv. Analysts suggest Putin achieved his goal of ending his international isolation and legitimizing his position without making any real concessions on the war. For many Ukrainians, the formal reception for Putin, including a red carpet, was particularly galling, seen as an act of honoring a leader responsible for immense suffering and war crimes, deepening uncertainty about future U.S. support.</p>

          <p>Australia's national rugby team, the Wallabies, secured a remarkable 38-22 victory over world champions South Africa after overcoming a 22-point deficit in Johannesburg.

The comeback was fueled by a dominant performance at the breakdown, with captain Harry Wilson scoring two tries. The stunning result marks a significant achievement for the Wallabies and an unexpected start to the Rugby Championship tournament for the Springboks.</p>
