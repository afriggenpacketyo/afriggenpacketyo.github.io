          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the U.S. is at odds with Iran's nuclear program, not the country itself, following recent U.S. military strikes. Vance praised President Trump's actions and expressed gratitude to the U.S. troops involved in the mission, emphasizing the importance of preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. He highlighted the precision and skill of the operation, which he believes has significantly delayed Iran's nuclear ambitions, adding that the United States is open to peaceful negotiations if Iran abandons its nuclear weapons pursuit. Vance warned against any Iranian retaliation, promising an overwhelming response to any attacks on American troops.</p>

          <p>The U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear sites has prompted a range of international reactions, with fears rising about a potential wider regional conflict. Israeli leaders praised the U.S. action, while Iranian officials vowed to defend their sovereignty. The United Nations expressed grave concern, urging de-escalation and diplomacy, while allies of Iran, such as Hamas and the Houthis, condemned the strikes and pledged retaliation. Saudi Arabia called for restraint, and other nations, including China and the U.K., urged dialogue and negotiation to prevent further escalation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities represents a significant gamble with potentially far-reaching consequences. Success could disempower Iran and enhance Trump's authority, but failure could lead to a wider conflict and further destabilize the Middle East. China and Russia are closely watching the situation, while Gulf states fear being drawn into a war. The article suggests that a careful de-escalation is necessary but fraught with risk, and the best-case scenario involves a symbolic Iranian retaliation followed by renewed negotiations.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that President Trump had already approved a plan to attack an Iranian nuclear facility before a scheduled lunch with Steve Bannon. Bannon, reportedly disagreeing with the plan, intended to raise concerns about Israeli intelligence and the effectiveness of the bunker-buster bomb. However, a White House official claims that Trump had already decided to hold off on the strike before the lunch. This account highlights the internal discussions and decision-making processes leading up to the U.S. action against Iran.</p>

          <p>Tens of millions of people across the Midwest and East Coast are experiencing dangerously hot temperatures as a rare June heatwave persists. Heat advisories are in effect from Minnesota to Maine, with heat indices expected to exceed 100F in many areas. Cities are opening cooling centers and taking precautions to protect residents from heat-related illnesses. Meteorologists attribute the extreme temperatures to a heat dome, a large area of high pressure trapping heat and humidity.</p>

          <p>Ben Stokes made a key breakthrough after Harry Brook's impressive 99 on the third day of the first Test at Headingley between England and India. India was building their lead when Stokes dismissed Sai Sudharsan, leaving India 90-2 with a lead of 96 runs at the close. Brook's innings included some remarkable shots, but he was eventually caught, and England was later bowled out for 465. The match is finely poised, with both teams having opportunities to gain the upper hand.</p>

          <p>New satellite images of Iranian nuclear sites show limited damage despite President Trump's claim that they were "totally obliterated." The images show a new crater at Natanz but no conclusive evidence that the attack breached the underground site. A large support building at Fordow also remained undamaged. Darya Dolzikova, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said there were slim prospects that the US entering the war would convince Iran to increase IAEA cooperation. The IAEA called on a cessation of hostilities in order to address the situation.</p>

          <p>Lawmakers across the political aisle offered a mixed response Saturday following President Trump's announcement that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities. Congressional Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey Graham and Sen. Ted Cruz, backed Mr. Trump's actions, while a number of leading Democrats condemned his decision to launch the attack without consulting Congress. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other Democrats agreed with Massie that the president should have consulted Congress, and on Saturday demanded that lawmakers be "fully and immediately" briefed on the attacks in a classified setting.</p>

          <p>Lawmakers across the political spectrum have responded to President Trump's decision to launch strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities with mixed reactions.

Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, while Gulf markets showed resilience. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed slightly lower, while Qatar and Bahrain gained. Egypt's EGX30 saw a significant increase. Analysts suggest that the Gulf's distancing from the conflict and calls for appeasement have helped to insulate it from significant market impact, with some viewing the removal of the Iranian threat as a positive development.</p>

          <p>Pentagon officials have revealed details about "Operation Midnight Hammer," the U.S. mission to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran. The operation involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers flying from Missouri, supported by fighter jets, refueling planes, and surveillance aircraft. The bombers dropped a total of 14 "bunker-buster" bombs on targets at Fordo and Natanz, while Tomahawk cruise missiles targeted Isfahan. Officials claim the strikes inflicted "extremely severe damage and destruction" and warned Iran against any retaliatory action. The mission was described as the longest B-2 Spirit bomber mission since 2001.</p>
