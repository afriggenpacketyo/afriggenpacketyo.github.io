        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court is considering a novel approach to address President Trump's actions that have effectively undermined protections for federal civil servants. Trump fired officials responsible for enforcing civil service laws, leading to a situation where these protections are unenforceable. The Fourth Circuit's proposal suggests that if the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) is unable to fulfill its role due to political interference, federal courts should step in to hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. This decision aims to close a legal loophole and ensure that civil servants are protected by existing laws, even if the executive branch attempts to weaken those protections. The legal theory of the 'unitary executive' plays a role in the current circumstances.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump reported that Vladimir Putin expressed his intention to retaliate for Ukraine's drone attack on Russian airfields during a recent phone call between the two leaders. The call, which lasted over an hour, was the first since the attack on missile-carrying aircraft inside Russia. Trump stated that he did not believe the call would lead to immediate peace. Russian officials have not confirmed this, but Moscow has previously indicated that military options are being considered in response. The conversation also touched on potential cooperation between the two countries and Ukraine's alleged attempts to disrupt negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded Biden-era guidance that required hospitals to perform abortions in emergency situations, even in states where the procedure is illegal. This guidance, issued in 2022, was based on the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which ensures that emergency patients receive necessary treatment regardless of their ability to pay. The rescission reflects the Trump administration's stance on abortion access. Abortion rights groups have criticized the decision, arguing that it endangers women's lives, but the ACLU has said the rescinding of the guidance does not change hospitals' legal obligation under the EMTALA statute to provide health care and life-saving abortions care.</p>

          <p>CrowdStrike's shares declined after the cybersecurity company issued weaker-than-expected revenue guidance for the current quarter. The company cited the ongoing impact of a widespread IT outage from last July and the end of an incentive program designed to retain customers after the incident. CrowdStrike also disclosed that it received requests for information from the Justice Department and the SEC regarding revenue recognition, annualized revenue, the outage, and related matters. Despite the disappointing guidance, CrowdStrike exceeded earnings estimates for the fiscal first quarter and announced a $1 billion share repurchase plan. (not investment advice)</p>
