          <p>In the Women's Cricket World Cup, Australian leg-spinner Alana King achieved the best bowling figures in the tournament's history, taking seven wickets for just 18 runs against South Africa. Her record-breaking performance led to South Africa's collapse, as they were bowled out for only 97 runs. Australia easily chased the target, securing a seven-wicket victory with 199 balls to spare and setting up a semi-final match against India. This dominant win solidifies Australia's top position in the group stage, highlighting their strength as they head into the knockout rounds of the competition.</p>

          <p>A vibrant Pablo Picasso portrait of his muse and partner, Dora Maar, titled "Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat," has sold for approximately $37 million at an auction in Paris. Painted in 1943 during a tumultuous period in their relationship, the artwork had been in a private family collection since 1944 and was hidden from public view for over 80 years. The sale price surpassed expectations, becoming the highest-priced artwork sold at a French auction this year. Experts noted the painting's exceptional condition and vivid colors, which were previously known only through a black-and-white photograph.</p>

Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump stated his intention to discuss the conflict with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his upcoming tour of Asia. This diplomatic approach comes amid growing frustration with Moscow and the recent imposition of new U.S. sanctions on Russian oil companies. Despite China's strong alliance with Russia, Trump believes Xi could exert significant influence on Vladimir Putin to help resolve the protracted conflict.</p>

          <p>Two-time Olympic gold medalist Abby Wambach suggests that parents should not attend their children's sports practices to help them develop internal motivation and resilience. In a recent interview, the former soccer star argued that a parent's presence can make a child nervous or overly driven to impress, outsourcing their motivation. By allowing children to interact with coaches and teammates without supervision, they can learn to take risks and make mistakes freely. Wambach believes this approach helps children become self-starters, a trait that contributes to success in adulthood.</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian missile and drone attacks have killed at least four people and wounded 20 across Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials. In Kyiv, two fatalities were reported from a ballistic missile strike, while two others were killed in the Dnipropetrovsk region, where residential buildings were damaged. Ukraine's air force stated it intercepted most of the incoming drones and several missiles. In response, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy renewed his plea for additional Western air defense systems, specifically U.S. Patriot systems, to protect Ukrainian cities from such attacks.</p>

          <p>A new report from Brown Harris Stevens reveals that more than a third of Manhattan condo apartments resold between July 2024 and June 2025 were sold at a loss. This trend indicates that the median price per square foot for these properties has remained largely stagnant over the past decade, a stark contrast to rising home prices in most of the U.S. The luxury market, however, proved to be an exception, with properties sold for over $10 million consistently yielding profits. Analysts attribute Manhattan's price weakness to factors like tax law changes and pandemic-related migration, though the market remains stable. (not investment advice)</p>

He noted that money, power, and fame can make individuals feel invincible, blinding them to the risks. Lansky II explained that sports have always been a target for organized crime due to the relative ease of fixing games compared to casino gambling.</p>

The author argues that the move, undertaken without public input or submitted plans, exemplifies a presidency that operates without regard for historical preservation, norms, or laws. The project is being funded by Trump and corporate donors, which the article suggests would be viewed as corruption in another country. The author posits that this massive, personal project may also signal Trump's intentions to remain in power beyond the constitutional two-term limit.</p>

          <p>Despite persistent social media rumors about a "Rainey Street Ripper" in Austin, Texas, authorities and academic researchers have found no evidence of a serial killer. A study determined that recent drownings in Lady Bird Lake were likely accidental and related to alcohol consumption near the city's bar district. This phenomenon of phantom serial killers has also appeared in New York and Boston, where police have similarly refuted such claims. Experts note that while public fascination with serial killers remains high, fueled by entertainment, the actual number of such criminals has declined by about 80% since peaking in the 1970s due to advances in DNA technology and increased public awareness.</p>

The denial follows the complete demolition of the historic East Wing to make way for the 90,000-square-foot event space. While senior administration officials had reportedly referred to the project as "The President Donald J.

President Trump has accused Maduro of leading a drug-trafficking organization, fueling fears in Venezuela that the military buildup is a precursor to an intervention aimed at regime change.

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on the overwhelming number of prescription drug advertisements airing during post-season baseball, particularly for conditions like plaque psoriasis and Crohn's disease. Drug companies spent nearly $900 million on sports programming ads last year, targeting a large, captive audience that often aligns with the demographics for common health issues. While the FDA permits such ads with clear risk disclosures, the commercials juxtapose images of active, happy people with a long list of severe potential side effects. The article suggests this direct-to-consumer advertising is more about persuasion than information, potentially influencing both patients and their doctors.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has taken a nearly 5% stake in engineering and construction company Fluor, aiming to unlock value from its significant holding in NuScale Power. Fluor's 39% stake in the small modular nuclear reactor company is valued at approximately $4.3 billion, representing over 60% of Fluor's market capitalization. Starboard argues that this holding is depressing Fluor's core business valuation and is urging management to consider a separation, such as a sale or a tax-free spinoff of the NuScale shares. Such a move could lead to a significant rerating of Fluor's stock. (not investment advice)</p>
