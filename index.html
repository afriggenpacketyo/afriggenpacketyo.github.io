        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant policy shift driven by the war in Ukraine and pressure from allies, Germany is amending its constitution to dramatically increase defense spending. The plan aims to raise its military budget to 3.5% of GDP, making its armed forces the largest in Europe. This move will fund a massive overhaul of the beleaguered Bundeswehr, boosting the domestic defense industry like drone-maker Quantum Systems. However, the article notes that rebuilding a strong military culture and recruiting personnel will be a generational challenge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court ended its term with several landmark decisions, largely split along ideological lines. In a major ruling, the court reined in the power of lower court judges by ending the practice of issuing nationwide injunctions that block executive actions. Other significant decisions included upholding the right of parents to opt their children out of school lessons that conflict with their religious beliefs on sexuality and allowing Texas to require age verification for pornographic websites. The court deferred a decision on a key Louisiana voting rights case until its next term.</p>

          <p>This opinion article examines President Trump's on-camera use of the F-word while discussing international conflict, noting it as a likely first for a sitting president in a public forum. The author suggests that while the language broke presidential norms, it conveyed a sense of authenticity and frustration that may have resonated with the public. The piece argues that such moments, when used judiciously, can make politicians seem more human and less scripted, potentially increasing their trustworthiness among voters.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has made the rare decision to postpone its ruling on a Louisiana congressional redistricting case, scheduling it for re-argument in the next term. The case questions whether a map drawn with a second majority-Black district to comply with the Voting Rights Act is an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. This unusual delay has fueled concern among legal experts and advocates that the court's conservative majority may be preparing a major decision that could further weaken the landmark 1965 law.</p>
