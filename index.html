          <p>Russia and Ukraine have exchanged 390 soldiers and civilians each, marking the largest prisoner swap since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022, which was agreed to during direct talks in Istanbul. Both sides returned 270 servicemen and 120 civilians on the Ukrainian border with Belarus, with further swaps expected in the coming days as part of the agreement to exchange 1,000 prisoners. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy announced the return of his people, while the Russian defense ministry said its servicemen and civilians were taken to Belarus for medical checks and treatment.

          <p>President Trump has threatened Apple with a 25% tariff if the company does not manufacture its iPhones in the United States, criticizing their move to shift some production to India. Treasury Secretary Bessent suggested this is part of a broader effort to bring precision manufacturing back to the U.S., particularly in semiconductors, to secure the supply chain. Apple CEO Tim Cook has previously stated that the company already sources components from the U.S., but analysts believe a full relocation is unlikely due to high costs and logistical challenges. Trump's proposed tariffs aim to incentivize domestic manufacturing, but analysts caution that the price of iPhones could dramatically increase as a result. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has extended the block on the Trump administration's plans to sharply cut jobs and reorganize federal agencies under the DOGE initiative, which is being done with the help of Elon Musk. The preliminary injunction pauses further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch for the duration of the lawsuit. The Trump administration has appealed the decision, arguing that Presidents can set policy priorities, but the judge emphasized that Congress creates and funds federal agencies, giving them duties they must carry out. The judge stated that agencies cannot conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following the Department of Homeland Security's decision to revoke the university's ability to enroll international students. The lawsuit accuses the Trump administration of retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights, which includes rejecting government demands to control the university's governance and curriculum. The ban affects over 7,000 current international students, including Princess Elisabeth of Belgium, and threatens the university's financial stability and academic mission. The lawsuit argues that the ban violates the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution.</p>

Harvard enrolls about 6,800 international students, who contribute disproportionately to the university's revenue and bring diverse perspectives to campus life.

He acknowledges Harvard has issues but believes the Trump administration's punitive measures, including slashing research funding and banning international students, are disproportionate. Pinker suggests that while Harvard has areas for improvement, such as academic freedom and viewpoint diversity, the blanket condemnation is unwarranted. He advocates for a more nuanced approach, diagnosing and treating specific ailments rather than destroying the institution, and he notes the importance of universities in discovering and transmitting knowledge.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that contrast-enhanced mammography can detect three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue as ultrasound, offering a more accurate screening method. The contrast-enhanced mammography can find tumors that are much smaller than those found by regular mammography. While MRI scans are better at detecting more tumors, contrast-enhanced mammograms are more cost-effective and could be made more widely available. The study, which was published in The Lancet, suggests that contrast-enhanced mammography should become the standard of care for women with dense breasts who are at high risk of developing breast cancer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that credit card interest rates are unlikely to decrease soon, potentially remaining elevated into 2026. Factors influencing this include the Federal Reserve's cautious stance on rate cuts, high delinquency rates, and inflation rates exceeding the Fed's target. Financial advisors recommend contacting card issuers for hardship rate reductions and exploring debt repayment strategies like the debt avalanche and snowball methods. Debt consolidation loans and balance transfer credit cards are also suggested to reduce debt rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Africa's Police Minister Senzo Mchunu has refuted claims of a "white genocide" by presenting crime statistics broken down by race. Mchunu stated that between January and March, five of the six people killed on farms were black, and one was white, and the victims included farm owners, employees, and managers. He added that these statistics were compiled in response to recent genocide claims, which were amplified by President Trump. Mchunu emphasized that crime is a significant issue in South Africa, affecting all sections of society, and rejected allegations of government expropriation of land held by white farmers.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed a tax and policy bill that would repeal many of the subsidies that have been critical to the growth of electric vehicles. If enacted, the bill would eliminate subsidies for battery manufacturing, incentives for EV purchases, and funding for charging stations. The legislation would also impose a new annual fee on EV owners, effectively raising prices for car buyers and potentially slowing the adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S. Analysts predict the bill would hinder the U.S.'s ability to compete with China and Europe in electric vehicle technology.</p>

          <p>A tax and policy bill passed by House Republicans disproportionately benefits wealthy Americans while negatively impacting low-income households, according to experts. The bill's tax cuts primarily favor business owners, investors, and homeowners in high-tax areas, while reductions to social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP would harm low earners. Analyses from the Congressional Budget Office and the Yale Budget Lab indicate that income for the bottom tenth of households would fall, while those in the top 10% would see an income boost. The bill's benefits are skewed toward the wealthiest, with a significant portion of the tax cuts going to the top 20% of households.</p>

The Turkish government now has the opportunity to consolidate peace by offering amnesty to PKK fighters and addressing Kurdish grievances. The group's leaders see this move as a new phase in their movement, focused on building a democratic society, and the new viability of this agreement will depend on what the Turkish government offers the group in exchange for relinquishing its weapons.</p>
