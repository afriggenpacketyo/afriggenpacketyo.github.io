          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly negotiating with several quantum computing companies, including IonQ and Rigetti Computing, to exchange federal funding for equity stakes. This move follows a similar pattern of government investment in industries deemed vital to national security, such as previous stakes taken in rare earths company MP Materials and semiconductor firm Intel. The strategy reflects a growing government focus on technological competition with China and ensuring the U.S. benefits from the growth of federally-funded strategic industries. Quantum computing is viewed as a critical future technology with significant economic and security implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić has labeled a shooting and arson incident outside the country's parliament in Belgrade a "terrorist attack." A 70-year-old man was arrested after firing a gun and injuring one person at a tent camp established by Vučić's supporters, before setting the tents on fire. The president asserted the attack was politically motivated, occurring amidst long-running student-led anti-government protests. The incident adds to the political tension ahead of the first anniversary of a deadly building collapse that initially triggered the nationwide demonstrations.</p>

          <p>Shares in Sweden's Volvo Cars surged by approximately 40% after the company announced third-quarter profits that significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The automaker reported an operating income of 6.4 billion Swedish kronor, attributing the strong performance to an ongoing cost-saving program and some one-off items. This resulted in the stock's best trading day since its public listing four years ago. Despite the positive results, the company acknowledged a challenging short-term outlook due to macroeconomic pressures and price competition. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's Environment Agency has given Thames Water its lowest possible rating of one star for poor environmental performance in 2024, citing repeated sewage spills. The assessment revealed that serious pollution incidents across all English water companies rose by 60% compared to the previous year, marking the worst combined score since the evaluation began in 2011. While the industry body acknowledged poor performance, Thames Water stated that its transformation program will require at least a decade. The agency attributed the decline to wet weather, chronic underinvestment in infrastructure, and increased monitoring that uncovered more failures.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed direct sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia's two largest oil producers, in a significant move to pressure Moscow over the war in Ukraine. This action, which targets corporations responsible for nearly half of Russia's crude-oil exports, aims to cripple a key source of funding for the Kremlin's military efforts. The decision marks a strategic shift for the Trump administration, which had previously hesitated to restrict Russia's energy sector due to fears of global economic impact. The sanctions are intended to coerce Russia into peace negotiations, though their immediate effect on the conflict remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A new biographical drama, "The Disappearance of Josef Mengele," examines the life of the infamous Nazi physician after he escaped justice following World War II. The film, directed by Russian filmmaker Kirill Serebrennikov, portrays Mengele's decades on the run in South America, where he was aided by a network of sympathizers. Starring August Diehl, the movie delves into the psychology of a war criminal who never escaped his past, exploring themes of ideological extremism and the "banality of evil." The film aims to serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of dogma and the frighteningly short path from ordinary person to perpetrator of atrocities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted its first-ever strikes against suspected drug-trafficking boats in the Pacific Ocean off South America, killing five people.

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service has proposed revising its standards to clarify that the date on a postmark does not necessarily reflect the date an item was mailed. This change is a consequence of the agency's reorganization, which has resulted in less frequent mail pickups in areas far from new regional processing centers. The potential for a delayed postmark has significant implications for time-sensitive documents like tax filings and mail-in ballots. To ensure a same-day postmark, the USPS advises customers to request one in person at a post office retail counter.</p>

          <p>The ongoing civil trial concerning the 2019 overdose death of Angels pitcher Tyler Skaggs places a spotlight on Major League Baseball's long history with performance-enhancing and pain-killing substances. This article traces the league's pharmacological lineage, from a 19th-century pitcher using a monkey testicle elixir to the widespread use of amphetamines, cocaine, and steroids in later decades. The culture of playing through pain to stay in the lineup has consistently driven players to seek chemical assistance. Skaggs's death from fentanyl-laced pills represents a grim continuation of this tradition, where the substances used to endure the game can have fatal consequences.</p>

With Jackson's potential return, there is hope for an offensive resurgence, but the loss of defensive lineman Nnamdi Madubuike for the season is a major blow.

          <p>A significant shortage of smaller, more affordable "starter homes" is preventing many first-time buyers from entering the housing market across the United States. Construction of these entry-level homes has plummeted, dropping from 40% of the market in the 1980s to just 12% today. Experts attribute the scarcity to soaring material costs, restrictive local zoning laws, and a "lock-in" effect where current homeowners are unwilling to sell and give up their low mortgage rates.

          <p>A second night of disorder outside a Dublin hotel used to house asylum seekers has resulted in injuries to three police officers and 24 arrests. The unrest, which saw stones and fireworks thrown at police, reportedly followed a protest over the alleged sexual assault of a young girl in the area. Police stated the violence was planned online and involved "violent thugs" intent on inciting fear. This follows widespread rioting the previous night where a police vehicle was set on fire, prompting officials to promise a robust response to any further disorder.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has maintained a notable silence a day after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized Vladimir Putin and imposed significant sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies. Trump expressed frustration that his conversations with the Russian leader "don't go anywhere" and canceled a planned meeting in Hungary. Pro-Kremlin state media outlets largely omitted coverage of Trump's criticism. This quiet response follows a sudden shift in tone from Trump, who just days earlier had described a phone call with Putin as "very productive," creating uncertainty in the diplomatic landscape.</p>

          <p>The national inquiry into child sexual exploitation by grooming gangs in England and Wales is in turmoil after four members of its survivor panel resigned. In open letters, they cited concerns about the inquiry's direction and a lack of trust, which they say was exacerbated by a public statement from safeguarding minister Jess Phillips that dismissed their accounts as "misinformation." The survivors have now stated they will only rejoin the panel if Phillips is removed from her post. The government has affirmed its support for Phillips, while other survivors on the panel have expressed a desire to continue their work from within the inquiry.</p>

          <p>Chinese policymakers appear to be prioritizing technological development over implementing a large-scale bailout for the country's struggling real estate sector, according to analysts. Despite the property slump continuing to be a major drag on economic growth, Beijing's official communications emphasize achievements in high-tech manufacturing and the strategic urgency of technological self-reliance. This focus suggests the government believes the worst of the property crisis has been contained and that future growth depends more on tech innovation. However, recent data shows real estate investment continues to fall, indicating the market is far from bottoming out. (not investment advice)</p>

This development comes as both nations prepare for critical trade negotiations in Malaysia and signals a potential escalation in the ongoing economic tensions.

At age 16, while struggling for playing time in Dinamo Zagreb's youth system, he contemplated pursuing basketball, a sport many of his friends played. Gvardiol persevered, eventually breaking into the senior team and launching a successful career that led him to the Premier League. He reflected that five years ago, he would have considered playing for a club like Manchester City to be an impossible dream.</p>

          <p>According to multiple sources, France is backing away from a commitment to adopt a more aggressive maritime strategy to intercept small boats carrying migrants across the English Channel. A promised new "maritime doctrine" to turn back vessels is reportedly being stalled due to France's current political turmoil, as well as legal and safety concerns among French naval authorities. This represents a setback for the UK government's efforts to stop the crossings, as dangerously overcrowded inflatable boats continue to depart from the French coast on a near-daily basis.</p>

In response, President Donald Trump accused Petro of encouraging drug production and announced a suspension of payments and subsidies to Colombia. This escalating feud between the two outspoken leaders jeopardizes decades of close cooperation in combating drug trafficking, potentially benefiting organized crime groups in the region.</p>
