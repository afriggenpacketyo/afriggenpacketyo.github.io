          <p>Wealthy Gulf states have promised substantial investments in the US, coinciding with falling oil prices, raising concerns about the feasibility of these pledges. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have announced plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the US, but lower oil prices, coupled with domestic financial commitments and regional reconstruction efforts, may strain their ability to fulfill these promises. Experts suggest that Saudi Arabia, needing higher oil prices to balance its budget, may face pressure on its spending, while the UAE and Qatar are in a more stable position.
