          <p>During Liverpool FC's Premier League victory parade, a car collided with pedestrians on Water Street, resulting in 27 injuries, including two serious cases. Police arrested a 53-year-old man, believing him to be the driver, and have stated the incident is not terror-related, treating it as isolated. Witnesses described the car driving through the crowd at a significant speed, pursued by people attempting to stop it, and the vehicle's rear windshield was shattered. The incident occurred about a mile before the parade's finishing point, causing chaos amidst the celebrations.</p>

The ministry will also offer consultation services through the Japan Student Services Organization for students studying in the United States, with 110 Japanese students and 150 researchers currently enrolled at Harvard.</p>

          <p>A new rule requiring teams to use three sets of tires during the Monaco Grand Prix aimed to increase strategic options and create more jeopardy. While the rule change did test the strategy engineers and created a variety of scenarios, it didn't significantly alter the race's outcome. Some drivers expressed discomfort with teams strategically using drivers to manipulate the race, such as Racing Bulls and Williams employing tactics to ensure favorable pit stops.

          <p>The diamond industry is facing a perfect storm of challenges, including potential tariffs and increasing competition from lab-grown diamonds (LGD). A proposed 10% import duty to the U.S. threatens the industry, which is already contending with a slowdown in demand and economic slump in China. LGDs, chemically identical to mined diamonds, are selling at an 80% discount, leading to a shift in consumer preferences, with over half of couples in the U.S. choosing LGD engagement rings. De Beers is responding by doubling down on natural diamonds, closing its LGD jewelry brand Lightbox.</p>

          <p>Tesla's European sales have significantly declined, with a 52.6% drop in April compared to the previous year, despite growing demand for electric cars. This trend continues from earlier months, resulting in a 46.1% decrease in sales for the first four months of the year. Notably, Chinese manufacturer BYD surpassed Tesla in pure electric car registrations in April, marking a shift in consumer preference. Some experts attribute Tesla's decline to a slow rollout of the latest Model Y version and Elon Musk's involvement in U.S. politics.</p>

In addition to the fines, the government suspended the licenses of eight aviation maintenance engineers from the three airlines for periods ranging from 15 to 45 days.

          <p>Shares of Chinese automakers are experiencing a second day of decline due to concerns about a potential price war and increased regulatory scrutiny. BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares fell sharply after the company announced price cuts on numerous electric and plug-in hybrid models. China's commerce ministry is reportedly investigating the practice of marking cars as sold to meet sales targets, which are then resold as secondhand vehicles. Analysts expect BYD's vehicle margins to be under pressure in the short term due to the price reductions, but anticipate the company will offset the impact through larger sales and lower battery costs.

          <p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is hosting a summit with Gulf nations and China to enhance economic resilience amid global volatility and U.S. tariffs. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim emphasized the importance of a stronger ASEAN-GCC relationship for interregional collaboration and sustainable prosperity. The meeting includes Chinese Premier Li Qiang and aims to position China as a reliable ally in the region. While ASEAN maintains neutrality, U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs have impacted several member states, prompting discussions for a potential summit with Trump on the tariffs.</p>

While industrial profit growth is expected to remain positive in the first half of the year, uncertainty remains due to the unclear trade relationship between China and the US.

Gregor Gregersen, founder of "The Reserve," notes an 88% increase in orders to store gold and silver in the vault from the same period in 2024, with 90% of new orders coming from outside Singapore. The shift is driven by concerns over tariffs, geopolitical instabilities, and a desire to avoid counterparty and geopolitical risks associated with paper gold.
