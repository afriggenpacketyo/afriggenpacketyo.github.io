          <p>The FBI is investigating an attack at the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, as a "targeted terror attack." FBI Director Kash Patel stated that agents and local law enforcement are on the scene, and updates will be provided as more information becomes available. The incident occurred at the intersection of 13th Street and Pearl Street, prompting police to evacuate the surrounding area. Colorado Governor Jared Polis condemned the attack as a heinous act of terror, emphasizing that hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable. The investigation is ongoing, with state and federal law enforcement collaborating to support the effort. Optimism surrounding the situation is low due to the nature of the event. </p>

          <p>According to Angela Zhang, a law professor at USC, US tariffs and tech restrictions are pushing Chinese tech companies to innovate and become more competitive. Higher tariffs make it difficult for Chinese products to compete in the US market, but this is forcing companies to cut costs and scale up. Zhang notes that Chinese firms are likely to explore other markets, such as Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and seek deeper trade relations with Europe, potentially offering technology transfers for market access. Despite the challenges posed by the US, Chinese firms are expected to continue pushing for technological advancement. </p>

          <p>Exit polls from the Polish presidential election suggest a very tight race between Warsaw's liberal Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski and conservative historian Karol Nawrocki. Initial polls showed Trzaskowski winning by a narrow margin, but later polls indicated Nawrocki in the lead, making the official result uncertain. Both candidates support continued assistance for Ukraine, but they differ on their approach to the EU; Trzaskowski favors closer ties with Europe, while Nawrocki advocates for a strong, sovereign Poland. The outcome of the election will significantly impact Poland's relationship with the EU and the direction of its domestic policies. </p>

She sought assistance from Senator James Risch to formally reject the pardon, and the Department of Justice has noted her non-acceptance. Hemphill's stance contrasts with other January 6 defendants who actively sought and celebrated their pardons, and she anticipates criticism from Trump for her decision. </p>
