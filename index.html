          <p>Local officials in a suburb near Thessaloniki, Greece, have discovered another series of unmarked graves containing 14 individuals from the country's civil war era. The bodies belong to prisoners held in a nearby Byzantine fortress, alleged to be communists and sympathizers executed between 1946 and 1953. The graves were found during renovation work on a municipal park, with the bodies jumbled and hastily buried, contrasting with a previous find of neatly arranged remains. Authorities are proceeding with excavation, citing the find's historical importance, while relatives are seeking DNA testing for identification.</p>

          <p>Ezra Klein discusses the contrasting reactions to his book "Abundance," which he co-wrote with Derek Thompson, within the Democratic Party, noting that some perceive it as a threat to anti-corporate populist ideals. The book critiques Democratic governance in areas where they hold power, focusing on increasing the supply of resources like housing and energy. While some Democrats have embraced the "abundance agenda," others worry it detracts from focusing on concentrated corporate power. Klein highlights a commissioned poll that showed voters were more concerned about corporate power than bottlenecks in production.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' legal team has filed a motion for a mistrial, alleging prosecutorial misconduct due to false testimony presented in court. The motion centers on testimony from Cassie Ventura's friend, Bryana "Bana" Bongolan, regarding an alleged 2016 balcony incident, which Diddy's lawyers claim was demonstrably false. Diddy's team argues that the prosecution knowingly presented perjured testimony, which could have influenced the jury's judgment. Diddy faces charges including racketeering conspiracy and sexual assault, and he maintains his innocence throughout the trial.</p>

          <p>The Broadway play "Good Night, and Good Luck" portrays the real CBS News journalists who worked on "See It Now," highlighting their roles in challenging McCarthyism. The play depicts figures like Fred Friendly, Don Hewitt, Joseph Wershba, and Shirley Wershba, emphasizing their commitment to journalistic responsibility. The story underscores the importance of a free press and the challenges faced by journalists in confronting powerful interests. Clooney, who plays Murrow in the theatrical adaptation, felt inspired to write the film by events surrounding the Iraq War.</p>

          <p>Navy veteran Michael Giardina participated in a psychedelic retreat in Mexico, organized by the Heroic Hearts Project, to address PTSD and childhood trauma. During the retreat, Giardina experienced a difficult but ultimately transformative journey, confronting memories of an emotionally abusive father and personal struggles with addiction. The use of psilocybin allowed him to "let go" of long-held emotional burdens and focus on spending more time with his daughters. The Department of Veterans Affairs is now conducting clinical trials to explore the potential of psychedelics in treating mental health conditions.</p>

          <p>A Mossad operation involving explosive pagers significantly weakened Hezbollah, leading to the assassination of its leader and other key figures. This disruption, coupled with the fall of Syria's President Assad, has diminished Iran's proxy war strategy and regional influence. The ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah has largely held, but the conflict has left southern Lebanon devastated and its citizens displaced. Analysts suggest that Hezbollah's losses have exposed the failures of Iran's long-term strategy of using proxy forces.</p>

          <p>The UK's energy system faces challenges as renewable energy generation increases, but the grid lacks sufficient capacity to transport it efficiently. This leads to compensation payments to companies like Ocean Winds for turning down their wind farms' output when the system is overloaded. Balancing the grid in this way has cost the country over Â£500 million this year, and could reach almost Â£8 billion a year by 2030. The government is considering a radical solution: instead of one big, national electricity market, there'll be a number of smaller regional markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel has warned it will prevent a boat carrying pro-Palestinian activists, including Greta Thunberg, and humanitarian aid from reaching Gaza, citing its naval blockade. Defence Minister Israel Katz stated that the blockade is essential to prevent weapons from reaching Hamas and that Israel will take necessary measures to enforce it. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition argues the blockade is illegal and accuses Israel of threatening unlawful force against civilians, while asserting their right to deliver aid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles was necessary due to California Governor Gavin Newsom's failure to maintain order during protests. Noem criticized Newsom's handling of the situation, citing violence and property damage, while defending President Trump's decision to prioritize community safety. Lawmakers reacted along party lines, with Republicans supporting Trump's action and Democrats condemning it as an escalation.</p>

          <p>Israel's defense minister vowed to prevent an aid boat, the Madleen, carrying environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg and other activists from reaching the Gaza Strip. Israel's minister stated that it wouldn't allow anyone to break its naval blockade of the Palestinian territory, which he said was aimed at preventing Hamas from importing arms. Thunberg and Cunningham are among 12 activists aboard the Madleen, which is operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition.</p>
