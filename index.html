          <p>A viral morning routine video by fitness influencer Ashton Hall, featuring a highly regimented schedule starting before dawn, has ignited a debate about modern masculinity. Hall's routine includes ice baths, skincare, meditation, and intense workouts, sparking discussions about hustle culture and self-optimization. Some critics argue that Hall's content promotes regressive ideas about masculinity and reinforces conservative gender roles, despite its seemingly benign nature. The influencer promotes a Christian, puritanical lifestyle and avoids hook-up culture, encouraging men to change their lives in service to themselves and God.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are questioning the validity of President Trump's formula for calculating tariff rates, arguing that it relies on inaccurate assumptions about elasticity. According to experts, the formula underestimates the elasticity of import prices in relation to tariffs, leading to inflated tariff rates. If the elasticity assumptions are adjusted, no country's tariff would exceed 14%, with most remaining at the baseline of 10%. A report from the Cato Institute also criticizes the trade-weighted average tariff rates used by the Trump administration to justify the tariffs, claiming they are higher than actual rates.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are requesting a prison sentence of over seven years for former U.S. Representative George Santos, citing a "brazen web of deceit" involving fraud, identity theft, and misleading voters. Santos is accused of falsifying campaign finance filings, laundering donor money through a fraudulent consulting firm, and fabricating his resume to gain political advantages. The prosecution details schemes where Santos allegedly used an elderly woman's credit card for personal expenses and falsely reported a $500,000 personal loan to his campaign. Santos was expelled from Congress in December 2023 and has pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity fraud.</p>

          <p>As President Trump's tariffs threaten to increase prices on everyday items, some consumers are rushing to make purchases before the tariffs take full effect.

          <h2>Jaguar Land Rover Pauses US Shipments Amid Trump's Tariff Concerns</h2>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will pause shipments of its UK-made cars to the US for a month as it considers how to mitigate the cost of Donald Trump’s tariffs. The 25% tariff imposed by the US on imported cars and light trucks took effect on 3 April. The Sunday Times reported that JLR is thought to have a couple of months’ supply of cars already in the US, which will not be subject to the new tariffs. A pause in shipments will add to fears over the impact of tariffs on Britain’s car industry, which employs about 200,000 people in manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Patrick Mullins rode Nick Rockett to victory in the Grand National at Aintree, with his father, Willie Mullins, training the top three finishers in the race. Nick Rockett, a 33-1 chance, triumphed over last year's winner, I Am Maximus, and Grangeclare West. The victory was particularly emotional for owner Stewart Andrew, whose late wife had watched Nick Rockett's first race shortly before her death. The race saw Broadway Boy lead for much of the course before suffering a fall, with both the horse and jockey receiving medical attention.</p>

          <p>While global leaders express concern over President Trump's tariffs, Argentinian President Javier Milei reaffirmed his support for Trump at a Mar-a-Lago event. Milei, who has implemented austerity measures in Argentina, sees himself as an ally in Trump's culture war. Despite Argentina being subject to a 10% tariff, officials framed it as preferential treatment. Milei is seeking a $20 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund and hoped for an informal meeting with Trump, though it remains unconfirmed whether the two leaders met.</p>

          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta expressed frustration after his team's 1-1 draw against Everton, citing a controversial penalty decision as a key factor. Arteta claimed that the penalty awarded to Everton, after Myles Lewis-Skelly's challenge on Jack Harrison, was "never a penalty" despite video assistant referee (VAR) confirmation. Everton manager David Moyes said he had not reviewed the incident. Arteta also criticized his team for conceding "silly fouls" that led to set-pieces, but maintained that Everton generated nothing from open play.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump’s tariff announcement has baffled global leaders and forced markets to reckon with the fallout from America’s dramatic shift in international trade policy. Panelists joined on Washington Week With The Atlantic to discuss what tanking financial markets could mean for the president’s administration. While the United States economy has tended to work in favor of educated professionals, blue-collar workers have not benefited in the same ways. Adjustments to trade policy could be one way to address this, but Trump’s tariffs are “shambolic, they’re extremely high,” and “no one knows whether he’s going to take them back the next day,”</p>

          <p>The Trump administration argues that a federal judge lacks the authority to order the return of a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, urging an appeals court to suspend the ruling. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national with protected status, was deported despite a 2019 ruling shielding him from deportation. The administration claims it has no control over Abrego Garcia and cannot arrange his return, while Abrego Garcia's attorneys accuse the government of inaction despite admitting its errors.

          <p>Cosmetic surgery in the UK is on the rise, driven by treatments to remove wrinkles and tone arms, thighs, and stomachs. While boob jobs remain the most popular treatment, facial rejuvenation and body contouring procedures have seen significant increases. Experts attribute the rise to cheaper and more accessible surgery, a shift in attitudes towards cosmetic procedures, and the impact of weight-loss injections.
