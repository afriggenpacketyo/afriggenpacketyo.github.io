Conservationists are urging KWS to improve risk assessments and communication regarding wildlife movement, and to equip residential areas near wildlife habitats with deterrent systems.</p>

            <p>German authorities are seeking to deport an American and three EU citizens for allegedly participating in pro-Palestinian protests in Berlin. The individuals were served with deportation orders connected to a protest at Berlin's Free University in October 2024, where masked individuals allegedly caused property damage. Critics are drawing comparisons to the Trump administration's handling of similar protests in the U.S., and legal challenges are underway, citing potential clashes with EU law regarding freedom of movement. The Berlin Immigration Office cited Germany's Staatsräson, or special responsibility towards Israel, as part of the grounds for the deportation.</p>

The author explores the prevalence of dishonesty in dating, ranging from minor embellishments to significant deceptions, and questions whether all dating lies are inherently awful, suggesting some may stem from insecurity or attempts at kindness.

            <p>The Justice Department is set to present its case for a potential breakup of Google in the final phase of a landmark antitrust trial. The government argues that Google illegally stifled competition by paying to be the default search engine on web browsers and phones and wants Google to stop these payments, spin off its Chrome browser, and possibly sell its Android operating system. Google contends that the proposed remedies are harmful and would force consumers to use inferior search engines, but experts believe the case could set a precedent for regulating digital markets.</p>

China's manufacturing capabilities and mandatory renminbi use would force the US to buy Chinese currency on a large scale, increasing its demand and exchange rate.</p>

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia of attempting to create a false impression of honoring an Easter ceasefire, citing ongoing attacks despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement of a temporary truce. Zelenskyy reported numerous instances of Russian shelling and assaults along the front line, stating that Putin either lacks control over his army or has no genuine intention of ending the war. Russia, in turn, claims Ukrainian forces launched attacks despite the ceasefire, with both sides accusing the other of violations.</p>

            <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla have attended a church service at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle as part of their Easter celebrations. The traditional Easter Matins service was held in the 15th Century chapel in Windsor, Berkshire. Most other members of the Royal Family, including the Duke of York, were also present for the service - apart from the Prince and Princess of Wales and their children, who spent the weekend on holiday in Norfolk. Following the service, the King and Queen were wished a "Happy Easter" by those gathered outside, and the Queen received a bouquet from a young girl.</p>

            <p>The United States has been warned to stop being “complacent” and engage with the Global South to consolidate its foothold in its escalating technological competition with China. Developing countries were expected to play an “increasingly critical” role in advanced technology over the coming decades, and their ties with China would probably strengthen, according to the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank. The United States cannot afford to underestimate the role that will be played by the Global South in shaping global technology competition, and failure to do so would allow China to advance its geopolitical, economic, and technological interests around the world.</p>
