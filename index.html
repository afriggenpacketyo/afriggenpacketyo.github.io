          <p>New York City Democrats headed to the polls to select their nominee for mayor in a race with national implications, viewed as a proxy war between the party's left-wing and moderate factions. The primary pits democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani against former Governor Andrew Cuomo, with Comptroller Brad Lander trailing behind. Mamdani, endorsed by prominent progressives, focuses on affordability with proposals like free public buses and universal childcare, while Cuomo, seeking a comeback after a sexual harassment scandal, emphasizes experience and public safety. Critics question Mamdani's ambitious promises, while Cuomo faces scrutiny over his past actions and management style, and the ranked-choice voting system adds further complexity to the election outcome. The results of this election will be closely watched by Democrats across the country as they attempt to take on Trump.</p>

          <p>Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old employee nicknamed "Big Balls," has resigned from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) less than a month after Elon Musk's departure. Coristine gained attention for his irreverent nickname and his efforts to investigate wasteful spending in the federal government, finding numerous payments lacking details about their recipients and purposes. He claimed the system distributing taxpayer money lacked accountability, making it susceptible to fraud and abuse. DOGE, established by the Trump administration and initially led by Musk, aimed to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget, achieving approximately $180 billion in savings through various measures. Coristine's resignation adds to the staffing shakeup within DOGE following Musk's exit.</p>

          <p>Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old employee also known as "Big Balls" who worked for the US government's "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE), has resigned, following Elon Musk's departure from the agency. Coristine's youth and online moniker became a meme as DOGE implemented job cuts across federal agencies. Prior to joining DOGE, Coristine worked at Musk's Neuralink and ran a company called DiamondCDN that provided network services, and some of its users included a website run by a ring of cybercriminals operating under the name ‚ÄúEGodly‚Äù. The White House has stated that DOGE's mission to cut government spending will continue despite the staff departures.</p>

          <p>A classified assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by several months, sealing off entrances to key enrichment sites. The assessment suggests some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes, but the deep underground infrastructure remains largely intact. The White House has disputed these findings, with officials standing by claims that the strikes "obliterated" Iran's nuclear capabilities. A classified briefing for Congress has been scheduled to discuss the administration's actions, and the strikes were aimed at stymying Iran's nuclear program amid concerns about its enriched uranium stockpile.</p>

          <p>Two young bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park in the U.K. and consumed a week's supply of honey before falling asleep. The park stated that the bears posed no threat to the public, but visitors were escorted to a secure building as a precaution. Keepers used recall training to encourage the bears back into their enclosure, and an investigation is underway to determine how the animals escaped due to an "operational error". Mish and Lucy were rescued in 2021 after being abandoned in the Albanian mountains.</p>

The committee emphasizes the need for households to benefit from cleaner technologies through lower bills, urging the government to make electricity more affordable. While electric car sales have nearly doubled in two years and heat pump sales are up, they remain below target, and the CCC praised relaxed planning rules for heat pumps. The CCC suggests removing charges from electricity bills to support renewable energy projects to lower prices, but this would require government funding.</p>

The Trump administration had ordered states not to spend $5 billion in funds allocated under the Biden administration's national electric vehicle infrastructure program.

Witkoff also confirmed that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding, and he dismissed concerns that Iran could resume its nuclear enrichment program quickly, stating it's "not even conceivable."</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have used the cosmic dance of dying stars to study the Milky Way's past, finding that stars born today spin up to 10 times faster than those formed billions of years ago. This extra spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to take shape. The study, based on data from Europe's Gaia space telescope and other sky surveys, presents the first direct evidence that the galaxy's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time. The findings offer a new way to study how the galaxy has changed over time.</p>

Other front pages focus on the UK's new National Security Strategy, Labour MPs' revolt over welfare bill cuts, and the upcoming NATO summit. The Daily Star quotes Donald Trump's comments on Iran and Israel after they breached a proposed ceasefire.

          <p>President Trump reacted angrily after a ceasefire he brokered between Israel and Iran was violated, using profanity and demanding Israel stop bombing Iran. A Pentagon report suggested U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities were less successful than Trump claimed, setting back the program by months. Other news includes a surge in ICE detentions of people with no criminal record, Powell defending the decision to hold interest rates, and allegations of a DoJ leader suggesting defying courts over deportations.

          <p>President Trump declared a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, but voiced frustration with both countries for violating the agreement shortly after it was announced. Israel accused Iran of launching missiles at Israeli territory, while Trump rebuked Israel for conducting strikes on Iran just before the ceasefire was to begin. The State Department announced the reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, and the White House stated Trump was "exceptionally firm and direct" in a call with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. The conflict resulted in at least 1,000 deaths, and drones hit bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops.</p>

Recent moves focus on expanding futures market access for foreign investors and allowing foreign currencies as collateral for yuan-settled trades.

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Commission approved an updated policy allowing the LAPD to deploy drones on routine emergency calls. Citing successes in other police departments, the commission said the technology offers crucial, real-time information about potential threats to responding officers. The new guidelines list other scenarios for future drone use, including high-risk incidents and large-scale events, and transfers their command to the Office of Special Operations. The drones will not be equipped with weapons or facial recognition software, and footage captured will be subject to periodic audits.</p>

          <p>The Natural History Museum in London will display a newly identified dinosaur species, Enigmacursor mollyborthwickae, a labrador-sized creature that lived 150 million years ago. Initially classified as a Nanosaurus, scientists now conclude it is a different animal, and the name means puzzling runner. The discovery sheds light on the evolutionary history of early small dinosaurs and the remains are the most complete of any in the world for early small dinosaurs. Scientists are untangling the mystery around the names and categorization of dinosaurs to understand how many species exist.</p>
