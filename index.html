          <h2>Study Finds Ancient Horses Migrated Between Asia and North America</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 22:00:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene epoch, approximately 50,000 to 13,000 years ago. These migrations occurred via the Bering land bridge when sea levels were lower, connecting the two continents. The study examined fossils, including those of Dalianensis horses from northeastern China, which showed mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. The research, published in the journal Science, indicates that genetic exchanges between the continents happened in both directions over multiple migrations, contributing to the understanding of horse evolution and distribution across the globe.</p>

          <p>A progressive district attorney in Arapahoe County, Colorado, has faced criticism for offering a lenient plea deal to a teenage illegal immigrant who caused a high-speed crash that killed 24-year-old Kaitlyn Weaver. The 15-year-old was sentenced to two years of probation and 100 hours of community service after racing his Jeep at 90 mph in a residential area and T-boning Weaver's vehicle. Weaver's father and attorney have condemned the deal as 'abhorrent,' especially since the teen was unlicensed and uninsured, and the family was initially told it was a 'no plea offer' case. The district attorney's office defended the plea deal as acknowledging the seriousness of the tragedy, though they recognized that no legal outcome could truly make up for the loss.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News analysis indicates that lawyers are increasingly engaging in venue shopping, seeking out federal jurisdictions with judges sympathetic to their political views to file lawsuits with nationwide impact. Conservatives often file cases in small Texas courts, ensuring rulings from Republican appointees, while liberals have favored courts in the 9th and 1st Circuits. The Supreme Court is considering whether a single federal judge should dictate policy for the entire country through nationwide injunctions, raising concerns about impartiality and eroding confidence in the courts. A random case-assignment policy was recommended to limit plaintiffs from choosing judges, but some districts, like the Northern District of Texas, have not fully adopted it.</p>

          <p>Walmart has cautioned that even with reduced tariffs on Chinese goods, the company may need to raise prices on certain items. CEO Doug McMillon stated that President Trump's tariffs are hindering Walmart's ability to maintain low prices for consumers. While the U.S. has lowered tariff rates on Chinese imports from 145% to 30% for 90 days, Walmart still anticipates cost pressures, particularly in categories like electronics and toys. The retailer is attempting to mitigate the impact on customers but acknowledges that further tariff increases could significantly affect their financial performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New clinical testing requirements for vaccines could delay the availability of updated COVID and flu shots this fall, potentially limiting them to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. Scientific advisers to the CDC have been debating whether to recommend immunization for all Americans or switch to a risk-based strategy, as is common in other countries. The FDA has requested more clinical data from Novavax before approving its COVID vaccine, and officials are questioning the necessity of COVID vaccines for children under 12. Some experts fear these changes are part of a broader effort to undermine vaccine use by raising safety doubts and imposing stringent requirements.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates and the United States have reached an agreement allowing the UAE to construct the largest artificial intelligence campus outside the U.S., giving the UAE expanded access to advanced AI chips. This agreement, made during Donald Trumpâ€™s visit to the Middle East, has raised concerns due to previous restrictions under the Biden administration over fears of Chinese access to the technology. The deal requires that data centers be managed by US companies, reflecting the Trump administrationâ€™s confidence in secure management of the chips.

          <p>An audit of deaths in Maryland found that medical examiners often misclassified deaths that occurred after individuals were restrained by police, with at least 36 deaths that should have been classified as homicides being labeled as accidental or natural. The report, prompted by the police killing of George Floyd, suggests evidence of racism and pro-police bias, with Black individuals being less likely to have their deaths classified as homicides. The audit also highlighted the use of 'excited delirium' as a cause of death in nearly half the reviewed cases, a diagnosis that has been criticized for disproportionately affecting Black men.

          <p>Japan's economy experienced an unexpected contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports.

This contraction occurs amid ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. and warnings from the Bank of Japan about the economy moderating due to global trade policies.

The US delegation is led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who tempered expectations for the talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not attend in protest of Russian President Vladimir Putin's refusal to participate, calling Putin's decision to send a 'decorative' lineup a sign that he was not serious about ending the war.</p>

          <p>Small business owners are struggling with the financial instability caused by President Trump's fluctuating tariffs on Chinese goods. Bobby Djavaheri, who imports kitchen appliances from China, experienced a 145% tariff hike, followed by a reduction to 30%, forcing him to adjust prices and rush orders for the holiday season. Many businesses are hesitant to pay the current tariff rate, hoping for further reductions, leading to increased demand for foreign trade zone facilities and bonded warehouses. Djavaheri believes the financial instability means he cannot count on making a profit this year, but will instead try to stay afloat.</p>

          <p>Australia's most decorated living soldier, Ben Roberts-Smith, has lost his appeal against a landmark defamation judgment that found he committed war crimes. A judge previously ruled that news articles alleging Roberts-Smith murdered four unarmed Afghans were true. The civil trial marked the first time a court assessed war crimes claims against Australian forces. Roberts-Smith maintains his innocence and has not been charged in a criminal court. The Federal Court judges upheld the original verdict, emphasizing that the evidence presented by the newspapers met the required standard.</p>

The bill, which passed its first stage in November, has undergone scrutiny and changes, including removing the need for a High Court judge's approval in favor of a panel of experts. The government has adjusted its impact assessment, admitting errors in calculating the potential number of assisted deaths. While a vote is not expected on Friday, the debate comes amid divided opinions in Parliament, with those opposed citing concerns about patient safety and coercion.

          <p>The Supreme Court is considering whether federal courts should have the ability to issue nationwide injunctions to halt unconstitutional government actions, a check on presidential authority. The cases before the court involve President Trumpâ€™s order to eliminate birthright citizenship. During oral arguments, justices discussed the constitutionality of the order and whether a federal district court can enjoin an executive branch order for the entire country. Erwin Chemerinsky argues that federal courts are essential to check illegal executive orders, while others argue that nationwide injunctions prevent the executive branch from carrying out its duties.</p>
