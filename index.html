          <p>Following Donald Trump's promise of increased deportations, ICE operations have become more aggressive in Southern California, creating fear among undocumented immigrants. The article recounts a specific raid at a Home Depot parking lot where ICE agents, along with local law enforcement, detained around 25 people, including women selling food. While authorities in Tijuana initially appeared calm, activists warned against underestimating Trump's power, noting his increased support across government branches. The fear of deportation has led to reduced movement and participation in community activities among immigrants, highlighting the profound impact of the administration's policies on the community's sense of security and well-being.</p>

The return capsule separated cleanly and landed safely using parachutes and an airbag system.

Trading standards officials are particularly concerned about young people getting injections, and they advise checking qualifications and avoiding practitioners advertising through social media.

          <p>Dozens more families are calling for an independent inquiry into maternity care at Leeds Teaching Hospitals (LTH) NHS Trust, following concerns about inadequate care leading to infant deaths and injuries. Tassie Weaver's experience, where her son died after a midwife dismissed her concerns, highlights systemic issues within the trust. 47 new families have contacted the BBC with similar stories of inadequate care between 2017 and 2024, and whistleblowers describe a culture where staff are afraid to raise concerns. Despite the trust's rating as "good" by the CQC, families and staff believe it does not reflect the reality of care provided.</p>

          <p>The leaders of the Group of Seven democracies have launched an action plan to mitigate risks in critical mineral supply chains, often resulting from overdependence on China. The plan aims to protect economic security against nonmarket practices through enhanced cooperation, monitoring shortages, and diversifying mining and processing. The G7 will develop a road map for standards-based markets for critical minerals and increase investment in responsible projects. While emphasizing the importance of stable relations with China, the leaders called on China to refrain from market distortions and harmful overcapacity.</p>

The hearings are expected to focus on the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, which threatens to escalate into a regional war, and the US military has repositioned aircraft and tankers to respond if needed.</p>

European leaders are seeking an understanding with Trump that, while they beef up their militaries and increase force deployments on the eastern flank, the US will not suddenly withdraw crucial capabilities until Europe is ready to take responsibility. They need to hijack Nato for their own purposes and make maximum use of Natoâ€™s chain of command and decades of experience in collective defence planning and multinational force integration to prepare for the day when they may need to act without the US.</p>
