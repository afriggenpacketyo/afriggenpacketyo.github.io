            <p>The US government is planning a military deportation flight under the Alien Enemies Act, targeting Venezuelan migrants believed to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang. ACLU lawyers are challenging the deportations, arguing that the migrants are not being afforded due process. The ACLU submitted a document they say their clients received notifying them of their removal from the U.S. under the AEA. A federal judge initially denied a temporary restraining order, but the ACLU has filed a new emergency application after reports of ICE officers pressuring detainees to sign deportation papers. </p>

            <p>A food safety expert advises Canadians on how to safely handle Easter leftovers to prevent food-borne illnesses. Key recommendations include refrigerating or freezing food within two hours of cooking, using shallow containers for quicker cooling, and ensuring meats reach an internal temperature of 74 degrees Celsius when reheating. Leftovers should be consumed within three to four days, or frozen for no more than three to four months. It is crucial to maintain proper temperatures and avoid the "danger zone" between 4 and 60 degrees Celsius where bacteria multiply rapidly. </p>

            <p>Britain's Supreme Court ruled that the legal definition of "sex" in the Equality Act 2010 refers to biological sex, meaning a person is either a man or a woman. The ruling clarifies that the law protects biological females and trans women, recognizing that both groups face distinct forms of discrimination. While the ruling impacts women-only services, it also enhances the rights of trans men to sue for pregnancy and maternity discrimination. This decision has sparked debate about the balance between gender identity and biological sex in law and society. </p>

            <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's actions against Harvard University, conditioning federal funding on compliance with civil rights laws, represent a recalibration of the relationship between taxpayers and elite universities. The author contends that American higher education no longer serves the common good, citing concerns about cultural Marxist indoctrination and a disconnect from traditional values. The piece suggests that universities should not receive taxpayer funding if they engage in discrimination or fail to promote civic responsibility. </p>

            <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs appears to be retreating from a plan to return telehealth therapists to offices that lack privacy, according to a memo obtained by NPR. The memo states that providers must have private workspaces to foster confidential relationships with veterans. However, confusion remains among clinicians, who are unsure how they can meet privacy requirements while returning to overcrowded facilities. The issue has raised concerns about the quality of mental health care for veterans. </p>

            <p>Harvey Weinstein has been moved to a New York City hospital after a judge approved his request to stay there rather than in jail when he is not in court for his retrial on rape and sexual assault charges. Weinstein's lawyers argued that being locked up in a sometimes freezing jail cell was exacerbating the disgraced movie mogul’s health issues, which include chronic myeloid leukemia, diabetes and walking difficulties that require a wheelchair to get in and out of court. The case will resume on Monday with more jury selection after nine jurors were picked this week. </p>
