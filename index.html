          <p>The Army has released guidelines for identifying and processing transgender service members for separation, following Defense Department directives. These guidelines instruct personnel to address transgender troops by their biological sex at birth, potentially misgendering them. Commanders are expected to initiate medical record reviews based on criteria like grooming standard exemptions or social media activity. Maj. Kara Corcoran, a transgender infantry officer, criticized the policy as worse than "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," overtly targeting transgender individuals despite their proven service.

          <h2>Early 'Mission: Impossible' Films Show Value of Ignoring Brand Building</h2>

          <p>The early 'Mission: Impossible' films distinguished themselves by eschewing continuity and allowing directors to express their unique styles. The series was defined by its lack of definition beyond Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, with each installment feeling made by a director with a specific take on the material. Later films have taken a different approach, relying on continuity and stricter canon, which streamlines the earlier stories and overlooks their true appeal. The early films remind us of the value of ignoring brand-building pressures and letting creative sensibilities take the lead.</p>
