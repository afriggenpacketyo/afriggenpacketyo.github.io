          <h2>Louisiana Faces Potential Rollback of Federal School Desegregation Orders</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 14:29:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Louisiana officials are seeking to end the remaining federal desegregation orders in the state, arguing they are outdated, and the Trump administration appears to be receptive to these efforts. Civil rights advocates are concerned that this move is part of a broader attack on Black students and civil rights, particularly as U.S. schools are becoming increasingly segregated. The Justice Department has already dismissed one order in Plaquemines Parish, and is open to considering others on a case-by-case basis. The Supreme Court has said that school desegregation orders were meant to be temporary, and over the years, many have been lifted, usually after a district showed it had made efforts to desegregate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors are considering a non-prosecution agreement with Boeing regarding the two fatal 737 Max crashes, a move that would avoid a guilty plea. Lawyers for the victims' families expressed outrage, claiming it would allow Boeing to evade accountability. The Justice Department officials believe this agreement is the best course of action, considering the risks of going to trial. Boeing would pay approximately $445 million to a crash victims’ fund, invest in compliance and safety, and be overseen by an independent compliance consultant. The crashes, which occurred in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019, were blamed on changes Boeing made to flight control software on the 737 Max.</p>

          <p>A vote on a megabill intended to advance President Trump's agenda failed in the House Budget Committee due to opposition from Republican hard-liners. Representatives Andrew Clyde, Josh Brecheen, Lloyd Smucker, Ralph Norman, and Chip Roy voted against the bill, defying Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson, primarily because the majority of the savings would not take effect until after Trump's presidency. The House Freedom Caucus has stated they are prepared to continue negotiations throughout the weekend. House Republican leaders will continue to negotiate with holdouts behind closed doors, and the Budget Committee will reconvene on Sunday night.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that President Trump's foreign policy isn't amoral but rather favors an immoral world order. While he condemns predecessors for lecturing other countries, his administration has made human rights a centerpiece of its diplomacy in South Africa, reflecting a belief that anti-white discrimination is the most pernicious ideology. His dealings, especially with allies like Qatar, suggest a preference for leaders who do business the "Trump way," not the international-liberal-order way. The article references Trump's Boeing aircraft which was described not as a form of repayment he demanded, but as a magnanimous gift from Qatar out of genuine friendship.</p>

          <p>Tesla has appointed longtime Chipotle executive Jack Hartung to its board of directors, effective June 1. Hartung will join Tesla's audit committee as the company battles sinking EV sales and eroding profits. Musk began his company's earnings call last month by saying that his time spent running DOGE will drop "significantly" by the end of May. Hartung, who was known for taking a disciplined approach to Chipotle's finances during the Covid-19 pandemic, will expand Tesla's board to nine members.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve plans to reduce its headcount by 10% over the next couple of years, according to a memo from central bank chair Jerome Powell. The reduction will include offering deferred resignation to some older employees. The memo comes as the Trump administration has pushed for cost cuts across civil service agencies, spearheaded by Elon Musk and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. One method for shrinking the staff will be to offer a voluntary deferred resignation program to employees of the Federal Reserve Board who would be fully eligible to retire at the end of 2027.</p>

          <p>The World Bank has cleared Syria’s $15.5 million debt after payments by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, making the country eligible again for grants to fund reconstruction and economic recovery.

The debt relief comes after President Trump announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria. The Syrian government has signed a $800-million memorandum of understanding with DP World to develop the Mediterranean port of Tartus.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill faced a setback as conservatives blocked it from advancing out of the House Budget Committee. Five Republicans voted against the legislation, citing that it does not go far enough to slash federal spending. The committee plans to return late Sunday to vote again. The legislation would extend tax cuts from Mr. Trump's first term while temporarily enacting new ones, offset partly by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and clean energy subsidies.</p>

The administration has aggressively challenged universal injunctions, which can prevent the government from applying a policy against anyone, instead of only the plaintiffs who sued to contest it. The president directed government agencies in February to "promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force" as part of the administration's restructuring plans.</p>
