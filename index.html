          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced new sanctions targeting Russia at the G7 summit, aiming to increase economic pressure on the Kremlin due to the ongoing conflict with Ukraine. The sanctions are designed to restrict Russia's war efforts by squeezing its energy revenues and limiting funds available for the war. However, Donald Trump signaled his opposition to further measures, citing the financial burden on the United States. The UK expects the new sanctions package to maintain pressure on Russia's military-industrial complex, demonstrating allied resolve to support Ukraine. The announcement occurred amid escalating conflict in the Middle East, drawing Trump away from the summit early.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korea's SK Hynix have risen to a more than two-decade high following reports that SK Group plans to build the country's largest AI data center in partnership with Amazon Web Services. SK Hynix, a leading supplier of DRAM, has seen its shares surge nearly 50% this year due to the AI boom. SK Telecom and SK Broadband are reportedly leading the initiative, with support from other SK affiliates. Meanwhile, Samsung, SK Hynix's DRAM rival, saw its market cap slide, struggling to capitalize on AI-led demand. SK Hynix has become a leader in high bandwidth memory used in AI servers.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump made limited progress on bridging tariff gaps during their summit, raising doubts about a quick agreement that would protect Japan's auto sector. Ishiba emphasized that any deal should benefit both countries, with bilateral talks continuing to seek such an agreement. Trump's tariffs on autos, auto parts, steel, and aluminum have raised concerns for Japan's export-driven economy. The U.S. has granted Japan a 90-day reprieve from tariffs, but it is uncertain if this will be extended. Despite predictions that higher U.S. tariffs would slow economic growth, Ishiba has said Japan will not rush into a deal that compromises national interests.</p>

He pitched one inning against the San Diego Padres, allowing one run on two hits. Although his form was not perfect, with some command issues, Ohtani's fastball reached 100 mph. Manager Dave Roberts called Ohtani a "unicorn" for his ability to both pitch and hit at an elite level. The Dodgers plan to gradually increase Ohtani's pitching workload, with the goal of having him fully ready for the stretch run of the season.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament are scheduled to vote on decriminalizing abortion, with two competing amendments tabled by Labour MPs Tonia Antoniazzi and Stella Creasy. The current law in England and Wales deems abortion illegal but permits it under certain conditions up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, with approval from two doctors. Antoniazzi's amendment seeks to prevent investigations, arrests, and imprisonment for women who terminate their own pregnancies, while maintaining punishments for medical professionals and violent partners. The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children has criticized the amendment, calling it an "extreme and dangerous proposal." The vote will address the legal status of abortion and its potential impact on women's healthcare access.</p>

          <p>The number of Americans aged 55 and older experiencing homelessness is rising, with more than 140,000 individuals affected daily, and projections estimating a near tripling by 2030. Factors contributing to this trend include the death of a spouse, divorce, job loss, eviction, and medical issues. Healthcare providers are concerned about the vulnerability of this aging population, who often face complex chronic medical conditions. Researchers note that the aging trend has been ongoing for 30 years, with the Baby Boomers generation being particularly at risk. The trend puts a strain on healthcare systems, as homeless seniors are frequently hospitalized and lack support for timely discharge.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates a rise in awareness of nicotine pouches among young people under 18, with 43% of 11-17 year olds now aware of the product, up from 38% in 2024. The survey, commissioned by Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), suggests nearly 4% of children in this age group have tried a nicotine pouch. Ash is urging the government to prioritize the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which aims to ban the marketing and sale of nicotine pouches to under 18s. The pouches, which do not contain tobacco, are considered less harmful than smoking but are highly addictive and not recommended for teenagers or non-smokers. Teachers and health experts are raising concerns about the easy accessibility of these products to children.</p>

          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is increasingly focused on the global arms export market, driven by security concerns and the need to deepen ties with allies. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani has expressed his desire to promote Japan's defense exports, and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba attended the country's largest defense exhibition. Experts suggest Japan's motivations are more related to security than profiting from global arms demand. The move aims to improve interoperability with allies, develop Japan's defense industrial base, and achieve economies of scale. Despite increasing its defense budget, Japan has largely purchased weapons from the U.S., leading to a decline in its domestic defense industry.</p>
