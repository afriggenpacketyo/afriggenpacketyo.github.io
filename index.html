          <p>The UK government and OpenAI have signed an agreement to explore using artificial intelligence in public services like education and defense to boost national productivity. The deal, a non-binding statement of intent, includes plans for an information sharing program, developing public safeguards, and expanding OpenAI's London office. This move is part of the government's broader strategy to leverage AI for economic growth, though it has drawn criticism from groups concerned about the unlicensed use of data and the focus on major US tech firms.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch is conducting a significant reshuffle of her shadow cabinet, with former leadership rival Sir James Cleverly expected to return to a prominent front-bench role. The changes are intended to advance the party's policy renewal program and strengthen its opposition to the Labour government. This strategic move comes eight months into Badenoch's leadership, a period marked by poor polling numbers and local election losses, as she aims to unify the party and rebuild its public standing ahead of future elections.</p>

          <p>The World Health Organization has strongly condemned what it describes as three separate attacks by the Israeli Defense Forces on a building housing its staff in Deir al Balah, Gaza. According to the WHO, Israeli military personnel entered the residence, forced women and children to evacuate on foot, and then handcuffed, stripped, and interrogated male staff members at gunpoint. The WHO statement detailed the destruction of its main warehouse, intensifying concerns over the safety of humanitarian workers in the conflict zone, with the IDF yet to comment.</p>

Marcos intends to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement to avert the tariffs, while the White House emphasizes a shared commitment to a free and secure Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>The race to revolutionize electric vehicles is intensifying, with major automakers like Volkswagen, Toyota, and Nissan renewing their push for solid-state batteries and targeting commercial production before 2030.

Some firms are focusing on semi-solid-state batteries as a practical bridge technology, while recent advancements in traditional LFP batteries are also challenging the investment case for the new technology.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Donald Trump's second term reveals a strong preference for using tariffs as a primary tool of foreign policy, often for objectives typically pursued through sanctions. Trump has deployed tariffs to pressure countries on non-trade issues like immigration and drug trafficking, creating global economic uncertainty. This "tariff tango" approach gives him direct, unilateral control but has been criticized by some experts for potentially destabilizing global trade and blurring the distinction between economic protectionism and punitive foreign policy.

          <p>In a thoughtful commentary, Slovenian author Ana Schnabl reflects on the narrow expectations Western publishers often have for writers from the Balkans. She argues that authors from the region are frequently pushed to produce stories centered on war, political tragedy, and cultural trauma to appeal to English-speaking audiences. This demand, she contends, overlooks a diverse range of contemporary stories and reinforces a one-dimensional, exoticized view of the Balkans, limiting the scope of literature that gets translated and published globally.</p>
