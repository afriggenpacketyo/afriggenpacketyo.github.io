          <p>The Trump administration's renewed threats of steep tariffs have drawn regret and shock from key U.S. allies, including Japan, South Korea, and Thailand. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called the announcement "truly regrettable," while other nations vowed to continue negotiations ahead of the new August 1 deadline. The letters detail significant levies, such as a 25% tariff on Japanese and Malaysian imports and 36% on Thai goods, creating widespread economic uncertainty. Despite the firm deadline, many leaders remain optimistic that continued dialogue can lead to a more favorable outcome. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia's central bank unexpectedly held its policy interest rate at 3.85%, contrary to economists' expectations of a cut. The Reserve Bank of Australia stated it needs more time and information to confirm that inflation is sustainably on track to its target. This decision came despite recent data showing inflation at a four-year low, prompting disappointment from government officials. The move led to a decline in the S&P/ASX 200 index while strengthening the Australian dollar against a backdrop of slowing economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new malaria treatment, Coartem Baby, has been approved for infants weighing less than 4.5kg, addressing a critical gap in care for the most vulnerable. Previously, babies were treated with modified adult drugs, risking overdose due to their developing bodies. Developed by Novartis in partnership with non-profit organizations, the medicine is expected to be rolled out in Africa on a not-for-profit basis within weeks. This breakthrough is poised to save countless lives, as children under five account for approximately 75% of all malaria-related deaths.</p>

          <p>The government of El Salvador has informed United Nations investigators that the U.S. maintains legal jurisdiction over Venezuelan migrants deported to its CECOT mega-prison. This admission, revealed in court filings, contradicts the Trump administration's public claims that it is powerless to act because the men are outside U.S. custody. Civil rights groups representing the migrants argue this proves the administration has been dishonest with the courts and the public. The revelation complicates the legal challenges against the controversial deal to house the migrants in El Salvador.</p>

          <p>The abrupt termination of U.S. foreign aid through USAID has triggered a severe healthcare crisis in Liberia, where such support was a crucial part of the national income. This sudden withdrawal has led to understocked health clinics, a rise in unplanned pregnancies, and a general collapse of essential medical services. The situation has fostered a sense of betrayal among Liberians, who now face dire circumstances without the previously reliable American support. Many citizens are left without access to fundamental healthcare resources.</p>

          <p>Caltech is ending its partnership with online education company Simplilearn after a class-action lawsuit alleged the firm and university misled students about a cybersecurity boot camp. The suit claimed the program was marketed with Caltech's prestigious name but had minimal connection to its faculty or academic standards. As part of the settlement, Simplilearn will refund $2.4 million in tuition, and Caltech will create a faculty committee to provide greater oversight for its professional education programs.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan for a large-scale reduction-in-force that could have eliminated tens of thousands of jobs. The agency announced it is on pace to reduce its staff by about 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year through normal attrition, a hiring freeze, and deferred resignations. This progress has eliminated the need for the mass layoffs, which were part of a broader Trump administration push to shrink the federal workforce and had drawn criticism for potentially harming veteran services.</p>

          <p>China has activated a new northbound flight path, W121, near the median line of the Taiwan Strait without consulting Taipei, a move that has escalated regional tensions. The route is an offshoot of the controversial M503 flight path, which at its closest point is just 4.2 nautical miles from the unofficial maritime boundary. While Beijing describes the change as a technical adjustment to ease air traffic congestion, Taiwan views it as a unilateral action that compromises its national security and flight safety.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive Justice Department and FBI review of the Jeffrey Epstein case has officially concluded that the disgraced financier died by suicide in 2019. The review also found no evidence of a so-called "client list" or any credible information that Epstein was blackmailing prominent individuals. The findings, released in a public memo, aim to debunk persistent conspiracy theories about his death in federal custody, confirming that no one entered his cell and that no further investigation against third parties is warranted.</p>

          <p>South Korea has canceled a planned $2.2 billion deal to purchase an additional 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters. The decision was influenced by a 66% cost increase and the platform's demonstrated vulnerability to modern air defenses and drones, as seen in the war in Ukraine. A South Korean lawmaker stated that the country must invest in future warfare capabilities rather than expensive legacy systems. The funds will likely be reallocated to develop and procure drones and other advanced smart weapon systems.</p>

          <p>Nearly 600 tech founders and industry figures have signed an open letter demanding that venture capital firm Sequoia Capital denounce what they describe as an "inflammatory attack" by one of its partners, Shaun Maguire.

The letter calls for a public apology, an investigation into Maguire's behavior, and a zero-tolerance policy on religious bigotry and hate speech.</p>
