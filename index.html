          <p>A significant power outage impacted Spain and Portugal on Monday, disrupting daily life and causing business closures, train and subway disruptions, and flight delays. Officials have ruled out a cyberattack as the cause, with Portuguese energy authorities citing a disruption in the European grid. The Spanish government convened an emergency crisis meeting and is working to restore power, which is expected to take several hours. The outage also caused significant delays at airports, particularly in Lisbon, Barcelona, and Madrid.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers, led by Sen. Adam Schiff and Rep. Mike Levin, are demanding a full disclosure of financial transactions preceding President Trump's recent pause on tariffs, raising concerns about potential insider trading. They have requested that all senior White House and executive branch employees release their securities transaction reports since the start of Trump's term. The request follows a surge in the stock market after Trump announced the tariff rollback, with Democrats pointing to Trump's Truth Social post just hours before the announcement, suggesting it may have been an indication of an upcoming market rally.</p>

          <p>American consumer spending is showing a divide, with lower-income earners reducing transactions to focus on necessities, while wealthier individuals continue to spend on luxuries like dining and travel. This trend is reflected in the performance of credit card lenders, with Synchrony, catering to lower-income users, experiencing a spending drop, while American Express and JPMorgan Chase, serving wealthier clients, saw spending increases, particularly in dining and first-class travel. This divergence highlights the economic anxieties stemming from President Trump's trade policies and their impact on different segments of the population.</p>

          <p>On the day of Canada's election, President Trump suggested that Canadians should elect him to make Canada the 51st state, promising tax cuts and economic benefits. Canadian political leaders, including Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre and Prime Minister Mark Carney, swiftly rejected the idea, emphasizing Canada's sovereignty and independence. Recent polls indicate the Liberals are ahead of the Conservatives. The Canadian election will determine whether the Liberals can maintain their majority or form a minority government.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated he is not currently worried about American shops running out of items due to President Trump's tariffs. Trump has introduced a baseline tariff of 10% against most nations and a higher 145% levy on goods from China. Bessent suggested retailers likely pre-ordered goods and that replacements would be found, while awaiting China's response to de-escalate trade tensions. His remarks come amid concerns about potential disruptions to supply chains and rising costs for consumers due to the tariffs.</p>

          <p>A child has damaged a Mark Rothko painting, estimated to be worth up to €50 million, at a museum in Rotterdam. The damage, described as superficial scratches, occurred during an "unguarded moment." The museum is seeking conservation expertise to determine the next steps for treatment. Modern unvarnished paintings like Rothko's are particularly susceptible to damage, making even small areas of damage instantly perceptible.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an emergency waiver to allow the sale of higher-ethanol gasoline (E15) nationwide this summer, aiming to increase fuel supply and lower costs during peak driving season. This move is expected to benefit biofuel producers and corn farmers by expanding the market for ethanol. The government typically restricts E15 sales during summer months due to environmental concerns, but the EPA expects to extend the waiver as long as necessary.</p>
