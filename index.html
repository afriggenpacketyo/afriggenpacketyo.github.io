          <h2>Trump Announces Framework for Trade Deal with the United Kingdom</h2>

          <p>President Trump announced a framework for a trade deal with the United Kingdom, emphasizing that while not finalized, it signifies a commitment to reciprocity and fairness in international trade. The deal aims to increase market access for American exports, particularly in agriculture, and eliminate non-tariff barriers that discriminated against American products. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick noted that a 10% tariff on imports from Britain would remain, generating revenue for the United States. The announcement follows Trump's broader effort to overhaul the global trading system through tariffs, with the U.K. being the first such agreement since the pause in reciprocal tariffs.</p>

          <p>G.O.P. lawmakers from swing districts face difficult decisions regarding legislation that would cut popular programs to fund President Trump's agenda. Representative Gabe Evans, a Republican from Colorado, is involved in writing legislation that could affect his re-election prospects. The Republican budget resolution instructs the Energy and Commerce Committee, where Evans sits, to slash Medicaid spending by $880 billion over the next decade to pay for tax cuts. This poses a dilemma for Republicans in Congress as they struggle to coalesce around Trump's domestic agenda, particularly concerning Medicaid, which provides health insurance for lower-income Americans.</p>

          <p>The Senate is scheduled to vote on the GENIUS Act, a bill aiming to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, but its passage is uncertain. Nine Democrats, including some who previously supported the bill in committee, have withdrawn their support, citing concerns over anti-money laundering, foreign issuers, and national security provisions. Led by Senator Ruben Gallego, these Democrats are calling for stronger measures to address these issues, casting doubt on the bill's ability to garner the 60 votes needed to advance.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price climbed above $100,000 for the first time since February, driven by optimism surrounding the U.S.-U.K. trade deal announcement. The cryptocurrency's rise reflects its status as a bounceback asset amid brightening prospects for U.S. trade deals. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto exchange Nexo, highlighted Bitcoin's resilience and safe haven status, supported by a pro-crypto Trump administration and demand from spot-ETF investors. However, Trenchev cautioned that Bitcoin's resilience would be tested further in an uncertain global environment, citing rising tensions between India and Pakistan and the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to interest rate cuts.</p>

          <p>Shopify's stock experienced a slight decline after the company released mixed first-quarter results and provided softer-than-expected guidance for the upcoming period. While earnings per share surpassed expectations, the company's revenue forecast for the second quarter was less optimistic. CFO Jeff Hoffmeister acknowledged the uncertainty stemming from President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, but stated that the expiration of de minimis is not expected to have a significant impact on Shopify in the near term. He also noted that Shopify's higher-income customer base may help insulate merchants from potential price swings.</p>

Girardi's lawyers requested a delay of one to two weeks, emphasizing his desire to be physically present.

Prosecutors are seeking a 14-year prison term, while Girardi's lawyers argue for medical care due to his dementia and cognitive decline.</p>

          <p>In an era characterized by loud egos and increasing unhappiness, cultivating a quiet ego is presented as a countercultural strategy for personal well-being. Psychologists define quiet ego as a self-identity that balances self-focus with consideration for others. It encompasses virtues like charity, humility, self-awareness, and hope, and is associated with better mood balance, life satisfaction, and a greater sense of life's meaning. The article suggests practical steps for acquiring these virtues, including questioning conventional wisdom, prioritizing the needs of others, and cultivating detached self-awareness.</p>

Researchers used satellite-based radar measurements to visualize land movement, attributing the sinking primarily to groundwater extraction. At least 20% of urban areas in all 28 cities are subsiding, with some cities experiencing faster sinking rates than others. The study highlights the potential for silent compromise of infrastructure over time, with damage becoming evident only when it is severe or catastrophic.</p>

          <p>Amazon is expanding its online pharmacy services to include prescription pet medications, offering hundreds of commonly prescribed medications for pets. Customers can purchase prescriptions through Amazon's storefront, with veterinarian approval required. Online pet pharmacy Vetsource will oversee the dispensing and delivery of medications, with delivery times typically ranging from two to six days. This move places Amazon in direct competition with online pet pharmacies like Chewy and Walmart, further solidifying Amazon's presence in the healthcare sector.</p>

          <p>Filing for bankruptcy can provide debt relief, but the type of bankruptcy determines which debts are discharged. Chapter 7 bankruptcy, also known as liquidation bankruptcy, eliminates many types of unsecured debt like credit cards and medical bills. However, it won't discharge obligations such as child support, most taxes, and federal student loans. To qualify for Chapter 7, individuals must pass an income-based means test. Alternatives to bankruptcy, like debt consolidation, debt management, and debt settlement, can ease debt burdens without a court filing.</p>

Experts fear that the volatile situation and risk of miscalculation could escalate into a full-fledged military conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.

          <p>The Bank of England has cut interest rates to 4.25% from 4.5%, signaling that more reductions may follow in the coming months. Governor Andrew Bailey noted the potential impact of the global trade war on UK economic growth and welcomed the UK-US trade deal as a positive sign. The Bank's decision to lower rates was influenced by concerns over the potential impact of trade tensions and expectations for lower inflation due to diverted cheap goods from countries like China. The move is expected to impact mortgage rates and monthly repayments for homeowners with tracker mortgages.</p>

Hundreds of Palestinian students were sent home from the schools in Shuafat refugee camp just after classes began on Thursday morning. Unrwa's Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, said Israeli authorities were denying children their basic right to learn and accused them of a "blatant disregard of international law". An Israeli ban on Unrwa took effect earlier this year and Israel accuses the agency of being infiltrated by Hamas. Unrwa denies this claim and insists on its impartiality.</p>
