          <p>The terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap, has been dismissed due to a technical error in how the charge was filed. He was accused of displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah, a proscribed organization in the UK, during a concert in London. The judge ruled the charge was "unlawful" and "null" because it was brought outside the legal six-month time limit. The decision was met with applause in the courtroom and celebrated by the band as a victory against "political policing."</p>

          <p>An extensive operation coordinated by Interpol across 14 African countries has led to the arrest of 260 individuals suspected of involvement in romance scams and "sextortion." The criminal networks allegedly used digital platforms to defraud over 1,400 victims out of a combined total of nearly $2.8 million. The crackdown, which took place between July and August, targeted the infrastructure used by these syndicates, leading to the seizure of devices and the dismantling of 81 cyber-crime groups. Officials noted a sharp rise in such digitally-enabled crimes, which cause both severe financial and psychological harm to victims.</p>

          <p>In response to escalating trade tensions, particularly with the United States, Beijing has developed a range of policy tools to protect its domestic industries and retaliate against what it views as unfair trade practices. These measures extend beyond traditional anti-dumping investigations and include more assertive mechanisms. Among them are the "Unreliable Entity List," which targets foreign firms deemed harmful to China's interests, and expanded export controls on dual-use items that have both civilian and potential military applications. These strategies provide China with a flexible and potent arsenal to navigate the complexities of global trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is championing a proposal to create a network of city-owned grocery stores designed to offer low prices by operating on a non-profit basis. The plan has garnered significant support among likely voters but has also drawn sharp criticism from established supermarket owners, who argue it is unrealistic and fails to account for the complexities of the grocery business. While a similar municipal store has found success in a small Kansas town out of necessity, another nearby experiment failed, highlighting the significant financial challenges and risks associated with such ventures in a competitive urban market.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's prosecution of Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver for allegedly assaulting a federal officer is being scrutinized as a potential test of authoritarian tactics. Critics argue the charges are dubious and politically motivated, designed to financially drain a political opponent through legal fees, even if she is ultimately acquitted. The case also challenges the Constitution's Speech and Debate Clause, which is intended to protect members of Congress from executive intimidation while performing their official duties. This article suggests that if the prosecution is allowed to proceed, it could set a dangerous precedent for weaponizing the justice system against political adversaries.</p>

          <p>Sir Tony Blair, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is reportedly involved in high-level discussions about leading a post-war transitional authority in Gaza. The proposal, which is said to have support from the White House, would establish a UN-backed international body to govern the territory for approximately five years before returning control to Palestinians. Blair, who previously served as a Middle East envoy, has been participating in planning talks regarding Gaza's future. This development comes as various international parties continue to table different, often conflicting, proposals for the governance and reconstruction of the war-torn region.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto is currently active in the Atlantic, and meteorologists are monitoring the possibility of its interaction with another developing storm system nearby. If the two systems get close enough, they could produce a rare phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect, where two storms orbit a common center. Forecasters believe this outcome is unlikely, as one storm is significantly weaker than the other, which would typically result in the smaller system being absorbed. However, the possibility remains, and such an interaction could slightly alter the projected paths of the storms as they move through the region.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of a deal to prevent a U.S. ban on TikTok, the Chinese government and state media have remained conspicuously quiet. This silence creates uncertainty, as Beijing's approval is ultimately required for the deal, which involves owner ByteDance divesting its U.S. operations into a new entity. While Trump has claimed he received a 'go-ahead' from President Xi Jinping, the details of the agreement remain murky, and its fate is intertwined with broader U.S.-China trade negotiations. The lack of a clear stance from China leaves the popular app's future in the American market hanging in the balance.</p>

          <p>The Chinese toy company Pop Mart has expressed satisfaction with the recent drop in the resale prices of its highly popular Labubu monster toys. After a summer where secondary market prices soared over 2,000% above retail, the company increased production to meet demand, which has helped cool the speculative frenzy. Pop Mart stated that its goal is to make its art accessible to genuine fans who connect with the products, rather than catering to scalpers seeking profit.

A hoarse throat has also become a notable feature of recent Covid variants.

          <p>The London-based financial technology company Checkout.com has launched a share buyback program for its employees, setting its new internal valuation at $12 billion. This figure marks a steep decline from its peak valuation of $40 billion during a 2022 funding round, reflecting a broader market correction for high-growth private tech firms. The move is intended to provide liquidity for longtime employees and investors at a time when initial public offerings have become less frequent. The company competes with other major payment processors like Stripe and Adyen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has unveiled a new wave of tariffs targeting specific industries, including a 100% levy on certain imported pharmaceuticals and significant taxes on heavy-duty trucks and furniture. The administration justified the measures as necessary to protect U.S. manufacturers from a "flooding" of products from foreign countries. This action represents an expansion of the president's protectionist trade policies, which have been a central feature of his second term, despite concerns from business groups about potential increases in consumer costs and disruptions to supply chains.

This stance underscores Hungary's continued dependence on Russian energy and its unique position within the EU, where most nations have worked to wean themselves off Russian fossil fuels following the invasion of Ukraine.</p>

While FIFA is officially in charge of selecting and managing host cities, Trump's threat aligns with his political focus on crime and could create logistical challenges for the event.

The IOPC is investigating Leicestershire Police's prior interactions with the killer, Valdo Calocane. Following the allegations, the watchdog has removed some staff from the case and commissioned an external review, but the incident has further eroded the families' trust in official institutions.</p>

          <p>Cities worldwide are experiencing a surge in rat populations, with experts pointing to a combination of climate change and human habits as the primary causes. According to urban rodentologists, warmer winters are allowing rats to breed year-round, leading to exponential population growth. This environmental factor is exacerbated by an abundance of food sources from overflowing trash bins and a growing appetite for fast food in dense urban areas. This convergence of factors is creating a significant public health challenge, as rats can spread disease and contaminate food supplies.</p>
