          <p>Tensions between Israel and Iran have escalated as Iran launched another wave of missiles at Israel, resulting in civilian casualties and infrastructure damage. Israel claims that Iranian missiles have killed 24 people and wounded approximately 500 others, accusing Iran of deliberately targeting civilians. In response, Israel conducted strikes on Iranian military targets, including missile launchers and facilities associated with the Quds Force. The conflict has led to the cancellation of planned talks on Iran's nuclear program between the U.S. and Iran, and the U.S. State Department has issued a directive emphasizing its non-involvement in Israel's actions against Iran.</p>

          <p>With increased immigration enforcement, foreign-born residents, particularly undocumented immigrants, are concerned about financial asset protection. Experts recommend creating a plan for potential detention or deportation, including designating someone to manage finances. Key steps include collecting and securing important documents, checking access to accounts from abroad, establishing a power of attorney, and protecting finances for future generations through legal documents and life insurance. Financial and legal experts emphasize the importance of planning ahead to ensure that assets are protected and families are provided for in emergency scenarios. (not investment advice)</p>
