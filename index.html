        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of key European leaders has publicly stated that any peace negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, including a proposed meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, must involve Ukraine. While welcoming U.S. diplomatic efforts, they stressed that a just and lasting peace cannot be decided without Kyiv's participation and must include robust security guarantees. The statement comes as the White House remains open to inviting Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to the summit, which Russia's Putin initially requested be a bilateral meeting. This diplomatic pressure underscores European concerns about potential agreements made without Ukrainian consent.</p>

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose won his first PGA Tour title in over two years, defeating American JJ Spaun in a three-hole sudden-death playoff at the St. Jude Championship in Memphis. Rose, 45, clinched the victory with a birdie on the third playoff hole after both players matched each other with a par and then a birdie on the first two. The win was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who entered the final round with a one-stroke lead but finished one shot back, tied for third. The victory marks a significant return to form for Rose and secures his place in the next stage of the PGA Tour playoffs.</p>

          <p>Bobby Whitlock, the singer, songwriter, and keyboardist who co-founded the influential rock band Derek and the Dominos with Eric Clapton, has died at the age of 77 from cancer. As a key creative force in the group, Whitlock co-wrote many of their most famous songs, including "Bell Bottom Blues" and "Why Does Love Got to be So Sad?" from the seminal 1971 album "Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs." His wife, Coco Carmel Whitlock, and former bandmate Eric Clapton were among those who paid tribute to the musician, who was remembered for his soulful contributions to rock music and his later-in-life passion for painting.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified Patrick Joseph White as the gunman who opened fire on the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, killing a police officer before dying during the incident. According to law enforcement, the 30-year-old had become fixated on his belief that COVID-19 vaccines had harmed him, a sentiment echoed by his neighbors. The attack has prompted a union representing CDC workers to demand that federal officials condemn vaccine misinformation, arguing it fuels a climate of hostility that endangers scientists. CDC employees will work remotely while security is assessed, following the traumatic event where multiple buildings on the campus were struck by gunfire.</p>

          <p>In University Place, Washington, a botched attempt to tow a broken-down car resulted in significant damage to a local restaurant. Surveillance footage captured the incident, showing a tow strap snapping multiple times, causing the runaway sedan to roll back and crash into the Pho and Teriyaki storefront on three separate occasions. After several failed attempts to secure and remove the vehicle, the driver and a passenger ultimately abandoned the car in the parking lot and fled the scene. The Pierce County Sheriff's office is investigating the event as a hit-and-run, as the restaurant sustained considerable structural damage.</p>

          <p>A correctional facility in Colorado has been fully evacuated as the Lee fire continues to expand, becoming the sixth-largest single wildfire in the state's history. All 179 inmates from the Rifle Correctional Center were safely relocated as a precautionary measure. The fire has burned over 167 square miles in western Colorado with minimal containment, fueled by gusty winds and dry conditions. While over a thousand firefighters are battling the blaze and no structural damage has been reported, residents in remote areas have been put on evacuation alert and air quality warnings are in effect due to heavy smoke.</p>

          <p>A historical report revisits the forgotten World War II tragedy of the Cap Arcona, a German luxury liner turned into a floating concentration camp. In May 1945, just days before the war's end, the ship was packed with thousands of prisoners and anchored in the Baltic Sea when it was mistakenly bombed and sunk by the British Royal Air Force. The attack resulted in the deaths of approximately 7,000 prisoners in one of the deadliest friendly-fire incidents in history. The article shares the harrowing accounts of survivors and explores the historical records that suggest British intelligence knew prisoners were aboard but failed to relay the information to the pilots.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called for the immediate removal of homeless individuals from Washington D.C., stating they will be given places to stay "FAR from the Capital." This demand is part of a broader plan he intends to announce to make the city safer and cleaner, which includes deploying more federal law enforcement. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has pushed back against the administration's claims of a crime spike, noting that violent crime is trending toward a 30-year low.

Shortly after, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had struck al-Sharif, alleging he was the head of a Hamas terrorist cell, a claim Al Jazeera has previously condemned as part of an incitement campaign against its staff.

          <p>Liverpool's Community Shield match against Crystal Palace served as the first major test for the team's revamped lineup, revealing both brilliant potential and areas needing improvement. Four new summer signings started, including record acquisition Florian Wirtz, who was a standout performer, and new goal-scorers Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong. However, the team twice surrendered a lead to draw 2-2 before losing on penalties, highlighting defensive vulnerabilities and a need for more time to adapt. Manager Arne Slot acknowledged that while his team doesn't concede many chances, they concede goals too easily, indicating that work remains to fix the bugs in his new system.</p>

          <p>England's Rehan Ahmed was the star performer as Trent Rockets defeated the Northern Superchargers by five wickets, continuing their unbeaten start in the men's Hundred cricket tournament. The 20-year-old first made an impact with the ball, taking two wickets for 23 runs to help restrict the Superchargers to a modest total of 124-9. He then contributed a crucial 31 runs with the bat during the chase. Despite a mid-innings wobble against the Superchargers' spin bowlers, the Rockets successfully reached their target with four balls remaining, thanks to Ahmed's key partnership and a calm finish from the lower order.</p>

An Nvidia spokesperson firmly denied these claims, stating the company does not have backdoors in its chips and that cybersecurity is critically important. This exchange marks the latest escalation in U.S.-China tensions over semiconductor technology, as Nvidia navigates complex export controls to maintain access to the significant Chinese market.</p>

A veteran of four spaceflights, Lovell was one of the first humans to orbit the Moon on Apollo 8 in 1968.
