          <p>Colombia's former president, Álvaro Uribe, has been sentenced to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and bribery in a case tied to the nation's civil war. The court found him guilty of paying jailed paramilitaries to retract testimony that connected him to the formation of violent right-wing militia groups. This landmark conviction marks the first time a Colombian head of state has been found guilty in a criminal trial, a decision hailed by human rights organizations as a major step toward accountability. Uribe, who maintains his innocence, has stated he will appeal the verdict.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old man, Jon Ruben, has appeared in court on charges of child cruelty following an incident at a summer camp in Leicestershire, UK. The charges stem from an investigation launched after eight children and one adult became ill and required hospitalization, although all have since been discharged from care. Ruben has been charged with three counts of wilful ill-treatment of a child and was remanded in custody pending his next court appearance. The police watchdog is also independently investigating the force's handling of the incident.</p>

          <p>Syria is scheduled to hold its first parliamentary elections in mid-September following the collapse of the Assad regime, a moment viewed with a mix of hope and deep skepticism. The new 210-member parliament will serve for a three-year transitional period, but interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa will appoint 70 of the seats, raising serious concerns about inclusivity and fairness. Ethnic and religious minorities are particularly wary, given recent sectarian violence and a lack of trust in the new government's commitment to their representation. Analysts see the elections as a critical test for al-Sharaa's leadership and the country's fragile transition.</p>

          <p>Several German states are expanding their use of "Gotham," a powerful surveillance software from the US company Palantir, which uses AI to analyze vast amounts of data for police investigations. Civil rights organizations are challenging its use through constitutional complaints, arguing it violates privacy rights by potentially ensnaring innocent individuals in a wide dragnet. Critics also highlight the dependency on a foreign tech company with controversial ties and the opaque nature of the software. The debate underscores a growing conflict between state security objectives and Germany's constitutional commitments to digital sovereignty and individual privacy.</p>

          <p>Australian cricketer David Warner, currently in England for The Hundred tournament, has offered some pointed commentary on English batter Joe Root's form ahead of the winter Ashes series. Warner suggested that Root, who has never scored a century in Australia, needs to adjust his batting technique to counter Australian bowlers like Josh Hazlewood, saying he must "take the surfboard off his front leg." Warner, who retired from international cricket, also commented on facing veteran English bowler James Anderson again, noting the conditions will be different. The article highlights the competitive but familiar rivalry between the two nations' players.</p>

          <p>Recent economic data presents a mixed and chaotic picture of the U.S. economy during President Trump's second term, challenging White House claims of a consistent boom. While second-quarter GDP showed robust growth, it followed an unexpected first-quarter contraction, and key indicators like private domestic investment have dropped significantly. The administration's aggressive tariff strategy has caused wild swings in trade, while the Federal Reserve has held interest rates steady despite intense presidential pressure. A major slowdown in job creation for July has further fueled concerns that economic uncertainty is causing a rapid deterioration in the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A noticeable pattern has emerged in President Trump's second term where world leaders are increasingly using praise and flattery as a primary diplomatic tool. Examples include the UK Prime Minister offering an "unprecedented" second state visit invitation and Israel's Prime Minister nominating Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Analysts suggest this strategy stems from a realization that Trump's decision-making is highly personal and that appealing to his desire to be seen as a uniquely successful winner is effective. Unlike his first term, leaders now engage directly with Trump, recognizing him as the sole decider on major policy issues.</p>

          <p>Japan's meteorological agency has confirmed that the country experienced its hottest July since record-keeping began in 1898, with the average temperature 2.89°C above the long-term average.

The extreme weather, which included an unusually early end to the rainy season, is being directly linked to human-driven climate change.

          <p>A new study led by Chinese researchers has traced the evolutionary origins of the potato, revealing an ancient link to a forerunner of the tomato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists found that modern potatoes derive from a hybridization event that occurred about nine million years ago. An ancestor of the tomato crossed with a tuberless, potato-like plant, a process that was key to the development of the tuber—the edible part of the potato. This pioneering research sheds new light on the complex genetic history of one of the world's most important and widely consumed food crops.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a temporary restraining order that blocks federal immigration agents from conducting "roving patrols" and indiscriminate arrests in Southern California. The ruling affirms a lower court's decision, which found substantial evidence that agents were unconstitutionally targeting people based on factors like race, language, or location without reasonable suspicion. The lawsuit was filed by civil rights groups on behalf of immigrants and U.S. citizens who were unlawfully detained. The decision represents a significant legal setback for the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics in the region.</p>

          <p>As wildfires affect parts of Europe, including Greece and Turkey, this article provides guidance for tourists whose travel plans may be disrupted. Experts advise that if the UK Foreign Office deems travel safe, canceling a trip due to uneasiness is unlikely to be covered by standard travel insurance unless specific catastrophe coverage was purchased. However, if an airline or holiday provider cancels bookings, travelers are eligible for refunds. The article clarifies that while airlines must provide care for significant delays or cancellations, compensation is unlikely for disruptions caused by "extraordinary circumstances" like wildfires.</p>

          <p>A TikTok trend known as "morning shed," featuring users removing overnight silicone masks and mouth tape, is highlighting a move toward extreme beauty routines. Kim Kardashian's Skims brand has capitalized on this by launching a "face shapewear" mask, which sold out quickly but drew criticism for promoting unrealistic beauty standards and preying on insecurities. Medical professionals express skepticism, stating that any effects from such products are temporary and that overuse could cause skin irritation. Critics argue these trends reinforce the harmful message that even sleep must be optimized for aesthetic gain, potentially damaging self-esteem.</p>

          <p>Amid growing "dating fatigue" and declining user numbers, online dating apps are introducing new features to keep users engaged and offer different experiences. Apps like Breeze are minimizing pre-date messaging to encourage in-person meetings, while others like Feeld cater to niche communities, and Tinder has added a "double date" function. This shift responds to user dissatisfaction with conventional app culture, which is often characterized by repetitive profiles and unhealthy behaviors like ghosting. This article explores whether these new approaches can reignite the search for love online in a saturated market.</p>

          <p>China's General Administration of Customs has tightened import regulations for durians from Vietnam after detecting hazardous levels of the metal cadmium and a chemical compound. The new rules mandate enhanced pre-export safety checks and require "batch by batch" testing upon arrival, with any non-compliant shipments being returned or destroyed. Exporters found with unqualified fruit will be suspended from shipping to China. These measures have already impacted trade, with the value of fresh durian shipments from Vietnam to China falling by approximately 45% year-on-year in the first half of 2025.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent EU-US trade deal negotiated by Ursula von der Leyen is a significant loss for Europe and should be rejected. The authors contend that the deal damages the EU's credibility, creates a one-sided economic disadvantage, and unwisely commits to massive EU investment in the US. The piece criticizes von der Leyen for caving to President Trump's pressure, suggesting she was unprepared to walk away from a bad deal. The authors call on EU governments and the European Parliament to intervene and course-correct, arguing that accepting these terms would be a long-term strategic mistake. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Miami jury has found Tesla liable in a 2019 fatal crash and ordered the company to pay $243 million in damages to the victim's family and her injured boyfriend. The lawsuit argued that Tesla's Autopilot technology was a contributing factor in the crash, which occurred when a distracted driver went through an intersection and struck the couple. The plaintiffs' attorney contended that Tesla irresponsibly marketed the system and failed to implement adequate safeguards to prevent its use on non-highway roads. Tesla plans to appeal the verdict, maintaining that the driver is solely responsible for the collision.</p>
