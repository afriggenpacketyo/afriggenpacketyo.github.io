          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran confirmed he spoke with President Trump before this week's interest rate decision but stated he was not pressured on how to vote. Miran, who dissented from the committee's quarter-point rate cut in favor of a larger half-point reduction, emphasized that his decision was made independently. The conversation occurs amid ongoing concerns about the central bank's autonomy due to the President's vocal criticism and repeated calls for more aggressive rate cuts. Miran also dismissed concerns about a potential conflict of interest regarding his status at the Council of Economic Advisers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a Republican-led bill to temporarily fund the government and prevent a shutdown ahead of the September 30 deadline. The measure passed narrowly by a vote of 217-212, with nearly all Democrats opposing it due to disagreements over healthcare funding provisions. The bill now faces a significant challenge in the Senate, where it will require bipartisan support to pass. This legislation also includes additional funding for the security of members of Congress following recent threats against lawmakers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a crucial phone call aimed at finalizing a deal that would prevent the social media platform TikTok from being banned in the United States. This discussion follows the establishment of a "framework" agreement earlier in the week intended to resolve U.S. national security concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. President Trump, who has previously extended the divestment deadline multiple times, has publicly expressed a desire to preserve the platform's value for its American business operations and user base.</p>

          <p>The UK government has successfully deported an Eritrean migrant to France under a new "one in, one out" returns agreement, following a victory in a last-minute court challenge. This marks the first legally contested removal under the pilot scheme, which aims to deter illegal small boat crossings by exchanging migrants with France. The government won the case after tightening rules around human trafficking claims, with the judge ruling France is a safe country for the individual's return. For each migrant returned, the UK will accept another with a strong asylum case from France.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals Walmart's Online Marketplace Growth Fueled by Lax Vetting, Resulting in Counterfeit Goods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 11:17:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive investigation has found that Walmart's rapid expansion of its third-party online marketplace was facilitated by loosened seller vetting processes, leading to a surge in counterfeit and fraudulent products. Shoppers have reportedly received fake goods, including potentially dangerous health supplements, from sellers who sometimes used the stolen identities of legitimate businesses to create their accounts. The report suggests Walmart prioritized aggressive growth to compete with Amazon, creating a "Wild West" environment where bad actors could thrive.

          <p>Federal authorities have charged four people in El Paso, Texas, in connection with a child-smuggling ring that allegedly brought children aged five to thirteen into the U.S. from Mexico. The suspects are accused of posing as the children's parents at border checkpoints and using marijuana-laced gummies to sedate them during the crossings. According to the criminal complaint, the smugglers coordinated via text messages and were paid for their role in the operation.

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has clarified that the price hike on the new iPhone 17 Pro model is not a result of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Speaking from the new iPhone's launch event, Cook stated definitively that tariffs were not factored into the new pricing structure. This comes as Apple has been actively shifting parts of its supply chain to countries like India and Vietnam to mitigate the financial impact of the ongoing trade dispute. The company had previously reported taking a significant financial hit from tariffs in a prior quarter.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to fire Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, after his office found insufficient evidence to press mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. According to sources, Trump administration officials had pressured Siebert to bring charges despite the lack of clear evidence. The move is being criticized as a politically motivated attack on the rule of law and an escalation of what some call a retribution campaign against the president's political adversaries. James's attorney condemned the expected firing as an illegal attempt to find a prosecutor who will "bend the law to carry out his revenge."</p>

The Chinese government had previously vowed to block the sale of the algorithm, which is key to the app's success, but its position may be softening. A potential deal could involve a U.S. entity licensing, or "renting," the algorithm from parent company ByteDance, though this raises concerns about whether China could retain access or influence over the technology.

Early signs of an infestation include yellowing leaf margins that later turn red and brown.

This intermediary purchases the product from the retailer at a wholesale price and pays the U.S. tariff on that lower value, rather than the final retail price.

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released by the Taliban after nearly eight months in detention and have had an emotional reunion with their daughter in Doha, Qatar. The couple, who had lived and run a charity in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, were detained in February for allegedly breaking Afghan laws, though the specific reasons were never disclosed. Their release was secured through Qatari mediation. The family expressed immense gratitude and relief, noting the couple's poor health after being held in harrowing conditions, including being chained and deprived of sunlight.</p>

          <p>The Board of Supervisors in Johnson County, Iowa, has passed a resolution denouncing numerous executive orders issued by the Trump administration. The measure specifically condemns 27 orders related to a wide range of policies, including immigration restrictions, rollbacks of LGBTQ+ protections, and environmental policy changes. The resolution aims to reaffirm the county's commitment to protecting all its community members from what it views as harmful federal actions. The text was updated to note that many of these orders utilize emergency authority granted to the President by Congress, implicating Iowa's federal representatives.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's announcement that he will designate antifa as a "major terrorist organization" is likely to face significant legal challenges, as experts note the president lacks the authority to designate domestic groups in this manner. Antifa is described as a decentralized movement with no formal leadership, making it difficult to classify as a single organization. While the FBI has investigated violence by antifa adherents, U.S. law does not have a chargeable offense for domestic terrorism, and such a designation could infringe on First Amendment rights. The move is seen as a political response to recent events, rather than a legally viable action.</p>

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has dismissed President Donald Trump's suggestion that the military should be used to stop illegal migration across the English Channel. During his state visit, Trump advised that military intervention was a viable option, but UK Trade Secretary Peter Kyle rejected the idea, stating that the UK Border Force is specifically responsible for policing borders. Kyle emphasized that the military's primary focus should remain on national defense issues around the world. The comments came as the UK deported a second migrant under a new returns deal with France, a diplomatic approach favored by the current government.</p>

          <p>Late-night television hosts have responded to the suspension of ABC's Jimmy Kimmel with a mix of satirical criticism and expressions of solidarity. Jon Stewart made a special appearance on "The Daily Show," parodying the situation by hosting an "administration-compliant" show filled with nervous praise for the president. Stephen Colbert called the suspension "blatant censorship," while Jimmy Fallon praised Kimmel's character and expressed hope for his return. The collective response from the late-night community highlights widespread concern over what is perceived as government pressure on a media outlet following comments Kimmel made about a political event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's orders for the U.S. Navy to conduct deadly strikes on suspected drug boats from Venezuela are being criticized by legal experts as a violation of both international and U.S. law. The administration has justified the attacks, which have killed at least 14 people, by labeling the targets "narco-terrorists." However, this article argues that the president cannot unilaterally declare individuals terrorists and order their execution without congressional authority or evidence of an imminent threat, as required by the long-standing "Caroline test" for self-defense. This use of military force is seen as a dangerous expansion of executive power, treating a law enforcement issue as an act of war.</p>

Greenfield claimed the company is being sidelined for fear of upsetting those in power, marking a retreat from its long-standing commitment to corporate social responsibility. The resignation follows recent conflicts, including a lawsuit filed by Ben & Jerry's against Unilever for allegedly obstructing its calls for a Gaza ceasefire. This departure is presented as a sign that the era of corporations taking strong, progressive political stands may be ending under current political pressures.</p>

The Polish Ministry of Defense has since clarified that any planned training or cooperation will take place exclusively on Polish territory. The fact-check reveals how unclearly formulated remarks were amplified and distorted by content farms to create a sensational but inaccurate narrative of escalating conflict.</p>

Modi claimed that "infiltrators" are threatening jobs and security, leading to a demographic shift. Critics argue that the mission is a thinly veiled effort to target minority populations, especially Muslims, and is part of a broader political strategy of demographic engineering. The announcement follows other controversial citizenship initiatives, like the Citizenship Amendment Act, which critics say discriminates based on religion and undermines the status of certain Indian citizens.</p>
