Kennedy claims to have engaged with pharmaceutical CEOs, emphasizing the administration's commitment to affordable access to therapies and its willingness to use statutory authority to address the imbalance.

          <p>Maureen Dowd, in a New York Times opinion piece, reflects on the tragic decline of Joe Biden, painting a picture of a once-gregarious and empathetic leader succumbing to hubris and the pressures of power. Dowd suggests Biden's inability to recognize his diminishing capabilities and his reliance on a close circle of advisors contributed to his downfall. The article critiques the alternate reality created by Biden's inner circle, where cognitive decline was concealed and damaging decisions were rationalized. Dowd argues that Biden's tragedy lies in his failure to relinquish power gracefully, ultimately harming both himself and the country.</p>

          <p>CNBC provides guidance for student loan borrowers on avoiding delinquency and default as the Trump administration increases collection efforts. The article explains the difference between delinquency (missing a payment) and default (failing to make payments for 270 days), emphasizing that only borrowers in default face garnishments of tax refunds, paychecks, and Social Security benefits. Experts recommend that delinquent borrowers contact their loan servicer to request forbearance and enroll in income-driven repayment plans, while those in default can pursue loan rehabilitation or enroll in an income-driven repayment plan. The article highlights the importance of proactive communication and awareness of available options to manage student loan debt.</p>

          <p>Vox reports on a unanimous Supreme Court decision in Barnes v. Felix, rebuking the Fifth Circuit's narrow approach to police violence cases. The Court held that the Fifth Circuit erred by focusing solely on the moment of the threat in excessive force cases, rather than considering the totality of the circumstances leading up to the use of force. Justice Kagan emphasized that prior events can provide crucial context for understanding an officer's actions. The article notes that the ruling does not guarantee a different outcome in the case but clarifies the proper legal standard for evaluating excessive force claims.</p>

Production has not rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2023 strikes, leading to intensified competition for fewer projects. President Trump briefly considered imposing tariffs on movies made outside the U.S. but has since paused to meet with industry leaders.

          <p>The New York Times discusses the tradition of spring cleaning and the opportunity it presents to declutter both physical spaces and mental landscapes. The article encourages readers to not only get rid of unwanted items but also to intentionally decide what to fill the newly created space with, such as old photos, love letters, and childhood artwork. It suggests that rediscovering these forgotten treasures can bring joy and meaning to everyday life, offering a contrast to the constant scrolling and digital distractions that dominate modern routines. The article also touches on various cultural and political topics, including a Supreme Court decision, economic trends, and artistic events.</p>

          <p>CNBC reports that long-term care costs can be substantial, often exceeding $100,000, and many Americans are unprepared to manage these expenses. Financial advisors emphasize the importance of advance planning, as most health insurance policies and Medicare do not cover long-term custodial care. The article highlights that Medicaid may cover costs for lower-income households after they exhaust their assets, while long-term care insurance remains uncommon. It advises proactive planning, including discussing needs with family members and considering hybrid insurance policies that combine life insurance with long-term care benefits (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Times reviews "Original Sin" by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, which portrays President Biden as experiencing cognitive decline, a fact allegedly concealed by his family and inner circle. The book suggests that concerns about Biden's diminished capacities emerged as early as 2015, but were often dismissed or downplayed. The article highlights the book's claims of a coordinated effort to present a false image of Biden's capabilities to the public and top Democrats, culminating in his disastrous debate performance in 2024. The review concludes that the book is a painful but necessary piece of journalism, underscoring the importance of transparency and accountability in politics.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that the Trump administration is considering policy changes to expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF), including requiring insurers to cover the procedure and declaring it an essential health benefit. While the White House has engaged with various stakeholders, including fertility doctors and conservative policy groups, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine has not been included in the process. The administration's efforts are complicated by differing views within the Republican base, with some Christian conservatives opposing IVF due to concerns about embryo loss. The article explores potential policy options and the challenges of balancing competing interests.</p>
