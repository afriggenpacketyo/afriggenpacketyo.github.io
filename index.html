          <h2>Spirit Airlines to Furlough Hundreds of Pilots Amid Financial Restructuring</h2>

          <p>Spirit Airlines will furlough 270 pilots and demote 140 others this fall as it struggles to regain profitability. The move aims to align staffing with a reduced flight schedule during the softer off-peak travel season. The pilot's union expressed concern over the airline's continued shrinkage and its impact on pilot careers. This decision follows a previous round of furloughs last year as the company navigates financial challenges after emerging from bankruptcy.</p>

          <p>The Trump Organization has filed a lawsuit against unidentified online merchants for selling unauthorized, imitation Trump-branded merchandise on platforms like Amazon, Walmart, and eBay. The suit alleges trademark infringement and seeks to halt sales, destroy counterfeit goods, and close the sellers' accounts. The complaint highlights products such as hats and shirts with "Trump 2028" branding. This legal action comes as sales of Trump-related merchandise have seen significant spikes on e-commerce sites.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Gabe Evans of Colorado argues that Democratic-run sanctuary cities are failing Hispanic communities by shielding criminal illegal immigrants. In an exclusive interview, the former police officer claims these policies have led to an increase in crime, citing the presence of violent gangs like Tren de Aragua. Evans states that Hispanic business owners and families in his district feel preyed upon and are losing thousands of dollars due to theft. He asserts there is strong support within the Hispanic community for stricter immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the European Union and the United States has been met with a largely negative response from key European leaders. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned of substantial financial damage, while French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou described it as "submission." The agreement imposes a 15% tariff on most EU exports in exchange for Europe increasing purchases of American energy. While some leaders expressed relief that an all-out trade war was averted, the general sentiment across the bloc was one of resignation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's legal team is requesting an expedited deposition of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, 94, in a lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal. The $10 billion lawsuit concerns a Journal article about a letter Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein, which Trump claims is fake. The court filing argues for urgency due to Murdoch's advanced age and "significant health scares," suggesting he might be unavailable for a trial. This legal maneuver is part of the ongoing fallout from the Epstein case, with a judge requesting Murdoch's response.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration must continue allowing Planned Parenthood clinics to receive Medicaid reimbursements for their services nationwide. The ruling is part of a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood challenging a tax bill provision that aimed to "defund" the organization. The judge stated that restricting access to the healthcare provider would likely lead to adverse public health consequences, such as an increase in unintended pregnancies and untreated STIs. This court order protects a critical funding source for the organization.</p>

          <p>In a personal opinion piece, a contributor from Gaza describes the systematic dehumanization and starvation of Palestinians as a long-standing and deliberate Israeli strategy. The author recounts personal experiences of humiliation and connects them to the current war's rhetoric and catastrophic conditions. The article argues that this process has preceded and justified atrocities, leaving Gazans feeling stripped of their humanity and abandoned by the world. It paints a grim picture of a society fractured by hunger and despair, where survival has replaced all other concerns.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump faced criticism for using an official joint press conference with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to promote his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland. While answering a question, Trump delivered a lengthy praise of the resort's "opulent and beautiful" refurbishment, blurring the lines between his business interests and diplomatic duties. The incident follows controversy over the Scottish government considering public funding for another of his resorts. Ethics experts and critics have questioned the appropriateness of using his official visit to advance personal financial interests.</p>

          <p>China has offered to strengthen economic ties with Brazil and defend "fairness" in global trade as Brazil faces the threat of new, sweeping U.S. tariffs. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated Beijing's willingness to work with Brazil and other nations to uphold the multilateral trading system. The statement specifically noted interest in expanding cooperation in the aviation sector, as Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer is heavily reliant on the U.S. market. This move signals China's strategic positioning to support nations impacted by U.S. trade policies.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles luxury real estate market is showing significant strength, exemplified by Paris Hilton and her husband's recent $63 million purchase of a Beverly Hills mansion.

Brokers report that rising demand from both domestic buyers displaced by wildfires and international buyers is fueling the high-end market. The activity suggests a continued robust period for luxury properties in areas like Beverly Hills and Bel Air.</p>

          <p>A sweltering and dangerous heatwave is affecting over 200 million people across the eastern half of the United States, from the Midwest to the East Coast. The most extreme conditions are focused in the Southeast, where heat indices, factoring in humidity, are forecast to reach between 105 and 115 degrees. Major cities like New Orleans, Memphis, and Raleigh are under extreme heat warnings, and the oppressive conditions are expected to persist for several days. The prolonged heat poses a significant health risk, as high nighttime temperatures will offer little relief.</p>

Malachi Marlan-Librett, who was charged with assault with a deadly weapon and a hate crime, will avoid jail time by attending therapy and anti-bias training. Video evidence showed him attacking protesters and yelling racial epithets. The lenient outcome has drawn criticism, with a victim in the case contrasting it with the perceived lack of accountability in the broader Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>A large-scale study has provided strong evidence that a combination of diet, exercise, and brain training can significantly improve memory and thinking skills in older adults. The two-year POINTER study involved over 2,100 sedentary individuals in their 60s and 70s. Participants who followed an intensive regimen of aerobic exercise, a Mediterranean diet, and cognitive training showed cognitive scores similar to people one to two years younger. The results suggest such lifestyle interventions can potentially slow the trajectory of age-related cognitive decline.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis indicates that new U.S. tariffs are likely to increase costs for American consumers across several key categories. Products such as clothing, footwear, coffee, and olive oil, which are predominantly imported, are expected to become more expensive. The tariffs will also affect cars, housing construction materials like steel and lumber, and even some energy products. While President Trump claims the tariffs will boost domestic manufacturing, economists and industry groups warn that the primary immediate effect will be higher prices passed on to shoppers.
