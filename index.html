            <p>The Indiana legislature has passed a bill to establish a commission to explore adjusting its border with Illinois, aiming to acquire parts of the state. This effort is fueled by political divisions, as some Illinois counties seek to separate from the Chicago area, which is controlled by Democrats. While Indiana's government supports the idea, Illinois' top officials do not, and any boundary change would require approval from both state governments and the U.S. Congress. Similar efforts are underway in eastern Oregon, where some counties want to join Idaho.</p>
