            <p>Harvard University has refused to comply with President Trump's demands regarding its governance, hiring, and teaching practices, leading to the freezing of $2.2 billion in federal funds. Harvard President Alan Garber emphasized the importance of academic freedom, stating that no government should dictate what private universities can teach. While Harvard has made some concessions regarding antisemitism, it drew the line at the White House's sweeping demands. With a substantial endowment, Harvard is financially capable of weathering the storm, but experts say that losing federal funding will still create a crunch.</p>

He did not refer to Trump by name, but his remarks were a clear rebuke of the administration's approach to social safety nets.

            <p>A study indicates that the popularity of disposable vapes in the UK is decreasing in anticipation of a government ban scheduled for June 1, 2025. Researchers suggest that vape users are transitioning to refillable and rechargeable devices. The percentage of 16-24 year olds primarily using disposable vapes has nearly halved in the past year. The ban aims to reduce littering and address rising rates of youth vaping, although some concerns remain about discouraging smokers from switching to vapes as a cessation tool.</p>

            <h2>Trump's Stance on Free Speech Equates to Submission, Experts Say</h2>

          </div>

            <p>Experts suggest that President Trump's concept of "defending free speech" is synonymous with submission to his agenda, raising concerns about the state of democracy in the US. This perspective is intertwined with potential trade agreements, particularly with the UK, where Trump's administration is demanding the dilution of digital regulations under the guise of protecting free speech. Critics argue that this stance prioritizes the interests of US tech companies over genuine freedom of expression. The article highlights the complex challenges of policing online spaces and the need to resist undue influence from powerful commercial interests.</p>

            <p>President Trump's continued defiance of court orders, particularly in a deportation case, is prompting concerns about a potential constitutional crisis. The Supreme Court ordered the administration to facilitate the return of a deported Maryland resident, but the administration has shown no intention of complying. Experts are divided on whether this constitutes a full-blown constitutional crisis, but many agree that it poses a significant threat to the separation of powers and the rule of law. The case highlights the ongoing tension between the executive branch and the judiciary.</p>

            <p>The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has issued a cease and desist order against Google for unfair trade practices related to search services on Android devices. The JFTC found that Google violated Japan's anti-monopoly law by requiring Android device manufacturers to prioritize its own search apps and services through licensing agreements. This action aligns with similar regulatory crackdowns on Google in the UK and the U.S. The company required manufacturers to preinstall and prominently feature Google Search and Chrome on devices.</p>

            <p>The White House is implementing a new media policy that significantly restricts access to President Trump for news agencies, particularly wire services like the Associated Press. This move follows a court ruling that the White House had improperly punished the AP for its coverage. The new policy will limit the number of wire service reporters in small-space events and give the press secretary greater control over who can question the president. Critics argue that this policy undermines media independence and constitutes viewpoint discrimination.</p>
