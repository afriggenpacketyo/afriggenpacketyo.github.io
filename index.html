            <p>Both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of breaking the 30-hour Easter truce that was supposed to be in effect. Ukrainian President Zelensky claimed numerous attacks by Russian forces, while Russia's defense ministry stated they had repelled Ukrainian assaults and drone strikes. The truce, announced by Putin, aimed to halt hostilities over the Easter period, but both sides have presented conflicting accounts of its adherence, with Zelensky dismissing it as a PR stunt. The BBC has not independently verified the claims from either side. The Easter truce was announced shortly after President Trump threatened to "take a pass" on brokering further Russia-Ukraine peace talks.</p>

            <p>Senator Amy Klobuchar has called for the Supreme Court to hold Trump administration officials in contempt for allegedly ignoring a court order regarding the deportation of Kilmar Ábrego García. Klobuchar suggests appointing a special prosecutor to investigate officials responsible for the deportation and their refusal to facilitate his return. This comes after Justice Alito dissented from a Supreme Court decision blocking the deportation of Venezuelans, criticizing the majority's decision-making process. The case highlights ongoing tensions between the courts and the Trump administration regarding immigration policies.</p>

            <p>An IDF inquiry has concluded that "professional failures" contributed to the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza, including 14 medics and a UN worker. The investigation cited an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders" as factors in the incident, which occurred when troops opened fire believing they faced a threat. One officer has been dismissed, and another will be reprimanded, while the IDF maintains that six of the casualties were Hamas members. The Palestine Red Crescent Society has dismissed the report as invalid, asserting that it shifts blame inappropriately.</p>

            <p>Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee warned that President Trump's tariffs could cause a summer slowdown in economic activity after an "artificially high" start. Businesses and consumers are stocking up on inventory in anticipation of the tariffs, which could inflate economic activity in April. Sectors like the auto industry are likely to heavily stock up on inventory before import levies rise. Goolsbee expressed optimism about the long-term economic outlook, but cautioned about short-term uncertainty.</p>
