          <p>Pfizer has announced an expansion of its cost-cutting initiatives, projecting an additional $1.2 billion in savings by the close of 2027, mainly by streamlining business processes through enhanced digital enablement, automation, and AI. The company's first-quarter earnings surpassed analysts' predictions, despite an 8% drop in revenue attributed to decreasing sales of its COVID-19 pill, Paxlovid. While maintaining its full-year sales forecast of $61 billion to $64 billion, Pfizer acknowledges potential impacts from President Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals but has already factored in $150 million in costs from existing tariffs. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla mentioned that uncertainty around Trump's pharmaceutical tariffs is deterring the company from further investing in U.S. manufacturing and research and development.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division is facing a significant exodus, with over 100 attorneys resigning following the confirmation of Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon. Dhillon stated that the division's priorities under President Trump would differ from those under President Biden, focusing on issues such as transgender athletes in sports and investigating anti-Christian bias, rather than enforcing voting rights laws. The resignations reflect disagreement with the administration's shift toward culture war issues. Dhillon indicated a desire to staff up the division to pursue actions like those targeting Harvard University, while Democrats voiced concerns about the politicization of the division.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a report that Amazon would display tariff costs next to product prices, the White House criticized the move as a "hostile and political act." Amazon initially stated it considered listing import charges only for its budget-focused Amazon Haul section but later clarified that the plan was never approved and would not be implemented. President Trump reportedly contacted Jeff Bezos to express his disapproval. The potential move stemmed from Trump's removal of the de minimis trade loophole, not his 145% tariff on imports from China, and Amazon has begun assessing the impact of tariffs on its third-party sellers.</p>

          <p>Consumer outlook has declined to its lowest level since 2011, with the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index falling to 86, significantly below expectations, as fears over tariffs intensify. The expectations index, which assesses the outlook for the next six months, has dropped to its lowest reading since October 2011, signaling potential recessionary conditions. Pessimism is driven by concerns about tariffs, employment prospects, and future income, with a notable increase in the percentage of respondents anticipating job losses. Inflation expectations have also surged, reaching 7% for the next year, and recession expectations have hit a two-year high.</p>

          <p>House Republicans moved to block a Democratic effort to investigate Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of Signal for communications.

The resolution sought to have Trump turn over all of Hegseth's communications shared on Signal.

          <p>Despite facing a significant deficit in polls just months prior, Canada's Liberal Party has secured a victory, largely attributed to backlash against Donald Trump's policies. Led by Mark Carney, who replaced Justin Trudeau, the Liberals capitalized on Trump's threats to annex Canada and implemented strategic advertising. The party's success also stems from its ability to implement progressive policies such as expanding social security, passing infrastructure bills, and legalizing marijuana, demonstrating a capacity to adapt and govern effectively, making them a successful left-of-center party.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed plans to soften the impact of automotive tariffs, as the car industry faces regulatory uncertainty and increased costs. While the 25% tariffs on imported vehicles into the U.S. will continue, the new measures will prevent other adjacent levies, such as additional tariffs on steel and aluminum, from "stacking" on top of the others. Tariffs on auto parts are still scheduled to take effect, but there will be an ability for some reimbursements, up to an amount equal to 3.75% of the value of a U.S.-made car for one year.</p>

          <p>Introverts often communicate and execute more effectively because their brains work differently, leading them to think more deeply, plan more intentionally, and choose their words more carefully. They are more successful than extroverts because they are honest about what they don't know, they value others' perspectives, they provide substance without theatrics, they ensure decisions are made with accuracy, and they bring clarity to what's really going on. Introverts help protect against skipping over ambiguity or bluffing their way through uncertainty. The result is communication that's precise, thoughtful and far more impactful.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's first 100 days have unleashed chaos with tariffs and executive orders, tanking markets and global trust. Despite promising the American public a "golden age" of prosperity, Trump's policies have quickly created great uncertainty among US businesses and consumers. Economists estimate a significant likelihood of a US recession in 2025, while others warn of a "high" or "very high" probability of a global downturn.
