          <p>Toyota has unveiled its latest RAV4 model, set to launch in Japan, North America, and Europe, marking the first vehicle to incorporate Toyota's new Arene software system.

The Arene system powers the multimedia system, voice agent, center display, and advanced safety technologies in the new RAV4.

          <p>An analysis of the second episode of the TV anime "Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX" explores a surprising plot twist where Char Aznable captures the Federation's white mobile suit, Gundam. This act of seizing an enemy's weapon during battle is known as "capture" in military terms. The article speculates on the reasons behind this unexpected turn of events, highlighting the differences in character interactions and trust compared to the original "First Gundam" series. The analysis suggests that small changes in the storyline can lead to vastly different outcomes, which may be a key theme of the series.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who sought to restrict public access. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, affirming that the public has a right of access to the commons for open-air recreation, which includes camping. This decision is expected to reignite the debate over public access to land in England, where Dartmoor National Park is a rare exception to the general lack of wild camping rights on private land. The court emphasized that public regulation of land use is more effective than private challenges.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has unveiled plans for a "Golden Dome" missile defense system, aimed at countering next-generation aerial threats to the U.S., including ballistic and cruise missiles. The system would consist of advanced technologies across land, sea, and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors. The plan is partly inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, but would be much larger and designed to combat a wider range of threats, including hypersonic weapons. The initial investment is projected at $25 billion, with a total cost of $175 billion over time, although some estimates suggest it could be much higher.</p>

          <p>The charity Women in Sport is calling for urgent action from sports leaders to address the barriers that prevent young black girls from accessing and staying involved in sports. A new report indicates that black girls are less likely to participate in sports despite having higher aspirations to become elite athletes. Racism, misogyny, and inflexible sporting structures contribute to 48% of black girls "falling out of love" with sport during their teens. The charity recommends better representation, diversity training, enforcement of anti-discrimination policies, and more community initiatives to support black girls in sports.</p>

          <p>Official data reveals that UK inflation has risen to 3.5% in April, the highest rate in more than a year, primarily driven by an increase in household bills. Water, gas, and electricity prices all increased, pushing inflation above the Bank of England's target of 2%. The largest upward contributors to the rise were from "housing and household services, transport, and recreation and culture." The Bank of England expects inflation to peak at 3.7% before dropping back to its 2% target, and analysts suggest this data may impact future interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A four-bedroom house in the security zone bordering President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club has been listed for $12.5 million, marketed as a potential tear-down. The house, built in 1952, is located on Algoma Road, an area that closes to through-traffic when the president is in residence. The property is described as having a “bespoke” location with a “truly elite level of privacy” and nearby deeded beach access. The listing notes that it is the only dry lot available for sale in Palm Beach’s Estate Section and the only piece of land publicly available in the presidential security zone.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the implications of former President Biden’s metastatic prostate cancer diagnosis, coupled with concerns about his cognitive decline. The author, a geriatrician and palliative care doctor, emphasizes the importance of understanding the prognosis and planning for the future, especially for those in positions of power. While metastatic prostate cancer is treatable, it is generally not curable, and Biden's frailty makes cancer and its treatment more challenging. The article suggests that those in leadership roles have a responsibility to face the realities of aging and plan accordingly.</p>

The vaccine, originally designed for meningitis B, has shown 30-40% effectiveness against gonorrhoea, with NHS England hoping it will reverse soaring infection rates. With over 85,000 cases in 2023, the highest since 1918, this initiative aims to reduce the pressure on clinics and combat the increasing antibiotic resistance of gonorrhoea. Vaccination will start in August, offered through sexual health services, and will also include vaccines for mpox, HPV, and hepatitis.</p>

The article highlights the experiences of two graduate students who, despite the risk of losing their visas and facing detention or deportation, remain committed to advocating for Palestinian rights. One student, T, documents the protests through writing and photography, while another, F, participates in protests and feels a responsibility to take on higher risks. These students are motivated by a sense of guilt and a desire to counter right-wing narratives of the pro-Palestinian movement.</p>

          <p>As real estate agent commissions remain high, flat-fee brokers are offering an alternative for buyers and sellers looking to save money. The National Association of Realtors settled a lawsuit that has ushered in new policies, including requiring agents to inform clients that fees are negotiable. Flat-fee brokerages are gaining traction by charging a fixed amount for their services, potentially saving clients thousands of dollars. However, traditional commission-based agents argue that their higher fees are justified by the level of service and expertise they provide. (not investment advice)</p>

While the initial entreaties appeared to do little to resolve the rifts, negotiations with lawmakers from divergent factions appeared to have yielded some progress.
