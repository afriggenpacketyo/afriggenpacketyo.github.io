          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has confirmed a 7% fall in energy bills starting in July, marking the first decrease in a year for approximately 22 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales. This reduction translates to an annual saving of Â£129 for a typical household using gas and electricity, reflecting a drop in wholesale gas prices. While charities welcome the price decrease, they emphasize that many people still struggle with energy costs, owing about Â£4 billion to suppliers. Despite this summer relief, analysts anticipate little change in prices come October.</p>

          <p>BYD outsold Tesla in Europe for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in April, marking the first time the Chinese carmaker has achieved this milestone. BYD's BEV sales increased by 169% year-on-year, while Tesla's sales fell by 49%. This shift occurs despite significant tariffs imposed by the European Union on cars imported from mainland China. The rise of Chinese carmakers is contributing to the growth of BEV sales in Europe, which now account for 17% of new car registrations.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how the label "DEI hire" is used to undermine successful individuals from non-traditional backgrounds, creating a climate where prejudice can be expressed more openly. It highlights instances where people of color and women in prominent positions have faced scrutiny and doubt about their qualifications. The author argues that this taunt feeds into existing insecurities and contributes to the feeling of "impostor syndrome," particularly for those in the public eye. The piece concludes by emphasizing the need to actively combat these prejudices to prevent them from spilling into real-life conversations.</p>

          <p>President Trump hijacked a meeting with South Africaâ€™s President Cyril Ramaphosa to focus on a racist narrative of white South Africans facing genocide, despite serious issues between the two countries. Trump presented misleading video evidence and ignored Ramaphosaâ€™s attempts to discuss trade and economic relations. The meeting underscored Trump's preference for scoring points with his base over substantive diplomacy. The article argues that while Ramaphosa remained composed, Trump damaged America's standing by prioritizing theatrics over addressing real issues.</p>
