          <p>During President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, the White House announced a $600 billion investment deal with the country, including significant defense sales. Trump praised Saudi Arabia as an example for the Middle East and deepened U.S.-Saudi ties through multiple economic and defense agreements. The agreements include judicial cooperation, defense modernization, and FBI coordination, alongside billions in investments in U.S. data centers. Trump also stated his intention to normalize relations and lift sanctions on the new government in Syria, hoping for a chance at peace, while business leaders like Elon Musk and Larry Fink attended an investment summit, anticipated to result in substantial deals.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered that an outside official be appointed to oversee New York City's Rikers Island jails, citing persistent violence and dysfunction. Judge Laura Taylor Swain's ruling removes control from the city and empowers a remediation manager to make necessary changes, working with the correction commissioner but reporting directly to the court. The order comes after nearly a decade of federal oversight following a class-action lawsuit focused on curbing the use of force. Despite significant spending, conditions at Rikers have not improved, prompting this drastic measure as a last resort.</p>

The gift raises concerns about violations of the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which bars federal officials from accepting high-value gifts without congressional approval. The Trump Organization has seen an increase in activity in the Gulf region, including plans for Trump towers and golf resorts in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE. Pam Bondi, Trump's attorney general, conducted a legal analysis of the Qatar plane gift that concluded it would be legally permissible, despite her previous work as a lobbyist for the Qatari government.</p>

          <p>The Kurdish militant group PKK announced it would end its armed insurgency against Turkey, potentially impacting Syria and Iraq. The PKK's decision follows a call for disarmament by its founder, Abdullah Ocalan. The move could reassure Turkey, which views the SDF in Syria as a PKK proxy. The deal between the SDF and Damascus could be facilitated by a successful peace process between Turkey and the PKK, potentially halting Turkish attacks in Syria.</p>

          <p>Casandra Ventura, known as Cassie, testified in the racketeering and sex-trafficking case against Sean Combs, detailing years of alleged abuse and control. Ventura's lawsuit in 2023 triggered a criminal inquiry that led to the indictment, portraying Combs as the kingpin of a criminal enterprise. Prosecutors sought to portray Ventura as a brave truth-teller on a healing journey, while the defense aimed to frame her as a willing participant in a troubled romantic arrangement. Ventura's testimony will trace how years of alleged subjugation at the hands of Combs led to her descent from a promising model and pop star to a drug-dependent, struggling artist.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing scrutiny for blurring the lines between public office and personal benefits, with examples including the acceptance of a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar and the promotion of a meme cryptocurrency. The administration's plan to accept the Qatari jet and transfer it to Trump's presidential foundation after he leaves office raises ethical concerns. Critics also point to the Trump family's business deals in the Gulf region and the disbanding of a Justice Department unit dedicated to investigating cryptocurrency crimes.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's ChatGPT has gained popularity for its ability to imitate the styles of various art studios, most notably Studio Ghibli. This has raised legal and ethical questions about copyright and the potential devaluation of artists' styles. While individual works of art are protected by copyright, visual styles are not, leading to concerns about style appropriation. The article explores potential legal avenues, such as right-of-publicity complaints and false endorsement claims, and discusses the broader implications for artists and the evolution of visual aesthetics.</p>

This brings the total number of layoffs announced by the company in the past year to about 20,000, or 15% of its workforce. Falling sales in China and heavy discounting in the US have negatively impacted earnings, and a proposed merger with Honda and Mitsubishi collapsed. The company also reported an annual loss of 670 billion yen ($4.5bn; £3.4bn), with US President Donald Trump's tariffs putting further pressure on the firm.</p>

A recent agreement with China would reduce the level of U.S. taxes on Chinese goods, while a trade agreement with the United Kingdom will cut tariffs on U.K. cars and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum.
