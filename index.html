          <p>President Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is scheduled to travel to Moscow this week for what is being described as a final attempt to secure a ceasefire in Ukraine. The visit comes as a 10-day ultimatum issued by the U.S. to Russia is set to expire, with the White House threatening significant sanctions if a deal is not reached. While the Kremlin has expressed openness to the talks, Ukrainian officials are urging Western partners to apply stronger pressure on Moscow. Analysts remain skeptical about the potential for a breakthrough or the imposition of severe secondary sanctions on Russia's key energy customers.</p>

          <p>China's central bank is intensifying efforts to promote the yuan as a global currency, citing growing concerns over the stability of the U.S. dollar as an opportunity for expansion. The bank has outlined plans to increase the yuan's role in international trade and finance, strengthen offshore markets, and enhance its Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). This renewed focus on internationalization, marked by a dedicated section in the central bank's midyear meeting summary for the first time in three years, signals a strategic push to establish the yuan as a more significant player in the global financial system.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old child tragically died following an incident at The Boardwalk water park, located within Hersheypark in Pennsylvania. The event occurred in the park's 378,000-gallon wave pool, which was subsequently closed out of respect for the victim's family. Lifeguards responded immediately and performed life-saving measures before the child was transported to a medical center, where they were pronounced dead. A subsequent police review determined the drowning was not the result of criminal activity and that the park was upholding its safety standards, with ten certified lifeguards monitoring the pool at the time.</p>

In her resignation letter, she emphasized the demanding nature of her role and her wish not to miss more of her daughter's early years. Swinney praised her invaluable contribution to public life and confirmed she will continue in her government role until the election.</p>

          <p>A recent survey of 1,000 Americans reveals the deep emotional connection people have with their pets, with some bonds extending into hypothetical romance. Following a viral trend where AI reimagines pets as people, 31% of owners said they would be willing to date the human version of their animal companion. The survey also highlighted that many people find more emotional support from their pets than from human relationships, with 77% stating their pet provides better support than an ex-partner. This strong attachment influences major life decisions, including housing, vacation planning, and romantic partnerships.</p>

          <p>Dozens of Democratic state legislators have fled Texas to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to vote on a controversial new congressional map. The GOP-led redistricting effort, part of a special session, aims to create districts that would more heavily favor Republican candidates in future elections. Democrats argue the maps are a gerrymandered power grab and are using the walkout to halt the legislative process, stating they will not allow disaster relief funds to be held hostage to the plan. In response, Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have the absent lawmakers removed from their elected positions.</p>

Some workers who accepted the arrangement feel they were exploited, having to perform labor while waiting to be put on the payroll.

          <p>This article critiques the current state of advertising on streaming services, arguing that the implementation is far worse than traditional television commercials. While ad-supported tiers have become common, the viewer experience is marred by low-quality spots, frequent repetition of the same ad, and disruptive placement that often interrupts scenes mid-dialogue. This is especially problematic for shows and movies not originally designed for commercial breaks. The author suggests that this poor execution creates a frustrating, brainwashing-like effect that could ultimately drive viewers away and undermine the very purpose of advertising.</p>

The book details how critic-turned-producer Jon Landau was pivotal in shaping the album, including refining the classic song "Thunder Road."

Data indicates a decline in travelers from Southern California, who constitute a major portion of Vegas visitors, as evidenced by a 4.3% decrease in traffic on Interstate 15. The slump is also attributed to a nationwide downturn in international tourism, with fewer visitors from key markets like Canada and Mexico. Despite the lower foot traffic, Las Vegas casinos have continued to see increased profits, with Clark County's gambling revenue up 3.5% for the same period.</p>

          <p>In a move likely to antagonize Beijing, India and the Philippines have conducted their first-ever joint naval exercises in the disputed South China Sea. The two-day patrol involved three Indian naval vessels and two Filipino frigates, underscoring a deepening of military cooperation between the two nations. The exercises coincide with a state visit by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos to New Delhi. The Philippines has been actively strengthening alliances in response to a series of confrontations with China, which claims nearly the entirety of the strategically vital waterway and reportedly shadowed the joint patrol.</p>

          <p>India is in a difficult position following President Trump's threat of a "penalty" for its continued importation of discounted Russian oil. Since the Ukraine war began, Russia has become India's top oil supplier, a trade that New Delhi officials appear reluctant to abandon, citing market prices and global conditions. The U.S. threat marks a reversal from the previous administration's more tolerant stance, which had tacitly encouraged the purchases to stabilize global prices. Analysts suggest India must now weigh the economic benefits of cheap Russian crude against the risk of U.S. tariffs and other penalties (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A devastating shipwreck in the Gulf of Aden has resulted in the deaths of at least 76 people, with dozens more still missing. The boat was carrying approximately 157 migrants, mostly from Ethiopia, when it sank off the coast of Yemen's Abyan governorate. This route, known as the "Eastern Route," is a perilous journey for migrants hoping to find work in wealthy Gulf states, despite the ongoing civil war in Yemen. This latest tragedy highlights the extreme dangers faced by migrants, including human trafficking and abuse, on one of the world's busiest and most hazardous migration corridors.</p>

          <p>A group of approximately 600 retired Israeli security officials, including former heads of the Mossad and Shin Bet intelligence agencies, has appealed to U.S. President Donald Trump to pressure Israel into ending the war in Gaza.

The appeal comes amid reports that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may expand military operations, a move that could further strain relations with allies as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens, with widespread deprivation and deaths from malnutrition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of African leaders and elites seeking medical care overseas is drawing renewed scrutiny to the underfunding of public healthcare systems across the continent. This article explores how a lack of specialized treatments, poorly equipped local hospitals, and an over-reliance on foreign aid contribute to this medical tourism. Despite a 2001 pledge by African Union members to allocate 15% of their national budgets to healthcare, most countries fall short of this target. This chronic underinvestment results in a cycle where those in power seek treatment abroad while local populations face inadequate medical infrastructure.</p>

A senior engineer from the Chinese Academy of Engineering provided a rare positive update on the engine's development.

          <p>Several former employees of Huawei's chip design subsidiary, HiSilicon, have been sentenced to jail for intellectual property theft in a case that has highlighted corporate espionage within China's competitive tech sector. A former researcher, Zhang Kun, left Huawei in 2019 and later founded a rival start-up, Zunpai, to develop Wi-Fi chips, persuading some of his former colleagues to join him. Huawei took swift legal action, applying to freeze millions in assets belonging to the new company.

While states like Georgia already have a program, others were pursuing unique rules, some stricter and some more lenient than the new federal standard. Health policy experts suggest the federal law now sets both the "floor and ceiling" for these requirements, potentially nullifying state-specific proposals.

U.S. export controls have inadvertently created an opportunity for Chinese firms to grow. Furthermore, Nvidia is now facing scrutiny from Beijing's cyberspace regulators over national security concerns, adding another layer of complexity to its operations in the crucial market.</p>
