          <p>A federal judge has overturned a Trump administration order that had stopped construction on the Revolution Wind project off the New England coast. The Danish company Orsted will resume work on the nearly completed farm, which is expected to power over 350,000 homes. This ruling represents a significant setback for the administration's efforts to curtail the offshore wind industry, which it has criticized as being too expensive and unreliable, creating a contentious environment for renewable energy projects.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral front-runner Zohran Mamdani has canceled his appearance at a WABC town hall to protest the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. Mamdani stated his withdrawal is a response to corporate leaders prioritizing their bottom line over press freedom following pressure from the Trump administration. The controversy stems from ABC's decision to take "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air indefinitely after the host's monologue about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, sparking a nationwide debate on free speech.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Trump intends to sign an executive order designating Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization as soon as it is drafted. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated this action is part of a broader effort to address what the administration describes as political violence from left-leaning groups. However, this move faces legal challenges, as current federal law does not have a mechanism for formally labeling U.S.-based organizations as domestic terrorist groups, raising questions about the order's implementation and legal standing.</p>

          <p>The White House has detailed a plan to move TikTok's U.S. operations into a new American-based joint venture to mitigate national security risks. This new entity would feature a majority of U.S. investors and board members, with software company Oracle managing top-to-bottom security, including oversight of the app's powerful algorithm. While the administration expressed confidence that China has approved the framework, Beijing has not publicly confirmed the deal, leaving the future of the popular social media app's 170 million U.S. users pending final agreements.</p>

          <p>The White House has firmly denied reports that border czar Tom Homan accepted $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents in an alleged bribery sting operation. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed the allegations, asserting that Homan never took the money and characterizing the situation as a politically motivated entrapment attempt by the Justice Department. The now-closed investigation reportedly centered on whether Homan accepted the cash in exchange for promising to help secure government contracts if Donald Trump were re-elected.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates on a downward trend and the possibility of another Federal Reserve rate cut in October, prospective homebuyers are advised to prepare strategically. Key steps include getting a mortgage pre-approval after checking one's credit report to demonstrate financial readiness to sellers. Additionally, researching and selecting an experienced real estate agent can provide a competitive edge in a potentially more crowded market. Comparing lenders and their terms now will also position buyers to act quickly and effectively when rates drop. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive analysis of 25 studies has found that while interventions aimed at reducing partisan animosity can produce small positive effects, these changes typically fade within two weeks. The research suggests that individual-focused approaches, such as correcting misperceptions about political opponents, are not a long-term solution for the deep political divides in the U.S. Instead, the authors argue that lasting change will require systemic shifts that alter the incentives for political and media figures who often fuel partisan conflict.</p>

          <p>Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, helps retirees cover out-of-pocket costs not paid by Original Medicare, but premiums vary widely based on location, plan type, and personal factors. In 2025, monthly premiums can range from as low as $32 for high-deductible plans to over $550 for comprehensive coverage, with most beneficiaries paying between $90 and $300 per month. To secure lower costs, experts advise enrolling when first eligible to avoid penalties for pre-existing conditions and carefully comparing plans from different insurers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump in September 2024, has rested his defense case after just a few hours. Representing himself, Routh called only three witnesses, including a former Marine sniper to serve as a gun expert. Federal prosecutors had previously spent seven days presenting their case with 38 witnesses. Throughout the proceedings, the judge repeatedly admonished Routh for not following judicial rules, and he ultimately chose not to testify in his own defense before the trial moved to closing arguments.</p>
