          <h2>China's Energy-Storage Sector Faces Challenges Amid Price War and Tariff Pressures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 21:30:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's energy-storage industry is grappling with challenges due to the US-China trade war and reduced government support, leading to concerns about price competition. Consultancy WaterRock Energy Economics projects a potential 10-20% decrease in capital expenditure by Chinese producers, which may result in a contraction of annual battery energy-storage systems (BESS) expansion to as low as 30 gigawatts (GW) this year, down from 42GW in 2024. BESS prices are expected to continue falling in the local market, and producers will need to focus on cultivating non-US markets to offset the impact of higher tariffs. This comes after a period of rapid capacity growth and intense price rivalry in China's energy-storage sector.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in New Jersey's Ocean County has led to mandatory evacuations for some homes in Ocean Township, Lakewood, and Lacey Township, with the fire starting at the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area. As of Tuesday evening, the fire had spread across approximately 3,200 acres and was 5% contained, threatening 1,320 structures and causing the evacuation of 3,000 people. Numerous road closures were implemented, and Jersey Central Power & Light reported over 25,000 customers without power due to the fire, with officials deploying a helicopter and a plane to drop water on the blaze; so far, there were no reported injuries.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., announced a plan to phase out synthetic food dyes due to concerns about their impact on children's health, citing studies linking them to ADHD and other conditions. The FDA will work with the industry to voluntarily eliminate six commonly used dyes by the end of next year and ban two others, Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B. However, the Consumer Brands Association defended the safety of current ingredients, and some experts caution that voluntary agreements may not be reliable, making the future of this initiative uncertain.</p>

          <p>While China faces declining birth rates, Guangdong province, particularly the Chaoshan region, stands out with a consistently higher birth rate.

Cultural traditions in regions like Chaoshan, where ancestral halls are common and lineage is highly valued, contribute to the preference for larger families.

          <h2>Supreme Court Leans Towards Siding with Parents on Opt-Outs for LGBTQ+ Storybooks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court appears likely to require a Maryland school board to allow parents to opt their children out of instruction featuring storybooks addressing gender identity and sexual orientation. The case involves a dispute between families and the Montgomery County Board of Education over whether the school's policy unconstitutionally burdens parents' First Amendment right to religious freedom. The court's conservative majority expressed skepticism about the board's decision to eliminate opt-outs, with justices questioning the feasibility and rationale behind denying parents the ability to excuse their children from instruction that violates their religious beliefs.</p>

          <p>Orange County Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Ferguson was convicted of second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of his wife, Sheryl Ferguson, in their Anaheim Hills home. The shooting occurred during an argument, and Ferguson claimed it was an accident, but prosecutors argued that he intentionally shot his wife. Ferguson's first trial ended in a hung jury, but the second jury reached a guilty verdict after just a day of deliberations. He faces 40 years to life in prison and will be formally removed from the bench after a review by the state Commission on Judicial Performance.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported a 20% drop in automotive revenue in its first-quarter earnings report, missing Wall Street estimates, with net income plummeting 71%. CEO Elon Musk has spent much of his time in President Donald Trump's White House, overseeing an effort to downsize the federal government. The president's sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production. Tesla refrained from promising growth this year and said it will "revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update."</p>

          <p>Archaeologists are confounded by a medieval cemetery near Cardiff Airport, where nearly all skeletons are women buried with unusual artifacts. The site, dating to the 6th or 7th Century, has revealed that the women's bones show signs of heavy manual labor, yet also signs of wealth and luxury. Another unexpected find was a woman tossed in a ditch, contrasting with the careful burials of others. Artifacts, including pottery shards and fine, etched glass likely imported from the Levant, suggest a community of significant status.</p>

          <p>Lori Daybell, already convicted of murdering two of her children, has been found guilty of conspiring with her brother to kill her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, in Arizona. Prosecutors argued that Daybell orchestrated the shooting to collect Vallow's $1 million life insurance policy and be with her current husband, Chad Daybell. The jury was swayed by text messages revealing Daybell's motives and her invocation of religious beliefs to justify the murder. Daybell, who represented herself in the trial, faces another life sentence and is also accused of conspiring to kill her niece's ex-husband.</p>

The charges include scheme to defraud and grand larceny, with the alleged crimes occurring between June 2021 and March 2024.
