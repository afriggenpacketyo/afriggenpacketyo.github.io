          <p>Despite President Trump's push for increased oil and gas production, the oil industry is facing significant challenges, including falling oil prices and economic uncertainty, according to a CNBC article. Oilfield service firms like Baker Hughes, Halliburton, and SLB are warning of slowed investment in exploration and production due to these factors. Executives have criticized Trump's policies, citing uncertainty as a major concern. SLB's CEO noted that tariffs are causing economic uncertainty that could hurt demand. The article notes that the North American petroleum market is particularly sensitive to commodity prices, leading to downside risk for onshore oil production in the U.S.</p>

          <p>House Education and Workforce Committee Republicans have released a plan to overhaul the student loan and financial aid system, proposing limits on student borrowing and fewer repayment options. The GOP measure, called the Student Success and Taxpayer Savings Plan, aims to facilitate the passage of President Trump's tax cuts. Consumer advocates have warned that these measures could worsen the affordability crisis for families paying for college. The proposal includes restrictions on financial aid programs and the elimination of consumer protections. Critics argue that the plan would limit college access and make it harder to repay student loan debt.</p>

          <p>Pfizer announced an expansion of its cost-cutting efforts, projecting an additional $1.2 billion in savings by the end of 2027, primarily through enhanced digital enablement and streamlining business processes, according to a CNBC article. This is in addition to a previous cost-cutting program expected to save $4.5 billion by the end of 2025. The pharmaceutical giant reported first-quarter profits that exceeded estimates, despite a fall in sales due to declining revenue from its Covid antiviral pill, Paxlovid. CEO Albert Bourla noted that uncertainty around Trump's pharmaceutical tariffs is deterring the company from further investing in U.S. manufacturing and research and development.</p>

          <p>Irish rap group Kneecap has issued an apology for remarks made at their concerts, denying support for Hamas and Hezbollah. The apology follows criticism and police investigation into video footage where a band member appeared to shout support for the designated terrorist groups. The group also apologized to the families of murdered British lawmakers for previous comments calling for the death of Conservative politicians. Kneecap faced scrutiny for displaying pro-Palestinian messages, including "F**k Israel," at Coachella.

          <p>The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has seen a mass departure of attorneys, with over 100 resigning following a shift in priorities under the Trump administration. Newly confirmed official Harmeet Dhillon stated that the division's focus would move away from enforcing voting rights laws and addressing unconstitutional policing, towards culture war issues favored by President Trump. The department has recently announced legal action against states permitting transgender athletes in girls' sports, withdrew from a lawsuit against Georgia's voting laws, and formed a task force to investigate "anti-Christian bias".

          <p>Amazon has denied reports that it planned to display tariff costs next to product prices, leading to a heated response from the White House. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt initially criticized the move as a "hostile and political act." However, an Amazon spokesperson clarified that the idea was only considered for Amazon Haul, its budget-focused shopping section, and was never approved. The Trump administration's tariffs have raised concerns about rising prices for American consumers. The article notes that the Washington Post declined to endorse a presidential candidate last year after its editorial page editor had approved an endorsement for Trump's rival, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.</p>
