          <p>President Trump visited Kerrville, Texas, to survey the catastrophic damage from recent flash floods that have claimed at least 120 lives and left over 160 people missing. The disaster was caused by the Guadalupe River rising 26 feet in just 45 minutes, devastating communities and a local summer camp where many children died. Standing with local officials, the president expressed the nation's anguish and pledged federal support for the rebuilding efforts. The visit highlights the immense scale of the tragedy as search and rescue operations continue for the scores of people still unaccounted for.</p>

          <p>A judge has allowed a lawsuit from New Hampshire against TikTok to proceed, which alleges the platform uses manipulative and addictive design features to exploit its young users. The state's case claims these features are intended to maximize engagement for commercial gain, potentially harming children's well-being. This ruling is part of a broader legal trend where states are targeting the design and safety policies of tech companies rather than user-generated content. TikTok has defended its safety protections, calling the lawsuit's claims outdated and cherry-picked.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is facing criticism over his government's handling of trade negotiations with the U.S. after President Trump threatened a new 35% tariff on Canadian goods. Despite Carney's initial tough stance, some commentators question whether recent concessions, like scrapping a digital services tax, have been effective in deterring U.S. protectionism. The article explores the intense political pressure on Carney to secure a fair deal while navigating an unpredictable U.S. administration, leaving the future of the trade relationship uncertain.</p>

          <p>Philanthropist Bill Gates has condemned the Trump administration's decision to cut funding and effectively shutter the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), calling the effects "entirely preventable." Gates highlighted alarming reports from aid workers describing critical shortages of HIV medication for children and other essential supplies in Africa. He argued that it is not too late to reverse the cuts, which are part of a broader rollback of U.S. commitments to global health initiatives like PEPFAR and the vaccine group Gavi.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has warned that his country will impose reciprocal tariffs on U.S. goods if President Trump follows through on a threat to levy a 50% import tax. Trump's threat is directly linked to the criminal trial of his political ally and former Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, a move critics are calling an unprecedented attempt to interfere in another nation's domestic judicial affairs. This development raises the risk of a serious trade war between the two largest economies in the Americas.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has reached her first Grand Slam final at Wimbledon, a remarkable comeback just two years after she took an indefinite break from the sport due to burnout and mental health struggles.

Her journey back to the top, culminating in a final against Iga Swiatek, is a powerful story of prioritizing well-being and proving that a return to elite form is possible after a hiatus.</p>
