          <p>The Marks & Spencer website is currently down, preventing users from browsing, as the retailer continues to address the fallout from a cyber-attack that occurred last month. Customers have been unable to place online orders for several weeks, and the company anticipates that its online services will remain disrupted until July, with a gradual return to normal operations. M&S estimates that the cyber-attack will negatively impact this year's profits by approximately £300 million, a significant financial blow to the retailer.

          <p>President Trump's tax and spending bill has advanced to a House vote after clearing a procedural hurdle, despite deep divisions among Republicans. The bill extends Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, creates new breaks, ends green-energy subsidies, and increases spending on military and immigration enforcement. It offsets these changes by tightening eligibility for food and health programs, potentially impacting millions of low-income Americans. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $3.8 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, raising concerns about the nation's fiscal health. The article provides an overview of the bill's key provisions and the political challenges it faces in Congress.</p>

          <p>Two Israeli Embassy staff members were killed in a shooting near the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The victims, a man and a woman, were shot at close range, and initial reports suggest the incident may have been a targeted attack, as one source claims the shooter yelled "free Palestine" prior to the shooting. Law enforcement has a suspect in custody, and the FBI is working with Metropolitan police on the investigation. Officials have stated that there is no ongoing threat to public safety, but the incident has prompted concerns about antisemitism and security.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has launched a revamped gasoline subsidy aimed at lowering prices by 10 yen per liter to alleviate cost-of-living pressures on consumers. Under the new scheme, the government will provide a fixed subsidy to wholesalers regardless of current prices, with the goal of reducing the wholesale gasoline price by 7.40 yen per liter in the first week and then by at least 1 yen weekly until it reaches 10 yen lower by mid-June.

JPMorgan has also upgraded EM equities due to thawing U.S.-China trade relations and attractive valuations.

The 5,000-ton destroyer suffered damage to its bottom due to a loss of balance during the launch, leaving the bow unable to exit the shipway. Kim declared the incident a "criminal act caused by absolute carelessness" and vowed to hold officials accountable, ordering repairs to be completed before June. The rare public disclosure of the accident follows the unveiling of another destroyer-class vessel last month.</p>

          <p>Immigration continues to be a significant and divisive issue in UK politics, with the Labour government elected last year on a manifesto promising to reduce migration. Figures released on Thursday are expected to show a fall in net migration to the UK, which Sir Keir Starmer will likely hail as an early success. However, politicians have long struggled to assuage public concerns over immigration, and the issue is still likely to dog the Labour government. The article explores the historical context of immigration debates in the UK and the challenges faced by successive governments in addressing public concerns.</p>
