          <p>Devastating flash floods have struck the Hill Country region of central Texas, resulting in a mass casualty event with at least 24 fatalities confirmed. The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes, causing widespread destruction. An extensive search and rescue operation is underway for 23 to 25 people who remain unaccounted for, many of whom are children from a local summer camp. Officials have declared a disaster as hundreds of responders, supported by helicopters and drones, continue to search the area.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are not expected to change their trade deadline plans following an injury to third baseman Max Muncy. While the initial injury appeared severe, tests revealed only a bone bruise with no structural damage, and he is expected to return in about six weeks. Given the positive prognosis and the time remaining before the playoffs, the team feels confident relying on internal options to fill his position. This avoids the need for an urgent, high-cost trade to replace the productive infielder.</p>

          <p>Several beaches in the Far Rockaway area of Queens, New York, were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple sharks were spotted swimming dangerously close to beachgoers. City officials utilized drone technology to monitor the sharks' activity and ensure public safety, closing one section for about an hour. The incident occurred amid heightened surveillance of shark activity along New York's coastline during the busy holiday weekend, with no injuries reported and beaches subsequently reopened.</p>

          <p>A Connecticut law is drawing criticism for allowing towing companies to sell impounded vehicles just 15 days after they are towed. Critics argue the law is predatory and disproportionately affects working-class residents who cannot quickly afford the hundreds of dollars in fees to retrieve their cars. The article highlights the practices of one company, MyHoopty.com, which residents accuse of aggressively targeting their neighborhoods to profit from the rapid vehicle sales.</p>

This natural process effectively locks away as much planet-warming carbon as the annual emissions of 55 million cars, playing a much larger role in climate regulation than previously understood.</p>

          <p>Germany secured a victory in their opening match of the Women's Euro 2025 tournament, defeating Poland with goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. However, the win was marred by a potentially serious knee injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the field in tears during the first half. The injury to the key player, who has a history of two prior ACL tears, raises significant concerns for Germany's prospects in the rest of the tournament.</p>

          <h2>Trump Executive Order Increases National Park Fees for Foreign Tourists and Ends DEI Initiatives</h2>

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order that will raise entry fees for international visitors to U.S. national parks. The order also mandates preferential treatment for U.S. residents in park access lotteries and revokes an Obama-era memorandum that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in public land management. This move aligns with the administration's broader policy of dismantling DEI programs across the federal government, with revenue from higher fees directed to infrastructure.</p>
