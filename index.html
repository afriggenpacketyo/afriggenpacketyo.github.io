          <p>Ford Motor exceeded third-quarter earnings expectations, reporting a net income of $2.4 billion. However, the company has lowered its 2025 financial guidance, anticipating a significant impact from a fire at a key aluminum supplier's plant. The disruption is expected to cost between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, primarily affecting the production of its profitable large trucks and SUVs. Ford plans to mitigate these losses by increasing production once the supply chain stabilizes and has announced the addition of 1,000 workers to support this effort. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo, an independent candidate, in the race to succeed him. The endorsement comes just before the start of early voting and represents a significant political reconciliation between the two former rivals. Adams framed the decision as a necessary step to prevent Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani from winning, calling Mamdani an "existential threat" to the city. The move consolidates the moderate political establishment against the progressive candidate in a contentious three-way race.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: China's Export Controls on Rare Earths Are a Direct Response to U.S. Trade Policies</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that China's recent tightening of export controls on rare earth minerals should be viewed as a direct reaction to aggressive U.S. trade policies. The author contends that the Trump administration's escalating series of tariffs, blacklistings, and sanctions against Chinese companies provided Beijing with both the justification and the blueprint for using such economic leverage. Rather than being a hostile or unprovoked action, China's move is presented as a predictable form of blowback in the ongoing trade conflict. The policy highlights the strategic use of critical resources in international economic disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Duckworth are being criticized for not commenting on a progressive Senate candidate in Maine, Graham Platner, who previously had a Nazi-style "Totenkopf" symbol tattooed on his chest. The scrutiny arises because both senators had previously been vocal critics of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's tattoos, which have Christian crusader symbolism. Platner, who has since covered the tattoo, claims he got it without knowing its historical meaning during a night of drinking while in the Marine Corps. The article highlights a perceived double standard in how political figures are responding to controversial symbols.</p>

          <p>The debut of new Rangers head coach Danny Rohl was marked by a comprehensive defeat to Norwegian club Brann in a European competition. The performance highlighted persistent issues within the team, including defensive frailties and a lack of attacking threat. The article suggests the collapse in the club's standards has been stark, with players appearing to lack both ability and character. Despite significant financial investment in the squad, the team's performance has worsened, presenting an immense challenge for the new manager to overcome.</p>

          <h2>Recent Drop in Gold Prices Prompts Questions About Purchasing from Retailers like Costco</h2>

          <p>Following a rare and significant single-day drop in the price of gold, consumers are evaluating whether it is a good time to buy the precious metal from large retailers like Costco. The article suggests that buying gold during a price dip is generally a sound strategy, as such declines are often temporary. Costco offers a convenient and potentially more transparent way to purchase physical gold bullion compared to traditional dealers, often with no shipping costs for members. However, sales are final, requiring buyers to be certain of their investment decision before purchasing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent Israeli military strikes in Lebanon, including an attack on an alleged Hezbollah training camp and the targeted killing of a commander, are fueling concerns of a renewed conflict. These actions come eleven months after a fragile ceasefire was brokered to end a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah. Both sides accuse the other of violating the agreement's terms, which included Hezbollah's disarmament and an Israeli withdrawal, neither of which has fully materialized. The ongoing violence and political stalemate threaten Lebanon's stability and have led to hundreds of deaths since the ceasefire began.</p>

          <p>Home equity loan interest rates have fallen to an average of 8.11% for a five-year term, their lowest point in nearly two years, presenting an opportunity for homeowners. This rate is significantly lower than alternatives like personal loans or credit cards, making it a more cost-effective way to borrow large sums. While the Federal Reserve is expected to make minor rate cuts, the impact on home equity rates will likely be minimal, suggesting that waiting may not yield much benefit.

          <p>Rivian, the electric truck and SUV manufacturer, is laying off more than 600 workers, or about 4.5% of its workforce, as it contends with a challenging market. The decision reflects a broader slowdown in EV demand, which has been exacerbated by the expiration of federal tax credits and increased auto tariffs under the Trump administration. In a memo to employees, CEO RJ Scaringe cited the "changing operating backdrop" as the reason for the restructuring. The company is now focusing on conserving cash and scaling efficiently as it prepares to launch a more affordable vehicle model next year.</p>

His family and advocates claim there is little evidence, and that he confessed only after being beaten and threatened by Israeli soldiers. The case has gained urgency after his 20-year-old cousin was beaten to death by settlers in a separate incident earlier this year.</p>

The book, which chronicles the author's journey of self-discovery with gender and sexuality, has become the most banned book in the United States amid a politically charged climate hostile to LGBTQ+ topics. The new hardcover edition will feature commentary from Kobabe, as well as notes and reactions from other comic creators, scholars, and even individuals who appear as characters in the book.

          <p>The U.S. government is set to release its delayed September inflation report, with economists forecasting that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.1% annually, its highest level since May 2024. The data release was postponed due to the government shutdown but is proceeding because it is needed to calculate the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security benefits. Economists attribute part of the renewed inflation to the Trump administration's tariffs, with a portion of those costs being passed on to consumers. The Social Security COLA is expected to be around 2.7%. (not investment advice)</p>
