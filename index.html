        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's removal of the de minimis exemption has eliminated duty-free status for 92% of US cargo shipments, impacting up to 4 million packages daily. Imported goods under $800 are now subject to duties, a significant shift from the last decade of global e-commerce. Customs experts warn of substantial troubles for small to medium-sized businesses, which may face increased costs and administrative burdens, potentially leading to higher consumer prices and shipping delays. Many international postal services have already suspended US-bound shipments, creating global confusion and supply chain disruptions.</p>

          <p>China's military parade next month, commemorating victory over Japan in World War II, will offer rare insights into the People’s Liberation Army’s leadership. The identities of generals in prominent roles will signal potential promotions, while absences may indicate those affected by the ongoing anti-corruption campaign, which has already seen 16 military deputies removed from the National People’s Congress since March 2023. This event serves as a crucial, albeit indirect, method for outsiders to observe the internal dynamics and personnel shifts within the secretive PLA top brass.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that US Ambassador David Perdue is expected to skip China's upcoming military parade in Beijing, joining a coordinated effort by Western missions to opt out of the grand event. The parade, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, faces diplomatic pressure from Western nations. This anticipated absence highlights ongoing geopolitical tensions and a reluctance by some international powers to legitimize or endorse China's military displays, underscoring a broader diplomatic stance regarding China's global position and military assertiveness. The US embassy has not yet commented on the matter.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US retirement system received a C+ rating from the Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index, ranking 29th out of 48 global systems, largely due to its reliance on voluntary 401(k)-style plans. Unlike countries like the Netherlands and Australia, which mandate contributions, the US system faces significant risk from insufficient coverage. Experts suggest mandatory contributions or easier enrollment could substantially improve its standing, especially as people live longer and fewer workers contribute. This article highlights the structural differences in global retirement funding and the challenges faced by the American model. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Minneapolis Authorities Detail Shooter's Motive in Church School Attack</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minneapolis authorities have revealed the motive behind the Annunciation Catholic Church shooting, stating the perpetrator, Robin Westman, sought notoriety and harbored a "deranged fascination" with previous mass shootings. Police Chief Brian O’Hara indicated the shooter's disturbing writings expressed hatred towards various groups, including Black, Mexican, Christian, and Jewish people, with an obsession for killing children. The attack, which left two children dead and 18 injured, had no specific grievance against the church, despite the shooter's mother having worked there. This incident draws parallels to other mass shootings where perpetrators study their predecessors.</p>

          <p>Yanni Gentsch, a 30-year-old German jogger, confronted a man filming her backside, sparking a viral movement and a petition to change German law.

Gentsch's petition, "Make voyeuristic recordings a crime," demands an amendment to the German Criminal Code, arguing the current framework protects perpetrators. Her initiative has ignited a national conversation, highlighting the prevalence of sexual harassment in public spaces and advocating for legal reform to better protect victims.</p>

          <p>Alibaba reported better-than-expected net income in the June quarter, surging 78% due to gains in equity investments and the disposal of Trendyol, despite revenue falling short of forecasts. Its cloud computing division was a bright spot, with revenue up 26% year-on-year, driven by robust AI demand and triple-digit growth in AI-related product revenue. While its core e-commerce revenue grew, adjusted earnings fell due to heavy investments in the competitive "instant commerce" space. Alibaba balances AI innovation with market competition, showing a 40% stock rally this year. (not investment advice)</p>

While consumers value free returns, retailers are tightening policies and shortening return windows to mitigate significant costs, which reached an estimated $890 billion in 2024.
