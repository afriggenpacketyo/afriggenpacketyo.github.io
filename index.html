            <p>John Henry Anderson, a 19th-century Scottish magician, significantly influenced Harry Houdini, despite their never meeting. Known as "The Great Wizard of the North," Anderson was among the first to pull a live rabbit from a top hat and achieved international fame. Houdini, upon visiting Aberdeen, Scotland, paid for the upkeep of Anderson's grave, acknowledging his predecessor's impact. As the Aberdeen Magical Society approaches its centenary, Anderson's story is being retold, highlighting Scotland's less-known contribution to the world of magic. The article emphasizes Anderson's innovative self-promotion and showmanship, qualities that Houdini admired and emulated.</p>
