          <p>Tropical Depression Barry made landfall near Tampico, Mexico, bringing maximum sustained winds of 35 mph. The system, which was briefly the second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, is expected to weaken as it moves inland. However, forecasters have issued a tropical storm warning, anticipating heavy rainfall of three to six inches, with isolated totals up to ten inches across several Mexican states. This significant precipitation poses a high risk of flooding and mudslides in the region over the next couple of days, even as the storm dissipates over land.</p>

          <p>A report from Dessau, in eastern Germany, highlights a troubling trend of rising right-wing extremism and nationalism among the youth, where Nazi-related slogans and symbols are becoming part of a "cool" pop culture. This phenomenon is linked to a broader radicalization of young people across the region, fueled by historical economic struggles post-reunification despite significant investment. The city, known for its Bauhaus legacy, now grapples with a history of racist violence and the election of a far-right mayor with a neo-Nazi past. Despite this, local civic groups and some young people are actively confronting the hostility and hate.</p>

          <p>China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) registered 49.7 in June, marking the third straight month of contraction, although it was a slight improvement from May's 49.5. This indicates ongoing struggles in the industrial sector despite government stimulus efforts, with inventory and employment levels continuing to decline. The data reflects a challenging economic environment characterized by a supply glut, sluggish consumer demand, and persistent deflationary pressures. While the non-manufacturing sector showed slight growth, economists remain cautious about the outlook for the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has announced an immediate but conditional resumption of seafood imports from certain regions of Japan, partially reversing a comprehensive ban. The measure excludes aquatic products from ten Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima, where the ban was originally imposed in July 2023. Beijing had initially suspended imports from these areas before Japan began releasing treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant. The full import ban on all Japanese seafood was enacted a month later, making this partial lift a notable, albeit limited, development in bilateral trade relations.</p>

The 3% levy would have applied retroactively to the revenue of large domestic and foreign tech companies, including U.S. giants like Google and Amazon. Canadian officials stated the move was made in anticipation of a comprehensive trade arrangement with the United States.

The deal is expected to unleash pent-up demand for UK-made vehicles, though the lower duty only applies to a quota of 100,000 cars annually. While the auto industry welcomes the relief, British farmers express concern that agricultural concessions, such as tariff-free quotas for US beef and ethanol, were used as bargaining chips. Negotiations are still ongoing to secure zero tariffs for the UK steel industry. (not investment advice)</p>

The protest movement, which has been ongoing for months, was initially sparked by a deadly train station roof collapse in November 2024, an incident widely attributed to government corruption.

The author argues that Moscow's failure to provide significant military or diplomatic support to Tehran during its conflict with Israel reveals a pattern of strategic neglect. This decline in influence is attributed to Russia being overextended and weakened by its ongoing war in Ukraine. The piece suggests that Russia's inability to stand up for its partners in Iran, Syria, and Armenia has severely crippled its credibility on the world stage.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is debating a massive legislative package, described by President Trump as his "big, beautiful bill," with crucial votes expected Monday. The bill, which passed narrowly in the House, combines increased spending on border security and defense with cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over ten years. Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to bypass the need for Democratic support, though they can only afford to lose three votes from their own party to ensure its passage.</p>

          <p>The arrest of two elementary school teachers in Japan for allegedly taking and sharing indecent photos of young girls in a private social media group has sparked public concern. The two men are accused of taking voyeuristic images and posting them to a group chat that included around eight other individuals, also believed to be teachers. The case came to light during an investigation into another teacher in the group who was arrested for a separate offense. This incident has raised serious questions about child safety in schools and the effectiveness of current vetting and monitoring systems for educators.</p>

          <p>Two people were killed in a high-speed crash on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Montgomery County on Sunday, which authorities believe was the result of street racing. The two deceased individuals were the drivers of the vehicles suspected of racing. The cars reportedly lost control and crashed near an interchange ramp in Upper Moreland Township. A third vehicle was also involved, with its two occupants sustaining minor injuries after colliding with one of the crashed cars. The incident led to the temporary closure of the eastbound lanes of the turnpike as an investigation began.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Investigate Why Electric Vehicles May Induce More Motion Sickness</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly their regenerative braking systems, are a likely cause. This system, which recovers kinetic energy to charge the battery, results in low-frequency deceleration that can provoke queasiness and discomfort in passengers. Chinese researchers are exploring potential solutions to mitigate this issue as the country continues its rapid transition to new energy transportation.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not run for reelection in 2026, citing a desire to move away from Washington's "political theatre and partisan gridlock." His announcement came shortly after President Trump criticized him for not supporting a major Republican spending bill and threatened to back a primary challenger against him. In his statement, Tillis lamented that leaders willing to embrace bipartisanship and compromise are becoming an "endangered species." His retirement will open up a key Senate seat in a state that has trended Republican in recent presidential elections.</p>

          <p>Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), stated that recent U.S. airstrikes inflicted "severe damage" on Iran's nuclear facilities but did not result in their total destruction. He emphasized that Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to restart its program if it chooses to do so. Grossi's assessment appears to counter more absolute claims from U.S. officials about the program's obliteration and raises questions about the long-term effectiveness of the military action. He stressed the urgent need for IAEA inspectors to regain access to the sites to verify the status of nuclear materials.</p>

The inquiry will investigate key decisions, such as the rapid discharge of hospital patients into care homes in early 2020, which many believe seeded the virus among vulnerable residents. It will also scrutinize issues like the use of "do not resuscitate" notices and restrictive visiting policies that kept families apart. Nearly 46,000 care home residents died with Covid in England and Wales, and witnesses are seeking accountability from officials like former Health Secretary Matt Hancock.</p>

While respecting the competition, he sympathized with comments from former Liverpool manager JÃ¼rgen Klopp, who criticized the relentless calendar. Guardiola stated that while many teams would love the income and prestige of being in the tournament, the physical toll on players is a significant and unavoidable challenge.</p>
