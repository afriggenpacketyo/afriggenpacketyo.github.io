        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Iraqi couple is set to stand trial in Germany, accused of being members of the Islamic State and enslaving two Yazidi girls. Prosecutors allege that in 2015, the man bought a 5-year-old Yazidi girl as a dowry for his wife, subjecting her to forced labor, sexual assault, humiliation, and torture for over two years. The couple allegedly bought a second Yazidi girl in 2017, who endured similar abuse. German prosecutors are using universal jurisdiction to prosecute the case, arguing the couple's actions were part of IS's systematic sexual assault of Yazidi women and girls.</p>

Chinese media asserts that the Z-10 has significant advantages in protection, maneuverability, and weaponry. The article highlights the ongoing military competition between India and China, particularly in high-altitude regions.

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered widespread sexual assault of children in South Africa's illegal mines. Children are recruited for cheap labor or trafficked for sexual exploitation, with miners reporting instances of sexual assault by adult miners in exchange for gold or protection. Activists say criminal gangs specifically target children, often abducting them from neighboring countries. The authorities are struggling to curb illegal mining, which costs South Africa's economy billions, and the police and Department of Social Development have not responded to requests for comment on the sexual abuse allegations.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, is facing criticism after stating he doesn't need to buy rice because he receives so much from supporters, amidst soaring rice prices affecting households. His comments came as his ministry explores ways to lower rice prices, including releasing government stockpiles. A recent survey showed widespread dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the rice price surge. The government has been auctioning reserve rice to ease prices, but public support for Prime Minister Ishiba's Cabinet has hit a record low.</p>

          <p>Republicans advanced their tax cut and border security package out of a House committee after conservatives negotiated changes. The conservatives had initially blocked the bill over deficit concerns. The bill permanently extends existing income tax cuts, adds temporary new ones, and increases spending for border security and defense. Democrats oppose the measure, and centrists are wary of proposed changes to Medicaid and clean energy tax credits. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the bill would add roughly $3.3 trillion to the debt over the next decade.</p>

          <p>Water voles are nearly extinct in Wales, prompting conservationists to use edible glitter to track them. The glitter is added to their food, allowing researchers to identify their droppings and monitor their movements. Nature Conservation Cymru hopes to use this data to improve the voles' habitat and increase their chances of survival. The team is testing the method on captive-bred voles before applying it in the wild, with early signs indicating the voles are consuming the glitter.</p>

The bones belong to a single species from a specific time, offering insights into dinosaur biology and behavior. Researchers believe the dinosaurs were part of a migrating herd wiped out by a catastrophic flash flood. The site is one of the largest bone beds in North America, providing a unique opportunity to study these prehistoric creatures.</p>

          <p>Olympic gold medalist R≈´ta Meilutytƒó reports that she was left "broken" by the harsh regime run by one of the UK's most successful swimming coaches, Jon Rudd. Meilutytƒó says Rudd's focus on weighing and swimmers' diets contributed to her struggle with an eating disorder and depression. Swim England did not act on a confidential 2012 investigation which ruled Rudd should be suspended after hearing evidence about his behaviour from 17 witnesses. In addition, there are allegations of bullying and a toxic training environment at one of the UK's most prestigious clubs for young elite swimmers when Rudd was head coach.</p>

The probe, initiated by the agency itself, involves detentions in Belgium and the Netherlands, and investigations in other countries. This incident underscores the importance of thorough oversight of public money spent on defense, a sector particularly prone to corruption due to high secrecy and large sums involved.
