        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewing company, experienced a significant drop after reporting a larger-than-expected decline in second-quarter sales volumes. The 1.9% decrease was primarily driven by underperformance in China and adverse conditions in Brazil, overshadowing a rise in revenue and operating profit. Despite the volume miss, the company's CEO highlighted the resilience of its major brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, and Corona. Analysts suggest the substantial volume decline is likely to weigh on the stock's performance, despite strong profit growth fueled by higher consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of 43 distinguished British lawyers and peers has cautioned the UK government that its plan to recognize a Palestinian state could be in breach of international law. They argue in a letter that Palestine does not meet the statehood criteria outlined in the 1933 Montevideo Convention, citing a lack of defined borders and a single, effective government. A government minister defended the plan, noting the UK is not a signatory to the convention and that 147 other UN members already recognize Palestine. The debate highlights the deep legal and political complexities surrounding the UK's foreign policy shift on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened Canada's prospects for a favorable trade agreement following its announcement to support Palestinian statehood. In a social media post, Trump stated that Canada's decision would make it "very hard" to secure a trade deal, intensifying pressure ahead of an August 1 tariff deadline. If an agreement is not reached, Canada could face a 35% tariff on goods not covered by the existing US-Mexico-Canada trade pact. This development injects a significant geopolitical element into trade negotiations, as Canada aligns with the UK and France in its intention to recognize a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>An Israeli settler suspected of killing a Palestinian activist, Awdah Hathaleen, was previously under U.S. sanctions that were lifted by the Trump administration. The settler, Yinon Levi, had been sanctioned by the Biden administration for alleged violence against Palestinians, but the sanctions were removed shortly after Trump took office in January. Hathaleen was an activist featured in the Oscar-winning documentary "No Other Land." The incident has drawn criticism from U.S. Democrats, who argue that lifting such sanctions emboldens violent actors and undermines efforts to hold them accountable for their actions in the West Bank.</p>

          <p>Qatar has warned it may halt liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments to Europe, including Germany, over a dispute concerning a new EU directive on corporate accountability. The EU's Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) requires large firms to address human rights and environmental issues in their supply chains, which Qatar claims goes beyond the Paris Agreement's scope. State-owned QatarEnergy fears significant fines for non-compliance, potentially impacting the 2 million tons of LNG Germany contracted to receive annually starting next year. The threat introduces new uncertainty into Europe's energy security, which has become more reliant on Qatari gas since reducing its dependence on Russia.</p>

          <p>Cambodia is appealing for the immediate release of 20 of its soldiers who were captured by Thai forces hours after a ceasefire was declared between the two nations. The truce, which followed five days of deadly border clashes over disputed temples, appears to be holding despite the incident. Thai officials stated the Cambodian troops surrendered and are being treated humanely, promising their return once the border situation stabilizes. The conflict, which killed over 40 people and displaced thousands, was de-escalated following intervention from the U.S., which threatened tariffs if the fighting continued, leading to subsequent trade deals with both countries.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that former President Donald Trump is effectively winning his long-standing conflict with what it terms the "liberal media." The author cites recent events such as the defunding of NPR and PBS, the departure of Stephen Colbert from late-night television, and staff buyouts at The Washington Post as evidence of Trump's success. The piece contends that Trump, unlike previous Republican presidents, has been willing to directly confront and fight back against media criticism. It frames his actions and the struggles of these media organizations as a significant victory in his second term, alongside other policy achievements.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court is set to hear a legal challenge that could potentially derail former President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs before they take effect. The lawsuit, brought by several states and small businesses, contests Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The plaintiffs argue that the president overstepped his constitutional authority by bypassing Congress, a novel use of the IEEPA for imposing tariffs. The court's decision could have significant implications for Washington's negotiating power in ongoing trade talks with China and other international partners.</p>

          <p>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a federal agency distributing over $12 billion to vital community health programs, has seen its workforce reduced by approximately a quarter under the Trump administration. These cuts have impacted roles from grant managers to scientists, raising concerns about the agency's ability to fund and oversee essential services like addiction treatment, maternal care, and rural health initiatives. Former agency leaders warn that the staff exodus poses a "big threat" to the national health safety net, with at least one scholarship program for disadvantaged medical students already being canceled.

Drawing from her own experiences with illness and the pandemic, she explains how journaling can help individuals make sense of their lives and process difficult moments. Jaouad suggests that reading passages from other writers' diaries can offer new perspectives and break creative blocks. For those starting out, she recommends setting a consistent time, integrating it into a daily routine like a morning coffee, and keeping the barrier to entry low by not worrying about the "right" way to do it.</p>

          <p>The United States and Pakistan have reached a trade agreement that includes a partnership to develop Pakistan's significant oil reserves, according to a late-night announcement from former President Donald Trump. The deal also reportedly involves lower tariffs on Pakistani exports to the U.S., averting a potential 29% tariff that was looming. While details remain scarce, Pakistan's finance minister called the agreement a "win-win" situation for both nations. The announcement came shortly after the U.S. imposed a 25% tariff on India, with Trump suggesting Pakistan might one day sell oil to its regional rival. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The French government has strongly condemned a comment made by Spain's transport minister, Oscar Puente, who referred to a group of French Jewish teenagers as "Israeli kids" in a now-deleted social media post. The teens were removed from a Vueling flight in Valencia, with the airline citing safety concerns over alleged inappropriate behavior. French ministers criticized Puente's remark as discriminatory and unacceptable, stating it wrongly equated French citizens of Jewish faith with Israelis. They also condemned the alleged "excessive and brutal" use of force by Spanish police against one of the group's counselors during the incident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the recent trade deal between the European Union and the United States represents a moment of profound humiliation for the EU, akin to Britain's 1956 Suez crisis. The author contends that the one-sided agreement, in which the EU made all the concessions, demonstrates the bloc's subservience to American pressure. Under the deal, most EU goods face a 15% tariff to enter the U.S., while U.S. goods enter the EU tariff-free, alongside massive investment and energy purchase commitments from Europe. The article concludes that this capitulation shows the EU has failed in its ambition to be a geopolitical equal to the US.</p>

          <p>According to Malaysia's Transport Minister, several Malaysian airlines, including budget carrier AirAsia, are showing interest in China's homegrown C919 passenger jet. This interest is driven by a need to diversify aircraft procurement and find alternatives to the long delivery backlogs from industry giants Airbus and Boeing. China's state-owned manufacturer, Comac, is promoting the C919 narrowbody airliner as a more readily available and cheaper option for carriers in Southeast Asia. The growing demand for air travel in the region is creating a significant market opportunity for new players like Comac to challenge the established duopoly.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has sanctioned Brazilian Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes and raised tariffs on Brazilian goods to 50%, escalating tensions between the two countries. U.S. officials accused Judge Moraes, who is overseeing the investigation into former President Jair Bolsonaro's alleged coup plot, of suppressing free expression and authorizing arbitrary detentions. The tariffs were directly tied to what former President Trump called the "politically motivated persecution" of his ally, Bolsonaro. Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned the moves as an "unacceptable" interference in Brazil's sovereignty, though he stated Brazil remains willing to negotiate on trade.</p>

          <p>Canada and Malta have announced their intention to formally recognize the state of Palestine this September at the United Nations General Assembly. This move aligns them with France and potentially the United Kingdom, increasing pressure for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated the decision is predicated on the Palestinian Authority holding elections and demilitarizing. The announcements were made during a U.N. conference on the conflict, which Israel and the United States boycotted, with Israel's ambassador criticizing the move as a "waste of time that legitimizes terrorism."</p>

          <p>Australia's pioneering national ban on social media for individuals under 16, aimed at tackling a youth mental health crisis, is facing scrutiny from experts. While the policy has strong public support, some researchers argue there is insufficient causal evidence linking social media use directly to poorer mental health, pointing to other factors like social inequity and climate anxiety. Critics also suggest a ban could push young people to less safe corners of the internet and that education, not prohibition, is needed. Meanwhile, the government is proceeding with trials to determine how to enforce the ban without compromising user data privacy.</p>

          <p>Auction house Sotheby's has facilitated the return of a set of sacred jewels, believed to be linked to the Buddha's remains, to India after facing intense pressure. The planned auction of the "Piprahwa Gems" was canceled following diplomatic intervention from the Indian government and global Buddhist leaders who argued that sacred relics should not be commodified. The Mumbai-based Godrej Industries Group acquired the jewels, which will now be placed on permanent public display in India. The relics were originally unearthed in 1898 from a stupa in northern India, and their return is being hailed as a major victory for the country's cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>With former President Donald Trump's August 1 tariff deadline imminent, the global trade landscape is a mix of new agreements and unresolved disputes.

However, many other nations, including major partners like Canada and Mexico, still face the threat of much higher punitive tariffs. Key economies such as India and Brazil are also facing steep levies tied to political issues, creating widespread uncertainty as a potential legal challenge to the tariffs' constitutionality is also pending.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to impose a 25% tariff, plus an unspecified penalty, on Indian goods is expected to negatively impact India's economic growth prospects, according to experts.

The tariffs could make Indian exports in key sectors like textiles, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles less competitive compared to other Asian nations. India's commerce ministry is studying the implications, while opposition parties have called the development a "catastrophic failure of foreign policy." (not investment advice)</p>
