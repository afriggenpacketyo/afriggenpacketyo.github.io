          <p>A salmonella outbreak traced to a recent egg recall has resulted in dozens of illnesses and hospitalizations across seven states in the West and Midwest, according to federal health officials. August Egg Company recalled approximately 1.7 million eggs distributed to grocery stores between February and May due to potential salmonella contamination, with at least 79 people affected and 21 hospitalized. The recall includes eggs sold in Arizona, California, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, Washington, and Wyoming, with the CDC advising consumers to discard or return the recalled eggs and disinfect any surfaces they contacted. This incident is the latest in a series of recent salmonella-related outbreaks involving various food products.

          <p>USA Gymnastics has seemingly removed its transgender eligibility policy pages from its website, with the timing of the removal currently unknown. This action follows public scrutiny ignited by a feud between Simone Biles and Riley Gaines over transgender athlete inclusion. Previous links to the organization's transgender eligibility policies now lead to error pages, though archives show the policies existed as recently as April. Other sports governing bodies have also quietly amended their transgender policies amid growing opposition to trans inclusion in women's sports. The debate over transgender athletes continues to be a contentious issue in the sports world.</p>

          <p>Political analyst Charles M. Blow reflects on the shifting mood in America regarding pluralism and racial justice. He notes that in the months since President Trump's return to office, there has been a push to purge diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts from the government and society. Blow highlights examples of what he calls "The Great Blackout," including the dismantling of the Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, D.C., and the cancellation of Juneteenth celebrations in multiple cities. He argues that America's youngest national holiday is now caught in the crossfire of the culture wars.</p>

The author suggests a sequence: provoking disturbances, declaring a state of emergency, and seizing control of local government operations, including voting. This strategy, according to the article, could be more effective than the January 6, 2021, riot. The piece expresses concern that Trump might use emergency powers to control the voting process in blue states before the 2026 midterm elections.</p>
