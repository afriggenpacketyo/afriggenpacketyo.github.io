          <p>A Frankfurt court is set to deliver its verdict on Monday in the case of Alaa M., a Syrian doctor accused of crimes against humanity.  Prosecutors allege M. tortured and murdered prisoners in Syrian military hospitals between 2011 and 2012.  M., who arrived in Germany in 2015, denies the charges, claiming fear of the military police prevented him from speaking out. The prosecution seeks a life sentence, while the defense requests acquittal.</p>
