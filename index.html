          <p>British front pages are covering multiple significant stories, led by the Post Office IT scandal inquiry, which revealed that false accusations may have led to 13 suicides. French President Emmanuel Macron's state visit also features prominently, with reports on his call for the UK to become less appealing to migrants to solve the small boats crisis. Additionally, the news includes Health Secretary Wes Streeting's warning to junior doctors against further strikes and a report from the Office of Budget Responsibility suggesting the state pension triple lock is fiscally unsustainable.</p>

          <p>The Palm Beach County Board of County Commissioners has unanimously voted to ceremonially rename a four-mile stretch of Southern Boulevard as 'President Donald J. Trump Boulevard.' This roadway runs from Palm Beach International Airport to the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort. In a social media post, Trump expressed his gratitude for the 'wonderful honor.' The name change is ceremonial, meaning postal addresses and emergency response systems will not be altered, and the new signs are expected to be installed later this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>School food caterers in the UK are being forced to reduce portion sizes, use cheaper ingredients, and serve less meat due to escalating costs and inadequate government funding. The chair of the school food organization LACA stated that a recent 3p per meal funding increase is insufficient, leaving a significant gap between the actual cost of a meal and the funding provided. Head teachers report spending tens of thousands of pounds from their own budgets to subsidize meals, money that could otherwise be used for staffing or resources.</p>

          <p>Writer and director Lena Dunham discusses her new Netflix series, 'Too Much,' which is loosely inspired by her own experiences moving to London. The show, starring Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe, deconstructs the romanticized American fantasy of England by contrasting it with the city's reality. Produced by the company behind iconic British rom-coms like 'Notting Hill,' the series features an extensive list of celebrity cameos, including Stephen Fry, Emily Ratajkowski, and Jennifer Saunders, who Dunham credits as a major comedic inspiration.</p>

          <p>China's producer prices fell by 3.6% in June compared to the previous year, marking the most significant decline in nearly two years and signaling deepening deflationary pressures. This drop was worse than economists' expectations and reflects an intense price war among companies struggling with excess inventory and weak consumer demand. While the consumer price index saw a slight rebound, economists warn it is too early to declare an end to deflation, as structural issues like overcapacity and a weakening property sector persist.

Kashanian, whose husband and daughter are U.S. citizens, had been allowed to stay in the country under an order of supervision, which her family says she had complied with for decades without issue.</p>

The NWS has lost about 600 staff members since February, and some forecast offices are operating with significant meteorologist vacancy rates, raising concerns about the agency's ability to handle future weather disasters.</p>
