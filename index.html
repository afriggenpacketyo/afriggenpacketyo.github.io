        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Portland officials have publicly opposed President Trump's directive to send federal troops to the city, stating there is no need for military intervention. They asserted that recent protests have been largely peaceful and that the deployment is an unnecessary show of force and a threat to the community. In response to what he termed threats from "antifa" and "domestic terrorists," Trump authorized the use of "Full Force" to protect ICE facilities, a move supported by Attorney General Pam Bondi who is deploying DOJ agents. The local leaders urged residents to remain calm and not to react to what they see as a provocation from the federal government.</p>

She described him as a loving father and provider who was being detained for driving under the influence while in the U.S. without legal status. Gauffeny expressed her anguish that her husband, who was shackled in his hospital bed despite being unconscious, may never meet their unborn child. She hopes that sharing his story will highlight that he was more than just a detainee and will prompt better security at immigration facilities.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler, the world's top-ranked golfer, experienced a significant downturn in performance at the Ryder Cup, becoming the first American to lose in all four of the opening sessions. Despite his dominant season, Scheffler's game appeared fragile under the pressure of the team competition, particularly his putting, contributing to Europe's commanding lead. His struggles were emblematic of the broader American team's futility against a sublime European side at Bethpage Black. The article suggests that the unique demands of the Ryder Cup format exposed weaknesses in Scheffler's game that are typically masked during individual stroke-play tournaments, diminishing his otherwise stellar reputation.</p>

          <p>In his upcoming book, "Life, Law, & Liberty," retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy reflects on his 30-year tenure, during which he was often the pivotal "swing vote" in major cases. Kennedy expresses concern about the current state of American democracy and the increasingly partisan tone of the court's opinions, stating, "The cases swung, not me." He provides personal insights into his decisions on same-sex marriage, which he says was influenced by the legal hardships faced by the children of gay couples, and his conflicted views on abortion. The book also explores his opposition to originalism, arguing that the meaning of liberty must evolve over time.</p>

Local authorities have declared an emergency, describing the rainfall as unprecedented in its intensity and speed, and have urged residents to stay away from the damaged areas while recovery efforts are underway.</p>

          <p>The Israel Premier Tech cycling team has been excluded from the upcoming Giro dell'Emilia race in Italy due to security concerns over potential pro-Palestinian protests. Organizers made the decision after similar demonstrations repeatedly disrupted the recent Vuelta a España race in Spain, where the team was present. A local Bologna councilor expressed satisfaction with the decision, stating that sport should be a vehicle for universal values and that the team's exclusion was a sensitive move shared by the community. The team, co-owned by Israeli Canadian billionaire Sylvan Adams, faces uncertainty as its title sponsor also expects a rebranding in the near future.</p>

          <p>The FBI is investigating a deadly shooting at a Dallas ICE facility as a targeted attack, after shell casings found at the scene contained anti-ICE messages. The shooter, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, killed one detainee and critically injured two others before dying of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The deceased victim was identified as Norlan Guzman-Fuentes from El Salvador, while the injured are from Mexico and Venezuela. In response, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the violence, blaming anti-ICE rhetoric from politicians and the media, and ordered increased security at facilities nationwide, sparking reactions from lawmakers across the political spectrum.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The effectiveness of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging is a subject of debate among dermatologists and researchers. While popular in various forms, from drinks to creams, there is skepticism about whether ingested collagen can successfully navigate the digestive system and reach the skin to provide benefits. Consultant dermatologists note that collagen molecules in creams are too large to penetrate the skin's surface effectively. Furthermore, studies on oral supplements show conflicting results, with industry-funded research often suggesting positive outcomes while independent studies find little to no effect. Experts suggest that sun protection, a healthy diet, and not smoking have a far greater impact on skin health.</p>

Many visitors arrive with high expectations of a pristine paradise but are instead met with the reality of a destination struggling under the strain of its own success, an issue highlighted by recent deadly floods exacerbated by poor waste management. While the island's natural beauty and rich culture still exist beyond the main tourist hubs, locals express sadness over the erosion of their home and the irony of tourists complaining about the crowds they are part of.

This policy initiated a period of rapid growth that has fundamentally altered the global tech landscape.

Housing Secretary Steve Reed is set to announce the plans, which aim to deliver up to 300,000 homes over several decades, with a requirement that at least 40% be classified as affordable housing.

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, currently a major hurricane in the Atlantic, has a possibility of interacting with a nearby developing storm, which could lead to a rare meteorological event known as the Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon occurs when two tropical storms get close enough to orbit a common center, potentially merging or altering each other's paths. While forecasts predict Humberto will not make landfall, its potential "dance" with the second system, expected to be named Imelda, is being monitored. Experts note that typically the stronger storm absorbs the weaker one, and while a merger is unlikely in this case, any interaction could slightly change the storms' trajectories as the second system approaches the southeastern U.S.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump posted a cartoon on his Truth Social platform depicting him firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, escalating his public criticism of the central bank's interest rate policies. Trump has frequently attacked Powell for not cutting rates more aggressively, and this post represents a direct, albeit symbolic, threat against the Fed chair's position. While the firing of a Fed chair by a president is unprecedented and legally contentious, the move aligns with Trump's ongoing efforts to assert control over the institution. Financial markets have so far shown little reaction, though economists worry that such a move could undermine the Federal Reserve's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

This innovative approach has been applied to disaster relief, such as providing 82 homes for residents displaced by the Lahaina wildfires in Maui.

Estimates for the number of "missing" housing units in the state have ranged from as low as 56,000 to as high as 3.5 million. These discrepancies arise from different methodologies, such as choosing a "healthy" vacancy rate, estimating "pent-up" demand from people living with parents or roommates, and focusing on different segments like affordable housing needs. Despite the lack of a single, definitive number, analysts agree that the shortage is substantial, underscoring the immense challenge the state faces.</p>

This resolution follows Dominion's nearly $800 million settlement with Fox News and another with Newsmax over similar election-related conspiracy theories. For Giuliani, this marks another legal consequence stemming from his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, adding to his existing financial and professional challenges.</p>

          <p>Israeli airstrikes and gunfire have killed at least 59 people across Gaza, according to health officials, as international calls for a ceasefire intensify. The casualties included multiple members of the same family killed in strikes on the Nuseirat refugee camp. Despite growing diplomatic pressure and a walkout during his speech at the United Nations, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remained defiant, stating his nation "must finish the job" against Hamas. Meanwhile, U.S. President Trump indicated that progress was being made toward a deal to release hostages and end the war, ahead of a scheduled meeting with Netanyahu, as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens.</p>

          <p>The No. 21 USC Trojans suffered a narrow 34-32 defeat to No. 23 Illinois, a game marred by self-inflicted errors, crucial penalties, and inconsistent play. Despite a late-game touchdown that gave them a one-point lead with under two minutes remaining, USC's defense could not hold, allowing Illinois to drive into position for a winning 41-yard field goal as time expired. The Trojans were hampered by injuries, including the absence of key offensive linemen and their defensive leader, but critical mistakes like a costly pass interference call and an interception by quarterback Jayden Maiava proved decisive. The loss highlighted recurring issues for coach Lincoln Riley's team.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Labour Party's annual conference, leader Keir Starmer has launched a sharp attack on the Reform UK party, labeling its politics as "toxic" and divisive. Starmer specifically criticized Reform leader Nigel Farage as "grubby" and "unpatriotic" for allegedly talking down the country while in America. He also condemned Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain (ILR) for migrants, arguing it would tear the country apart by threatening people who have long contributed to British society. The attacks signal Labour's strategy to position itself as a patriotic alternative to Reform, which continues to lead in opinion polls.</p>

He lives comfortably on approximately $4,000 per month, sourced from VA disability benefits, the GI Bill, and part-time work as an English teacher. Ryan states that the lower cost of living in Vietnam removes the constant financial pressure he felt in America, allowing him to focus on personal happiness and growth rather than just survival. He describes Vietnam as a safe and calm country where he feels motivated and able to invest in his future, a stark contrast to the economic struggles he faced in the U.S.</p>

Elder was chosen for his extensive experience in high-stress environments, technical expertise in engineering, and leadership skills honed over 1,800 flight hours. His background is considered ideal for managing the challenges of isolation, resource limitation, and simulated emergencies that the crew will face during their 378-day confinement, providing crucial data for future missions to Mars.</p>

Postecoglou acknowledged the team's lack of ruthlessness in front of goal and took responsibility for turning their improved play into positive results. While fans are frustrated, some observers believe the team is showing enough promise that results will eventually improve once the new system fully clicks.</p>
