          <p>President Vladimir Putin has called for direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, proposing a meeting in Istanbul on May 15, while dismissing calls for a 30-day cease-fire. This comes as European leaders visited Kyiv to express solidarity and warn of further sanctions on Russia's banking and energy sectors if a cease-fire is not agreed upon. The article highlights the competing proposals from Kyiv and Moscow as both seek to position themselves as seeking peace, amid efforts to end the war, and the geopolitical shifts occurring. The US proposed a 30-day cease-fire earlier this spring, which Kyiv agreed to, but Putin did not, setting onerous conditions instead.</p>

The administration has accused China of unfairly subsidizing key sectors and flooding the world with cheap goods, while China has been steadfast in saying it does not intend to make trade concessions in response to Mr. Trump’s tariffs.</p>

          <p>This guest essay argues that being a "good enough" mother, rather than a perfect one, is beneficial for children's development. The author, a psychiatrist, suggests that mothers are often unfairly blamed for their children's problems and should cut themselves some slack. By being flawed and imperfect, mothers teach their children to accept their own flaws and understand the importance of give-and-take in relationships. The article encourages mothers to stop striving for perfection and recognize that their imperfections are a valuable part of parenting.</p>

Given China’s large demand for agricultural products and limited amount of farmland, overseas agricultural investment and cooperation could serve as an effective way to support the country’s food security by diversifying its food supply sources.</p>
