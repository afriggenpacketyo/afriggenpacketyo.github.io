Kohberger is accused of the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students.

The bill seeks to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increase spending on border security and defense, and impose new restrictions on Medicaid and food stamps. Key changes in the Senate version include a modified increase to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap and a plan to incrementally lower provider taxes that fund Medicaid.

Democrats are using the opportunity to highlight controversial elements of the bill, such as Medicaid work requirements, while some Republicans are logging their opposition to specific parts of the package.

          <p>The Trump administration has formally accused Harvard University of violating federal civil rights law by failing to protect its Jewish and Israeli students. In a "notice of violation" letter, the administration alleged "deliberate indifference" to a hostile campus environment and threatened a potential loss of all federal funding if immediate changes are not made. The letter cites incidents of students being assaulted and the circulation of antisemitic imagery. Harvard stated it "strongly disagrees" with the findings but has taken proactive steps to combat antisemitism and bias on campus amid ongoing tensions.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo were identified by analysts as the "biggest winners" of the Federal Reserve's 2025 stress tests, which all 22 participating banks passed. The annual tests simulate a severe economic downturn to assess banks' resilience. Both Goldman and Wells saw their stress capital buffer requirements lowered more than their peers, which could free up significant capital for share buybacks, dividends, and new investments. The results are seen as another sign of a potentially easing regulatory environment for large banks, contributing to a rally in financial sector stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered significant disparities and failures in how police forces across England and Wales handle cases of coercive or controlling behavior, a decade after it was made a specific crime. The report found that some forces log three times as many offenses as others, indicating a lack of consistent understanding and prioritization. Victims described having to act as their own detectives, gathering extensive evidence themselves due to poor police responses. In response to the findings, which highlight that many forces are not using updated risk-assessment tools, a government minister pledged to hold police to higher standards.</p>

Campaign groups for bereaved families stated this phrase reflects the experience of thousands who lost loved ones. The inquiry will investigate key decisions, such as the rapid discharge of hospital patients into care homes without testing in early 2020, which is blamed for seeding the virus among vulnerable residents. Nearly 46,000 care home residents in England and Wales died with Covid, and families are seeking answers about these policies and restrictive visiting rules.</p>

          <p>The Greek government is in crisis following revelations from a European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) investigation into the misuse of hundreds of millions of euros in EU agricultural subsidies. The scandal, involving fraudulent claims for things like non-existent livestock, has implicated two former agriculture ministers and led to the resignation of four total ministers. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has acknowledged failure and promised to fight corruption, but faces pressure as this is the latest in a series of scandals undermining his government.

          <p>The U.S. dollar is tracking for its worst performance in the first half of a year since 1973, having fallen over 10% against a basket of major currencies.

Expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts have also contributed to the decline. The weakening dollar has, in turn, boosted other currencies like the British pound to a three-year high.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case that could further dismantle restrictions on money in politics. The challenge, brought by national Republican committees and Vice-President JD Vance, targets the legal limits on how much political parties can spend in coordination with their candidates' campaigns. The plaintiffs argue these limits violate their First Amendment free speech rights, an argument similar to the one used in the landmark 2010 Citizens United ruling that opened the door to unlimited outside spending. The case could significantly alter the landscape of campaign finance by potentially removing one of the few remaining regulations on spending.</p>
