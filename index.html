          <p>Microsoft's digital crimes unit, in collaboration with global law enforcement, dismantled the Lumma Stealer malware project, which had infected over 394,000 Windows computers worldwide between March 16 and May 16. The Lumma malware was used by hackers to steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, bank account credentials, and cryptocurrency wallets. Microsoft obtained a court order from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia to dismantle the web domains supporting Lumma's infrastructure, and the U.S. Department of Justice took control of Lumma's central command structure, effectively shutting down online marketplaces where the malware was sold.</p>

Despite the uncertainty, Canada Goose expressed confidence in its brand strength and financial position, citing its ability to adapt to changing conditions. The company's COO noted that a large portion of Canada Goose's units are made in Canada and comply with trade agreements, minimizing the impact of tariffs. Revenue increased by 7.4% year-over-year, and the company is expanding into non-winter categories and leveraging AI-powered virtual try-on tools for its eyewear collection (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it would scrap proposed agreements for federal oversight of police departments in Minneapolis and Louisville, as well as close civil rights investigations into departments in several other cities. Justice Department officials stated they planned to drop cases filed after incidents of police violence against Black people, arguing that consent decrees are costly and last too long. This decision came days before the anniversary of George Floyd’s murder, which prompted a federal report finding the Minneapolis police routinely discriminated against Black and Native American people. While leaders in Minneapolis vowed to continue with overhaul measures, proponents of consent decrees argue that federal oversight is the most effective tool for reforming law enforcement agencies accused of civil rights abuses.</p>

          <p>President Trump, Speaker Mike Johnson, and House Republican holdouts met to address the stalled "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act" after negotiations with hard-liners soured. The GOP remains divided over key provisions, including Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deductions. House leadership aimed to put the bill on the floor Wednesday night to force a vote, but hard-liners threatened to oppose it. The bill includes changes to Medicaid, state and local tax deductions, SNAP food assistance, and immigration policy, and Trump hoped to persuade holdouts to support his signature bill, even threatening to primary those who vote against it.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security officials confirmed the U.S. deported eight migrants convicted of crimes to a third country but refused to disclose the destination.

The flight carrying the deportees landed in Djibouti, with lawyers for some deportees claiming their clients were ultimately headed to South Sudan. The migrants were citizens of Cuba, Laos, Mexico, South Sudan, Burma, and Vietnam, convicted of crimes including murder and sexual assault, and this incident is one of several in which the administration has faced accusations of flouting court orders in deportation proceedings.</p>

          <p>A new book alleges that former President Joe Biden and his late son, Beau Biden, actively concealed details and misled the public regarding Beau's cancer diagnosis while he served as attorney general of Delaware. The book claims the Biden family wanted to keep Beau's condition a secret and misled the media about his health. According to the book, Beau used the name George Lincoln when receiving treatment, and Joe Biden ordered his staff to mislead the media regarding his whereabouts as vice president, traveling to Houston for Beau's treatment while publicly stating he was going to Delaware. Beau Biden died of a glioblastoma brain tumor in May 2015 at the age of 46.</p>

The targets included organizations supplying defense, IT services, and logistics support, and Russian spies used hacking techniques to access networks, including internet-connected cameras monitoring aid shipments at Ukrainian borders.

          <p>A multitrillion-dollar reconciliation bill debated in Congress includes trillions in tax cuts for the wealthy, hundreds of billions in spending cuts to programs for the poor, and increased spending for defense. The Urban Institute illustrates the bill's effects, showing that it would significantly worsen the financial situation of poor Americans while benefiting affluent households. This approach aligns with traditional Republican priorities of lower taxes, reduced spending on social programs, and increased defense spending. Despite some Republican figures suggesting a break from this tradition, the bill's composition indicates a continuity with past Republican economic policies.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that U.S. chip export controls are a "failure" and are harming American business more than China. Huang noted that the restrictions have cut Nvidia's China market share from 95% to 50% and motivated Beijing to accelerate its own chip production. The Chinese Commerce Ministry has criticized the U.S. policy as "overreaching" and "bullying," demanding that the White House correct its mistakes. Nvidia is caught between maintaining relationships with both the U.S. and China amidst a deepening tech cold war.</p>

Starmer stated that ministers would change the threshold to allow more pensioners to qualify again, with details to be confirmed at the autumn Budget. The winter fuel payment provides a lump-sum amount to pensioners to help with heating costs over the winter.</p>

This highlights a contradiction in Trump's approach, criticizing land seizures overseas while embracing similar tools at home.
