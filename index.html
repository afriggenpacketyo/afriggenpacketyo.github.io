        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department has resumed processing student visa applications, but now requires applicants to make their social media accounts public for review. Consular officers will be looking for posts and messages deemed hostile to the U.S., its government, culture, institutions, or founding principles. Refusal to comply could result in visa rejection, raising concerns about ideological vetting and chilling legitimate political speech. This policy adds to increased scrutiny of international students, including potential blocks on attendance at certain universities and stricter grounds for terminating their legal status.</p>

          <p>Emmet Sheehan made a strong return to the Dodgers after recovering from Tommy John surgery, pitching four innings and allowing only one run. Justin Wrobleski followed with five innings of relief, but the Padres rallied to tie the game in the ninth after a throwing error. Will Smith then hit a walk-off home run to secure the Dodgers' 4-3 victory, overshadowing the bullpen's fatigue after consecutive bullpen games. Sheehan's performance offers an intriguing option for the Dodgers' shorthanded rotation in the second half of the season, highlighting his improved strength and understanding of the game.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have pieced together thousands of fragments of 2,000-year-old wall plaster to reveal stunning frescoes from a luxurious Roman villa in London. The frescoes, discovered in 2021, depict musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, offering insights into the wealth of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London." The art also shows a blend of classical ideas with local influences, such as the inclusion of mistletoe, and the team hopes to find the missing fragment containing the artist's name. The discovery highlights the early commitment and investment the Romans made in London, viewing it as more than just a provincial outpost.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the complexities and potential pitfalls of regime change in Iran, cautioning against the notion that it can be easily achieved. While acknowledging the repressive nature of the Iranian regime and its destabilizing actions in the region, the author warns that regime destruction does not guarantee successful regime change. The piece emphasizes the need for careful consideration of the potential consequences, including the possibility of prolonged instability and the absence of a viable alternative government, drawing lessons from past interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. The article concludes by urging caution and highlighting the messy history of regime change, especially in revolutionary regimes.</p>

          <p>China's extended 618 shopping festival, designed to boost retail sales, concluded without significant excitement due to ongoing economic concerns. The festival, which has expanded to include multiple e-commerce platforms and a month-long sales period, failed to entice consumers facing employment instability, stalled wage growth, and a property crisis. While retailers and the government have attempted to stimulate spending through discounts and subsidies, consumers are increasingly seeking affordable alternatives rather than splurging on promotional events. Major e-commerce platforms have not disclosed overall sales figures, reflecting the subdued consumer sentiment.</p>

          <h2>US to Resume International Student Visas with Stricter Online Checks</h2>

          <p>The U.S. government will resume processing international student visas but will require applicants to make their social media accounts public for thorough screening. This move follows a temporary halt in interviews for student visas in May and aims to vet applicants for "hostile attitudes" towards U.S. citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles. The policy change is expected to burden embassy and consular staff, potentially reducing the volume of visa interviews. The Trump administration has been tightening standards for international students, citing concerns over anti-Semitism during student protests.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump questioned workers installing new flagpoles at the White House about their immigration status, seemingly in jest. The remarks followed a reporter's question about the administration's deportation efforts. Trump, while touring the new flagpoles, asked the workers if there were any "illegal immigrants" among them, adding that their lives would be destroyed if discovered. The comments come as the Trump administration aims to expand efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants.</p>

          <p>With increasing tariffs, businesses are employing "tariff engineering" to lower duty costs by altering product materials or dimensions to fit into more favorable harmonized system codes. This legal practice involves strategic design choices that result in different tariff classifications and duty rates. Companies in sectors like consumer goods and garments are finding it relatively easy to implement these strategies, while more regulated sectors face greater challenges. The article provides examples of companies tweaking products to qualify for lower tariffs, emphasizing the need to balance redesign with honest product representation.</p>
