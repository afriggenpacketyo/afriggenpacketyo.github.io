          <p>President Trump used his social media platform to pressure "everyone" to lower oil prices amidst escalating tensions in the Middle East following U.S. strikes on Iran. He warned that failure to do so would benefit "the enemy," although he did not specify who he was addressing. The price of U.S. crude oil and global benchmark Brent both experienced slight decreases following Trump's post. Trump also urged the Department of Energy to increase drilling efforts. Optimism surrounding the oil market remains relatively stable despite the U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several tankers have altered their courses away from the Strait of Hormuz due to heightened concerns about potential disruptions to trade following U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. Data indicates that at least six vessels initially diverted, though some have since resumed their course toward the Strait. Reports of electronic interference and GPS jamming further exacerbate worries among vessel owners, leading to increased insurance costs and potential avoidance of the area. Despite these concerns, overall vessel flow into the region appears to be sustained, with some analysts suggesting pressure from China, a major buyer of Iranian oil, may be influencing Iran to avoid disrupting shipping. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Steve Hill, an expert in war studies, Iran possesses numerous options for retaliating against the U.S. attack without provoking further aggression from the United States. Hill suggests that Iran could strike a balance by responding enough to satisfy its own people but not so much that it triggers another round of attacks. He notes that a measured response would allow Iran to demonstrate retaliation without escalating the conflict into a full-blown war. This approach would allow Iran to justify its actions to its citizens without inviting further attacks from the U.S.</p>

          <p>A recent German study indicates that immigrants arriving in Germany and the European Union are more educated than ever before. In 2024, 32.1% of migrants from non-EU countries held a university degree or equivalent qualification, marking a record level and a continuing upward trend. However, a study by the Institute for Employment Research found that many economically successful foreigners are considering leaving Germany, often citing discrimination as a reason. The study emphasizes the potential of migrants to drive economic growth across the EU if their skills are fully utilized.</p>

          <p>The United States launched airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, joining an Israeli-led offensive, with President Trump claiming a major victory that "totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear program, although the extent of the damage remains uncertain. The motivations behind the attack stem from a perception of Iranian vulnerability and a desire to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. The strikes have sparked controversy and raised concerns about potential retaliation from Iran, which could include attacks on U.S. forces or disruptions to international shipping lanes, and the possibility of a wider war in the Middle East.</p>

This move signals a new strategy to hold congressional Republicans accountable for thwarting Trump's legislative agenda.

          <p>Three years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, the number of abortions performed in the US continues to rise, even in states with bans. According to #WeCount, US abortion providers performed 1.14 million abortions in 2024, the highest number in recent years. A growing number of abortions are occurring through telehealth, facilitated by "shield laws" that protect providers treating women in states with bans. Despite legal challenges to shield laws and access to mifepristone, telehealth abortions continue to rise, indicating ongoing demand for abortion care.</p>

          <p>Compass has filed a lawsuit against Zillow, alleging that the online property website is violating antitrust laws with a new rule banning home listings from its platform if they appear on any other service for more than 24 hours before being posted on Zillow. Compass argues that Zillow is leveraging its market dominance to impose the ban and hobble competition. Compass CEO Robert Reffkin stated that no company should have the power to ban agents or listings simply because they don't follow that company's business model. Compass is defending its three-pronged marketing strategy for home listings, claiming it better serves sellers.</p>

          <p>A Marine Corps veteran, Adrian Clouatre, is struggling to care for his two young children after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained his wife, Paola, who is facing deportation. Paola, a Mexican national, had been seeking a green card to legally live and work in the U.S. after marrying Adrian in 2024. However, ICE issued an order for her deportation in 2018 after her mother failed to appear at an immigration hearing. Immigration law experts say directives for strict immigrant enforcement have cast away practices of deference previously afforded to military families.</p>

While the US claims the strikes caused monumental damage, Iran asserts the sites were evacuated beforehand, and there was no increase in radiation levels.

Gagandeep Gulati sent videos of the attack to others before falsely claiming to police that he was the victim. The Court of Appeal increased the sentence, citing Gulati's motive of seeking to give the false impression of consent as a significant aggravating factor. The Solicitor General welcomed the increased sentence, condemning Gulati's actions as sickening.</p>

Insurers say the process ensures patients receive medically necessary care and allows them to control costs. The changes could cut into profits if they lead to patients using care more often, though the companies cheered the changes.</p>
