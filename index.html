          <p>US agriculture exporters are facing a "full-blown crisis" due to the ongoing trade war and tariffs, particularly with China. The agriculture sector is experiencing significant financial losses, including canceled export orders and layoffs, as China reduces its purchases of U.S. farm products. Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture indicates China's largest cancellation of pork orders since 2020, impacting exporters of various products like wood pulp and grass seed. Port of Oakland officials warn of potential job losses and economic downturn due to tariff-induced slowdowns in cargo volume, as China is a major trading partner for the port.

          <p>Real Madrid defender Antonio Rüdiger is facing a potential ban after throwing an object, believed to be an ice cube, at a referee during the Spanish Cup final. The incident occurred after Rüdiger, already substituted, reacted angrily to a refereeing decision against his teammate Kylian Mbappe. The Spanish Football Federation disciplinary code could suspend him for four to twelve matches for "mild violence," or even longer if the offense is deemed more serious. Rüdiger has since apologized for his actions, but condemnation has been widespread, with calls for the German FA to take action.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-28 07:00:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration, through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is reviewing federal programs, including those targeting HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention, to identify waste and inefficiencies. Advocates are urged to support this review to ensure programs are optimally designed and resources are effectively allocated. The Ryan White CARE Act, for instance, hasn't been reauthorized since 2009, and a review could reallocate funds toward substance abuse and mental health services. While efficiency is needed, deprioritizing funding for the HIV/AIDS epidemic would be a mistake, as cutting efforts leads to spikes in new infections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's policies, including rolling back tax credits for electric vehicles and pausing funding for charging stations, are creating uncertainty for community college students training for jobs in the electric vehicle industry. Apprenticeship programs, developed in partnership with industry and community colleges, are designed to provide a skilled workforce for electric car companies. Community colleges have invested heavily in these programs, but the federal policy changes could reduce demand for electric vehicle manufacturing and put plants at risk of closure. While some state leaders remain optimistic, the future of these programs and the job prospects of students are now less certain.</p>

          <p>Despite controversial statements, many white evangelical leaders in the U.S. continue to strongly support President Trump, citing his actions on issues such as abortion, immigration, and the location of the U.S. embassy in Israel. They believe Trump has delivered on his promises to "bring back Christianity," contrasting him with previous Republican presidents who they felt did not do enough to advance their agenda. Trump's administration has also established a faith office and a taskforce to address "anti-Christian bias" in the federal government, further solidifying his support among this demographic.</p>

          <p>Canada's Election Day is driven by the resignation of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and shaped by the politics of the United States, namely the policies of President Donald Trump. Trump started threatening to annex Canada and started backing that rhetoric with coercive policies, like hitting Canada with tariffs for no discernible reason.  The main contenders are Mark Carney (Liberal) and Pierre Poilievre (Conservative), with the Liberals expected to win. The election has shifted from cost of living concerns to defending Canada from Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>The Children's Commissioner for England is urging the government to ban AI apps that create sexually explicit images of children. Dame Rachel de Souza emphasized the need for a total ban on "nudification" apps, where AI edits photos to make people appear naked. She highlighted that the government is allowing such apps to "go unchecked with extreme real-world consequences", disproportionately affecting girls and young women. The government has announced laws to tackle the creation and distribution of AI-generated child sexual abuse material.</p>
