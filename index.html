          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 12:03:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK Member of Parliament James McMurdock has voluntarily relinquished the party whip following serious allegations regarding his business dealings. The party's chief whip, Lee Anderson, confirmed McMurdock's self-suspension pending an internal investigation into claims, first published by the Sunday Times, concerning his use of government Bounce Back loans during the pandemic. McMurdock maintains that his business transactions were conducted entirely within legal and regulatory frameworks, stating they were assessed by qualified professionals who confirmed absolute compliance. This internal inquiry is expected to take several weeks, potentially led by an external figure. The incident marks the second time a Reform MP elected in 2024 has lost the party whip, reducing their current representation in the Commons and raising scrutiny over the party's standards for elected officials.</p>

          <p>The Madre Fire in California has rapidly expanded to over 79,600 acres, making it the state's largest wildfire this year, with only 10% containment as of Saturday morning. Originating in the Los Padres National Forest, the blaze has prompted evacuation orders and highway closures in San Luis Obispo and Kern counties, located north of Los Angeles. While approximately 50 structures are threatened, no injuries or damage have been reported yet. State and federal agencies are collaborating on a unified command response, deploying extensive air and ground resources to combat the fire's exponential growth driven by current weather and terrain conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than 20 individuals have been arrested in London on suspicion of offenses under the Terrorism Act 2000, following a protest in Parliament Square supporting the now-banned group Palestine Action. The Metropolitan Police confirmed the arrests, as the group's proscription came into effect Saturday after a High Court bid to block the ban failed. This designation criminalizes membership or support for Palestine Action, with potential prison sentences up to 14 years. The government moved to ban the group after it claimed responsibility for an estimated £7 million in damage to military aircraft at RAF Brize Norton last month, citing a "long history of unacceptable criminal damage."</p>

          <p>Two American aid workers with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S. and Israel-backed initiative, were injured in a grenade attack at a food distribution site in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. While GHF claimed Hamas was responsible, no immediate evidence was provided. Concurrently, Israeli airstrikes killed 14 people in Gaza, including a doctor and his children, and 10 Palestinians died while seeking food, some near GHF sites, though GHF denies responsibility for deaths at its locations. These events unfold as U.S.-led ceasefire efforts gain momentum, with Hamas giving a "positive" response to a proposal while seeking guarantees for a full war end and the dissolution of GHF.</p>

The Dutchman highlighted the challenging wind conditions at Silverstone, which made the high-speed corners particularly sensitive for the cars. Piastri, who was fastest after the first runs, expressed satisfaction with his initial lap but acknowledged a messy second attempt.

Kelce's post, which quickly garnered over 2,000 negative comments, highlighted a stark contrast in public sentiment regarding the state of the nation.

          <p>"Tipflation" describes the increasing confusion and pressure surrounding tipping in modern society, driven by new digital payment systems and pre-calculated tip options. While traditional tipping norms for services like waiting tables remain, customers are now prompted to tip in unexpected places, from fast-food takeaways to self-service kiosks. Experts suggest that the default tip requests embedded in digital payment systems, which many businesses don't opt out of, contribute to this phenomenon. This shift has led to customer frustration and a sense of obligation, with surveys showing a disconnect between expected and actual tipping behaviors across different countries.</p>

However, endocrinologists and professors of medicine state there's no substantial scientific evidence or large-scale studies supporting its direct effect on lowering cortisol levels.

The Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA) of 2016 protects U.S. consumers from such retaliation, making these clauses unenforceable. Paull has filed complaints with state and federal agencies.

          <p>A doctor highlights the severe challenges Medicaid patients face due to new congressional work requirements, which could lead to nearly 12 million Americans losing insurance by 2034. While exemptions exist for medical conditions or disabilities, patients like one with severe scoliosis often lack the stable address, phone, or ID to navigate bureaucratic hurdles. The article argues that these "time taxes" disproportionately affect the urban poor, language minorities, and those with cognitive impairments, effectively disenfranchising them from entitled benefits. Critics contend these cuts, aimed at reducing waste, will instead cause financial disaster for safety-net hospitals and increase illness, particularly in rural areas.</p>

          <p>Mo Gawdat, a happiness researcher and former Google X executive, shares his "90-second rule" as a method to live a more fulfilled life by effectively managing anger and upset. Inspired by neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor's research, Gawdat explains that stress and anger hormones naturally flush out of the body within 90 seconds. The challenge lies in preventing the mind from re-triggering these emotions through rumination. To recover quickly, Gawdat advises asking three questions: "Is it true?", "Can I do something about it?", and "Can I accept it and do something despite its presence?". This approach encourages mindful processing and acceptance, leading to quicker emotional recovery.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued an executive order increasing entry fees for non-U.S. residents at national parks and lakeshores, including those in Michigan, while also revoking diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) directives from previous administrations. The order aims to prioritize American families by funneling revenue from foreign tourists into infrastructure improvements and granting U.S. citizens preferential access. This move reverses Obama-era and Biden administration policies that promoted broad accessibility and diverse storytelling within the parks. The changes impact Michigan's Isle Royale and Sleeping Bear Dunes, which currently charge fees, and follow Trump's earlier order to end government DEI programs.</p>

          <p>A shopkeeper in Durham, Andrew Board, expressed frustration after a brazen shoplifter he apprehended was dealt with via a community resolution rather than formal court action. The thief, who stole a crate of beer, admitted the offense but only had to pay for the goods and was banned from the shop, without receiving a criminal conviction. Board argues this sends the wrong signal, lacking a true deterrent for criminals and fueling the problem of frequent shoplifting at his store. This incident reflects a national issue in England and Wales, where only 18% of reported shoplifting offenses lead to charges, with police often failing to identify suspects.</p>

The experience fostered confidence and reduced loneliness by connecting her with diverse communities of hobbyists. She advocates that hobbies are not a luxury but integral to achieving work-life balance, forcing individuals to set boundaries and enriching their lives by providing outlets for creativity, physical activity, and mental engagement.</p>

Despite being acquitted of the most serious federal charges, Combs was found guilty of transporting male prostitutes across state lines and faces new civil cases. The article contends that prosecutors often resort to trafficking charges due to outdated domestic violence statutes, especially when dealing with wealthy and powerful abusers. It also criticizes media portrayals that soften the image of alleged predators and highlights societal tendencies to minimize such issues, suggesting that money and connections often allow powerful individuals to evade severe consequences.</p>

The widespread adoption of statin drugs for cholesterol management and advancements in emergency care, such as CPR and portable defibrillators, have also been crucial.
