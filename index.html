          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease estimating the economic impact of climate change when developing policies, except where explicitly required by law. This directive effectively suspends the use of the "social cost of carbon," a metric used to assess the economic damages from global warming. Jeffrey B. Clark, acting administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, expressed doubt about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change. Critics argue this policy ignores the science and economics of climate change, potentially hindering efforts to regulate pollution and protect the environment.</p>

          <p>Following talks between Ukraine's allies in Kyiv, Sir Keir Starmer hailed the outcome as a "significant moment" in securing a ceasefire in the conflict with Russia, while acknowledging it's not the end of the process. Around 30 global leaders reaffirmed their call for Russia to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, threatening "massive" sanctions if Russia does not comply. The UK prime minister emphasized the unprecedented unity among allies, contrasting it with earlier stages of the conflict. The Kremlin responded by accusing European leaders of confrontational remarks, but indicated they would consider the proposal.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's crypto agenda faces obstacles due to concerns over conflicts of interest arising from his personal cryptocurrency ventures. Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill, due to the President's involvement with meme coins like $TRUMP and $MELANIA, which have added billions to his wealth. Democrats have criticized these ventures as "pay-for-play schemes," and some senators who initially supported the stablecoin legislation withdrew their support, citing concerns over anti-money laundering and national security. The president's pursuit of personal profits is creating a major impediment to long-awaited advancements for the crypto industry.</p>
