          <p>Five police officers were shot while serving a warrant in York County, Pennsylvania, leaving three in grave condition and one critical. The gunman reportedly died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene of the incident in North Codorus Township. Governor Josh Shapiro and other state officials traveled to the area, and a local hospital confirmed it was treating two individuals in serious condition while implementing enhanced security protocols. The event prompted a temporary shelter-in-place order for nearby schools as a precautionary measure while law enforcement secured the area.</p>

          <p>Hilaria Baldwin described her debut performance on "Dancing with the Stars" as a dream come true, especially with her husband, Alec Baldwin, and their family present to support her. In a pre-performance segment, Alec praised her work ethic, noting that professional dancing was her life before an injury forced her to stop. Following a steamy cha-cha with her partner Gleb Savchenko, some social media users commented on Alec's seemingly stoic reaction in the audience. Hilaria emphasized that her husband has been very supportive of her journey on the show, which represents a return to a passion she thought she had lost.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has officially declared that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza, making him the first U.S. senator to use the term. Citing casualty figures and statements from Israeli officials as evidence of intent, Sanders argued that Israel's response to the October 7th attack has become an "all-out war against the entire Palestinian people." He called for an end to U.S. complicity in the conflict, demanding an immediate ceasefire, a massive increase in humanitarian aid, and an end to military assistance for what he termed Benjamin Netanyahu's "genocidal government."</p>

The London-based company, which spun out of a crypto-mining infrastructure firm, has been named an AI partner for Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI for their UK expansions. Nscale also announced a $6.2 billion agreement with Microsoft to develop hyperscale AI infrastructure in Europe and received a £500 million equity investment from Nvidia. This swift ascent highlights the intense demand for AI data centers and Europe's push for "sovereign AI" capabilities (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>In response to policy shifts within the Trump administration's Department of Health and Human Services, four western states have formed the West Coast Health Alliance to issue their own vaccine guidelines. California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii are providing joint recommendations for COVID, flu, and RSV vaccines for the fall season. This move comes after the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez and the appointment of vaccine skeptics to key federal roles. The states' guidance, based on input from medical doctors and major health associations, contrasts with recent federal changes, particularly regarding vaccine recommendations for children and pregnant individuals.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the Trump administration and its allies are reportedly launching a campaign against progressive nonprofit organizations. This response appears to be based on the perception that a broader leftist plot was responsible for the murder, despite initial indications that the alleged killer acted alone. The article frames this move as part of a larger political strategy to connect the actions of an individual to a wider ideological movement. This development raises concerns about the use of a violent act to justify political targeting of opposing groups.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that recent Republican tax legislation, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), is creating a more complex and inequitable tax code. The laws extend tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy while introducing specific carve-outs for certain working-class professions, such as a deduction for tipped income and tax-free overtime pay. This approach creates "horizontal inequity," where people with similar incomes face vastly different tax burdens depending on their profession. The article suggests this strategy erodes the tax base and encourages tax avoidance, leaving salaried professionals as one of the few groups paying predictable rates (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>With U.S. household debt reaching record levels, many Americans are struggling to keep up with payments, particularly on high-interest credit cards. For those whose debt obligations exceed their income, traditional budgeting may not be sufficient. This article outlines several strategies for relief, including debt consolidation to a lower-interest loan, which can make payments more manageable for those with good credit. Other options discussed are debt settlement, where companies negotiate a lower total balance with creditors, and formal debt management plans offered through credit counseling agencies, which restructure payments and reduce interest rates over a set period (not investment advice).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, bringing the new target range to between 4% and 4.25%. This marks the first rate cut since December 2024 and reflects the central bank's growing concern over a slowing labor market and weakening economic growth. Projections from Fed officials indicate the possibility of two additional cuts before the end of the year, though opinions among policymakers are divided. The move aims to support employment by easing borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, even as inflation remains slightly above the Fed's target (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers edge rusher Khalil Mack is expected to miss four weeks after suffering a dislocated left elbow during a game against the Las Vegas Raiders. While a significant blow to the defense, the diagnosis was a relief compared to fears of a season-ending injury. Coach Jim Harbaugh praised Mack's toughness, noting he walked off the field despite the severe injury. In his absence, Tuli Tuipulotu and veteran Bud Dupree will take on larger roles, with the team also considering promoting rookie Kyle Kennard from the practice squad to add depth to the pass rush.</p>

          <p>A new study of nearly 34,000 veterans suggests that nicotinamide, a form of Vitamin B3, is associated with a lower risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancers. The research, published in JAMA Dermatology, found the greatest benefit among individuals who began taking the supplement after their first skin cancer diagnosis, showing a 54% reduced risk of recurrence. While many dermatologists already recommend the over-the-counter supplement, this large-scale study provides stronger evidence for its use as a secondary prevention measure. The findings may lead to more widespread recommendations, particularly for patients at high risk for common skin cancers like basal and squamous cell carcinoma.</p>

          <p>A dive team has officially identified a shipwreck discovered 200 feet underwater off the coast of Nantucket as the ST Seiner, a fishing boat that sank nearly a century ago. The vessel was lost in a storm in January 1929 with 21 crew members aboard, and no survivors were ever found. The salvage company Atlantic Wreck Salvage located the wreck site in 2022 and confirmed its identity during dives in July 2025. Distinctive features like a double drum trawl winch and sonar scans matching the ship's dimensions helped confirm it was the long-lost vessel, providing potential closure for descendants of the crew.</p>

The footage captured the student at a campus memorial event, mimicking being shot and falling to the ground while shouting taunts at a group of Kirk's supporters. The video sparked widespread outrage, including a call for expulsion from Texas Governor Greg Abbott. The university president condemned the behavior as intolerable and antithetical to the school's values, confirming that the individual is no longer a student at the institution.</p>

          <p>In his first Federal Open Market Committee meeting, newly-confirmed Governor Stephen Miran was the sole dissenter, advocating for a larger half-point interest rate cut instead of the quarter-point reduction approved by the other members. Miran, a recent appointee by President Trump, cast his vote just days after being confirmed by the Senate to the Fed's Board of Governors. The dissent highlights a significant divergence in opinion within the central bank on how aggressively to respond to the slowing economy. Other governors who had previously dissented, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, aligned with the consensus for the smaller cut (not investment advice).</p>
