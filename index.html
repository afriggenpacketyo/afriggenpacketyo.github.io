          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant increase due to escalating tensions between the United States and Iran, fueled by President Trump's skepticism about reaching a nuclear agreement with Iran. Brent crude futures rose by 4.3% to $69.77 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude gained 4.9% to settle at $68.15. The U.S. is also preparing a partial evacuation of its embassy in Iraq, and the UK Maritime Trade Operations warned of potential military escalation in the region. Iran's defense minister further heightened concerns by stating that U.S. bases in the region are within reach of Iran's military. The instability in the Middle East and the potential for conflict are driving market anxieties. Optimism is low given the current state of affairs.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's declaration of a trade deal with China, logistics and retail executives warn that the damage to the supply chain, U.S. consumers, and the economy will persist. While Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that tariffs on Chinese goods will remain at 55%, industry leaders argue that this rate is too high and will continue to strain businesses. Concerns include potential job losses, increased consumer prices, and instability for consumer goods companies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested extending tariff pauses for countries negotiating in good faith, but uncertainty remains about the future of trade relations. The situation is causing anxiety in the freight industry. (not investment advice)</p>

Bessent highlighted that the U.S. is engaged in trade discussions with 18 significant partners, including the European Union. He suggested that for those negotiating constructively, the U.S. would likely extend the tariff pause beyond its expiration date.

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to repeal limits on greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants, arguing that U.S. power plants contribute a small portion of global emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also claims that eliminating climate pollution from power plants would have little impact on public health. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that the administration aims to protect the environment while boosting the economy. Environmental groups have criticized the proposal, arguing that it will harm public health and worsen climate change. The move is part of a broader effort to redirect the federal government away from climate action. This proposal is a setback for environmental regulations.</p>

          <p>Researchers have analyzed gold coins from the San Jose galleon, a Spanish ship that sank in 1708, confirming their origin and revealing intricate designs. The coins feature depictions of castles, lions, and crosses, as well as the "Crowned Pillars of Hercules." The study, published in Antiquity, used images taken by remotely operated vehicles to analyze dozens of coins scattered around the shipwreck. Colombian authorities plan to begin extractions from the wreck, which was discovered in 2015. The discovery has sparked legal claims from multiple parties, including Colombia, Spain, and an American salvage company. The images offer a glimpse into a fascinating historical find.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Donald Trump argued that the appeal of his felony conviction in New York should be moved to federal court, claiming the case relates to official acts as president. The Manhattan District Attorney's Office countered that the request was made too late and that the evidence presented was not related to Trump's official duties. Judges on the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals pressed both sides, acknowledging the case's unique nature. Trump was convicted of falsifying business records related to a hush-money payment. The panel is expected to issue a written opinion at a later date. This case continues to have legal ramifications.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom's attempt to block the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, calling it a "crass political stunt." The DOJ argues that President Trump has the authority to mobilize the National Guard to protect federal personnel and facilities amid violent protests related to ICE raids. The agency cited the inability of local law enforcement to control the unrest, and the comments made by LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell that "things have gotten out of control." The DOJ emphasized that the President has every right to call forth the National Guard. The clash highlights the tensions between state and federal authority.</p>

          <p>Images of unrest and political spin are creating a distorted view of the situation in Los Angeles, where protests against immigration raids have taken place. While some portray the city as chaotic, others emphasize the peaceful nature of the majority of demonstrations. President Trump has used the images to condemn Los Angeles, while state leaders criticize his deployment of the National Guard. The contrasting narratives highlight the political polarization surrounding the issue. The reality on the ground is more nuanced than the media portrayals suggest.</p>
