          <p>Following Karen Read's acquittal on murder and manslaughter charges in the death of her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, her parents expressed relief and a focus on returning to normalcy after more than two years of a life-changing ordeal. Bill and Janet Read credited their daughter's strength and determination, referring to her as the "fifth lawyer" in the case, for her involvement in pursuing every angle of the investigation. They acknowledged the hurtful and misogynistic comments directed at Karen during the trial and expressed a commitment to speaking out and helping others in need moving forward, hoping the question of who is responsible for O'Keefe's death will one day be answered. The family of John O'Keefe has expressed their disappointment with the verdict, and Read still faces a civil wrongful death suit filed by the O'Keefe family. </p>

          <p>Faced with soaring rice prices, Japanese restaurants and food companies are increasingly turning to noodles as a cost-effective alternative. Antworks Co., which operates Densetsu no Sutadonya eateries, has recently opened ramen noodle restaurants to diversify its offerings due to rice prices tripling in recent years. Yoshinoya Holdings Co. is also bolstering its ramen noodle business, aiming to balance ingredient costs with non-rice options as consumers seek alternatives at supermarkets, with sales of frozen udon noodles and related products experiencing growth. The shift reflects consumers' sensitivity to price increases and the industry's adaptation to maintain affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A mysterious human skull discovered in the 1930s, known as "dragon man," has been identified as a Denisovan after initial attempts to extract DNA failed, according to recent studies. Researchers successfully extracted genetic material from dental calculus, calcified dental plaque, to compare it to previous samples. The findings revealed that the "dragon man" was not a new species but rather an intact Denisovan specimen, which are closely related to Neanderthals and coexisted with modern-day humans. The skull was originally found by a Chinese laborer and kept hidden to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Japanese army before being donated to a museum in 2018.</p>

          <p>A recent deadly border skirmish between Thailand and Cambodia has become a test for China's regional diplomacy, as Beijing seeks to maintain stability in a strategically important area.

The clash, resulting in one Cambodian soldier's death, highlights long-standing border disputes in the Indochina peninsula, a crucial trade gateway for China. While the risk of escalation is deemed low, the incident underscores the challenges in China's efforts to foster closer regional ties amid competition with the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "Total and Complete Moron" for maintaining steady interest rates, and suggested he might consider firing him. Despite previous statements indicating no intention to dismiss Powell, Trump floated the possibility, raising legal questions about the president's authority to remove the Fed chair before his term concludes in May 2026. Trump's criticism stems from his desire for lower interest rates, which he believes would stimulate economic growth, while Powell and the Fed prioritize managing inflation. Any attempt to fire Powell would likely face legal challenges, given the Fed's independent status.</p>

          <p>The United States' recent failure to reach a tariff agreement with Japan and its threat to impose new duties on imports from multiple countries may strengthen China's negotiating position. With the US looking weak in the short term, analysts suggest that China may adopt a tougher stance in trade negotiations with Washington. President Trump's previous imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports and subsequent pauses pending trade talks have created a dynamic where Beijing's negotiators could draw strength from the US's apparent desperation to secure deals.

          <p>The United States experienced a series of environmental setbacks on Friday, with the Trump administration's actions to keep two Michigan coal plants open and the Supreme Court's ruling favoring fossil fuel firms in an emissions case. The Department of Energy ordered the JH Campbell coal plant to remain operational beyond its scheduled closure date, and the administration is expected to extend the life of the Monroe power plant. These plants contribute significantly to Michigan's greenhouse gas emissions, and opponents argue that the decision lacks support and could burden ratepayers. The move reflects the administration's stance on energy policy, prioritizing fossil fuels over environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>Scientists are trying to solve a decade-long mystery involving strange signals detected from below the ice in Antarctica, which seem to defy the laws of physics. The signals emerged during a search for high-energy cosmic particles known as neutrinos, using NASA's Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna experiment. The anomalous radio waves came from below the horizon, suggesting they had passed through thousands of miles of rock, but the radio waves should have been absorbed by the rock. Follow-up observations and analyses with other instruments have not been able to find the same signals.</p>

The team subsequently announced a $1 million donation to support families of "immigrants impacted by recent events in the region". The team's actions and financial support reflect the ongoing tensions surrounding immigration enforcement and the Dodgers' commitment to their diverse fan base.</p>

The measure restricts freedom of movement and allows the police to make arrests without a warrant. Troubles in the region began a month ago, when the local banana workers union joined a nationwide protest against proposed pension cuts and declared a strike.</p>

          <p>Romance and fantasy books, particularly the "romantasy" blend, are experiencing a surge in popularity, driving UK fiction revenue above £1 billion for the first time. The rise of BookTok, a TikTok reading community, has fueled the genre's success, with young women driving sales and embracing tropes like "enemies to lovers" and high "spice levels." While attitudes toward romance are improving, some readers and industry experts believe sexism still prevents the genre from mainstream recognition. The growing commercial success of romance is prompting publishers to invest more seriously in the genre, but critical appraisal remains lacking, with broadsheets rarely reviewing romance books.</p>

          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague is heavily influenced by President Trump's demands for increased defense spending by European allies. Secretary General Mark Rutte has prioritized a commitment to higher defense spending to avoid conflict with the US, although compromises and disagreements on trade, Russia, and the Middle East are expected. The summit's brevity and reduced agenda are seen as attempts to hide divisions and cater to Trump's preferences. Despite the focus on defense spending, challenges remain in reaching and defining spending targets, with some nations struggling to meet existing goals.</p>
