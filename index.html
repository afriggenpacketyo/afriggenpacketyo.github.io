        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's former president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has been detained again as prosecutors investigate charges of insurrection. The charges stem from his declaration of martial law in December, an act the Constitutional Court deemed a betrayal of public trust. Yoon, who was impeached in April, faces a potential life sentence if convicted, with prosecutors arguing for his detention due to concerns he might destroy evidence. His legal team has contested the detention, claiming it is unreasonable as he no longer holds any authority.</p>

          <p>A significant overnight Russian drone attack on Kyiv has resulted in at least two deaths, thirteen injuries, and multiple fires across the Ukrainian capital. Officials reported that drone wreckage struck residential buildings and a primary healthcare center was nearly destroyed in the Podilsky district. This attack follows one of the largest aerial assaults of the war earlier in the week, with Ukraine's military also warning of a potential ballistic missile threat. The incident occurs as the US resumes sending some weapons to Ukraine after a recent pause.</p>

          <p>A large section of the iconic Sycamore Gap tree, which was illegally felled in September 2023, is now on permanent display at a visitor center near Hadrian's Wall. The installation allows the public to see and touch the trunk, which is surrounded by benches inscribed with public messages of grief and hope. The project was designed by artist Charlie Whinney following a public consultation to determine the tree's future. This memorial aims to provide a place for reflection and connection for the many people who were outraged by the tree's destruction.</p>

          <p>Detectives are investigating historical sexual abuse allegations involving a convicted former bishop and another former vicar from the Church in Wales. The investigation, revealed by a BBC report, includes fresh claims against former Bishop Anthony Pierce, who was jailed earlier this year for child sexual abuse. Victims have come forward stating that concerns about Pierce were reported to church officials as early as 1986 but were ignored, allowing him to be promoted. The Church in Wales has apologized for its failings and promised a review of its culture.</p>

          <p>An investigation by Global Witness reveals that some of the world's poorest countries, including Somalia, Haiti, and Yemen, are paying millions to lobbyists connected to Donald Trump. These deals appear to be an attempt to offset cuts in U.S. foreign aid and secure support, sometimes by bartering natural resources. The report highlights contracts worth $17 million signed with firms like Ballard Partners and BGR Government Affairs, which have strong ties to the Trump administration. This trend raises concerns about the exploitation of vulnerable nations navigating new U.S. foreign policy dynamics.</p>

          <p>Reform UK's momentum continues as Sir Jake Berry, a former Conservative Party chairman knighted by Boris Johnson, announces his defection to the party. This follows several other former Tory MPs who have recently joined Nigel Farage's party, signaling a significant trend in UK politics. Sir Jake's move is seen as particularly damaging to the Conservatives due to his seniority and close ties to the former prime minister. The development is also forcing the Labour government to shift its strategic focus, now treating Reform as a serious long-term challenger.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's ambiguous but threatening tariff policies are causing significant uncertainty for Chinese manufacturers who have relocated to Southeast Asia to avoid direct U.S. levies. The threat of targeting transshipment through these countries has left many Chinese exporters in a state of limbo, unsure how to plan their supply chains. This strategy is a direct blow to the "China plus one" approach, where companies diversify production into neighboring nations. In response, many Chinese firms are pausing further overseas expansion.

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine, reversing a recent pause in some arms shipments. The president stated the weapons are necessary for Ukrainians to defend themselves against Russia's intense attacks, expressing concern over the number of people dying. The decision comes after the White House confirmed a halt in some shipments as part of a broader review of global military aid. The move signals a potential recalibration of U.S. policy as the war continues, with Trump recently expressing frustration with Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports, effective August 1, is raising alarms about potential price increases for a wide range of consumer products. Experts warn that because copper is essential for electrical wiring, plumbing, appliances, and electric vehicles, the tariff could fuel inflation. The administration argues the tariff is a matter of national security, necessary to rebuild the domestic copper industry for defense and infrastructure needs. The U.S. currently imports over half its copper, and ramping up domestic production would take years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to a new federal "megabill" that curtails clean energy subsidies, California lawmakers are considering rolling back state environmental regulations. The goal is to fast-track clean energy projects to meet new, tight federal deadlines for construction and operation. Influential lawmakers have proposed exempting some green energy projects from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a law often criticized for slowing development. While clean energy groups support streamlining, environmental organizations are wary, fearing it could undermine crucial protections.</p>

Trump also cited alleged unfair trade practices and attacks on American social media companies as justification for the steep tariff.
