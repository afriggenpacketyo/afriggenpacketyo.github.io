          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has officially announced she will not seek reelection when her second term ends in 2026. Ernst, the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate, cited prayer and reflection as guiding her decision to conclude her chapter of elected service. Her retirement opens up a competitive race for the Senate seat in a state that has trended Republican in recent presidential elections. Speculation is already underway about potential Republican and Democratic candidates who may contend for the position.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has determined that former President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles was illegal, violating the Posse Comitatus Act. This law restricts the federal government's power to use military forces for domestic law enforcement. The ruling, which is currently on hold, came in response to a lawsuit filed by California officials who argued that local law enforcement could manage the situation without military intervention. The decision could create legal challenges for any future attempts to use the Guard in a similar capacity within the state.</p>

          <p>Following a 48-14 blowout loss to TCU, University of North Carolina head coach Bill Belichick gave a blunt assessment of his team's performance. In his first postgame press conference as a college coach, the former New England Patriots leader stated that the Tar Heels have "a lot of work to do" and must improve in all aspects of the game. Despite an impressive opening touchdown drive, UNC was unable to sustain momentum against the Horned Frogs. Belichick acknowledged that TCU was clearly the better team and emphasized the need for his program to regroup quickly for their next game.</p>

Authorities reported that the child suffered significant blood loss from a leg wound and was airlifted to a Miami hospital for treatment. Emergency responders applied two tourniquets to control the bleeding before he was transported. While shark attacks are relatively rare, Florida consistently leads the world in the number of unprovoked bites recorded annually. The specific type of shark involved in this incident has not yet been identified.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have officially begun a ground operation in Gaza City, according to a statement from Chief of the General Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir. The announcement signals an enhancement of military strikes in the region, with reservists having been called up in recent weeks to support the effort. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a video message expressing his appreciation and trust in the IDF soldiers and reservists, stating that the nation is now facing a "decisive stage."

Market strategists note that while both assets benefit from geopolitical uncertainty, Bitcoin's performance has been partly tempered by a significant rotation of capital into Ethereum. This divergence highlights a market seeking both safety in traditional assets like gold and yield in the crypto space. (not investment advice)</p>

The Justice Department argued for dismissal based on sovereign immunity and the plaintiffs' failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that many of the Trump administration's tariffs are illegal, creating significant uncertainty for the shipping industry and raising the possibility of refunding billions of dollars in duties. The decision has thrown trade deals into question, though a stay is in place until October 14, and an appeal to the Supreme Court is expected. Logistics professionals report that shippers are currently maintaining a cautious, wait-and-see approach, with no immediate changes to their operations.

The company has already seen a double-digit lift in spending from pros who utilize these credit accounts.

          <p>The deepening strategic partnership between Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping is inadvertently strengthening the alliance system of the United States and its allies. This article suggests that by treating the West as a unified adversary, Moscow and Beijing are discouraging Western nations from seeking separate arrangements with them. Despite opportunities to exploit divisions, both leaders have prioritized their anti-Western alignment, with China continuing to support Russia's war in Ukraine and alienating its neighbors in Asia. This dynamic effectively reinforces the established global order that both Putin and Xi seek to challenge.</p>

          <p>A provision for a 0% tax rate on long-term capital gains, combined with new deductions in President Trump's recent tax legislation, may create a significant opportunity for investors. Financial planners note that more individuals could qualify for this bracket, which applies to those with taxable income below certain thresholds. This allows for "tax-gain harvesting," a strategy of selling profitable assets without incurring taxes, or selling and rebuying assets to reset their cost basis for future tax savings. For 2025, the 0% rate applies to single filers with taxable income of $48,350 or less. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an advice column, a 79-year-old woman describes the emotional turmoil of being the sole caretaker for her 88-year-old husband, who has dementia. She explains that their 35-year marriage has been loveless for decades, and she now struggles to provide care without feelings of love or concern, while being unable to leave him in his vulnerable state. The columnist advises her to release any guilt and reframe her perspective, separating the man who needs care from the husband who caused her pain. He also encourages her to find small, personal ways to care for her own well-being amidst the difficult circumstances.</p>

          <p>Elias Morgan has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 45 years for the murder of prison officer Lenny Scott. The court found that Morgan carried out the "execution" as a revenge killing four years after Scott lawfully confiscated a phone from his prison cell. The phone's discovery had exposed Morgan's illicit relationship with a female officer. Scott was shot six times outside a gym in Skelmersdale, Lancashire, in February 2024. During sentencing, the judge described the murder as a profound tragedy, while the victim's family condemned Morgan as a violent coward.</p>

          <p>A report commissioned by NHS England reveals that people with learning disabilities and autism are dying almost two decades younger than the general population. The review found that in 2023, life expectancy for this group was 62.5 years, and 39% of their deaths were classified as avoidable, nearly double the rate for the wider population. The most common causes of avoidable death included influenza, pneumonia, and heart disease. Advocacy groups have called the figures shocking and unacceptable, while the NHS has stated it is implementing more staff training and earlier patient identification to improve care.</p>

This development highlights Ukraine's effort to create its own standoff munitions, which allow aircraft to strike targets from a safer distance, reducing reliance on limited supplies of Western-provided ordnance. The weapon appears to be a kit that converts a standard 500-kilogram bomb into a guided munition. This innovation provides Ukraine with a lower-cost solution to conduct surgical strikes and maintain pressure on Russian forces across the front lines.</p>

          <p>Qualifying for a reverse mortgage, a loan that allows seniors to convert home equity into cash, involves several key requirements set by the federal government for its most common version, the HECM. A borrower must be at least 62 years old, the property must be their primary residence, and they must have substantial home equity. Lenders also conduct a financial assessment to ensure the homeowner can still cover property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Additionally, mandatory counseling from an independent third party is required to ensure applicants fully understand the loan's implications before approval.</p>

The trend is part of a global rise in borrowing costs, influenced by geopolitical tensions and US trade policies.
