          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual assault ring, has died at 41 by suicide, according to her family. Giuffre had accused powerful figures, including Prince Andrew, of sexual assault. She claimed she was trafficked and abused as a teenager. Her death comes after she posted on Instagram about suffering from renal failure following a car crash. Epstein was arrested in 2019 on sex-trafficking charges but died by suicide in jail while awaiting trial.</p>

          <p>Iran and the United States are engaging in a third round of talks concerning Iran's nuclear activities, raising hopes for a new agreement to prevent further conflict in the Middle East. President Trump expressed optimism about reaching a deal, contrasting with his decision to abandon a previous nuclear agreement in 2018. The outcome of these talks could significantly impact regional and global security by potentially averting a U.S.-backed Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities and preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Alberta, Canada, separatist sentiment is growing, fueled by concerns over national unity and the influence of U.S. President Donald Trump. Some Albertans feel more aligned with the United States than the rest of Canada, citing cultural and economic reasons. This sentiment is influencing the federal election, with some warning of a "national unity crisis" if Alberta's demands regarding oil and gas production are not met. While outright separation remains unlikely, the issue poses a significant challenge to the country's next prime minister, regardless of party affiliation.</p>

The DOJ's expert witness countered that Chrome could be transferred to another company without losing functionality, but Google maintains its contributions to the Chromium project are unmatched.</p>

          <p>Joseph Koenig was found guilty of first-degree murder for throwing a rock that killed Alexa Bartell in Colorado. The jury also convicted him on multiple counts of attempted murder and assault related to other vehicles targeted in the rock-throwing attacks. Two co-defendants testified against Koenig as part of their plea agreements, claiming he threw the fatal rock.
