            <p>Governor Gavin Newsom signed a $2.8 billion bailout to address California's Medicaid program deficit, which has been inflated by the expansion of coverage to include undocumented immigrants. Republicans have criticized the program's sustainability and the impact on healthcare access for legal residents. The additional funds will maintain the program's operations through June, benefiting around 15 million Californians, including non-citizens. Newsom's budget proposal estimates the cost of covering undocumented immigrants at $8.4 billion for 2024-2025. </p>

            <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in a federal antitrust trial, defending Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp against FTC allegations that the company is a monopoly. The FTC argues that Meta's ownership of these platforms gives it excessive control over the social media market and seeks to force Meta to divest them. Zuckerberg countered claims that he did not invest in developing Instagram and emphasized Facebook's initial struggles with mobile users. The trial's outcome could significantly impact Meta's business empire and the FTC's approach to challenging Big Tech.</p>

            <p>Harvard University has rejected demands from the Trump administration to alter its policies, including DEI programs and screening international students, risking nearly $9 billion in federal funding. Harvard President Alan Garber stated that the demands represent undue governmental regulation of the university's intellectual conditions and violate its First Amendment rights. The administration's requests included eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and scrutinizing international students for views deemed hostile to American values. The university argues that federal funding supports vital research and innovation, and that it has taken steps to combat antisemitism.</p>

            <p>A vaccine expert has voiced concerns about the potential normalization of child measles deaths, as the U.S. experiences a significant measles outbreak with over 700 cases and three deaths this year. The expert suggests the federal response is under scrutiny due to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s history of spreading misinformation about vaccines. Despite the availability of a highly effective measles vaccine, outbreaks persist across six states, raising questions about the administration's commitment to public health and vaccine promotion.</p>

            <p>China's economy is facing concerns of a potential "summer blue" period, where growth declines in the second quarter after an initial "open door red" start. This pattern has been observed in previous years, with robust first-quarter growth followed by a slowdown. Concerns are rising as China prepares to release its first-quarter GDP growth, with economists estimating an average growth of 5.16%.

            <p>Apple shares rose, pushing the company's market cap back above $3 trillion after the Trump administration exempted phones, computers, and chips from new tariffs. Wall Street analysts expressed relief that Apple would be able to withstand the tariffs. However, administration officials warned that the exemptions were temporary and could change. Uncertainty about the future helps explain Apple's relatively muted gain on Friday. (not investment advice)</p>
