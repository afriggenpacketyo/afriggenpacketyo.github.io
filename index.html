          <p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz has strongly condemned the Federal Communications Commission chairman's calls for action against ABC over comments made by host Jimmy Kimmel. Cruz compared the chairman's rhetoric, which suggested regulators could act "the easy way or the hard way," to mafia tactics straight out of the film "Goodfellas." While expressing personal disdain for Kimmel and satisfaction that his show was suspended, Cruz warned that empowering the government to police speech sets a perilous precedent that could be used against conservatives in the future.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has dismissed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Donald Trump against The New York Times, criticizing the complaint as an improper political attack rather than a serious legal document. Judge Steven Merryday stated the 85-page filing was filled with "tedious and burdensome" language unsuited for a legal complaint, comparing it to a "megaphone for public relations." While the judge did not rule on the case's legal merits, he gave Trump's lawyers 28 days to submit a revised, more professional complaint not exceeding 40 pages.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, is resigning from his position following pressure from the Trump administration to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Siebert's office had been investigating mortgage fraud allegations against James for months but had not found sufficient evidence to secure an indictment. The resignation deepens concerns that the Department of Justice is being politically weaponized, as it follows President Trump's public statement that he wanted Siebert removed from his post.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation to impose a new $100,000 annual fee on H-1B visa applications, a move that could significantly impact the U.S. tech industry's ability to hire foreign talent. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the policy is designed to encourage companies to "Train Americans" and hire recent U.S. graduates instead of foreign workers. The tech sector, which heavily relies on the H-1B program, has criticized the fee as a disincentive to attract top global talent, while immigration law experts question the executive branch's legal authority to impose such a fee.</p>

          <p>The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), with a newly appointed panel, has voted to change several key vaccine recommendations. For COVID-19, the committee moved away from a broad recommendation for most adults, instead advising vaccination based on "individual-based decision-making" after consulting a doctor. For children under four, the panel now supports separate MMR and varicella shots over the combined MMRV vaccine due to a slightly higher risk of febrile seizures. A vote on the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for newborns was tabled for future discussion.</p>

The final witness, an FBI agent, presented evidence showing Routh had been living at a gas station and conducting surveillance on the former president for a month. Investigators detailed Routh's internet searches for high-powered weapons and his alleged text messages seeking rocket-propelled grenades to prevent Trump from being elected.

          <p>Recent threats by President Trump and the FCC Chairman to revoke broadcast licenses have highlighted the federal government's regulatory control over networks like ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox. These networks use public airwaves and are required by the FCC to operate in the "public interest, convenience and necessity." While this power is typically invoked over issues like obscenity or children's programming, the current administration is targeting news coverage and commentary it deems politically biased. Legal experts note that revoking a license is a complex process that would likely face significant legal challenges.</p>

As one of over 2,000 models calling for government regulation, Gandy fears that without protective measures, AI could irreparably damage the industry and negatively impact the mental health of young people.</p>

          <p>Estonia has invoked Article 4 of the NATO treaty to request urgent consultations with allies after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace for 12 minutes. The Estonian government condemned the incursion over the Gulf of Finland as "brazen" and summoned Russia's chargé d'affaires to lodge a formal protest. NATO confirmed its jets intercepted the Russian aircraft, calling the incident "reckless Russian behaviour." The move marks the second time in a week a NATO member has sought Article 4 consultations, escalating regional tensions amid the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Canada's women's rugby team delivered a stunning semi-final victory over New Zealand, ending the six-time champions' 11-year undefeated streak at the World Cup. The Canadian side, which had to fundraise to even attend the tournament, dominated the first half and held on for a historic win. The result was described as "seismic" and a "fairytale," as New Zealand had not lost a knockout game in the competition since 1991. Canada now advances to its first World Cup final since 2014, where they will face either France or England.</p>

          <p>Recent votes by the CDC's advisory committee (ACIP) are raising concerns that the U.S. may be heading toward a two-tiered system for vaccine access. The panel's decision to remove the combined MMRV vaccine from the recommended childhood schedule will disproportionately affect low-income children covered by the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. While privately insured families may still have access to the convenient single shot, children on VFC will not, creating new hurdles and potential health disparities. This move signals a potential fracturing of a long-successful public health program.</p>

The Typhon system can launch missiles with a range of 500km to 5,500km.

          <p>A senior UK cabinet minister has dismissed President Donald Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to stop asylum seekers crossing the English Channel. During his state visit, Trump advocated for using military force to handle illegal migration, a method he has employed at the U.S. southern border. UK Trade Secretary Peter Kyle responded by stating that the UK Border Force has the specific responsibility for policing borders, and while the navy can be called upon if needed, the military's primary focus remains on national defense and global security issues.</p>

The party argues the move would make policing more visible and accessible, making it easier for the public to report crimes and build confidence in law enforcement. They suggest the cost of the "police desk promise" could be covered by abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner roles.
