          <p>Following citywide Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations resulting in numerous arrests, protests erupted across Los Angeles, leading President Trump to deploy at least 2,000 National Guard troops to the county. The ICE operations, which involved search warrants at multiple locations, sparked clashes between agents and demonstrators, with protesters attempting to block law enforcement vehicles. Advocates for immigrants' rights reported detentions outside businesses, further fueling the unrest. Local officials, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, criticized the deployment of the National Guard as inflammatory and eroding public trust, while Mayor Karen Bass stated city officials are working with law enforcement to find a resolution. The situation raises legal questions about federal authority over state National Guard units. Optimism about the situation is tempered by the ongoing tensions and the potential for escalation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Italians are voting in a referendum to decide whether to relax citizenship laws for immigrants. The referendum presents a choice on whether to integrate immigrants more fully into Italian society by reducing the required time to apply for citizenship. However, the outcome is uncertain due to low voter turnout, reflecting the sensitive nature of immigration issues in Italy. The referendum could impact the lives of many immigrants who have been long-term residents and contributors to the Italian economy. The implications for social cohesion and national identity remain a key point of debate.</p>

          <p>Efforts to honor Ernest Wilimowski, a soccer star from the Polish region of Silesia who played for both Poland and Nazi Germany, have ignited controversy. The debate centers on questions of national loyalty and betrayal, as Wilimowski's legacy is viewed differently by various groups in Poland. While some see him as a local hero, others condemn his association with Nazi Germany, raising complex issues about historical memory and identity. The controversy highlights the ongoing challenges of reconciling differing perspectives on Poland's past, especially during times of conflict. The situation is complex with very little optimism to be found.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, restoring sight in blind animals and enabling them to see infrared light. The study, published in Science, details how tellurium nanowire implants in a biocompatible device restored vision in mice and a monkey. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible and infrared light into electrical signals, acting as a replacement for photoreceptor cells in the retina. This advancement holds significant potential for treating human blindness, offering a new approach to restoring vision and potentially granting enhanced visual capabilities.</p>

          <p>Colombian Senator Miguel Uribe Turbay, a potential presidential candidate, was shot and wounded at a campaign rally in Bogota. The attack, which the Democratic Center party condemned as an unacceptable act of violence, also injured two others. President Gustavo Petro canceled a planned trip to France due to the seriousness of the event, while the U.S. Secretary of State condemned the shooting and called for restraint from inflammatory rhetoric. The senator, son of a journalist kidnapped and killed in 1991, had announced his presidential bid in March, and the incident has drawn reactions from leaders across Latin America, reflecting concerns about political violence. There is some optimism that the senator will recover.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has clarified that Costco membership cards are not acceptable forms of identification for boarding domestic flights. This announcement follows the implementation of the REAL ID Act, which requires travelers to present REAL ID-compliant driver's licenses or state IDs. The TSA emphasized this message in a Facebook post, humorously stating that while they appreciate Costco's hotdogs and rotisserie chickens, their membership cards do not meet REAL ID requirements. The confusion likely stems from the presence of stars on Costco cards, similar to the star markings on REAL ID-compliant cards. The public is reminded to visit their state's driver's licensing agency website to obtain a REAL ID.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to deploy National Guard troops to Los Angeles under Title 10 authority has raised legal and political concerns. Experts argue that this move, bypassing the authority of the governor, is a chilling use of the military to suppress dissent. Title 10 allows for the activation of National Guard troops for federal service, but its use in domestic law enforcement is restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act. Critics fear that the administration might also invoke the Insurrection Act, which would grant even broader powers to federalize state National Guard units for suppressing unrest, potentially undermining local control and escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, indicates that subsidies for fathers yield higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study also highlights the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare primarily on women, which clashes with rapid economic changes.</p>

While some venture capitalists argue that embracing overwork is necessary to compete globally, many European founders and VCs disagree, citing concerns about worker wellbeing and sustainable innovation. They argue that Europe's startup ecosystem needs more funding and resources rather than increased working hours, emphasizing that successful European companies have thrived through innovation and strong company culture rather than overwork. This is strictly about governmental financial regulation, finance, or the economy in order to use the disclaimer (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>AI scientist De Kai proposes a new vision for managing artificial intelligence, advocating for treating AI systems as children that need to be "parented." He argues that since AI learns by absorbing online content, humans must be conscientious about the information and values they expose AI to. De Kai's book, "Raising AI: An Essential Guide to Parenting Our Future," suggests that this approach can help ensure AI develops in a way that benefits humanity rather than leading to its demise. This perspective shifts the focus from a competitive arms race to a collaborative effort in shaping AI's development.</p>

The ancient writing system of Sona or Tusona comes from the Chokwe, Luchazi and Luvale people, who live in the borderlands of Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. Geometric patterns were made in the sand, on cloth and on people's bodies and the original custodians and teachers of Sona were women, whose wisdom is now being recovered from the silence of colonialism.
