          <p>This New York Times article details the controversial deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man, to El Salvador, despite a judge's order prohibiting it. The deportation triggered a fierce debate among officials in the Department of Homeland Security, Justice Department, and State Department, revealing the administration's efforts to control the narrative and downplay the danger Abrego Garcia might face in El Salvador. The article further exposes discussions among officials to portray Abrego Garcia as a leader of MS-13, despite lacking evidence, and the subsequent firing of a Justice Department lawyer who advocated for his return to the United States.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer advises investors to remain patient as the stock market experiences a downturn due to rising bond yields and uncertainty surrounding the federal budget bill. Cramer believes that once the budget negotiations conclude and a bill is passed, investor sentiment will improve, focusing on the potential for tax cuts to stimulate economic growth. He acknowledges the current market stress caused by higher rates, new tariffs, and inflation, but remains optimistic about the economy's ability to recover. According to Cramer, the U.S. is so wealthy that it can 'kick the can down the road for decades before the national debt blows up in our face.' (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Donald Trump presented videos and articles he claimed showed that white Afrikaners were being persecuted in South Africa. Ramaphosa disputed Trump's claims, noting that black people were more likely to be victims of violence. Trump also brought up the issue of land seizures from white farmers, while Ramaphosa emphasized that the government's policy was against the violence and that his delegation included white South Africans. The article portrays Trump's approach as an ambush, contrasting it with Ramaphosa's measured response and attempts to steer the conversation back to trade and economic investment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas lawmakers are advancing a bill aimed at clarifying medical exceptions within the state's restrictive abortion law, which has been in effect since 2022. The proposal specifies that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency causing major bodily impairment and defines a "life-threatening" condition as one capable of causing death. While not expanding abortion access or including exceptions for rape or incest, the bill represents a pivot for Texas Republicans who have long defended the law, but some abortion-rights advocates remain skeptical about its impact. The Texas Supreme Court previously ruled against a group of women who were denied abortions after experiencing serious pregnancy complications.</p>

The state claims it remains "in the dark" regarding the city's security measures, while a spokesperson for Mayor Karen Bass asserts that a strict security plan is in place. The affluent coastal enclave has been closed to the public since the January wildfire, and the reopening of PCH necessitates the establishment of new security checkpoints.</p>

Being flexible with travel dates and destinations can help score deals on airfare. Setting a budget for dining out and using credit card points and airline rewards can also cut down on costs.

Irwin was first caught in October when officers lured him with a large bag, banking on its similarity to a kangaroo pouch. This time, officers had to physically detain him after he attempted to jump past an officer. Kangaroos are legal to own in Colorado but are native to Australia and used to more boundless spaces than a private owner can typically provide.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met with House Republican hard-liners to negotiate a far-reaching tax and spending bill, aiming to pass it by the end of the month. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $2.3 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years. Trump faces opposition from the House Freedom Caucus, who want additional spending cuts, and Republicans in Democratic-leaning districts, who want bigger tax cuts for their voters. Democrats uniformly oppose the legislation, saying it would benefit the rich and unfairly punish lower-income Americans.</p>

          <p>The NFL's spring league meetings saw a failed proposal to ban the "tush push," a play popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles. The Green Bay Packers' proposal fell short of the required 75% majority, with the Eagles and several other teams voting against the ban. The Packers cited player safety and pace of play as reasons to ban the play, but the NFL has previously stated that no injuries have been reported on the tush push. The play will remain legal for the 2025 season.</p>

Experts outside of the agency told me that the policy could also prevent most American children from accessing their initial series of COVID vaccines—essentially guaranteeing that kids will first encounter the virus without protection.</p>

          <p>A federal judge struck down regulations requiring most U.S. employers to provide workers with time off and other accommodations for abortions. The ruling was a victory for conservative lawmakers and religious groups who opposed the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's decision to include abortion among pregnancy-related conditions in regulations on how to implement the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The judge ruled that the EEOC exceeded its authority by including abortion in its regulations. The judge vacated the provision of the EEOC regulations that included abortion as a "related medical condition" of pregnancy and childbirth. However, the rest of the regulations still stand.</p>
