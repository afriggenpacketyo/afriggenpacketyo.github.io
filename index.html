          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with President Trump, aiming to maintain Canada's sovereignty while avoiding conflict, following his election on an anti-Trump platform. Carney emphasized that Canada would not become the 51st U.S. state, a statement met with a noncommittal response from Trump. Despite pre-meeting tensions and criticisms from Trump regarding Canadian dependence on the U.S., the meeting concluded on a positive note, with Trump praising Carney. The leaders discussed trade relations, tariffs, and foreign affairs, but no major breakthroughs were achieved, with both sides acknowledging the need for further negotiations. Optimism score: 55</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported better-than-expected first fiscal-quarter earnings and provided a strong forecast for the current quarter's revenue. However, the company is anticipating a $1.5 billion hit to revenue due to new U.S. regulations restricting the export of AI chips to China. AMD CEO Lisa Su stated that strong demand for its leadership product portfolio would offset these headwinds. The company's data center segment saw a 57% increase in sales, driven by demand for both Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs, though gaming sales declined due to reduced console chip revenue.

This move, announced during a staff meeting, involves eliminating divisions overseeing climate change and energy efficiency, including the Office of Atmospheric Protection.
