          <p>A Public Accounts Committee report has found that the UK government's actions to ensure fair compensation for sub-postmasters wrongly accused in the Post Office scandal have been insufficient. Many victims are yet to receive redress, with the government lacking plans to follow up with eligible individuals. The report highlights slow progress in compensation schemes and a lack of awareness among potential claimants. The committee urges the government to proactively inform postmasters about compensation options, as the long-running public inquiry into the scandal is set to publish its final report in July. The system has been described as not working, and the government must act quickly to right the wrongs done to so many.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to purchase 12 new F-35 A fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear bombs, bolstering its contribution to NATO's airborne nuclear mission. This move signifies the "biggest strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture in a generation," according to Downing Street. While the jets can carry conventional weapons, their capability to be equipped with US-made nuclear bombs underscores the UK's commitment to nuclear deterrence. The decision, to be announced at the upcoming NATO summit, has been praised by NATO leadership and is expected to support thousands of jobs across the UK. The jets will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk, and the investment shows the UK's resolve to meet new nuclear risks.</p>

          <p>The debate over the origins of Covid-19 persists, with the controversy reflecting deep public distrust of science rather than a simple political divide. While some attribute the spread of lab-leak theories to right-wing misinformation, many credible scientists believe the question of the virus's origins remains unsettled. The core issue is a crisis of trust, stemming from longstanding anxieties over virus research, transparency, and inclusiveness in decision-making. Scientists must cultivate trust through transparency, accountability, humility, and relationship-building to address public concerns effectively.</p>

          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani declared victory after leading in the first round of voting, prompting former Gov. Andrew Cuomo to concede. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, gained momentum with younger voters and a progressive platform. Cuomo, seeking a political comeback, conceded and hinted at a possible independent run in the general election. Despite Cuomo's concession, the race will proceed to a ranked-choice count due to no candidate reaching 50% of the vote, with final results expected in July.</p>

          <p>China is expanding avenues for foreign institutions to use the yuan, aiming to challenge the U.S. dollar's dominance as international confidence in the greenback wavers. The People's Bank of China is promoting the internationalization of the digital yuan and expanding access to yuan-denominated futures. These efforts focus on the futures market and promoting bilateral trade settlement in yuan. While global investors are interested in diversifying into China, strict capital controls and geopolitical risks remain significant challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

Mamdani, a democratic socialist, gained support with his progressive platform, including free public buses and city-run grocery stores. His win represents a rejection of the establishment and a desire for enthusiastic and courageous leadership among New York Democrats.</p>
