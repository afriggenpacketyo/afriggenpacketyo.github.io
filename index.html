          <p>An opinion piece challenges Western media narratives on South Africa, highlighting the country's high levels of violence, including farm attacks, and differing views on land ownership. It asserts that South Africa's murder rate is significantly higher than global averages and that farm attacks occur at disproportionately high rates. The article also disputes claims that white South Africans own the majority of agricultural land, arguing that land distribution by productive value is more balanced. Additionally, it notes that South Africans prioritize job creation over land redistribution and largely oppose a recently enacted expropriation law. </p>

          <p>The women of the "No Sex for Fish" cooperative in Kenya, who gained independence by rejecting sexual exploitation in exchange for fish, now face new challenges. Disastrous floods have devastated their village and disrupted their fishing business, while cutbacks in U.S. aid have created anxiety about their access to HIV medication. Eleven of the women are HIV positive and rely on free antiretroviral drugs, but changes in supply and distribution have caused concern. The women are trying to support each other through a savings association, but their survival remains precarious.</p>

          <p>A fire broke out in a hospital ward caring for elderly people in Hamburg, resulting in the deaths of three individuals. Around 220 emergency workers responded to the scene, and more than 35 people were injured, with one person sustaining life-threatening injuries. Firefighters rescued patients, some of whom had mobility issues, using turntable and portable ladders. The cause of the fire is currently unknown, but firefighters were able to prevent the flames from spreading to other parts of the hospital.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have created an infrared contact lens that enables humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lenses combine conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. These upconversion contact lenses (UCLs) convert infrared light with wavelengths between 800 and 1,600 nanometers into visible light. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred, the lenses allow users to recognize patterns, letters, and flashing infrared signals in the dark, and work even better with closed eyes.</p>

          <p>This is a poem by Nicky Vaid, entitled 'How to Open a Hole'. The poem explores themes of loss, loneliness, and the disorientation of trauma through vivid and surreal imagery. It speaks of dreams being siphoned away, the speaker feeling unseen and unheard, and the struggle to find connection in a world that feels fragmented. The poem evokes a sense of darkness and despair, but also hints at the possibility of transformation and finding new perspectives in the aftermath of difficult experiences.</p>
