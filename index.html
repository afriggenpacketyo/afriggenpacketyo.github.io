          <p>Iran has executed two men, Mehdi Hassani and Behrouz Ehsani-Eslamloo, who were accused of working for the exiled militant group Mujahideen-e-Khalq (MEK). The judiciary's official news outlet reported they were convicted of carrying out attacks on civilian infrastructure and producing propaganda for the organization. The men were found guilty of waging war against God, armed rebellion, and undermining national security, with their death sentences upheld by the Supreme Court. The MEK is designated as a terrorist organization by Iran, which human rights groups say is second globally in its use of capital punishment.</p>

          <p>Claressa Shields successfully defended her undisputed women’s heavyweight championship with a commanding unanimous decision victory over Lani Daniels in Detroit. Shields, a native of nearby Flint, controlled the bout from the outset, using superior timing and a varied attack to neutralize her opponent. Although Daniels showed resilience, she was unable to match the champion's output or accuracy throughout the fight. The victory improves Shields' undefeated record to 17-0 and reinforces her status as the only boxer in the four-belt era to be an undisputed champion in three different weight classes.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced it will implement a daily "tactical pause" in military operations in specific areas of Gaza to allow for the distribution of humanitarian aid. The suspension of military activity is scheduled from morning until evening in Al Mawasi, Deir al Balah, and Gaza City and will continue until further notice. This decision, coordinated with the United Nations and other international groups, aims to open secure corridors for aid convoys to deliver food and medicine. The move comes amid increasing international pressure to address the worsening malnutrition crisis within the enclave.</p>

          <p>The presence of firearms was a recurring theme in the relationship between Ashley and Doug Benefield, culminating in his fatal shooting. During her trial, Ashley testified she was carrying a .45 caliber gun in her bra on the night she met Doug and that she shot him in self-defense after he became violent. Prosecutors argued she was a manipulator who used the weapons as part of a plot to gain sole custody of their daughter. Investigators found two other loaded guns in the house after the shooting, which the defense claimed was due to her fear as an abused woman.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing global conflicts and economic uncertainty, the war in Ukraine is receiving less attention from policymakers. This analysis suggests that former President Trump's approach to trade and foreign policy has pushed both Russia and Ukraine into a more isolated position. Trump recently issued a 50-day deadline for Russia to reach a peace deal or face severe sanctions, a threat some analysts believe is unlikely to significantly influence Vladimir Putin's actions. The article notes that Ukraine, reliant on Western support, is facing internal political pressures while navigating growing international pessimism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India is facing a growing crisis of student suicides, which now account for 7.6% of the nation's total, with an estimated 13,000 students dying by suicide annually. Experts point to a combination of extreme academic pressure, toxic competitiveness, and a lack of adequate mental health support within educational institutions. Neuropsychiatrists and prevention advocates argue that students are often prepared for exams but not for life's failures, calling for integrated mental health education and better support systems. The Indian government has acknowledged the problem and is implementing measures to provide psychological support for students, teachers, and families.</p>

None of the births were induced or scheduled, and Drake feels it is a "sign from God." A mathematics professor calculated that the probability of four random people sharing a birthday is infinitesimal, making this family's story exceptionally unique.

Writing from her experience, she notes that tactics include charging for tap water, offering only expensive drinks, or swapping for cheaper wine. To avoid this unofficial "tourist tax," she advises visitors to be polite, learn key French phrases like asking for tap water, and always check the bill carefully before paying. While upselling is a normal part of hospitality, she argues that outright scamming is unacceptable, even in an era of overtourism.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has made phone calls to the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia, urging an immediate ceasefire following recent deadly border clashes. Both nations thanked Trump for his efforts, with Cambodia agreeing to the ceasefire and Thailand emphasizing the need for dialogue first, though shelling reportedly continued overnight. The intervention comes a week before significant U.S. tariffs on both countries are set to take effect, with Trump stating that trade discussions would be inappropriate until the fighting stops. The dispute over the border has killed at least 33 people.</p>

          <p>Turkey has officially recorded its highest temperature ever, hitting 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 degrees Fahrenheit) in the southeastern town of Silopi. The new record comes as a severe heat wave grips much of the eastern Mediterranean, with temperatures up to 12 degrees Celsius above seasonal averages. This extreme heat, combined with dry conditions and strong winds, has fueled disastrous wildfires across the country, resulting in evacuations and multiple fatalities. The heat wave is also impacting neighboring countries, with Greece battling major fires and requesting assistance from the European Union.</p>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the iconic and often controversial frontman of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath, has passed away. Known as the "Prince of Darkness," Osbourne's distinctive vocals and theatrical stage presence helped define the sound and image of heavy metal in the 1970s. After his departure from Black Sabbath, he launched a highly successful solo career with hits like "Crazy Train" and "Mr. Crowley." Throughout his life, Osbourne was as famous for his wild offstage antics and struggles with addiction as he was for his music, later gaining a new generation of fans through the reality TV show "The Osbournes."</p>

          <p>Despite early home runs from Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández, the Los Angeles Dodgers fell to the Boston Red Sox 4-2. Dodgers starter Clayton Kershaw struggled to hold the initial lead, giving up three runs in the second inning and another in the fifth. In contrast, Red Sox pitcher Garrett Crochet recovered from the early homers, striking out ten batters over six innings and preventing further damage. The Dodgers' efforts were also hampered by several runners being thrown out on the bases, and the game ended with Mookie Betts striking out as the potential tying run.</p>

          <p>Greece is fighting five major wildfires across the country, fueled by a severe heatwave with temperatures forecast to reach 44C (111F).

          <p>China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security has officially designated "drone flight planner" as a new occupation, reflecting the rapid growth of the country's low-altitude economy. This emerging sector, which includes both manned and unmanned aerial activities below 1,000 meters, has been identified by Beijing as a strategic industry for driving innovation and job creation. The new role involves planning flight paths for multiple drones, developing mission parameters, and managing on-site operations. This official recognition is expected to attract more young, tech-savvy talent to the burgeoning field of drone technology.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced that nearly 4,000 of its employees have chosen to leave the agency through a deferred resignation program initiated by the Trump administration. This reduction represents an estimated 20% of NASA's total workforce, which will shrink from 18,000 to 14,000 employees. The move is part of a broader plan to reduce the federal workforce and comes amid proposed budget cuts for the agency. While the administration's budget request suggests a significant funding decrease, recent legislation has allocated additional long-term funding for key missions, including a return to the moon.</p>
