          <p>The U.S. Northern Command addressed photos published in the San Francisco Chronicle depicting National Guardsmen sleeping on floors during the Los Angeles protests. A spokesperson stated that the soldiers were resting while off-mission due to security concerns preventing them from traveling to better accommodations, and they have access to food and water. California Governor Gavin Newsom had previously shared the photos on social media, criticizing President Trump's treatment of the troops, who Newsom claimed were deployed without adequate resources. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass emphasized that the unrest is confined to a few blocks in the downtown area. Optimism score of 40.</p>
