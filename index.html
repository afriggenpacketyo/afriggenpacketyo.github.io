          <p>In a flashback article, Fox News reports on President Joe Biden's response to Special Counsel Robert Hur's report, which raised concerns about Biden's mental acuity. The article quotes Biden dismissing the report's description of him as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory." The report, stemming from an investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents, amplified Republican criticisms about his fitness for office. The article concludes by noting the subsequent pressure from Democrats for Biden to drop his re-election campaign due to his age and performance, leading to his eventual withdrawal and Vice President Kamala Harris's defeat by Trump.</p>

The article describes the event, noting that winds of 60 to 70 mph carried dust from dry farmlands into the city, impacting travel and outdoor activities, such as a high school graduation ceremony. The dust storm caused ground stops at Midway International Airport and backed up expressways as drivers struggled with near-zero visibility.

Prosecutors aim to use her testimony to demonstrate a pattern of criminal behavior and the existence of a racketeering conspiracy led by Combs. The article also notes the defense's argument that the case is about domestic violence, not sex trafficking, while prosecutors emphasize the element of coercion and fear in Ms. Ventura's experiences.</p>

Abuse was the norm at Satyam, and the children were very afraid to talk about what they endured.

          <p>Michelle Goldberg argues that the Democratic Party faces a reckoning for its handling of President Biden's declining health and cognitive abilities, pointing to groupthink and risk aversion as key factors.
