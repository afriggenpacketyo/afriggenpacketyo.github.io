          <p>A new book, "The Age of Diagnosis," argues that modern medicine's eagerness to diagnose and preemptively screen patients is creating problems. The author, Dr. Suzanne O'Sullivan, advocates for "slow medicine," where doctors and patients take time to develop a relationship, monitor symptoms, and carefully consider a diagnosis. While acknowledging the benefits of advanced medical technology, she cautions against overdiagnosis, which can lead to unnecessary treatments and anxiety. She suggests that diagnosis is a clinical skill that requires understanding the patient's story in the context of tests.</p>

          <p>King Charles is visiting Canada for the first time since his coronation to deliver the Speech from the Throne, opening the 45th session of Canada's parliament. This marks the first time a king has opened a new session of parliament, though George VI granted royal assent to bills in 1939. The invitation to the King is viewed as a strategic move amidst strained ties between Canada and the United States. The visit includes meetings with key Canadian leaders and a tree-planting ceremony.</p>

          <p>An Austrian court has overturned the perjury conviction of former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who had been sentenced to eight months suspended jail sentence. Kurz was initially found guilty of giving false testimony to a parliamentary inquiry in 2020 regarding his role in appointing executives for the ÖBAG state holding company. He argued that he was interrupted during his testimony and that the judge was biased. Kurz is still under investigation for corruption in a separate case.</p>

The display, which included a skull dressed in a habit, is considered a way for Catholics to revere their saints.
