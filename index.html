          <p>President Trump hinted at a possible resolution with Harvard University regarding the enrollment of international students, even as a federal judge blocked the administration from revoking Harvard's access to a crucial student visa system. Trump stated that negotiations were progressing well and a "mindbogglingly" historic deal could be reached soon. The Department of Homeland Security had previously threatened to revoke Harvard's student visa certification due to alleged failures in addressing campus antisemitism, leading to a lawsuit from the university. The conflict has significant implications for Harvard, where approximately one in four students are from outside the United States, with potential caps on foreign student enrollment also being discussed.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil on bail, after he was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for over three months. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil was not a flight risk or a threat to the community, despite the government's claims that his presence in the US could pose adverse foreign policy consequences. Khalil, a prominent voice in Columbia's pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested in March, sparking demonstrations in New York and Washington DC. His attorneys argued that the government was violating his free speech rights, and the judge expressed skepticism of the government's requests to keep him detained, setting the stage for his reunion with his family. </p>

The indictment states that Suzanne Morphew's death was determined to be a homicide caused by intoxication from a chemical mixture known as BAM, used for sedating animals, and that Barry Morphew had access to this substance.

          <p>The UK Home Secretary is expected to proscribe Palestine Action, effectively designating it as a terrorist organization, following a break-in at RAF Brize Norton. Activists sprayed two military planes with red paint, prompting a security review at military bases across the UK. The move has drawn criticism from Amnesty International UK, which expressed concern over the use of counter-terrorism powers against protest groups. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer condemned the incident as "disgraceful," while some MPs have called for the group to be banned.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court sided with President Trump and congressional Republicans in a challenge to Californiaâ€™s emission standards, reviving a lawsuit from the oil and gas industry. The justices ruled that fuel makers had standing to sue over California's strict emissions standards, arguing that the state was abusing its power by addressing global climate change rather than a local air-quality problem. The ruling was overshadowed by recent actions from Trump and Republicans to disapprove regulations that would have allowed California to enforce new regulations for zero-emission vehicles. California's Attorney General expressed disappointment but vowed to continue defending the state's authority under the Clean Air Act.</p>

Under the GOP-proposed "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), borrowers may face significantly larger bills compared to the Biden administration's SAVE plan. The plan would also extend the repayment timeline to 30 years before loan forgiveness, which could delay major life milestones for borrowers. Critics argue that the proposed changes would make it more difficult for borrowers to manage their debt and could lead to higher default rates. (not investment advice)</p>
