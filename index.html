          <p>An opinion piece asserts that anti-Israel protests on college campuses are orchestrated by Hamas-aligned networks, leading to violence and intimidation against Jewish people. The author cites examples such as Molotov cocktails thrown at peaceful protestors in Boulder, Colorado, and attacks on Jewish individuals and institutions. The piece argues that current strategies to combat anti-Semitism are insufficient and calls for holding perpetrators accountable through criminal prosecution and disrupting their support networks. The author suggests that universities should not use taxpayer money to fund discrimination and that those who enable anti-Semitic activity must be addressed to tackle the root of the problem. The piece concludes that protests have changed, and strategies to address them must also evolve. </p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the deployment of at least 2,000 National Guard troops to California in response to ongoing protests in Los Angeles following a series of immigration raids. Demonstrations have intensified, with protesters clashing with federal Border Patrol agents in riot gear. The protests were sparked by ICE agents arresting at least 44 immigrants in raids on multiple locations on Friday. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has condemned the ICE raids, stating they "sow terror in our communities," while ICE officials have criticized the protests as "appalling."</p>

Analysts warn that this could have significant implications for the asset management industry, potentially impacting cross-border income earned by hedge funds and private equity funds.

          <p>Democrats are engaged in extensive self-criticism following Kamala Harris's election loss, questioning their values and direction. While some see this introspection as necessary, others view it as excessive self-pity. Columnists debate whether this self-reproach is useful or if it overshadows the need for strong leadership in opposition to the current administration. The discussion also touches on the role of right-wing influence and the importance of focusing on issues beyond election politics.</p>

          <p>MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell is facing a defamation trial for spreading false claims about Dominion Voting Systems and its former executive, Eric Coomer, related to the 2020 election. Coomer, like other individuals targeted by right-wing conspiracy theories, experienced harassment and was forced into hiding. Lindell, who has refused to settle, maintains that he believed his statements were true. The trial highlights the real-world consequences of spreading lies about innocent people and the ongoing impact of Trump's Big Lie.</p>

          <p>The Santa Cruz Wharf, a popular tourist destination, faces an uncertain future after a section collapsed during a winter storm. City officials are planning a partial repair, but a full restoration depends on state funding, which is uncertain due to budget deficits. The incident raises questions about rebuilding in the context of climate change and rising sea levels, as other California piers have also sustained damage from recent storms. The partial repair aims to strengthen the broken end, but the long-term viability of the wharf remains a concern.</p>

          <p>A major tsunami poses a risk to the entire California coast, potentially causing over $12.6 billion in damage and impacting more than 680,000 residents. Distant-source tsunamis, originating from earthquakes in Alaska or Chile, could provide hours of warning but result in significant inundation. Near-source tsunamis, triggered by nearby earthquakes, could strike in as little as 10 minutes, leaving little time for evacuation. The worst-case scenarios vary by region, with Southern California facing potential casualties of over 350 and the North Coast at risk of devastation from a Cascadia subduction zone event.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that California faces a significant tsunami risk from near-shore earthquakes, which could generate life-threatening waves in as little as 10 minutes. Heavily populated coastal communities may not have enough time for emergency alerts or evacuations. Data shows that locally generated tsunamis could reach heights of up to 30 feet in some areas, depending on the quake's strength and location. Some communities, like Alameda and Newport Beach, face immense evacuation challenges due to dense populations and limited exits, highlighting the need for preparedness and quick action.</p>

          <p>Indigenous fishermen in Chile are protesting the salmon industry's impact on their ancestral way of life and the environment. Reinaldo Caro, one of the last Kawésqar fishermen, laments the contamination caused by salmon farms, which discharge feces and medication into the seabed. The salmon industry, a major export for Chile, is criticized for damaging ecosystems and using large quantities of antibiotics. Legislation is pending to halt the industry's expansion and protect the Kawésqar people's traditional way of life, but concerns remain about the economic impact of restricting the industry.</p>
