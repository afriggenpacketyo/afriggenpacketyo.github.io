          <h2>Royal Experts Disagree on Likelihood of Reconciliation Between Princes William and Harry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 04:00:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Royal experts are divided on whether Prince William will reconcile with Prince Harry, with some suggesting the rift has widened due to Harry's public criticisms of the royal family. One expert noted that Harry has not expressed any regrets for his behavior, while another believes King Charles may need to intervene to facilitate a reconciliation. Harry has stated his desire for reconciliation, particularly given King Charles's cancer diagnosis and his security concerns, but also expressed feeling let down by the establishment. Kinsey Schofield noted that Harry and Meghan's recent interviews seem to be contradicting one another.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new impact assessment estimates that assisted deaths in England and Wales could exceed 4,000 in the tenth year after a potential law change, representing less than 1% of all deaths. The report analyzes the financial implications, projecting potential NHS savings from reduced hospital and hospice care, ranging from Â£5.84m to Â£59.6m annually after a decade. However, it also anticipates significant costs, including over Â£10m annually for staffing an assisted dying service and substantial training expenses. The Department of Health and Social Care maintains neutrality on the issue, while proponents emphasize compassionate end-of-life care, and opponents raise concerns about risks to vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong is facing his first major test in the general election, amidst concerns over potential impacts from tariffs imposed by the US. The election is seen as a gauge of the People's Action Party's (PAP) popularity, which has ruled Singapore since 1965, and Wong's leadership. Voters are primarily concerned with the rising cost of living and housing availability, while the PAP emphasizes its efforts to help citizens cope with these challenges. A strong showing for the PAP would solidify Wong's leadership, while a significant opposition presence would push for greater scrutiny and debate in Parliament.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's promise of a "golden age" for the US economy is off to a chaotic start, with GDP shrinking in the first quarter due to trade distortions and weaker consumer spending. Trump attributes any negative numbers to his predecessor, while claiming credit for positive reports. The economy faces challenges from the administration's plans to overhaul the world economy, including tariffs that have caused confusion and uncertainty for businesses. While it's too soon to determine if tariffs will lead to a recession, the execution of these policies has created widespread apprehension among voters.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst economic challenges such as inflation and housing affordability, as well as navigating relations with a volatile Washington. Voters express concerns about the rising cost of living, though both major parties have offered small-scale measures to alleviate economic pressures. The election also reflects a shift away from major parties towards independent candidates, signaling dissatisfaction with traditional political offerings.

          <p>Over 80 people have died in recent violence in Druze-majority areas of Syria, sparked by a blasphemous audio recording and escalating into armed clashes. Unidentified groups attacked the town of Jaramana, leading to widespread violence and the involvement of armed Druze community members. The situation has calmed following agreements to allow Syrian government forces into the areas. Meanwhile, Israeli jets bombed Damascus, with Israel citing the need to protect the Druze community, though this interference is exacerbating tensions and destabilizing Syria's political transition.</p>

          <p>The blood of Tim Friede, a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, has led to an "unparalleled" antivenom, according to scientists. Antibodies in his blood have shown protection against fatal doses from various snake species in animal tests. This could be a significant step toward a universal antivenom, addressing the issue of snakebites that kill up to 140,000 people annually. Friede's motivation was to develop better therapies for snakebite victims, and his work has identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that can target classes of neurotoxins.</p>

          <h2>US Tariffs on Imported Car Parts Take Effect, Raising Industry Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 25% import tax on key car parts has taken effect in the US, increasing pressure on the automotive industry. While Donald Trump eased the measure, the new tariff is intended to push carmakers to increase US manufacturing. However, analysts predict this will likely lead to higher costs for businesses and consumers, with any immediate expansions in the US potentially impacting production elsewhere. Concerns about price hikes have prompted a sales surge, but companies warn of increased costs and uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods is cutting into advertising revenue for Meta, Alphabet, and other platforms. The expansion of the loophole gave rise to Temu, Shein, and other low-cost online retailers, which led to a surge in digital advertising. However, President Trump eliminated the exemption, subjecting goods made in China and Hong Kong to import taxes, with Temu starting to add "import charges" to certain products. As a result, Temu and Shein have reduced their advertising spending, and their apps have fallen off the charts of most downloaded apps.</p>
