          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, actions by the Trump administration to penalize critics have sparked a significant First Amendment debate. Officials have threatened to revoke visas, address federal employees' social media posts, and pursue "hate speech," a term legal experts note has no legal definition and is broadly protected. Scholars argue that while celebrating violence may be in poor taste, it is generally protected speech, and government pressure on private companies to fire employees sets a dangerous precedent for censorship.</p>

          <p>During President Trump's state visit, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer successfully avoided major public disagreements, projecting a partnership on defense, trade, and technology. However, the true test of the visit lies in whether Starmer influenced Trump's thinking on key issues like Ukraine and Gaza during their private discussions. Based on their joint press conference, Starmer made little headway on Middle East policy, though there appeared to be some common ground regarding the need to pressure Russia economically.</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has stated that the decision to drop spying charges against two British men was not influenced by any "outside pressure." The case against a former parliamentary researcher and a teacher, who were accused of gathering information for China, was dropped because the evidence did not meet the legal threshold for trial. The prosecutor noted that a conviction would have required proving China was an "enemy" under an outdated 1911 law, a provision since updated in new national security legislation.</p>

A federal judge in Washington D.C. blocked the deportation of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, stating the government's justification "crumbled like a house of cards."
