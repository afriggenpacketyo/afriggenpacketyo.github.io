            <p>A hearing for Bryan Kohberger, accused of the 2022 killings of four University of Idaho students, addressed evidence admissibility for his upcoming trial. Key arguments included limiting online shopping data, roommate testimony, and the 911 call audio. The defense sought to prevent autism-related characteristics from being used as aggravating factors in a potential death penalty phase, while the prosecution wants to use a photo Kohberger took of himself hours after the killings as evidence. Jury selection is scheduled to begin July 30, with the trial commencing August 11 in Boise, expected to last nearly three months.</p>

            <p>US stocks experienced historic gains after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on higher tariffs for most countries, reverting to a 10% import tax rate, while simultaneously raising tariffs on Chinese goods to 125%. The S&P 500 soared by 9.5%, marking its largest single-day rally since 2008, following days of market turmoil caused by the initial tariff announcements. While the levies on Chinese goods remain an economic challenge, Trump indicated a willingness to negotiate and consider exemptions for individual companies. The Dow ended the day up more than 7.8%, and the Nasdaq skyrocketed more than 12%.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is escalating its efforts to undermine state environmental policies with an executive order aimed at curtailing states' ability to set their own climate laws, particularly targeting California's initiatives. The order directs the Attorney General to identify and halt the enforcement of state laws addressing climate change, environmental justice, greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon taxes. This action could affect California's cap-and-trade program, tailpipe emission standards, and the Polluters Pay Climate Superfund Act, leading to potential legal challenges and further conflict between the federal government and states like California.</p>

            <p>A 59-year-old San Diego woman, Yafang Zhou, was found trapped in a storm drain after being missing for two weeks and later died from her injuries.

Authorities are investigating how she became trapped, as no open maintenance hole covers were found in the area. The case is considered unusual, with questions remaining about her entry into the storm drain system and her activities leading up to the incident.</p>

Concerns about a slowing economy and reduced discretionary spending have also contributed to the rush, with companies stocking up on products affected by the levies, including those from China, Vietnam, Thailand and India.

The school, however, maintains that multiple investigations found no wrongdoing by staff, and that the expert opinions represent a "difference of opinion".

            <p>The stock market rallied following President Trump's partial retreat from his radical trade agenda, but this optimism hinges on the assumption that he will further reduce tariffs. Trump's current trade policy, which includes a 10 percent universal tariff and a 125 percent tariff on China, is still more radical than pre-inauguration worst-case scenarios. If Trump maintains his current course, the US will face surging prices and a heightened risk of recession. Wall Street is betting that Trump will continue retreating from his current position, but this outcome is not guaranteed.</p>

            <p>Constellation Brands, owner of Modelo and Corona, issued a weaker-than-expected outlook for fiscal 2026 and slashed its medium-term forecast due to higher U.S. tariffs on its beer imports from Mexico. The Trump administration imposed a 25% tariff on all imported canned beer and empty aluminum cans. While the company topped Wall Street's estimates for its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, its outlook took precedence. Constellation plans to reposition its portfolio by divesting "mainstream" wines and focusing on premium brands.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for most countries, except China, whose tariffs he raised to 125%. The White House stated that Trump raised tariffs against China because "when you punch at the United States of America, President Trump is going to punch back harder." The article provides a detailed list of the original tariffs Trump threatened, along with the updated rates for each country after the 90-day pause.</p>

The attractions are expected to reset the bar and expectations of guests. However, the park leans heavily into IP and lacks a larger idea or concept.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration replaced the director of the FBI, Kash Patel, as the interim head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and installed Dan Driscoll, secretary of the army, in his place. The move placed control of the agency responsible for enforcing the nation's gun laws to the defense department. The decision to have the army secretary run the ATF could be a precursor to reducing its size and scope, with ATF agents having been diverted to help with enforcing Trump's immigration agenda.</p>

            <p>UK scientists claim that a saliva test may help "turn the tide" on prostate cancer by analyzing men's DNA to determine their risk of developing the disease. Men with a high risk score were invited for further investigations, which led to the discovery of aggressive cancers that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. While the test has not yet been proven to save lives, experts say that it will be "years" before such tests could be used routinely. The test looks for 130 mutations in men's DNA, each of which can increase the risk of prostate cancers developing.</p>

            <p>House Republicans narrowly advanced a budget plan key to extending President Trump's tax cuts, which are set to expire this year, after the president dialed up the pressure to break through opposition from his own party. The budget resolution still faces a final vote later Wednesday, and it's unclear whether it has enough support to clear the last hurdle. Some Republicans said they would vote to advance the resolution but would not back its passage. At a fundraiser for House Republicans Tuesday night, Mr. Trump told GOP holdouts to "close your eyes and get there."</p>

But after US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on the country, sparking a trade war, calls grew for Canada to go to the polls as soon as possible.</p>

It initially reported that 23 people were killed but warned its first responders were searching for two dozen others under the rubble. The Israeli military said it had struck a "senior Hamas terrorist" who was responsible for planning and executing attacks in the area.</p>
