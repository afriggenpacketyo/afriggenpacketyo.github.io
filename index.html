          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to eliminate restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. power plants, claiming they are insignificant on a global scale. However, an analysis indicates that emissions from American fossil-fuel plants contribute 5% of global planet-heating pollution since 1990. If the U.S. power sector were a country, it would rank as the sixth-largest emitter worldwide. Experts warn that removing these protections will have dangerous and costly consequences, undermining efforts to address climate change.</p>
