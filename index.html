          <p>Ben Duckett's impressive innings of 149 runs guided England to a remarkable victory against India in the first Test at Headingley, successfully chasing a target of 371. Duckett's performance, supported by Zak Crawley's 65, set a strong foundation for England, although quick wickets caused some concern. Joe Root and Jamie Smith steadied the innings, securing the win with 14 overs to spare, adding another chapter to Headingley's rich cricket history. The teams will now prepare for the second Test at Edgbaston, scheduled to begin on July 2. The optimism score reflects the positive outcome of a hard-fought cricket match.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, has strongly criticized the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S. and Israeli-backed aid organization, labeling it a "death trap" that endangers more lives than it saves. Lazzarini's statement comes amidst reports from the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health of numerous deaths near GHF sites, with civilians expressing concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the aid distribution. GHF has defended its operations, asserting that it adheres to security protocols and accusing Hamas-affiliated sources of spreading misinformation, while the U.N. and other aid organizations refuse to work with GHF due to humanitarian concerns. The situation is further complicated by accusations against UNRWA and funding cuts, leaving the agency in a precarious financial situation.

          <p>The growth in home prices is slowing down faster than expected due to rising supply and decreasing demand in the housing market. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index indicates a 2.7% national increase in April compared to the previous year, marking the smallest gain in nearly two years. While New York, Chicago, and Detroit saw the biggest increases, prices in previously hot markets like Tampa and Dallas are now declining. Higher mortgage rates and increased housing supply are contributing to this slowdown, although prices are not at risk of major declines as seen during the Great Recession.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has argued that the War Powers Act is unconstitutional, asserting that President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear targets was within his powers under Article II of the Constitution. Johnson stated that many constitutional scholars believe the Nixon-era law, which limits the president's power to unilaterally wage war, violates Article II. A bipartisan War Powers resolution seeking to bar U.S. military action in Iran may not proceed if the Iran-Israel ceasefire holds. The speaker said he hopes the resolution is not acted on, as it would be inappropriate. The optimism score reflects the ongoing debate over presidential war powers.</p>
