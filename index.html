          <h2>Lisbon Funicular Crash Claims Lives, Injures Many</h2>

          <p>A tragic accident in Lisbon involving the Elevador da Gloria funicular resulted in at least 17 fatalities and numerous injuries, prompting a national day of mourning in Portugal. The funicular, a popular tourist attraction, derailed and crashed into a building, leading to a swift response from emergency services. The victims included both Portuguese citizens and foreign nationals, with investigations underway to determine the cause of the crash. Eyewitness accounts describe the carriage as being 'out of control' before the collision, raising questions about safety measures and regular inspections. The incident has deeply affected the city, with the iconic streetcar now a heap of metal surrounded by police as the charm of the European capital is shattered, which has prompted safety checks on Lisbon's other funiculars. The optimism score is 10.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled to testify before the Senate Finance Committee amidst recent shakeups at the CDC and controversies surrounding vaccine policies. The hearing follows the FDA's decision to narrow access to the COVID-19 vaccine, which led to the ousting of CDC Director Susan Monarez and resignations of other top officials. Senators are expected to question Kennedy on the FDA's changes, upcoming CDC meetings on vaccines, and potential alterations to childhood vaccine recommendations. Kennedy is expected to defend his actions as efforts to eliminate bureaucracy and restore 'gold-standard science' within HHS, while critics raise concerns about potential harm to children's health and the integrity of vaccine programs.

          <p>Graham Linehan, co-creator of Father Ted, is on trial in London, accused of harassment and criminal damage against a transgender activist, Sophia Brooks. The prosecution alleges that Linehan posted offensive messages on social media targeting Brooks, including calling her a "deeply disturbed sociopath" and a "domestic terrorist." The trial also involves an incident where Linehan allegedly damaged Brooks' phone after she confronted him about his tweets at a conference. Linehan has pleaded not guilty to the charges, while his separate arrest at Heathrow Airport on suspicion of inciting violence remains under investigation. The optimism score is 40.</p>

          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner is at risk of a fine from tax authorities, in addition to paying £40,000 in underpaid stamp duty, according to tax experts. Rayner admitted to paying less stamp duty on her property, claiming she was badly advised, but HM Revenue and Customs can levy penalties for carelessness. The penalty could hinge on whether she sought specialist tax advice, and even if she did, she could still face a fine. The dispute centers around the ownership of a property and the application of tax law. The optimism score is 45.</p>

          <p>The debate over when children should get smartphones is intensifying, with some advocating for delaying access until middle school. However, one professor suggests introducing devices earlier with intentional guidance, akin to training wheels on a bike. By turning tech use into a conversation, parents can teach digital literacy and address online challenges. Giving children smartphones at an early age can help them develop a healthy relationship with technology. The optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>A major study on alcohol and cancer, commissioned by the US Department of Health and Human Services, has been buried by the Trump administration. The alcohol industry has worked to discredit and bury the analysis, which offers new evidence of the link between drinking alcohol and getting sick and dying from cancer. The study's conclusions, which found that negative health effects start at low levels of consumption, were intended to inform new dietary guidelines.

The ruling, based on religious beliefs, is causing confusion and potential litigation as schools figure out logistics and how to handle opt-out requests.
