          <p>President Trump has signed an order to enact portions of a trade agreement between the UK and the US, reducing tariffs on UK cars shipped to the US. The agreement allows up to 100,000 cars to enter the US at a 10% tariff, lower than the previously imposed 25% import tax. The order also establishes a similar system for steel and aluminum, though specific details were not provided. The UK government aims to eliminate tariffs on core steel products and the deal will remove tariffs on certain aerospace products, marking a positive step in US-UK trade relations.</p>

          <p>President Trump abruptly ended his participation in the G7 summit in Canada, citing escalating tensions in the Middle East as the reason for his early return to Washington. The White House indicated that the decision was related to the Israel-Iran conflict, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio also heading back to Washington. Despite reports of a potential ceasefire, Trump clarified that his return was due to issues of greater significance. The president's departure occurred amid ongoing discussions regarding the Middle East situation, including potential deals and the role of the United States.</p>

The report emphasizes the need for practical change for survivors of abuse who have struggled to be heard. It notes that authorities have avoided recording the ethnicity of perpetrators, hindering the ability to draw national-level conclusions about offenders. While the government has accepted the report's recommendations, the report itself highlights that many of these problems have been known for years, yet action has been lacking.</p>

Industrial accidents are common in China due to lax safety standards, with previous incidents including chemical plant explosions and fires leading to significant loss of life.

The contract represents a significant vote of confidence in UK workers and British industry, especially after the government intervened to prevent the closure of the plant's blast furnaces.

          <p>Esfandyar Batmanghelidj argues that recent Israeli attacks have significantly altered Iran's trajectory, harming the progress made by the Iranian people towards liberty and prosperity. Despite the challenges posed by an oppressive government, Iran has been experiencing slow but steady improvements in its political, economic, and social conditions. The Iranian people have been pushing back against authoritarian tendencies, but Israel's attacks have disrupted this progress. The author contends that these attacks demonstrate a contempt for the agency and aspirations of the Iranian people, who were striving for a better future.</p>

          <p>President Trump's response to the escalating Israel-Iran conflict remains uncertain, marked by ambiguous statements and an early departure from the G7 summit. Possible courses of action include escalating the conflict under pressure from Netanyahu, maintaining the current stance of non-involvement, or pulling back due to domestic concerns. His decision will be influenced by factors such as Netanyahu's pressure, advice from the National Security Council, and the views of his MAGA base. The situation is further complicated by the abandonment of planned talks between the US and Iran.</p>
