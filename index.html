          <p>President Trump stated he intends to name a new national security advisor within six months, clarifying that Mike Waltz was not fired but promoted to UN ambassador. Trump emphasized Waltz's capabilities and his preference for the UN ambassador role. When questioned about Stephen Miller potentially filling the position, Trump acknowledged Miller's significant influence within the administration. Trump also mentioned ongoing trade negotiations with various countries, including China, asserting his control over setting tariffs. The president further addressed his offer to send U.S. troops to Mexico to combat drug cartels, which was declined by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, citing her fear of the cartels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made outside the U.S., aiming to boost the American film industry, which he believes is declining due to foreign incentives. Trump described this as a matter of national security, citing messaging and propaganda concerns. He had previously appointed film stars as special envoys to attract business back to Hollywood. This move follows earlier trade policies, including tariffs on Chinese goods, leading to retaliatory measures affecting the import of American films into China. Trump mentioned ongoing trade discussions with several nations, including China, but did not confirm any upcoming trade agreements.</p>

          <p>Australian stocks experienced a downturn following Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's re-election, marking the first time in 21 years that an Australian PM has secured a second consecutive term. The decline reflects concerns about global macroeconomic uncertainty. The S&P/ASX 200 index fell by 0.47%, reversing previous gains, while the Australian dollar strengthened against the US dollar. Oil prices also fell after OPEC+ agreed to increase production. Meanwhile, U.S. futures edged down after strong gains on Wall Street the previous week, with the S&P 500 recovering losses incurred since Trump's announcement of retaliatory tariffs.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton addressed the controversy surrounding team orders at the Miami Grand Prix, emphasizing that there were no hard feelings between him and teammate Leclerc. Leclerc echoed this sentiment, acknowledging Hamilton's attempts to try something different during the race. Ferrari team principal Vasseur defended the team's decision-making process, explaining the delay in issuing team orders was to ascertain whether Hamilton's pace was due to DRS. Vasseur acknowledged the drivers' frustration but reiterated that the decisions were made for the benefit of the team, aiming to catch Antonelli.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Bureau of Prisons, along with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen and expand Alcatraz prison to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders. Trump stated this decision is to serve as a "symbol of law, order, and justice," citing the need to address violent crime. The prison, closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, would be substantially enlarged and rebuilt. Trump has previously clashed with courts over sending alleged gang members to prisons in El Salvador and has discussed sending homegrown criminals to foreign prisons.</p>

The exhibit, which featured portraits of 120 people killed by gun violence, was dedicated in April 2024 and was intended to be a permanent reminder of the ATF's mission. A DOJ spokesperson stated that the ATF will continue to honor the memory of all victims of violent crime while at the same time preserving the rights of law-abiding Americans.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on all movies “produced in Foreign Lands” via his Truth Social platform. He claims the U.S. film industry is dying due to incentives offered by other countries. Trump stated that this is a national security threat and that the Department of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative are implementing the tariff. The announcement comes after Trump initiated a trade war with China, which has already led to a reduction in the quota of American movies allowed into the country. Experts warn that retaliation could devastate the U.S. film industry.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is increasingly popular among American women, allowing them to preserve their fertility. The procedure involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage, costing between $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, with additional storage and fertilization costs. Many companies now offer egg freezing as a benefit, but some critics worry about the emphasis on profits and the lack of access for lower-income women. The optimal age for egg freezing is in a woman's 20s, as egg quality declines with age. The biological clock is a reality every woman faces.</p>
