          <p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with potential payouts being less than £950 per deal. This follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not deeming all hidden commissions unlawful, found excessively high commissions to be unfair. The FCA will consult on the scheme's details, which could cover agreements dating back to 2007, though concerns exist about data availability from that period. The first payouts are anticipated next year, with the industry expected to cover the full cost of the redress program. (not investment advice)</p>

The confirmation passed with a 50-45 vote, solidifying her role in one of the country's most powerful prosecutor offices, which she had held on an acting basis since May. Pirro's nomination followed the collapse of a previous nominee and faced little resistance from Democrats. Her confirmation was part of a series of votes completed before the Senate adjourned for its September recess.</p>

A $7,500 reward has been offered for information leading to his arrest, as a multi-agency search continues in the rugged terrain surrounding the town.

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano in Russia's far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume over 3.7 miles into the sky. The eruption occurred days after a massive earthquake in the region and was accompanied by a 7.0-magnitude quake, prompting a temporary tsunami warning. According to the Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team, the ash spread eastward over the Pacific Ocean without affecting populated areas. Experts noted this is the first historically confirmed eruption of the volcano in several centuries, though the exact date of its last activity is disputed.</p>

The updated exhibit will feature information on the impeachments of Presidents Trump, Andrew Johnson, and Bill Clinton, as well as the inquiry that led to Richard Nixon's resignation.</p>

The collision reportedly caused the vessel to nearly capsize and threw a passenger overboard, who is said to be unharmed. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after it was spotted resting on a shallow sandbar. Due to tidal conditions and the need for heavy equipment, the whale's carcass will be moved on Monday for a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death.

          <p>Germany's birth rate fell to a historic low of 1.35 children per woman in 2024, sparking debate about demographic decline and its impact on the economy. The trend is part of a global phenomenon, with sociologists pointing to multiple crises like the pandemic, climate change, and inflation as contributing factors for young people delaying or forgoing having children. While some women are choosing to be child-free, experts note a significant "fertility gap" between the number of children people desire and the number they actually have. Improving family-friendly policies and work-life balance is seen as crucial to reversing the trend.</p>

          <h2>UK Issues Amber Weather Warning for Storm Floris as Strong Winds Approach</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 10:50:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An amber weather warning has been issued for most of Scotland as Storm Floris is expected to bring unusually strong winds and potential danger to life on Monday. The Met Office warns of gusts between 70-90mph in exposed areas, with a risk of damage to buildings and travel disruption. A yellow warning is also in place for northern England, north Wales, and Northern Ireland. This is the sixth named storm of the season, and its timing in August is notable, as trees in full leaf are more susceptible to being toppled. Ferry services and rail operators have already issued travel advisories and cancellations.</p>

          <p>China has granted export permits to 183 additional Brazilian coffee companies, a move that provides a significant alternative market for Brazil's exporters. This development comes shortly after the United States announced a steep 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee and other goods. While the U.S. is a massive market for Brazilian coffee, this approval from China, Brazil's top overall trade partner, offers a crucial opportunity for diversification. The new export permits are valid for five years, signaling a potentially long-term shift in global coffee trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has dismissed star defensive end Micah Parsons' public trade request as "negotiation talk." The comments came after Parsons expressed his desire to leave the team on social media amid a contract extension dispute. Jones insisted the team has an agreement in principle and that he expects to resolve the situation, drawing parallels to past high-profile contract standoffs. Parsons, who is entering the final year of his rookie contract and seeking a record-setting deal, has not been practicing due to a back injury, while teammates have publicly voiced their support for him.</p>

Jordan, the site's custodian, called the visit an "unacceptable provocation," while Hamas and the Palestinian Authority condemned it as an aggression that crossed red lines.

          <p>Actor Sydney Sweeney's 2024 Republican voter registration in Florida has become public amid a social media debate over her new ad campaign for American Eagle. The campaign, which puns on her "great genes," drew criticism from some for echoing eugenicist rhetoric, while conservatives praised it as a blow against "woke" advertising. This follows a previous controversy in 2022 when guests at her mother's party wore hats resembling MAGA apparel. Sweeney has not commented on her voter registration, but the revelation has added a new layer to the ongoing public discussion about her and her brand partnerships.</p>

Footage aired on state broadcaster CCTV as part of a series celebrating the People's Liberation Army's anniversary appeared to show a successful jet take-off from the carrier. The Fujian is China's third carrier and the first to be equipped with this modern launch technology, which is similar to that used by the U.S. Navy.

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent public appearances, marked by rambling speeches, off-topic digressions, and factual inaccuracies, have led experts to renew questions about his mental fitness. The 79-year-old president has exhibited unusual behavior, such as a lengthy, unprompted rant about windmills during a meeting with a European leader and a confabulated story about his uncle and the Unabomber. While the White House maintains the president is in excellent health, some psychologists point to these incidents as potential signs of cognitive decline, noting a deterioration from his more articulate speaking style in past decades.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a rocky marriage, divorce attorneys recommend taking proactive steps to protect your finances, especially if a prenuptial agreement is not in place. One key strategy is to gather comprehensive information about all joint financial assets and liabilities while you still have easy access to accountants and records. Another protective measure is to create a postnuptial agreement, which defines how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided in a divorce. While broaching the topic can be difficult, attorneys suggest that open communication can prevent greater conflict later. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, using specific language can effectively de-escalate children's tantrums. Instead of punishing or dismissing a child's outburst, emotionally attuned parents use phrases that validate feelings and offer support, such as "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you." Other powerful phrases include "I believe you" and "Your feelings make sense," which help a child feel understood and safe. This connection-based approach helps a child's nervous system regulate more quickly and builds long-term emotional resilience.</p>

The initiative, which could be operational within weeks, may allow up to 300 children, each accompanied by a guardian, to enter the country for free treatment. This move follows criticism from the Foreign Affairs Committee about the government's previous reluctance to support such a scheme. The plan is being developed as humanitarian organizations continue to warn of a dire medical crisis in Gaza, with tens of thousands of children killed or injured.</p>
