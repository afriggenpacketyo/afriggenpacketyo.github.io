        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A powerful earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.2 struck off the coast of Alaska, prompting a tsunami warning for the state's southern peninsula. The quake occurred approximately 50 miles south of Sand Point, with the warning covering areas from the Kennedy Entrance to Unimak Pass. While the tremors were widely felt across the peninsula, authorities confirmed there was no immediate danger to Anchorage, the state's most populous city. The event follows a smaller 5.2 magnitude earthquake that hit the region earlier the same day.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to switch from high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar for its products sold in the United States. This change aligns with advocacy from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has raised concerns about the health effects of corn syrup. While Coca-Cola products in other countries like Mexico and the UK already use cane sugar, the US market has traditionally used corn syrup. The move is part of a broader push by Kennedy's "Make America Healthy Again" movement to remove certain ingredients from American food products.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Using data from NASA's Webb Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory, astronomers have observed the early stages of planet formation around a protostar named HOPS-315. Located 1,300 light-years away, this young star is surrounded by a disk of gas and dust where minerals, specifically silicon monoxide, are just beginning to crystallize. Scientists state this is the first time such an early phase of planetary system development has been seen outside our own solar system. The discovery provides a glimpse into what our own solar system may have looked like in its infancy, approximately 4.6 billion years ago.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has set an October 16 execution date for death row inmate Robert Roberson, who was convicted for the 2002 death of his two-year-old daughter. Roberson's conviction was based on what was then known as shaken baby syndrome, a diagnosis that his legal team now argues is based on outdated science. His attorneys are pursuing appeals for a new trial, citing new expert evidence suggesting the child's death was a tragic accident, not a homicide. This case has drawn significant attention, with a bipartisan group of lawmakers previously issuing a subpoena that temporarily stayed his execution in 2024.</p>

          <p>More than 20 children, mostly toddlers, are in the custody of a California child-welfare agency as authorities investigate a Los Angeles-area couple, Silvia Zhang and Guojun Xuan.

Authorities discovered 15 children in the couple's home and located another six elsewhere, with most believed to be born via different surrogate mothers. Some surrogates have come forward stating they were misled and unaware the couple was commissioning so many children simultaneously, raising questions about surrogacy laws.</p>

          <p>India secured a four-wicket victory over England in the first one-day international cricket match in Southampton, successfully chasing a target of 259. All-rounder Deepti Sharma anchored the chase with an unbeaten 62, guiding the tourists to their target with 10 balls remaining. For England, Sophia Dunkley's 83 and Alice Davidson-Richards' 53 were the standout performances, but a subpar total and a sloppy fielding effort ultimately cost them the game. The result gives India an early lead in the crucial three-match series, which serves as preparation for the upcoming World Cup.</p>

States like Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma have passed laws to label or restrict ingredients such as artificial dyes, certain additives, and soda purchases with food stamps. The article suggests this state-level action allows Kennedy to advance his goals without creating new federal regulations, a strategy that aligns with the Trump administration's preference for deregulation.

The article explains that the court can also hear cases based on specific UN conventions, such as the Genocide Convention, which South Africa invoked in its case against Israel.

Their work often explored themes of love, kindness, and empathy with a simple yet powerful style, earning them a wide following.

          <p>The Canadian government has announced new measures to restrict tariff-free steel imports in an effort to protect its domestic industry from the impact of U.S. tariffs. Prime Minister Mark Carney stated that Canada will tighten its tariff rate quotas, subjecting imports from non-free-trade partners that exceed 50% of 2024 volumes to a 50% tariff. The policy also specifically targets steel melted and poured in China and mandates the use of Canadian steel in federal government projects. This move comes after the Trump administration imposed steep tariffs on Canadian steel, causing a significant downturn in the country's production. (not investment advice)</p>

The poll also asked respondents about the recently closed Jeffrey Epstein investigation.
