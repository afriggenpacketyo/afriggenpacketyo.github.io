          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 02:45:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has overtaken China as the primary exporter of smartphones to the United States, accounting for 44% of U.S. imports in the second quarter. This significant shift, a 240% year-over-year increase in volume from India, is largely driven by Apple's strategy to diversify its manufacturing supply chain away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties. While global manufacturers like Samsung and Motorola are also moving assembly to India, Apple's transition is the most aggressive. Despite the move, challenges such as lower manufacturing efficiency compared to China's mature infrastructure remain a consideration for companies.</p>

          <p>A recently brokered ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia is already facing challenges, with Thailand accusing Cambodian forces of violating the agreement just hours after it began. The ceasefire was intended to halt border clashes that have resulted in at least 33 deaths and displaced thousands. Despite the accusation, which Cambodia denies, local commanders from both sides met as planned to reinforce the agreement to stop shooting and allow for the recovery of casualties. The conflict escalated last week following a landmine incident, leading to rocket attacks and civilian deaths.</p>

          <p>A murder investigation has been launched in Bermondsey, south London, after a stabbing at a commercial property resulted in two fatalities. A 58-year-old man died at the scene, and a 27-year-old man later died in the hospital. Two other men are also hospitalized, one of whom is a detained suspect in life-threatening condition. The Metropolitan Police have stated the incident is not believed to be terror-related and have established a significant police presence in the area. Local officials and residents expressed shock over the violent event in what is typically considered a safe neighborhood.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a misconduct complaint against Chief U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, accusing him of making improper comments regarding President Donald Trump. The complaint alleges that Boasberg questioned whether the Trump administration would adhere to court rulings during a private meeting, potentially undermining judicial impartiality. This action escalates a conflict related to Boasberg's handling of a case involving the deportation of Venezuelans to a mega-prison in El Salvador. The DOJ is seeking an investigation and the judge's recusal from the case, a move that follows Trump's own calls for Boasberg's impeachment.</p>

          <p>British banking giant Barclays exceeded profit expectations for the second quarter, reporting a pre-tax profit of £2.5 billion, and announced a £1 billion share buyback. The strong performance was largely fueled by a 10% year-over-year increase in its investment banking division's income, which benefited from market volatility. This result comes as CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan continues a strategic overhaul and cost-reduction plan initiated in February. The bank faces a competitive landscape, including potential challenges from new U.S. capital rules and strategic shifts among its U.K. rivals. (not investment advice)</p>

The storm destroyed infrastructure, knocked out power, and caused landslides in the surrounding Hebei province.

The victims, Clinton and Cristen Brink, were attacked on a trail, but their daughters, ages 7 and 9, were physically unharmed. Arkansas State Police have released a sketch of a male suspect seen leaving the area in a black sedan and are asking the public for assistance. In a statement, the family described the parents as heroes who died protecting their children and called for justice as the search for the perpetrator continues.</p>

According to the Financial Times, Washington informed Lai he could not stop in New York en route to South America. However, other reports suggest the trip was delayed, not canceled, and would still include stopovers in other U.S. cities. Taiwan's Presidential Office cited typhoon rehabilitation efforts and regional developments as reasons for the change, a decision that could potentially ease tensions with Beijing and smooth the path for a future meeting between the U.S. and Chinese presidents.</p>

          <p>Following international condemnation, Israel has begun allowing more humanitarian aid into Gaza, but the United Nations warns the amount is a fraction of what is needed to address a deepening hunger crisis. Convoys of aid trucks are moving, but desperation is so high that people are looting them in a phenomenon charities call "self-distribution." The UN's agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, reports that one in five children in Gaza City is malnourished and that hundreds of trucks of aid are needed daily to avert widespread starvation. While Israel has implemented daily "humanitarian pauses," the overall situation remains dire.</p>

          <p>Recent comments from U.S. President Donald Trump have raised questions about a potential divergence in policy from that of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. During a meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump publicly acknowledged "real starvation" in the territory, directly contradicting Netanyahu's claims and adding pressure for increased aid. This apparent shift comes as the U.S. and U.K. announce renewed aid efforts. The article frames a complex international policy landscape, also noting Trump's comments on the war in Ukraine and other global issues.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued new guidance affirming the right of federal employees to engage in religious expression at work, including attempting to persuade colleagues of their religious views. The memo from the Office of Personnel Management states that workers can discuss religion, display religious items, and engage in polite, persuasive conversation, provided they stop if asked. The policy, which builds on previous guidance, is part of a broader administration push to protect religious freedom. Critics have condemned the move as unconstitutional, arguing it encourages workplace proselytizing and could lead to harassment.</p>

          <p>School districts nationwide are facing the potential loss of crucial mental health resources due to the Trump administration's abrupt discontinuation of millions of dollars in federal grants. The Department of Education cited concerns that the funds were used for diversity, equity, and inclusion-based hiring, a claim disputed by grant administrators. The cuts jeopardize the jobs of counselors and social workers in numerous states, many of which already have a severe shortage of child mental health professionals. Sixteen states are now suing the administration over the cuts, arguing they create a safety issue for students.</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union is drawing mixed reactions, with some economists arguing it is an "unbalanced deal" that will harm the EU's economy. The agreement imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports while eliminating tariffs on American goods exported to the EU, a move that could reduce the EU's GDP. However, the deal also provides stability by averting President Trump's threat of even higher 30% tariffs. European industries, such as Italian winemakers and German automakers, have expressed concern over the impact of the new levies. (not investment advice)</p>
