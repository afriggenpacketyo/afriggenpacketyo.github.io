          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic. Forecasters anticipate it will strengthen into a hurricane but expect the system to stay over open waters, passing east of Bermuda without making landfall. While no watches or warnings are in effect, swells generated by the storm are projected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast and Atlantic Canada early next week. The season has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA.</p>

          <p>Tong Jilu, the former chief of state-owned telecommunications infrastructure company China Tower, is under investigation for corruption by the Communist Party's top watchdog. Tong was a key figure in China's 5G development and played a vital role in the company's growth since its establishment in 2014. While details from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection are scarce, reports suggest his case may be connected to another high-profile graft investigation involving a former executive at a major Chinese brokerage. This marks another instance of Beijing's ongoing anti-corruption campaign targeting influential figures.</p>

          <p>A cyberattack targeting software provider Collins Aerospace has caused significant disruption at several major European airports, including Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack disabled the 'Muse' software, which is used by numerous airlines for check-in and baggage systems, forcing staff to resort to manual, paper-based processes. This led to hundreds of flight delays, cancellations, and long queues for travelers for a second consecutive day. The software's parent company, RTX, acknowledged the "cyber-related disruption" and is working to resolve the issue, though a timeline for restoration remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, William Bennett reflects on the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, suggesting it symbolizes the end of an era where reasoned argument could change minds in American public life. Bennett posits that political discourse has devolved from persuasion to coercion, with universities becoming "factories of fragility" rather than centers for open debate. He argues that society now teaches people to hate opponents rather than love their own principles, making the cost of public conviction so high that many capable individuals retreat from civic engagement entirely. The author calls for a return to vigorous, passionate argument to preserve democracy.</p>

          <p>Large-scale protests have erupted across the Philippines, with thousands gathering in Manila to demand accountability for alleged widespread corruption involving flood control projects. The scandal involves billions of dollars allocated for projects that were reportedly substandard or never built, an issue highlighted by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. himself. The Department of Finance estimates economic losses of up to $2 billion due to the fraud, which has fueled public outrage, particularly after the country suffered from deadly monsoons.

          <h2>UK Government Faces Criticism for Barring Gazan Scholarship Students from Bringing Families</h2>

          <p>Charities and universities in the UK are criticizing the government's immigration rules that prevent scholarship students evacuated from Gaza from bringing their families with them. Recently, 34 students were brought to the UK to begin their studies, but some may be forced to give up their places rather than leave their dependents, including young children, behind in a conflict zone. Critics, including the Refugee Council and Oxford University, have labeled the policy "excessively harsh," arguing that no one should have to choose between their education and their family's safety. The controversy highlights the tension between humanitarian concerns and the UK's recent crackdown on immigration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that recent political attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence, including calls to fire Governor Lisa Cook and demands for drastic interest rate cuts, pose a significant threat to the U.S. economy. Historically, central bank independence prevents politicians from engineering short-term economic boosts that lead to long-term, high inflation. Forcing the Fed to finance government deficits with artificially low rates could backfire, potentially causing markets to anticipate higher inflation, which would in turn raise interest rates on mortgages, loans, and the national debt. The article draws parallels to historical instances in the U.S. and Turkey where political interference in central banking led to severe economic damage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The rapid expansion of co-living developments in New York City neighborhoods like Crown Heights and Bushwick is facing backlash from longtime residents. These dorm-style complexes, which offer small private rooms with shared amenities at premium prices, are marketed to young, often transient professionals. While tenants are drawn to the promise of a built-in community and flexible leases, local community boards and residents view them as "harbingers of gentrification." Critics argue these developments displace local culture, drive up rents, and cater to a temporary population that doesn't integrate into or invest in the community's long-term health.</p>

A Taliban spokesman emphasized that Afghanistan's independence and territorial integrity are paramount, urging the U.S. to adhere to the Doha Agreement, which prohibits threats against the country's sovereignty. The statement came after Trump hinted that the Taliban might be open to a U.S. military return, four years after the chaotic withdrawal that left the strategic facility in Taliban hands.

The White House later clarified that the one-time fee would only apply to new visa applicants, not current holders or renewals.

Historically, the party not holding the presidency often gains a significant number of seats. Key indicators to watch will be President Trump's approval rating, voter enthusiasm, and public opinion on the economy and major legislation.

          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has become the most popular party in the country for the first time, according to a new opinion poll. The survey, conducted by the Insa institute, places the anti-immigration party at 26% support, narrowly ahead of the ruling conservative CDU/CSU bloc at 25%. This milestone comes as the AfD, officially classified as a "confirmed right-wing extremist endeavor" by domestic intelligence, continues to gain traction amid voter dissatisfaction. The poll results reflect a significant shift in the German political landscape and pose a major challenge to the established mainstream parties.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK's Liberal Democrat party, is calling for the communications regulator Ofcom to take action against Elon Musk and his social media platform, X. Davey alleges that "crimes" are being committed on the platform, citing the presence of harmful and illegal content, and argues that Musk should be held personally accountable under the new Online Safety Act. The call for an investigation follows Musk's recent criticism of the act as a threat to free speech and his appearance at a far-right rally where he made comments Davey described as "inciting violence." This escalates the conflict between UK political figures and the tech billionaire over content moderation and responsibility.</p>

          <p>An email from 2011 has resurfaced in which Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, referred to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as a "steadfast, generous and supreme friend." The message was reportedly sent just weeks after she had publicly condemned her association with him as a "gigantic error of judgment." A spokesperson for the Duchess claims the email was sent in response to a threat from Epstein to sue her for defamation and was an attempt to placate him. The spokesperson reiterated that the Duchess stands by her public condemnation of Epstein and that her first thoughts are with his victims.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece contends that a range of recent events, from microaggressions in London to political violence in the U.S., are symptoms of a deeper societal problem: a deficit of empathy. The author argues that both British and American societies are normalizing hate and "othering," which corrodes not just politics but also civic life. Drawing on the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, the essay calls for empathy to become a public practice woven into institutions. The author suggests that without a conscious effort to foster empathy and grace over grievance, democracy itself is at risk.</p>

          <p>Citizens in Guinea are voting in a referendum on a new constitution that could allow the current military leader, General Mamady Doumbouya, to run for president. Doumbouya, who seized power in a 2021 coup, had promised a return to civilian rule, but the proposed changes are highly controversial. The new constitution would extend presidential terms and allow military members to seek office, while making it harder for political parties to compete. With the main opposition leaders calling for a boycott and facing a government crackdown, the referendum is expected to pass, potentially solidifying military influence in the West African nation's politics.</p>

The network pays participants to post pro-Russian propaganda and fake news aimed at undermining the country's pro-EU government. Operatives were also instructed to conduct illegal, biased polls and secretly record opposition supporters to create a pretext for questioning the election results. The investigation found links between the network, fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor, and a sanctioned NGO, revealing a coordinated campaign to spread malign influence and destabilize the democratic process in the strategically significant Eastern European nation.</p>

Her friends, who were with her that night, recount the events leading to her disappearance and express their belief that her death was covered up. An inquest previously concluded she was murdered by one or two British soldiers, and a potential extradition would mark the first time a UK soldier has been sent abroad to face trial for murdering a civilian.</p>
