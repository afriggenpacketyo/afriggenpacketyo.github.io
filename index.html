          <p>Tokyo police and prosecutors have issued apologies to two men for their wrongful arrest and indictment in a 2020 case involving the suspected unauthorized export of sensitive equipment. The apology follows a high court ruling ordering compensation for the men. The men were arrested on suspicion of exporting equipment that could be used to produce biological weapons, but the indictment was later withdrawn. The family of a third man involved, who died during detention, expressed dissatisfaction with the apology.</p>
