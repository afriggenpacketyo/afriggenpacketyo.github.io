          <p>An article examines the continued relevance of Saturday Night Live (SNL) as it concludes its 50th season, noting its success in attracting viewers and remaining a powerful comedy brand.

          <p>Marco Rubio disputes the intelligence community's assessment that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is not a proxy force of NicolÃ¡s Maduro's government. He claims the gang is exported by the Venezuelan regime and has been operationalized to target opposition members, citing an FBI assessment. The article highlights the clash between Rubio's claims and the National Intelligence Council report, which states the Maduro regime likely does not direct the gang's movement. This disagreement is central to the debate over the Trump administration's ability to deport suspected gang members under the Alien Enemies Act. The administration has treated suspected gang members as wartime enemies, a move that has faced legal challenges.</p>

Leis are used to express aloha, love, and welcome, and are given for various occasions. The article details the intricate process of lei making, where a single lei can use hundreds of flowers. However, the tradition is facing challenges due to suburban sprawl, climate change, and the increasing import of flowers from other countries.

Regarding Ukraine, Gates believes Putin's goal is to recreate the Russian Empire, making Ukraine a client state.
