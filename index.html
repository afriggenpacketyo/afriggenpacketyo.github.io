            <p>The United States and European allies are set to convene in Paris to discuss strategies for resolving the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, marking a significant transatlantic engagement. European diplomats intend to press the US to exert greater pressure on Russia to agree to an unconditional ceasefire, while Ukrainian officials will participate in the discussions. The US State Department indicated that the focus will be on ending the fighting, with Donald Trump's envoy reporting on his meeting with Vladimir Putin. Tensions between Trump and Zelenskyy remain high, adding complexity to the peace efforts.</p>

            <p>Authorities in Ogden, Utah, rescued 152 dogs from a residence where they were living in “extremely poor” and overcrowded conditions. Ogden Animal Services, along with other agencies, responded to a report of possible animal neglect and discovered the large number of dogs.

            <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reported a first-quarter profit that exceeded expectations, driven by strong demand for AI chips.

TSMC is investing heavily in overseas facilities, including a significant expansion in the US, in response to these trade uncertainties.

            <p>King Charles is reportedly maintaining a distance from Prince Harry due to ongoing tensions related to Harry's legal battle for security in the UK, with some experts suggesting the King is avoiding entanglement. Sources indicate that Prince William has also not responded to Harry's attempts to communicate. Harry is said to be in the dark about his father's health condition, and feels Charles could intervene to reinstate his security, a claim the palace denies. This distance is fueled by trust issues and concerns about Harry sharing information with the media, according to royal experts.</p>

            <p>China is reportedly shifting its approach in the trade war with the US, moving away from tariffing goods and focusing on measures targeting the American services sector. This shift comes after the US increased levies on select goods from China, prompting Beijing to implement non-tariff restrictive measures, including widening export controls on rare-earth minerals and opening antitrust probes into American companies. China is also allegedly restricting deliveries of Boeing jets and urging domestic users to replace American technology with domestic alternatives. Experts suggest this indicates a full-steam decoupling of the two economies (not investment advice).</p>

The author argues that it is time to hear directly from disabled women about the inequalities they face, while spotlighting their contributions and resilience. By sharing their stories, the aim is to challenge stereotypes and foster a more nuanced view of disability, advocating for decent support and recognition as valuable members of society.</p>

            <p>As his regime crumbled, Bashar al-Assad allegedly used a private jet to smuggle cash, valuables, and confidential documents out of Syria, according to a Reuters investigation. The operation, orchestrated by Assad's top economic advisor, Yasar Ibrahim, involved four flights to the United Arab Emirates. The jet carried unmarked bags of cash, intelligence documents, laptops, and hard drives detailing Assad's corporate network. Assad has been granted political asylum in Russia, while the new Syrian government aims to recover the funds taken abroad to support the country's economy.</p>

            <p>Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou's future at the club is uncertain as the team struggles in the Premier League and other competitions.

Postecoglou himself admitted he is unsure if he will remain as head coach beyond the end of the season. The team is under pressure to end their 17-year trophy drought, and Postecoglou's survival hinges on their performance in the Europa League.</p>

            <p>The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has requested a pause in the Menendez brothers' resentencing hearing, pending a review of a recently completed parole board assessment. This motion stems from the brothers' clemency appeal to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who ordered the risk assessment. The DA argues that the court should have access to the most current risk assessments before making any resentencing decisions. Erik and Lyle Menendez were sentenced to life in prison for the 1989 killings of their parents, but a prior DA motion seeks to reduce their sentences and grant them parole eligibility.</p>

            <p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is scheduled to meet with US President Donald Trump amid trade tensions between the US and the European Union. As the first European leader to meet Trump since he announced tariffs on European imports, Meloni's visit to Washington will test her diplomatic skills. With Trump being a fan of Meloni, the meeting will take place amid wider concerns of a potential trade war between the US and the EU. The EU is hopeful that Meloni could aid talks to find a compromise to resolve what Trump sees as an unfair trading relationship.</p>

The chase began after officers responded to a shooting at a motel, where a man was injured. The suspect led police on a pursuit, driving recklessly and striking other vehicles. After an almost hourlong chase, police used a PIT maneuver to stop the truck on a bridge, where officers opened fire. The driver was pronounced dead at the scene, and a passenger surrendered to police.</p>

Victims have reported feeling violated and losing faith in humanity after being targeted in this way. Authorities and banking industry representatives have warned people to check their accounts to ensure the payment has been received before handing over goods, but this has provided little comfort to business owners.</p>

The surgery, believed to be the first of its kind for a sloth, involved removing infected tissue surrounding two of Rico's teeth. Dental experts from Newcastle University collaborated with zoo staff to perform the procedure, which required specialized techniques due to the unique anatomy of sloth teeth. Rico has been regularly monitored since the surgery and is recovering well, free from toothache.</p>

Miller acknowledged his performance was below his capabilities and attributed the issues to inconsistent execution of his pitches. The Dodgers' offense provided enough support with a seven-run first inning, but Miller's performance raised concerns about the team's pitching depth.</p>

            <p>A UK trade deal with the US under Donald Trump is unlikely to be a significant driver of economic growth, argues Martin Kettle. With Trump's approach of asserting power and demanding a winner, Britain risks becoming a loser. The focus should be on protecting British trade interests, not expecting a major economic boost. A trade deal with the US should be tactical, not strategic, with Europe remaining the key driver for the UK's elusive economic growth (not investment advice).</p>
