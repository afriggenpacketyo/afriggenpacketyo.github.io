          <p>Ether and cryptocurrency trading stocks experienced significant gains following the congressional passage of the GENIUS Act, a landmark stablecoin bill. The legislation, which now heads to the President's desk, is considered the first major crypto-focused law in the United States. Ether's price reached its highest point since January, and ETFs tracking the cryptocurrency saw record inflows, surpassing those for Bitcoin. Analysts suggest this could signal a shift in market leadership from Bitcoin to Ethereum, bolstered by the new regulatory clarity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Richard Durbin has claimed that FBI agents reviewing Jeffrey Epstein's case files were told to "flag" any records mentioning Donald Trump. Durbin sent letters to the Justice Department and FBI demanding an explanation for what he called "apparent discrepancies" in how the files were handled. According to the senator, this review involved around 1,000 personnel on 24-hour shifts, a process he described as haphazard. The allegation adds to the political pressure on the Trump administration regarding the transparency of the Epstein investigation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly demanding a minimum tariff of 15% to 20% on all goods imported from the European Union, escalating trade tensions. According to sources briefed on the matter, this represents a significant increase in demands during ongoing negotiations, which appear to have stalled. The EU had been seeking a deal similar to the one with the U.K., which maintained a lower baseline tariff. The news has caused market jitters, reflecting concerns over a potential trade war with the major economic bloc. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of Michigan's latest Survey of Consumers indicates that fears of tariff-induced inflation are subsiding, with outlooks returning to levels seen before recent tariff announcements. The one-year inflation forecast dropped significantly to 4.4% from 5%, while the five-year outlook also declined. Despite this improvement, consumers still perceive a risk of future price increases, and the readings remain above their long-term averages. Economists view the trend as encouraging for the Federal Reserve, suggesting that inflation expectations are becoming better anchored. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has announced that its spending on hotels for asylum seekers decreased by nearly a third in the last fiscal year, from £3 billion to £2.1 billion. This reduction was primarily achieved by moving individuals into cheaper accommodations, such as shared housing, and by renegotiating contracts. Despite the cost savings, the number of people in asylum hotels was higher in March 2025 than the previous summer, and experts warn that a recent surge in small boat crossings could increase reliance on hotels again.

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a deal that gives it a major stake in Guyana's vast offshore oil reserves. The merger was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the lucrative Stabroek Block. Exxon, which leads the Guyana oil project, said it disagreed with the ruling but would respect the outcome and welcome Chevron to the venture. The resolution removes significant uncertainty that had been weighing on Chevron's stock performance.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Democratic Party is facing a structural crisis, evidenced by historically low approval ratings and the collapse of its previous winning coalition. The author contends that the party's focus on "intersectional obsessions and woke grievances" has alienated large segments of the American electorate on key issues. The rise of figures like New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, described as a communist, is presented as proof that the party is moving further leftward, away from the concerns of mainstream Americans. The author concludes that this trajectory will lead to continued political decline for the party.</p>

          <p>The fourth and final detainee who escaped from the Delaney Hall Detention Facility in Newark, New Jersey, last month has been apprehended in Los Angeles. The FBI announced that Andres Felipe Pineda Mogollon, a 25-year-old Colombian national, was arrested following a traffic stop in the Silver Lake neighborhood. The four men, described by DHS as "public safety threats," reportedly escaped by breaking through a drywall panel in their unit. The other three escapees were captured within a week of the June 12 breakout from the privately run immigration facility.</p>

          <p>An Iranian father was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in the parking lot of his child's preschool in South Beaverton, Oregon. ICE stated that Mahdi Khanbabazadeh was arrested for overstaying his visa and had resisted during a traffic stop, leading agents to follow him to the school. Witnesses described a chaotic scene where agents broke the vehicle's window to complete the arrest, which occurred near where other children were playing. An immigration lawyer disputed ICE's claim, stating Khanbabazadeh was in the process of adjusting his legal status after marrying a U.S. citizen.</p>

          <p>Recent sectarian massacres in Syria's Sweida province underscore a fundamental policy rift between the United States and Israel regarding the country's future. The violence, which prompted Israeli airstrikes on Damascus, erupted after the U.S. special envoy endorsed a strong, centralized Syrian government under leader Ahmed al-Sharaa. However, Israel remains distrustful of Sharaa, a former jihadist, and has supported local minority groups like the Druze, fearing a unified Syrian threat. This divergence in strategy is contributing to instability, as Sharaa's attempts to assert control clash with Israeli-backed regional autonomy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order establishing "Schedule G," a new classification for federal employees that makes them at-will political appointees who can be hired and fired by the president. The White House claims this will streamline appointments for key policy roles and help "dismantle the deep state." This move is similar to the controversial "Schedule F" and aligns with Project 2025's goal of politicizing the civil service. Critics argue the order will undermine the nonpartisan federal workforce, making government service less stable and more beholden to executive power.</p>

The judge also barred Bolsonaro from using social media and communicating with his son and foreign diplomats.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's demand to release grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein, a move forced by a Wall Street Journal report, is a political misstep. The author suggests that by selectively calling for transparency, Trump is feeding the very conspiracy theories that his supporters have championed for years. The move is framed as an attempt to control the narrative, but the author predicts it will only whet the public's appetite for more information and could further expose Trump's past association with Epstein's world. This ultimately threatens to undermine his anti-elite political mystique.</p>

The package, which passed 216-213 along party lines, claws back about $8 billion from foreign assistance programs and $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The vote was temporarily delayed by procedural maneuvers from Democrats, who sought to force votes on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The bill, already approved by the Senate, now heads to the president's desk to be signed into law. (not investment advice)</p>

The film is praised for its nasty, cynical, and eerily accurate portrayal of how digital reality can bleed into and distort real life.
