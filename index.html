          <p>Katie Piper, presenter and campaigner, spoke at the Hay Festival in Wales about her views on aging and beauty standards. She compared aging to a bereavement, noting that women often age out of the male gaze and face societal judgment. Piper, who underwent numerous surgeries after an attack in 2008, discussed her latest book, which explores themes of age, beauty, and self-acceptance. She expressed excitement about getting older, emphasizing the importance of self-identity and challenging societal expectations, stating that aging can be a key to living how one wants to live, free from others' expectations.</p>

          <p>The Polish presidential election is too close to call, with exit polls indicating a tight race between the two contenders. The vote is viewed as a significant test of populist nationalism's influence in Europe. Initial exit polls showed a neck-and-neck situation, making the final outcome uncertain. Both candidates have claimed victory, but the official results are expected to be released later. The narrow margin suggests a deeply divided electorate and highlights the ongoing ideological battles within Poland. </p>

          <p>Ukraine launched a "large-scale" drone attack deep into Russian territory, reportedly destroying 40 military bombers, as ceasefire talks are set to resume in Istanbul. Ukrainian security sources claimed the attack, dubbed "Operation Spider's Web," took over a year and a half to plan and was personally overseen by President Zelenskyy. The drones targeted airfields, including the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk region, over 2,500 miles from Ukraine. This operation comes as Kyiv announced a Russian military strike killed at least 12 soldiers, and explosions caused bridges to collapse in western Russia. The ongoing conflict and diplomatic efforts continue amidst escalating attacks.</p>

          <p>The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) removed a list of ‚Äúsanctuary‚Äù states, cities, and counties from its website after facing criticism from the National Sheriffs‚Äô Association.

The list was created following an executive order from President Trump calling for a tally of sanctuary jurisdictions. Despite the removal, DHS stated it would continue to use the sanctuary tally, while leaders of some cities questioned the sanctuary label.</p>

          <p>Daniel Duffey, a former Republican political strategist, was convicted on two counts of stalking after prosecutors alleged he sent harassing text messages and letters to the victim and his family. Duffey also created a fake Grindr account under the victim‚Äôs name, requesting app users attend the victim‚Äôs wedding for sexual encounters. The harassment escalated after the victim did not respond to Duffey‚Äôs invitation for a beer. The judge ordered Duffey incarcerated ahead of his sentencing due to concerns about his lack of self-restraint.</p>
