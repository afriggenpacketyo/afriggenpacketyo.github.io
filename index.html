          <h2>Japanese Ruling Coalition Projected to Lose Upper House Majority in Election</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 10:12:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exit polls from Japan's recent upper house election indicate that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition is set to lose its majority. This outcome places significant political pressure on Ishiba, who has been grappling with public frustration over rising prices and challenging trade negotiations with the United States. Despite having already lost the majority in the more powerful lower house, Ishiba has stated his intention to remain in office to manage the critical tariff talks. A loss of the upper house would severely undermine his government's ability to pass legislation and could destabilize Japanese politics at a pivotal moment.</p>

          <p>Sources suggest that the most likely opportunity for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping this year is around the APEC summit in South Korea. The meeting could potentially take place in China before the summit or on the sidelines of the event, which runs from October 30 to November 1. This development follows recent diplomatic engagements, including a meeting between the two countries' top diplomats and a phone call where the leaders extended mutual invitations. Both sides have expressed a strong desire for a presidential meeting to help stabilize relations amid ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from "I Regret Almost Everything" by renowned restaurateur Keith McNally recounts the harrowing experience of a major stroke he suffered in 2016. The stroke severely impaired his mobility and speech, leading to a period of profound despair and a suicide attempt two years later. McNally describes the shock of his diagnosis and the immense physical and emotional challenges he faced, including the difficulty of communicating and the shame he felt about his condition. The memoir details his journey from being a celebrated figure in the New York restaurant scene to confronting a life-altering health crisis.</p>

          <p>This article argues that traditional methods of measuring the U.S. labor market, such as job creation numbers and the unemployment rate, are becoming obsolete. Given the rise of the "gig economy," side hustles, and remote work, many Americans now have multiple income streams that aren't captured by conventional jobs data. The author suggests that a more relevant metric would be to measure income, tracking how many people earn above a certain threshold from all sources, adjusted for inflation. This shift would provide a more accurate picture of economic health in an era of complex work arrangements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The small Mojave Desert community of Newberry Springs, located on the historic Route 66, is anticipating a resurgence as the famous highway approaches its 100th anniversary in 2026. Once a bustling stop, the town declined after the construction of Interstate 40 bypassed it, a fate shared by many similar communities. Now, residents and local business owners are preparing for an influx of tourists by organizing events, creating historical tours, and preserving local landmarks like the Bagdad Cafe. They hope the centennial will bring renewed attention and economic life to their town, which feels "frozen in time."</p>

His death has cast a spotlight on India's notoriously dangerous roads, where over 150,000 people die annually.

Many now place more hope in the United States to pressure Israel into an agreement.

          <p>This article explores the concept of personality change, featuring writer Olga Khazan, who successfully redesigned her own personality to be less neurotic and more extroverted. Contrary to the belief that personality is fixed, research from psychologists like Shannon Sauer-Zavala suggests that traits can be altered through intentional, sustained changes in behavior and thinking. The process involves identifying desired traits and consciously acting in ways that align with them, such as an introvert joining an improv class to build social skills. While challenging, this "fake it 'til you make it" approach can lead to genuine and lasting shifts in one's characteristic way of feeling and behaving.</p>

The House Armed Services Committee, with some Republican support, voted to block the move, arguing it flouts congressional authority.

As Western development funding declines, the report suggests the region's "center of gravity" is shifting towards Beijing, as well as Tokyo and Seoul. China is well-positioned to enhance its dominance through strategic infrastructure projects, like high-speed rail links, while promoting its aid as having no political strings attached.

          <p>A "cautious calm" has reportedly settled over the Syrian city of Suweida following a week of violent clashes between local Druze fighters, Bedouin gunmen, and government forces. The fighting, which killed over 1,000 people and displaced at least 128,000, was triggered by the abduction of a Druze merchant. A ceasefire was declared as Bedouin tribes reportedly withdrew from the city, which remains under the control of Druze fighters. The humanitarian situation is dire, with a severe shortage of medical supplies and hospitals described as being out of service.</p>

          <p>Following a landmark court ruling, the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) has released nearly 300 pages of records related to the controversial "Cop City" training center. The documents, obtained after a lawsuit by a news outlet and a research group, reveal the foundation's active lobbying efforts to prevent a citywide referendum on the project. Emails show the APF warned city officials that a public vote could derail financing and damage the city council's credibility. This ruling sets a significant precedent for the transparency of private police foundations, which have often operated as "black boxes" for funding police activities.</p>

          <p>Critics and scientists argue that the Trump administration's energy policy is setting back environmental progress by decades. The administration has declared a national energy emergency to justify expanding oil, gas, and coal production while cutting support for green energy and climate research. Recent actions include gutting green energy tax credits and proposing to shutter labs that study climate change, even as climate-related disasters intensify. Scholars like Harvard's Naomi Oreskes contend these moves are not economically sound but are designed to benefit fossil-fuel industry allies and deny the credibility of environmental science itself.

While not yet approved for PCOS, some women in clinical trials and anecdotal reports have seen significant improvements in symptoms, including weight loss, regulated menstrual cycles, and reduced testosterone levels. Researchers believe the drugs' effectiveness stems from improving insulin sensitivity, which in turn helps balance hormones. However, more extensive research is needed, and high costs and limited insurance coverage remain major barriers for patients.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that the Trump administration's new executive order on "Restoring Gold Standard Science" is designed to undermine the role of evidence in policymaking. The policy gives political appointees, not career scientists, the power to define scientific integrity and decide which evidence is credible. This framework allows officials to manufacture doubt about inconvenient findings by demanding unattainable levels of certainty or cherry-picking data, echoing tactics used by the tobacco industry. Critics warn this approach will enable the administration to block or roll back public health and environmental regulations by creating a scientific record that serves political goals rather than informing them.</p>

The quakes initially prompted tsunami warnings for the Russian coast and a tsunami watch for Hawaii. However, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and Russia's Emergencies Ministry later confirmed that the danger of significant tsunami waves had passed. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the seismic activity, which occurred about 144 kilometers east of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.

Most people are infected by eating raw shellfish or through open wounds exposed to contaminated water. Symptoms can range from diarrhea to life-threatening flesh-eating infections, and individuals with weakened immune systems are at higher risk.</p>

          <p>This article pushes back against recent conservative criticism of Superman being portrayed as an immigrant, arguing that the character's origins are deeply rooted in leftist and immigrant experiences. Created by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the earliest comics depicted Superman as a "Champion of the Oppressed" who fought corrupt bosses and landlords, acting as a socialist figure. The piece, featuring insights from "All-Star Superman" author Grant Morrison, traces the character's evolution through different eras, from a patriotic symbol during WWII to a family man in the 1950s. It concludes that Superman's enduring power lies in his ability to embody universal ideals and reflect contemporary social issues.</p>
