          <h2>Debanking Practices Spark Political Debate Amidst Claims of Discrimination</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 19:02:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A contentious issue known as "debanking," where financial institutions close accounts or deny services based on perceived political positions, is gaining traction in Washington. While some view it as politically motivated discrimination, others argue it's simply banks exercising discretion to manage risk and profitability. The Trump administration is considering measures to address the issue, including reviving a "fair access" rule that would require large banks to provide services more broadly. Despite differing viewpoints, there's growing consensus that debanking is a problem needing serious attention, but what to do about it remains hotly debated. </p>

With the GOP holding a slim margin in the House Budget Committee, the loss of even a few votes could prevent the bill from advancing. House Speaker Mike Johnson is attempting to sway the holdouts, while House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington remains confident the bill will pass. The effort to pass this bill is a crucial test of Johnson's speakership as he works to unify his divided conference. </p>

          <p>Walmart reported strong sales growth, particularly in its e-commerce division, but cautioned that President Trump's tariffs would soon lead to price increases. CEO Doug McMillon stated that while the company would try to keep prices low, the magnitude of the tariffs made it impossible to absorb all the pressure. The retailer's shares fell initially before recovering, reflecting investor concerns about the impact of trade wars on the retail sector. While Walmart is better positioned than some competitors due to its domestic sourcing, higher prices are still expected for discretionary items. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments concerning President Donald Trump's executive order to limit U.S. citizenship to children born on American soil to lawful permanent residents.

          <p>Federal health officials are considering limiting Covid vaccine recommendations to older Americans and those with chronic health problems, potentially impacting vaccine availability. New clinical testing requirements may delay the release of updated shots. The FDA is seeking more clinical data before approving Novavax's Covid vaccine. Some experts fear these changes could undermine the use of all vaccines. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is struggling to fill key roles, leading to officials holding multiple positions simultaneously. The administration is relying on acting officials—temporarily appointed but not Senate-confirmed—in other key roles, including FEMA’s head and the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. This dual-hatting reflects Trump’s attempts to learn from his first term. Trump owes it to his agenda and to the nation to doff the dual hats. </p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating a radio failure at the Denver Air Traffic Control Center, which covers approximately 285,000 square miles of airspace. The outage temporarily affected communications for about 90 seconds on Monday. The FAA said the outage affected some flights approaching Denver International Airport. They said the controllers used another frequency to communicate with pilots, and that all aircraft remained safely separated. </p>
