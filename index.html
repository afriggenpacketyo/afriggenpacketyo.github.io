          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris remained closed for a second day following a brazen daytime heist where thieves stole crown jewels from the Apollo Gallery. The perpetrators utilized a crane-like lift to force open a window and then smashed display cases, escaping on motorcycles with items of "inestimable value." French Culture Minister Rachida Dati characterized it as a "four-minute operation carried out without violence," highlighting significant concerns about the museum's security protocols. This incident has shocked many, given the apparent ease with which such treasured items were taken from a highly secured institution, raising questions about historical preservation versus modern security needs.</p>

          <p>President Trump has renewed calls to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco, despite the city experiencing a significant post-pandemic resurgence, largely propelled by the artificial intelligence boom. Crime rates have fallen dramatically, and tourism and residential real estate are on the rise, with venture capital funding for AI surpassing previous records. Mayor Daniel Lurie and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who initially supported Trump's idea, have since publicly stated that additional federal troops are unnecessary, emphasizing local law enforcement's successful efforts. The city's chief economist notes a cleaner, safer environment and abundant economic opportunities, though challenges like high office vacancies and homelessness persist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sports commentator Stephen A. Smith has openly expressed his deep dislike for NBA superstar LeBron James, revealing a personal beef spanning over a decade. Smith recounted a recent courtside confrontation with James, which he believes was an orchestrated "set up" designed to portray him negatively on camera, particularly given the limited camera angles. He clarified that his initial criticism of James stemmed from comments about LeBron's son, Bronny, and that he viewed James as a concerned father in that specific moment. Despite this, Smith claims James has actively tried to undermine his career, leading to his strong and enduring negative feelings.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 19:19:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) reported a full recovery of its services after a daylong outage caused widespread disruptions to major websites and applications globally. The incident, which began early Monday morning, affected numerous platforms including Disney+, Lyft, Reddit, and various banking and government sites, highlighting the internet's critical reliance on a few major cloud providers. AWS identified a DNS issue with its DynamoDB service in the US-East-1 region as the root cause, which has since been fully mitigated. While core services are back online, some backlogs are still processing, and a detailed post-event summary is expected to shed more light on the incident.</p>

          <p>The "No Kings" protests, among the largest one-day demonstrations in U.S. history, signify broad public opposition to President Trump's perceived authoritarianism and aim to counter despair among opponents. The slogan's broad appeal unites diverse groups, providing an outlet for citizens and a warning to wavering Trump supporters and institutions. While not immediately altering the political landscape, these mass movements are crucial for maintaining momentum through future elections, potentially reconstituting an anti-MAGA majority. Trump's strong reactions, including an AI-generated video depicting him as "King Trump" attacking protesters, suggest the protests are effectively getting under the White House's skin.</p>

          <p>Several U.S. states are warning that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits may not be disbursed in November if the federal government shutdown continues indefinitely. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the program, informed state agencies that funds would be insufficient to cover full benefits if appropriations lapse, prompting urgent notices from states like Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. Over 40 million Americans rely on these benefits, averaging $187 per month, and advocates warn of potentially devastating effects on vulnerable populations. While contingency funds exist, the USDA has not confirmed their utilization, making the potential for delayed or missed payments a critical policy choice in the ongoing political stalemate.</p>

          <p>A potential mass shooting was successfully averted at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport thanks to the quick actions of law enforcement and a crucial tip from the suspect's family. Billy Joe Cagle, 49, of Cartersville, was arrested after his family reported he was livestreaming threats to "shoot up" the airport. Officers located a Springfield AR-15 assault rifle with 27 rounds of ammunition in his truck parked outside the South Terminal. Cagle, a felon with documented mental health challenges, was taken into custody unarmed inside the terminal, where investigators believe he was scouting the area. Authorities lauded the community and inter-agency collaboration for preventing a tragedy.</p>

Her defense argued she was framed by law enforcement and others, presenting a federal investigation that questioned the SUV impact theory.

          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett predicted the government shutdown would likely end this week, suggesting the administration might implement "stronger measures" if Democrats continue to resist. The shutdown, now in its third week, persists due to a partisan stalemate over federal funding and the extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits. Hassett claimed Democrats were delaying a vote to reopen the government for political optics, ahead of "No Kings" protests. Despite Republican efforts to pass short-term funding, Democrats, who benefit from public opinion polls blaming Trump for the impasse, remain firm on their healthcare funding demands.

Nuno conceded the team's performance was "not good enough" after a 2-0 defeat, recognizing that fan anxiety is impacting players.

While Trump can command the troops, a separate order still blocks their actual deployment to Portland, where protests have occurred near an ICE facility.

          <p>A significant Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage caused widespread disruption globally, knocking offline over a thousand apps and websites, including Snapchat, Reddit, and major banks like Lloyds. The incident, which saw user problem reports soar, highlighted the critical interdependence of internet infrastructure on a few dominant cloud providers. Experts warned of the perils of such concentration, with one noting that "small errors, often human made, can have widespread and significant impact." While Amazon reported services were recovering after fixing an underlying DNS issue, the event sparked calls to reconsider reliance on a handful of monopoly platforms for security and economic resilience.</p>

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey announced that European troops are "ready to deploy" to Ukraine within weeks, contingent on a ceasefire agreement between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. This readiness stems from detailed plans developed by a "coalition of the willing" of 26 European nations, formed to guarantee Ukraine's security. Healey emphasized that Ukrainians must decide the terms of any peace talks, while warning of a "new era of threat" and the highest risk of wider European conflict since WWII. The announcement follows reports of a tense White House meeting where Trump reportedly pressured Ukrainian President Zelensky to cede territory to Russia.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report on the deadly Lisbon funicular crash, which tragically killed at least 16 people and injured 21 in September, has concluded that the snapped haulage cable was substandard. The report stated the cable did not meet the required specifications laid out by the city's transport operator, despite having been in use for less than a year. Investigators also identified five instances where the maintenance program referred to "non-existent, inapplicable or outdated standards." After the cable broke, safety systems failed, with the pneumatic brake becoming inoperable and the manual brake proving insufficient to stop the runaway car, highlighting critical safety oversights and potential negligence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that to avert potential conflict, the West must critically re-evaluate its perception of China, moving beyond a "mirror" view that projects Western historical patterns of aggression onto China's rise. Drawing on the concept of Thucydides's Trap, the article contends that applying Western and Japanese histories of conquest to China's 5,000-year, land-bound cultural DNA is a conceptual misstep. China's history, shaped by geography and a defensive posture within its fertile heartlands against nomadic incursions, suggests a different trajectory than one of inevitable maritime expansion and rivalry. The author advocates for understanding China through its own unique historical and ecological context to foster a more accurate and peaceful engagement.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to double the ICE workforce is facing significant hurdles, with over a third of new recruits failing the agency's personal fitness test, impeding the goal of deploying 10,000 deportation officers by January. The test, requiring 15 push-ups, 32 sit-ups, and a 1.5-mile run in 14 minutes, has proven a major obstacle, especially the run. Senior ICE officials are concerned about the quality of recruits, noting that many misrepresented their physical condition. The agency has already eased academy standards and is now moving fitness checks earlier in training to improve efficiency, while also offering bonuses and student-loan forgiveness to attract candidates.</p>

Authorities accuse him of orchestrating the 2013 murder of Juan Jesus Guerrero Chapa, a rival cartel lawyer, in Southlake, Texas, as an act of revenge for his father's death. After years on the run, Villareal-Hernandez was finally arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the U.S. this past February. His arraignment for conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, interstate stalking, and continuing a criminal enterprise is scheduled for October 29, highlighting a determined pursuit of justice.</p>

          <p>Cannabis-infused beverages, containing THC and/or CBD, are rapidly gaining popularity in the U.S. as Americans consume less alcohol, with Gallup reporting the lowest drinking rates since 1939. These drinks, marketed as nonalcoholic alternatives, are projected to grow from $1.1 billion to nearly $5.6 billion by 2035. While offering zero calories and sugar, doctors warn of potential side effects like anxiety, paranoia, and impaired memory, especially for teens and those with certain health conditions. Despite a patchwork of state regulations, major retailers like Target are testing sales, signaling a significant shift in consumer preference towards cannabis drinks as a social alternative.

The exhibition directly contrasts with President Trump's executive order to reinstall such monuments, asserting that they promote white supremacy. Artist Kara Walker's "Unmanned Drone," a headless, zombie-like sculpture of Stonewall Jackson, aims to reframe the mythological legacy of Confederate figures, with the melted bronze ingots set for further artistic transformation.</p>

Kimmel's suspension by ABC, owned by Disney, came after comments he made about a shooting and pressure from a federal regulator, sparking free speech debates and calls for a boycott. While new sign-ups partially offset the losses, and planned subscription price increases also coincided with the churn, the data suggests a financial impact from the controversy.</p>
