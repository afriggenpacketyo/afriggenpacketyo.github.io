          <p>Representative Michael McCaul highlights a provision in President Trump's tax bill that could allocate $12 billion to reimburse states, particularly Texas, for expenses incurred in securing the border during the Biden administration. McCaul emphasizes that Texas bore the brunt of the federal mission due to the Biden administration's failure to deliver on border security, spending over $11 billion on efforts like building the border wall and detention facilities. The measure, included in a "managers amendment," is now headed to the Senate, where Senator Cornyn is expected to champion it, with confidence from McCaul that it will remain in the bill. Governor Abbott expresses gratitude for the allocation, recognizing it as a reduction of the financial burden Texas incurred addressing a national issue. </p>

          <p>The UK government is preparing for a difficult Spending Review, with insiders predicting tough decisions as departments compete for limited funds. While overall government spending is increasing due to tax rises, priority areas like health and defense are receiving significant boosts, leading to budget cuts elsewhere. The Chancellor aims to set government budgets through 2029, prioritizing long-term capital projects like infrastructure while squeezing day-to-day spending on public services. Tensions are rising as ministers negotiate allocations, with potential impacts on services like policing, care for vulnerable populations, and education. </p>

These include negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, calls for a cease-fire in Gaza, and engagement with Syria's new head of state. The administration's inclination to reduce its assertive role in the Middle East also contrasts with Israel's reliance on US support. While the alliance is unlikely to collapse, Israel faces a more challenging landscape with an ally potentially less aligned with its interests. </p>

          <p>The EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, responded to President Trump's threat of 50% tariffs on EU goods by stating that any trade deal must be based on "respect not threats." Trump's announcement followed frustration with the progress of a trade agreement with the EU, claiming a trade deficit. European politicians expressed disappointment, with the French trade minister reaffirming a commitment to de-escalation while being ready to respond. The EU is one of the US’s largest trading partners, and the situation remains tense as negotiations continue. </p>

          <p>An Alabama study reveals that climate-resilient construction methods, particularly the Fortified standards, significantly reduce hurricane damage and insurance claims. Homes built or retrofitted to Fortified standards experienced fewer and less costly claims during Hurricane Sally in 2020. If all impacted homes had met these standards, insurers could have saved up to $112 million, and policyholders could have saved nearly $35 million in deductibles. The study supports Alabama's approach of mandatory insurance discounts for Fortified homes and grant programs to help homeowners afford retrofits, potentially serving as a national model. </p>

Open-heart surgery confirmed the diagnosis, and the removal of the thickened pericardium relieved the pressure on Mauceri's heart.

          <p>Netflix's miniseries 'Sirens,' adapted from Molly Smith Metzler's play, combines beach-read aesthetics with sharp satire and insight into the lives of wealthy individuals.

The series explores themes of money, class, and power dynamics between women, contrasting the repetitive work of Michaela's staff with the curated efforts of Michaela and her followers. While the show is entertaining, its strength lies in the complex relationships and the exploration of loyalty and love. </p>
