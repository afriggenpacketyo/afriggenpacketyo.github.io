          <p>President Trump has placed the Washington, D.C. police under federal control and deployed the National Guard, citing an emergency over what he calls rampant crime. This unprecedented move was met with strong opposition from local officials, who contend that official statistics show crime is actually at a 30-year low. The D.C. Attorney General has labeled the action unlawful and is considering legal challenges, arguing there is no factual basis for such a drastic federal intervention.</p>

He described the meeting as an exploratory effort aimed at ending the war and stated he would consult with European leaders and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy afterward. In response, President Zelenskyy has asserted that any agreements reached without Kyiv's direct participation would be considered "dead decisions."</p>

          <p>AMC Entertainment's stock rose after the company reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter financial results, including a significant narrowing of its net loss and a 35% year-over-year revenue increase. CEO Adam Aron attributed the positive performance to a recovering industry-wide box office, a 26% rise in attendance, and record-breaking revenue per patron. The company has also successfully restructured its debt, pushing maturities out to 2029, which strengthens its financial foundation for future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article outlines how a reverse mortgage could serve as a valuable financial tool for certain seniors, particularly in a climate of rising living costs. It identifies three specific groups who might benefit: those on fixed incomes needing a supplement, homeowners with significant equity but limited liquid cash, and seniors who wish to age in place by funding necessary home modifications. The tool allows homeowners to access their equity without monthly loan payments, but the article stresses the importance of understanding the associated risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A severe heatwave is sweeping across Europe, causing temperatures to soar above 109°F (43°C) and fueling devastating wildfires in multiple countries. Authorities have issued top-level weather alerts and conducted evacuations in France, Montenegro, and Turkey as firefighters battle massive blazes. Scientists highlight that Europe is the world's fastest-warming continent, a trend that is intensifying the frequency and severity of such extreme weather events and leading to record-breaking fire seasons across the region.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has condemned a targeted Israeli airstrike in Gaza that resulted in the deaths of five Al Jazeera journalists and a freelancer, describing the attack as a grave breach of international law. The Israeli military claimed it targeted correspondent Anas al-Sharif, alleging he was a Hamas operative, a charge he had denied and for which Israel has provided little public evidence. Media rights groups have decried the attack, noting that the current conflict marks the deadliest period for journalists since record-keeping began in 1992.</p>

          <p>Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi was among dozens of lawmakers detained by police in New Delhi during a protest against alleged electoral manipulation. The demonstrators were marching toward the Election Commission headquarters, claiming that voter rolls are being improperly revised to benefit Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party. The protest was triggered by a large-scale electoral roll revision in the state of Bihar, which critics argue could disenfranchise millions of citizens, particularly from minority communities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the Ghislaine Maxwell sex-trafficking case. In his ruling, the judge stated that making the materials public would not reveal any new information of consequence and would risk undermining the foundational secrecy of the grand jury process. He also suggested the government's motion may have been a "diversion" intended to create an illusion of transparency amid political pressure regarding the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.</p>

          <p>A new wellness trend known as "cowmaxxing" is emerging, which promotes the use of cow-based products like beef tallow moisturizer, raw milk, and organ meat supplements for health benefits. Proponents, including influencers and some political figures, advocate for these items as "natural" alternatives to modern processed goods, claiming they improve everything from skin to gut health. However, public health experts caution that many of these claims are scientifically unproven and that some practices, particularly consuming raw milk, carry significant health risks.</p>
