          <p>Karla Flores, experiencing double vision, was diagnosed with a rare chordoma on her brain stem. During pre-surgery MRI, a second chordoma was discovered on her spine, which could have caused paralysis if undetected. Dr. Mohammed Labib at the University of Maryland Medical Center devised a plan to remove the brain stem tumor through traditional neurosurgery and the nose. For the spinal tumor, Dr. Labib pioneered a "third nostril" approach, operating through the side of Flores' eye to avoid spine incisions. After a 20-hour surgery, the tumor was removed, her eye socket rebuilt, and after radiation treatment, Flores is now cancer-free, though facing substantial medical bills.</p>

He referenced a 2027 deadline allegedly set by President Xi Jinping for China's military to be capable of invading Taiwan. Hegseth also emphasized the US does not seek conflict with China but aims to deter war through a strong shield of deterrence forged with allies, and cautioned against economic ties with China, which he said Beijing would use as leverage.</p>

Schoen suggests a more targeted approach to reform, such as canceling social science grants while preserving funding for medical and scientific research.

          <p>US immigration authorities are collecting DNA information from migrants, including children, and uploading it to a national criminal database, according to government documents. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) is creating detailed DNA profiles on migrants that will be permanently searchable by law enforcement. Since 2020, CBP has added over 1.5 million DNA profiles to Codis, marking a 5,000% increase in three years. Experts argue this constitutes a "massive expansion of genetic surveillance and an unjustified invasion of privacy," potentially reinforcing harmful narratives about immigrants and intensifying policing practices.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger is set to face trial in August for the murders of four University of Idaho students, but the case is encountering difficulties, including a lack of a clear motive presented by prosecutors. His attorneys sought a trial delay, citing prejudicial publicity from an NBC Dateline special that allegedly contained prosecution leaks. Recent court rulings have gone against Kohberger, allowing considerable evidence to be presented at trial, including his Amazon purchase history and a master's essay about handling a crime scene. Prosecutors have not yet attempted to ascribe a motive for Kohberger's alleged actions.</p>

Some retailers, like Abercrombie & Fitch and Macy's, have reduced their full-year guidance due to the tariffs. Economists agree that tariffs are inflationary, and the costs will likely be passed on to consumers, with a majority of US CEOs already increasing prices or considering doing so this year.

          <p>The early 'Mission: Impossible' films, unlike many modern franchises, were defined by their lack of definition and strong authorial styles of their directors. The first four movies, directed by Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams, and Brad Bird respectively, were stand-alone stories that allowed each filmmaker to demonstrate their creative strengths. These films prioritized individual vision over building consistent lore or trying to top previous installments. The recent films in the franchise, however, have taken a different approach, emphasizing continuity and intersecting story threads, which sacrifices the unpredictable nature that made the earlier films so compelling.</p>

The restored monument lacks some features of the original, leading an architectural historian to call it more of an ideological gesture than a genuine restoration.</p>

          <p>Consumers are taking a more frugal approach to summer vacations due to economic concerns, according to a Deloitte report. While more people plan to travel compared to last year, summer travel budgets have decreased following President Donald Trump's announcement of widescale tariffs and stock market volatility. The average summer travel budget is now expected to grow by 13% year-over-year, down from an initial projection of 21%. Travelers are cutting back on in-destination spending, staying with family and friends, and choosing to drive instead of fly to save money.</p>
