        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has abruptly canceled two pandemic-era grant programs that provided about $1 billion for food aid organizations to purchase produce directly from local farmers. This decision, framed as a return to fiscal responsibility, has left both non-profits and small farms struggling. Organizations that serve food deserts now face significant shortfalls, impacting vulnerable populations like children and seniors who relied on them for fresh food. Simultaneously, the 8,000 small farmers who scaled up operations to meet the grant-funded demand are now grappling with a sudden loss of a major revenue stream.</p>

          <p>Two firefighters, Battalion Chief Frank Harwood and Battalion Chief John Morrison, were killed and a third was critically injured in what authorities describe as a deliberate ambush in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. The suspect, identified as 20-year-old Wess Roley, allegedly started a wildfire to lure the first responders to the scene before opening fire with a shotgun. Investigators found Roley deceased at the scene from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. A motive remains unknown, though it was revealed that Roley had previously expressed a desire to become a firefighter, adding a tragic layer to the unprovoked attack.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in November 2022, has agreed to plead guilty to all charges to avoid the death penalty. According to prosecutors, the deal ensures Kohberger will receive four consecutive life sentences for the murders plus ten years for burglary, with no right to appeal. This resolution brings a legal conclusion to a case that shocked the nation, though it has been met with fury from some victims' families who feel the state failed them by not pursuing a capital punishment trial. The plea hearing is scheduled to finalize the agreement.</p>

          <p>Despite receiving over 1.2 million fan votes and being named a captain for the 2025 WNBA All-Star Game, Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark was ranked only ninth among guards by her fellow players. The voting process combines input from fans (50%), media (25%), and players (25%), highlighting a significant disparity in perception between the public and her peers. While Clark leads the league in assists and has driven unprecedented popularity, her injury-shortened season and recent shooting struggles may have influenced the players' assessment. The final starter list reflects a blend of fan popularity and player-respected performance, with Clark securing her spot largely through overwhelming public support.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting a marathon voting session, known as a "vote-a-rama," on President Trump's signature domestic policy package. The legislation, which combines increased spending on border security and defense with cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs, is being advanced through the budget reconciliation process, requiring only a simple majority. Democrats are using the session to force votes on controversial amendments, putting Republicans on the record ahead of midterm elections. With a slim majority, GOP leadership is working to secure enough votes to pass the bill before a self-imposed July 4 deadline, facing opposition from a few key Republican senators.</p>

          <p>A booming coffee culture in China is expanding beyond urban centers into the countryside, with a surge in new rural cafes designed to attract social media-savvy consumers with scenic views. China's coffee industry is now valued at over $42 billion, with net imports growing more than six-fold between 2020 and 2024. While this trend provides new economic opportunities, some observers question its long-term viability. Many of these cafes rely on a novelty factor that may fade after a single visit, suggesting the influencer-driven model might not be sustainable without evolving to offer more than just picturesque settings.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has escalated his criticism of the Republican-led domestic spending bill, threatening to support primary challengers against GOP members who vote for it. Musk, who has called the legislation a "disgusting abomination" due to its spending levels and a $5 trillion debt ceiling increase, vowed on social media that supporters will "lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth." His opposition also stems from the bill's cuts to green energy tax credits. The public threats signal a renewed political activism from the billionaire, potentially complicating the bill's passage and impacting future Republican races.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have made swift moves at the start of NBA free agency, agreeing to a two-year, $12 million deal with forward Jake LaRavia. The signing came shortly after the team lost a key defensive player, Dorian Finney-Smith, who agreed to a four-year, $53 million contract with the Houston Rockets. Finney-Smith had been an important contributor for the Lakers, valued for his defensive versatility. LaRavia, a 6-foot-7 wing player, averaged 6.9 points and shot 42.3% from three-point range last season, offering the Lakers a new option on the perimeter.</p>

The review will examine statutory maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave, which have been criticized for low pay rates and complexity. With one in three fathers not taking paternity leave due to affordability issues and shared leave uptake remaining very low, the government acknowledges the need for reform. Campaign groups have lauded the review as a generational opportunity to create a system that better supports working families and promotes gender equality.</p>

          <p>As Republicans advance a major spending bill, Americans are assessing its potential impact on their daily lives, revealing a mix of excitement and anxiety. The legislation funds tax cuts by altering programs like SNAP and Medicaid, causing worry for recipients who rely on them for food and healthcare. Small business owners in the green energy sector fear layoffs as the bill phases out tax incentives for wind and solar. Conversely, provisions like eliminating federal income tax on tips and overtime have garnered praise from service workers and firefighters, who anticipate significant financial benefits from the proposed changes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey has denied Apple's request to dismiss a major antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. The lawsuit alleges that Apple illegally monopolizes the smartphone market by creating a restrictive "walled garden" ecosystem that stifles competition and harms consumers. Judge Xavier Neals ruled that the government's allegations of anticompetitive conduct, such as suppressing cloud-streaming apps and blocking cross-platform messaging, are substantial enough to proceed to trial. The decision marks a significant step in the government's efforts to challenge the tech giant's market power, with a potential trial date set for 2027.</p>

While emphasizing that the "doors of diplomacy will never slam shut," Araghchi said Iran first needs assurance that it will not face further military attacks during negotiations. The U.S. strikes caused severe damage to key nuclear sites, but Iranian officials and UN inspectors agree that the country's enrichment capabilities were not eliminated. This cautious stance from Tehran signals a significant hurdle in de-escalating tensions after the recent 12-day conflict.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that a new generation of younger investors is reshaping market dynamics by rewarding companies with bold, forward-thinking ideas rather than those focused on traditional metrics like stock buybacks. He argues these investors are drawn to the stories behind stocks like Robinhood, Reddit, and DoorDash, seeing potential for massive future growth and clever financial engineering. This shift represents a move towards an "idea market" where individual company narratives hold more sway than macroeconomic factors like Federal Reserve interest rate decisions, challenging the strategies of institutional investors who focus on beating indices.

          <p>A report from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health indicates that practical and logistical obstacles, rather than vaccine hesitancy, are a primary cause for declining childhood vaccination rates in the UK. Parents face challenges such as difficulty booking appointments, getting time off work, and a lack of clear reminders and information about their child's vaccination schedule. This has led to no childhood vaccine meeting the 95% WHO target since 2022, resulting in outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles. Experts are calling for investment in more accessible services, including better use of NHS apps for booking.</p>

Kennedy has a history of promoting health conspiracies and has dismantled parts of the CDC while questioning established vaccine science. This creates a central tension: he is bringing ambition to neglected areas of public health, but his methods often drift into misinformation, undermining scientific consensus.</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company has not yet seen appreciable price increases resulting from U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. He attributed this to mitigation strategies, including significant forward-buying by Amazon and its third-party sellers to build up inventory before the tariffs took full effect. Jassy also highlighted the competitive nature of the marketplace, where many sellers absorb costs to gain market share, which helps keep prices stable for consumers. In the same interview, he called generative AI the "most transformative technology of our lifetime" and predicted most consumers would have robots in their homes within a decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy bills for millions of households in England, Scotland, and Wales are set to fall by 7% starting Tuesday under the new price cap from regulator Ofgem. This translates to a reduction of about Â£11 per month for a typical household. However, analysts from Cornwall Insight caution that prices are unlikely to fall much further and remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. With geopolitical uncertainty potentially affecting wholesale prices, there is concern about affordability this coming winter. Ofgem is encouraging consumers to shop around for fixed-rate deals, which could offer more certainty and potential savings.</p>

However, the White House clarified that targeted sanctions will remain on former president Bashar Assad, human rights abusers, and terrorist-affiliated groups. The order also directs a review of the terrorist designations for the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Syria's new transitional president, Ahmed al-Sharaa.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing arguments over the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members. The administration invoked the wartime law, which allows for deportations with minimal due process, by arguing the Tren de Aragua gang constitutes a "hybrid criminal state" invading the U.S. The ACLU contends the act was intended only for major military conflicts, not for addressing gang activity. The judges appeared focused on whether they have the authority to overrule a president's determination of what constitutes an armed conflict or invasion.</p>

In a letter to staff, university leaders cited reductions in federal research support and the potential impact of an increased endowment tax proposed in President Trump's budget bill. The cuts will likely lead to staff layoffs and a slowing of faculty hiring, though the School of Medicine is excluded.

Many importers halted orders when a much higher tariff was briefly in place, creating a supply chain bottleneck.
