          <p>D-Wave Quantum's shares jumped over 18% following the release of their latest quantum computing system, Advantage2, which is the company's sixth and most advanced system to date. The new computer offers a 40% increase in energy scale and a 75% reduction in noise, making it accessible through the company's cloud services. CEO Alan Baratz describes the system as an engineering marvel, highlighting the company's progress in scaling quantum technology to meet industry demands for computational processing power while maintaining energy efficiency.

          <p>This New York Times article details the reactions of Ukrainians to the ongoing war and recent diplomatic efforts. Despite a call between President Trump and President Putin, and negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, many Ukrainians express exhaustion but also a determination to continue fighting. Civilians like Olena Boiko, who have suffered immense losses, view diplomatic efforts as detached from the harsh realities on the ground, while soldiers like Lt. Pavlo Velychko see intensified attacks under the cover of negotiations. The general sentiment is one of resilience and a commitment to defending their future, regardless of external support or diplomatic maneuvers.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article examines the challenges Speaker Mike Johnson faces in passing President Trump's megabill due to deep divisions within the Republican Party. The article identifies several factions, including deficit hawks concerned about the bill's $3.3 trillion addition to the deficit, swing-district survivors wary of Medicaid cuts, clean-energy advocates seeking to preserve tax breaks, and state-tax deduction proponents demanding a higher cap on state and local tax deductions. Johnson must navigate these conflicting demands to secure enough votes for passage, a task made difficult by his slim majority in the House. The bill's future in the Senate also faces uncertainty due to Republican objections there.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article investigates the Trump administration's pursuit of a luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to serve as a temporary Air Force One. The article details the secret coordination between Washington and Doha, with President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steven Witkoff, playing a key role in the discussions. Initially considered a purchase, the deal evolved into a proposed gift from Qatar, raising ethical concerns and questions about the financial sense of refitting the plane for presidential use. Despite Qatar's denial of using the transaction for influence, the arrangement has drawn condemnation from both Democrats and Republicans, as well as ethics lawyers.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, told CNBC that the retailer intends to maintain current pricing levels, leveraging its scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity improvements. McPhail emphasized that over half of the company's goods are domestically produced and that they are actively diversifying import sources to reduce reliance on China. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's anticipation of raising prices due to tariffs. Home Depot's announcement accompanied their fiscal first-quarter results, which beat sales estimates but missed earnings expectations, reflecting a challenging backdrop of muted sales growth due to higher mortgage rates and borrowing costs.

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to garner support for his budget package, which faces significant hurdles due to conflicting demands from various factions within the party. Speaker Mike Johnson can only afford a few defections, as conservatives push for deeper spending cuts and changes to Medicaid, while moderates resist larger cuts to the program. The bill, estimated to add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, also faces opposition over provisions related to state and local tax deductions. Despite these challenges, Republican Rep. Ralph Norman indicated he would allow the bill to advance out of the Rules Committee, signaling a potential path forward.</p>

          <p>A new U.S. bill, inspired by the deportation of Iranian Christian convert Artemis Ghasemzadeh, aims to prevent the expedited removal of individuals fleeing countries with religious persecution. Representative Yassamin Ansari introduced the Artemis Act, seeking to ensure that those fleeing persecution have the chance to claim asylum in a U.S. immigration court. Despite expected Democratic support, experts suggest the bill faces challenges in passing due to Republican control of the House and the Trump administration's focus on strict immigration policies. Nevertheless, the legislation symbolizes hope for Ms. Ghasemzadeh and other Iranian Christians deported to Panama, who feel acknowledged at the highest level of American politics.</p>

          <p>According to a veteran Chinese diplomat, Donald Trump's trade policies have fractured Western unity, potentially reshaping the global order as allies consider alternatives. Wu Hailong, president of the China Public Diplomacy Association, stated that Trump's global tariff war has worsened conflicts with US partners, shaking transatlantic ties. Accusations that allies were exploiting US advantages, pledges to annex Canada and buy Greenland, and the sidelining of Europe in talks with Russia over the Ukraine war have all contributed to these divisions. The tariffs announced on almost all trading partners have also exacerbated the situation, leading US allies to weigh fresh options.</p>

          <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) member states adopted a treaty on global pandemic preparedness, aiming to improve prevention measures, monitoring capacities, and infectious disease controls. The agreement includes equity measures to ensure the distribution of health products and access to pathogen genetic data through a Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing System (PABS). The Treaty's effectiveness depends on its enforcement, and some experts said the agreement does not give the WHO any powers of interference in domestic affairs whatsoever. The most notable absence at the World Health Assembly is the United States, and the WHO depends on how its initiatives are financed â€” another detail that is yet to be decided.</p>

The elimination of the unit could fuel skepticism about the program, as the office identified misuses of the law, including improper searches for information about members of Congress and Black Lives Matter protesters.
