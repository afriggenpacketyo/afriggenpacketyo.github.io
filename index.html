          <p>An Iranian ballistic missile directly struck a hospital in southern Israel, prompting immediate condemnation and vows of retaliation from Israeli officials. Twenty patients were evacuated from the Soroka Medical Center following the attack, which was part of a larger barrage of missiles launched at Israel. Police reported projectile impacts at multiple locations in central Israel and urged the public to stay clear of impact sites. The event marks a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, raising concerns about further violence and instability in the region.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing conflict, an Iranian missile directly hit the Soroka Medical Center in Beer Sheba, Israel, causing significant damage and injuries, though the hospital had been partially evacuated beforehand. Israeli officials condemned the attack as a war crime, emphasizing the deliberate targeting of civilians and medical teams. The strike occurred as Israel attacked Iran's Arak heavy water reactor, with Iran reporting no radiation danger. This escalation follows a series of Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and retaliatory missile attacks by Iran, further intensifying regional tensions and raising concerns about potential U.S. involvement. Optimism is tempered by the severity of the attacks and potential for further escalation.</p>

          <p>In Los Angeles, a series of immigration raids at Ambiance Apparel resulted in the detention of over 40 migrants, leaving families and communities in distress. The raids, conducted by ICE agents, have sparked outrage among activists who decry the separation of families and the targeting of hardworking individuals. Stories of those detained, including a 40-year-old father of young children and a man who supported his family, highlight the human cost of the increased immigration enforcement.

One fragment includes the Latin word 'Fecit,' suggesting the presence of skilled painters who traveled the Roman empire.

The Cook Islands has responded by stating its commitment to addressing New Zealand's concerns and values their development assistance.

While acknowledging the repressive nature of the Iranian regime and its destabilizing actions, the article cautions against the assumption that regime destruction leads to successful regime change. The author highlights the lack of a clear successor government and the potential for prolonged instability in a defeated Iran. The piece underscores the need for careful consideration of the potential consequences before pursuing regime change, noting that history suggests such transitions are often messy and unpredictable.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers will announce plans to assist immigrant communities impacted by recent immigration raids in the city. This marks the team's first public statement since federal immigration agents began launching raids throughout the Southland almost two weeks ago.
