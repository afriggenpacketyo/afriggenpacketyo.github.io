          <p>Overnight Russian strikes across Ukraine have resulted in at least seven deaths and 41 injuries, targeting both civilian and energy infrastructure. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha condemned the attacks, highlighting the extensive use of drones and missiles, particularly in Kharkiv. The strikes affected multiple regions, including Donetsk, Dnipro, and Odesa, causing further damage to energy infrastructure and resulting in more casualties. Russia launched a total of 215 projectiles, with Ukrainian forces neutralizing 174 of them, though the strikes continue to inflict significant harm and destruction across the country.

          <p>WorldPride 2025 is concluding its first celebration in Washington, D.C., with a weekend parade that began Saturday in a historic gay neighborhood and ended at the U.S. Capitol. This marks the first time D.C. has hosted the international LGBTQ+ festival since its start in Rome in 2000, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Pride events in D.C. Despite the usual scale of Pride festivities, organizers note a dampening effect due to the current political climate and executive orders perceived as limiting the rights of trans people. The National Park Service's decision to close Dupont Circle Park during the weekend also sparked controversy. </p>

          <p>Despite bipartisan support for fiscal responsibility, the US national debt continues to climb, with Donald Trump's policies potentially exacerbating the issue. Republican senators are raising concerns about Trump's spending plans, while economists express mounting worry about the growing debt pile. Moody’s recently downgraded the US credit rating, citing the failure of administrations to address deficits and rising interest costs. The debt ceiling has repeatedly sparked legislative battles, raising questions about the reliability of US debt. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Georgia hospital is facing scrutiny over its decision to keep a brain-dead pregnant woman on life support due to the state's fetal 'personhood' law. Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old nurse, was declared brain dead while almost nine weeks pregnant, and doctors have continued life support against her family's wishes. The law, known as the LIFE Act, grants fetuses the same rights as a person, leading to debate over whether removing life support would be considered terminating a pregnancy. The case highlights the complex legal and ethical considerations arising from fetal personhood laws, particularly in medical emergencies. </p>

With rice prices doubling in the past year, more than 40% of respondents fear consumers may reduce their rice consumption. The government has begun selling rice stockpiles directly to retailers to curb prices, which average 4,200 yen per 5 kilograms. There is a lack of consensus on the appropriate price level, with some suggesting 3,000 yen per 5 kg as reasonable. </p>
