          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to permit him to appoint peers to the House of Lords. Farage contends that this move is crucial to rectify the "democratic disparity" in the upper chamber, highlighting his party's substantial support from over 4.1 million votes in the general election and recent local government successes, despite having no current peers. He pointed out that smaller parties like the Green Party and Liberal Democrats possess numerous peerages, advocating for the Lords to better reflect the significant changes in British politics. This request aims to bolster Reform UK's influence in parliamentary scrutiny and legislative processes, ensuring their growing political presence is acknowledged.</p>

          <p>China's defense ministry spokesman, Jiang Bin, has voiced "strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition" to the United States, lodging stern representations over an alleged "infringement and provocation" near the Scarborough Shoal. Beijing is demanding that the U.S. effectively restrain its frontline forces and immediately halt any related acts of infringement. The Scarborough Shoal, a disputed territory known as Bajo de Masinloc in the Philippines and Huangyan Island in China, is claimed by both countries and remains under Chinese control. The Chinese military reiterated its commitment to maintaining high alert to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security, and regional peace.</p>

          <p>Germany has officially condemned a plan by Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich to construct 3,400 housing units in the E1 area of the occupied West Bank, asserting it is illegal under international law. A German Foreign Ministry spokesperson emphasized that this expansion would effectively divide Palestinian territory, severely undermining prospects for a viable two-state solution and an end to the Israeli occupation, as called for by the International Court of Justice. The international community, including the European Union, views these settlements as a breach of international law and a significant impediment to peace. This diplomatic stance underscores growing global concern amidst the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are set to meet in Alaska, with their evolving relationship taking center stage amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine. Initially, Trump called Putin a "strong leader" and "genius," but his tone has shifted, expressing disappointment and frustration over the conflict. Despite past rhetoric, Trump has maintained weapon supplies to Ukraine and imposed tariffs on Russian oil purchasers, yet opted for a summit over harsher sanctions. This meeting, described by Trump as a "feel-out meeting," aims to gauge Putin's willingness for peace, though experts like Maria Snegovaya caution about Putin's manipulative nature.</p>

          <p>Aid agencies are sounding a dire warning of starvation in Myanmar's conflict-ridden Rakhine State, prompting the World Food Programme (WFP) to issue an urgent appeal for increased donations to prevent a "full-blown disaster." The state, particularly affected by a military blockade, faces a humanitarian crisis far worse than other areas, with food scarcity leading to desperate acts, including reported suicides. This situation is compounded by a 60% drop in WFP's global funding compared to the previous year, leaving only 20% of severely food-insecure individuals in Myanmar able to receive assistance. The crisis underscores the devastating impact of the civil war and restricted access.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Tsinghua University in China have reportedly broken a 40-year-old mathematical barrier in theoretical computer science, potentially revolutionizing computer speed. The team, led by Associate Professor Duan Ran, devised a new approach to the "single-source shortest-paths" problem (SSSP), a fundamental challenge in network optimization. Their method bypasses the traditional sorting process of Dijkstra's algorithm, significantly reducing calculation time by focusing only on the most crucial points. This development, published on arXiv and recognized with the Best Paper Award at the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, promises to greatly enhance computational efficiency.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, is on the brink of becoming the season's first hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph, just shy of the 74 mph threshold. Forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center predict it could strengthen into a major hurricane by the weekend. While not an immediate threat to the U.S., its longer-term path remains uncertain.

          <p>A new American Immigration Council report suggests that the Trump administration's immigration enforcement, initially focused on criminals, has shifted to target law-abiding immigrants. The report indicates that barely half of current ICE detainees have criminal records, a significant drop from over three-quarters post-Trump's first inauguration. Critics argue this approach, coupled with the revocation of Temporary Protected Status and humanitarian visas, is causing widespread fear and impacting industries reliant on foreign-born workers. Stories of detention without clear justification highlight concerns about the administration's policies, which some view as an attempt to intimidate immigrants who have followed legal processes.</p>

Critics argue the policy is vague and inconsistently enforced, blurring the line between political statements and human rights issues. While MLS aims to maintain stadium safety and neutrality, its approach differs from most other major North American sports leagues and global soccer norms.

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of Japan's World War II surrender, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged Tokyo to "make the right choice" regarding Taiwan, emphasizing historical responsibilities. Wang asserted that international documents following the anti-fascist war clearly defined Japan's obligation to return stolen territories, including Taiwan, deeming this an unchallengeable outcome. He criticized "some forces in Japan" for attempting to "glorify aggression" and distort history. This statement underscores China's firm stance on Taiwan and its demand for Japan to fully confront its wartime past, linking historical remembrance to contemporary geopolitical issues.</p>

          <p>Negotiations for a landmark treaty to combat global plastic pollution ended in Geneva without an agreement, despite extending beyond their scheduled deadline. Nations remained deadlocked over fundamental issues, primarily whether the treaty should cap plastic production or focus solely on waste management and recycling. While over 100 countries advocate for production limits and controls on toxic chemicals, powerful oil- and gas-producing nations and the plastics industry oppose such restrictions. This failure marks a significant setback, as current plastic production levels are deemed unsustainable, and a recent Lancet report highlighted plastic pollution as a grave and costly health danger.</p>

While the overall beer category shows resilience, on-trade consumption (bars/restaurants) is suffering, with at-home consumption gaining ground.
