          <p>Former President Donald Trump has stated he will not support a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the NFL team reverts to its previous name. On his social media platform, Trump argued the team's heritage is being "systematically taken away" and urged an immediate reversal of the 2022 name change. The team, which dropped its former name in 2020 due to its racist connotations toward Native Americans, has previously indicated it has no plans to change its current "Commanders" moniker. Trump also called for the Cleveland Guardians baseball team to revert to its former name.</p>

          <p>Approximately five million above-ground pools are being recalled due to a significant drowning hazard that has led to the deaths of nine children. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission announced the recall, which involves pools from manufacturers Bestway, Intex, and Polygroup that are 48 inches or taller. The pools' external compression straps can create footholds, allowing young children to climb in without a ladder, leading to tragic accidents between 2007 and 2022. Consumers are advised to prevent unattended access or drain the pools until a free repair kit, which replaces the strap with a safer rope system, can be installed.</p>

          <p>Authorities have formally identified the 10-year-old boy killed in a recent coach crash in Somerset as Oliver Price. The incident occurred when a coach carrying students from Minehead Middle School veered off the road and slid down a 20-foot slope near Wheddon Cross. A major incident was declared, and emergency services, including air ambulances, responded to the scene where up to 70 people were on board. Avon and Somerset Police confirmed that five other individuals, including two children, remain hospitalized in stable condition as the investigation into the cause of the crash continues.</p>

          <p>With average daily phone use exceeding four and a half hours, smartphone addiction is a growing concern linked to mental health issues like depression and anxiety, as well as physical ailments. Scientific studies confirm that problematic smartphone use exhibits classic signs of behavioral addiction, including cravings and withdrawal. Experts recommend a multi-faceted approach to combat this dependency, suggesting methods such as removing phones from the bedroom, disabling notifications, and setting the screen to black-and-white to reduce appeal. Combining these behavioral nudges with other activities like exercise and spending time in nature has been shown to be effective in reducing addiction and improving overall well-being.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has issued a warning about active cyberattacks targeting a vulnerability in its on-premises SharePoint collaboration software, a tool widely used by businesses and governments globally. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) stated the flaw allows unauthenticated access and could let attackers execute malicious code. Security researchers at Palo Alto Networks believe thousands of organizations could be affected, with attackers already exfiltrating sensitive data and establishing backdoors. Microsoft has released patches for some SharePoint versions and is working on a fix for the 2016 version, urging customers to apply updates immediately to mitigate the serious threat.</p>

          <p>CoreWeave, a company that rents AI data centers, saw its stock rise over 5% after announcing its intention to sell $1.5 billion in bonds. The capital raised from the notes, which are due in 2031, will be used for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment. This move follows a successful $2 billion debt offering in May that was reportedly five times oversubscribed and a recent announcement of a $6 billion AI data center project in Pennsylvania. Despite some investor concerns about its debt, CoreWeave's stock has more than tripled since its March IPO, reflecting strong market confidence.</p>

          <p>Christine Hunsicker, the former CEO of clothing technology companies CaaStle Inc. and P180, has been charged with defrauding investors out of more than $300 million. Prosecutors allege she used forged documents, fabricated audits, and false financial statements to portray her company CaaStle as a high-growth business when it was actually in severe financial distress. Hunsicker allegedly continued the scheme even after being removed by the company's board. CaaStle, which Hunsicker once valued at $1.4 billion, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy last month, leaving investors with worthless shares. Hunsicker has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>

The popular beverage, along with other seasonal favorites like the Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew, will be joined by new items, including a Pecan Cortado and Italian Sausage Egg Bites. The fall menu launch is a key part of Starbucks' strategy to boost sales and customer traffic, which have recently stalled after years of strong growth. The PSL has become a cultural phenomenon and a significant revenue driver for the coffee giant since its debut in 2003.</p>

          <p>The discovery of a very large shark fin, estimated to be from a 36 to 42-inch tail, in a Connecticut harbor has raised concerns of illegal poaching. The Atlantic Shark Institute reported that the fin, photographed by a local harbormaster, likely belongs to either a great white or mako shark, both of which are protected species that cannot be legally kept. The presence of rope still attached to the fin suggests the shark was killed and processed at sea before its tail was discarded. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has been notified, and an investigation into the apparent foul play is presumed to be underway.</p>

Habba, who was appointed by President Trump, faces a 120-day deadline that expires Tuesday, and without Senate confirmation, her term can only be extended by a vote from the state's judges. Blanche praised Habba's "steady leadership and sound judgment," stating she has the full confidence of the DOJ.

          <p>An artist who was one of the first women to report Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell for sexual crimes claims she urged the FBI to investigate Donald Trump nearly three decades ago. The artist, Maria Farmer, told the New York Times she identified Trump as a person of interest in 1996 and again in 2006, citing an unsettling late-night encounter with him in Epstein's office in 1995. While law enforcement has never accused Trump of wrongdoing related to Epstein, Farmer's account raises new questions about what was known by authorities and when, particularly amid recent controversy over the release of Epstein-related files.</p>

Previously, the IDF had avoided a major ground operation in these central camps.
