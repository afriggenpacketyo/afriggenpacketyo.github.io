          <p>California's economy has surpassed Japan's, making it the fourth-largest in the world with a nominal GDP of $4.1 trillion. Governor Gavin Newsom attributed the state's thriving economy to investments in people, sustainability, and innovation. California's growth rate in 2024 was 6%, outpacing the US, China, and Germany. Newsom also noted that the Trump administration's tariff policies endanger California's economic interests.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has reportedly saved taxpayers only $150 billion, far short of its original $1 trillion pledge. A study by the Partnership for Public Service estimates that the firings, re-hirings, lost productivity, and paid leave resulting from DOGE's actions will cost over $135 billion this fiscal year. The IRS is projected to lose $8.5 billion in revenue in 2026 due to a DOGE-driven exodus of 22,000 employees.</p>

          <p>Vox reports that President Trump's ban on transgender people serving in the military is likely to be upheld by the Supreme Court, citing the Court's history of deference to the military. The article argues that while the ban may be discriminatory, the Court's precedents allow the military to impose restrictions that would be unconstitutional in civilian contexts. The author notes that the Court has grown more conservative since a similar ban was reinstated in 2019, making a favorable outcome for the Trump administration highly probable.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles is anticipating a significant drop in imports over the next two weeks due to tariffs, according to Executive Director Gene Seroka. Arrivals are predicted to decrease by 35% as shipments from China have largely ceased due to the current 145% tariff rate. Seroka expects exports to be hit even harder, with retaliatory tariffs impacting agriculture, heavy-duty manufacturing, and the IT sector. The slowdown is expected to have a ripple effect at the port, potentially affecting truckers and dock workers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has granted an interview to The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, despite past criticism and the recent controversy surrounding Goldberg's accidental inclusion in a Signal chat about a military attack. Trump claimed that the story being written will be entitled "The Most Consequential President of this Century". Trump has frequently attacked Goldberg and The Atlantic for what he claims are false stories.</p>
