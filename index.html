          <p>President Trump's nominee for U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Mike Waltz, is set to have his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee next week. Waltz, who previously served as Trump's national security adviser, is expected to face intense questioning from Democrats regarding his involvement in a controversial Signal chat that exposed sensitive military plans. The nomination followed the withdrawal of Rep. Elise Stefanik, whom Trump asked to remain in Congress to help with his legislative agenda.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mike Collins is publicly exploring a 2026 Senate bid in Georgia, aiming to challenge incumbent Democrat Jon Ossoff. In a video, Collins stated that while a Senate run was not his original plan, he feels a sense of duty to consider it and will consult with his family and former President Trump. The race is seen by the GOP as a key opportunity to flip a Senate seat, with recent polling suggesting Collins has an edge over other potential Republican primary candidates.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a forthcoming 50% tariff on copper imports, a move intended to bolster domestic production of the widely used industrial metal. The announcement caused copper prices to surge to a record high, and shares of U.S. copper miners like Freeport-McMoRan also rose in response. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the administration's goal is to bring copper production back to the U.S., with the new tariff expected to be formally implemented by the end of July.

          <p>Canadian authorities have charged four men, two of whom are active members of the Canadian Armed Forces, for allegedly plotting to form an anti-government militia. The group is accused of conducting military-style training and scouting operations with the intent to forcibly seize land in the Québec City area. A police search uncovered a significant cache of explosive devices, firearms, and ammunition, highlighting ongoing concerns about extremism within the Canadian military's ranks.</p>

          <p>Following the Senate's passage of major cuts to means-tested programs like Medicaid, this article analyzes the long-standing debate over the political resilience of different types of social benefits. It challenges the progressive argument that universal programs like Social Security are inherently safer from cuts than targeted, means-tested benefits for the poor. The author contends that historical trends show significant growth in means-tested spending over recent decades and that a program's political strength may depend more on its beneficiaries, such as the elderly, than its universal nature.</p>

Directed by James Gunn, the film avoids a traditional origin story and instead presents a sincere, lighthearted narrative where Superman's inherent goodness is questioned even by his allies. This approach allows the film to explore contemporary skepticism toward altruism while defining what makes Superman exceptional, not through isolation, but by contrasting him with his super-powered peers in a bustling, whimsical world.</p>

          <p>The discourse surrounding artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly radicalized, splitting into two opposing belief systems: one of zealous proponents who see AI's rapid, world-altering ascension as inevitable, and another of staunch skeptics who dismiss it as an overhyped fad. This article argues that the conflict has become a battle of cosmologies, moving beyond evidence into the realm of faith. This polarization distracts from nuanced discussions about AI's real-world effects on employment, education, and society, as both sides either trivialize immediate concerns or ignore the technology's genuine breakthroughs.</p>

          <p>A team under Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has reportedly sought access to vast amounts of internal emails and chat logs from the CIA, NSA, and other spy agencies. According to a Washington Post report, the goal is to use AI tools to screen for employees who may be opposing the Trump administration's agenda, framed as an effort to root out the "Deep State." A spokesperson for Gabbard disputed the report, stating the initiative's goal is to expose politicization and restore accountability within the Intelligence Community.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is planning to end the requirement for most travelers to remove their shoes at U.S. airport security checkpoints, according to people familiar with the matter. The rule has been in place for nearly two decades, since the failed "shoe bomber" attempt in 2001. While travelers in the TSA PreCheck program are already exempt, this change would extend the convenience to the general public, marking a significant shift in airport security procedures.

          <p>No-closing-cost home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are attracting homeowners, but it's crucial to understand the trade-offs. Lenders often recoup these waived upfront fees by charging a higher interest rate or imposing penalties if the line of credit is closed early. Borrowers should calculate the break-even point to see if paying a higher rate over time is more expensive than paying closing costs upfront. These products also tend to have stricter credit requirements and may include clawback provisions for early repayment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on Tuesday that he plans to impose tariffs of up to 200% on pharmaceuticals imported into the United States. He suggested the industry would be given a grace period of about a year to a year and a half to "get their act together" and move production to the U.S. before the steep levies take effect. The threat is the administration's most significant move on pharmaceutical-specific tariffs, which the industry has warned could disrupt supply chains and increase costs for patients.

The region, known as "flash flood alley," is particularly susceptible to such events due to its unique topography and geology, which cause intense rainfall to rapidly run off into rivers and valleys.</p>
