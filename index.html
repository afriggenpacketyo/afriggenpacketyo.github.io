          <h2>UK Government Pledges to Halve Sewage Discharges by 2030</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 05:18:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a plan to cut the number of sewage discharges into English and Welsh waterways in half by 2030. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the water sector as "broken" and acknowledged the regulator, Ofwat, is "clearly failing," suggesting tougher penalties for non-compliant water company executives, including potential prison sentences. The plan also includes banning plastic-containing wet wipes and reducing phosphorus pollution, though critics note the pledge is not legally binding and question how the government will be held accountable. This initiative follows public outrage over record pollution levels and rising water bills.</p>

          <p>A sports coach at National Taiwan Normal University, Chou Tai-ying, has publicly apologized for a research project that allegedly pressured student athletes into giving blood. The project, which ran from 2019 to 2024, reportedly involved threats of losing academic credits for non-participation, with one politician alleging students gave samples multiple times a day. Coach Chou admitted to using unqualified students for blood withdrawal and apologized for her "reckless words and behaviour." The university's principal also apologized for negligence, and Taiwan's education ministry is reviewing the case and the individuals involved.</p>

          <h2>Fitness Experts Weigh In on Social Media Trend of Using Vibration Plates for Weight Loss</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 05:00:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vibration plate machines are gaining popularity on social media as a tool for weight loss, stimulating muscles through whole-body vibration. Fitness experts confirm these devices can enhance muscle activation, potentially improving strength, balance, and bone density, making them a useful low-impact option. However, they caution that vibration plates alone do not burn a significant number of calories and are not a substitute for traditional exercise and a healthy diet. Medical professionals advise that individuals with certain health conditions, such as joint issues or pregnancy, should consult a doctor before using them.</p>

          <p>A.P. Deauville has voluntarily recalled more than 67,000 cases of its Power Stick brand roll-on antiperspirant deodorant due to manufacturing deviations from FDA standards. The recall affects three specific scents sold at major retailers including Walmart, Amazon, and Dollar Tree. The FDA notice specified the issue as a "cGMP deviation," related to Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations, but did not detail any immediate health risks to consumers. This action is part of a broader, unexplained rise in product recalls across the United States in recent years.</p>

          <p>Japan is holding a crucial upper house election, seen as a major test for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) coalition. Public frustration is high due to rising prices, particularly for staple foods like rice, and concerns over the economic impact of potential U.S. tariffs on the auto industry. Polling suggests the ruling coalition may struggle to secure the 50 seats needed to maintain its majority, which could lead to political instability. The election also sees a surge in popularity for the populist Sanseito party, which is attracting younger voters with a nationalist platform.</p>

          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have captured the first direct evidence of rocky planet formation around a very young, sun-like star named HOPS-315. Located 1,370 light-years away, the infant star's surrounding gas disk revealed the presence of silicate minerals and silicon monoxide gas condensing, the fundamental building blocks of planets like Earth. This observation provides an unprecedented glimpse into the processes that likely occurred at the dawn of our own solar system. The discovery suggests that the formation of Earth-like planets could be a common process, offering new avenues to explore how prevalent such worlds are in the universe.</p>

Investigators then used DNA evidence to identify another man, George Steven Burch.

Created by artist Robert Vargas, the artwork depicts Valenzuela in his pitching motion and tipping his cap, meant to symbolize his impact and the unity he brought to the Latino community. Valenzuela, who played for the Dodgers from 1980 to 1990, sparked "Fernandomania" in 1981 and became a hero for many Latino fans who felt a deep connection to the player from a small town in Mexico. Fans at the game expressed emotional reactions, sharing how Valenzuela represented hope and possibility for their community.</p>

          <p>Despite a resurgent offensive performance, the Los Angeles Dodgers lost 8-7 to the Milwaukee Brewers, marking their ninth loss in their last 11 games. The Dodgers' lineup showed signs of life, scoring seven runs on ten hits, including back-to-back home runs from Tommy Edman and Miguel Rojas in the eighth inning. However, their pitching staff struggled, with starter Emmet Sheehan giving up five runs and the bullpen yielding three more. The offense repeatedly failed to capitalize on key opportunities, such as leaving a go-ahead run at third with no outs in the third inning, ultimately falling short in a close game.</p>

Government forces deployed to quell the violence have been accused of joining attacks on the Druze community. The U.S. has demanded an end to the violence, while Israel has declared its support for the Druze and conducted strikes against Syrian government forces.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent congressional decision to cut $1.1 billion in federal funding for public media is set to disproportionately harm small, local radio stations serving rural communities. Stations like Allegheny Mountain Radio, which covers parts of West Virginia and Virginia, rely on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for up to 65% of their budget. These stations provide essential local news, emergency information, and community connection in areas with spotty internet and phone service. While the cuts were partly justified by claims of political bias at NPR, they threaten the existence of non-partisan local broadcasters that are vital information sources for their communities.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues a Global Crisis of Morality Hinders Peace Efforts in Major Conflicts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a commentary for The Guardian, Simon Tisdall argues that the failure to achieve peace in conflicts like those in Gaza and Ukraine stems from a global collapse of a shared "moral order." He posits that in a world fractured by moral relativism, where what is indefensible to one group is justifiable to another, achieving consensus for peace becomes nearly impossible. This moral crisis is exemplified by political leaders who operate without consistent ethical standards and by public apathy or denial in the face of atrocities. The article concludes that ending major conflicts requires a collective recommitment to universal ethical standards as defined by international law and shared responsibility.</p>
