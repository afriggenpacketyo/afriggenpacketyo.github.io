          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel returned to air after a week-long suspension by ABC, following controversial comments criticizing President Trump's MAGA movement regarding Charlie Kirk's killing. His return to "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" was met with both protests and supporters outside the Hollywood studio, reflecting deep divisions. The comedian's pre-taped monologue was highly anticipated as his first public address on the matter. This article highlights how ABC and Disney are facing intensified scrutiny from the Trump administration and the FCC, with some local affiliates even preempting the show's return, underscoring ongoing tensions surrounding media and free speech in a politically charged environment.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a significant shift in his Ukraine policy, stating his belief that Ukraine, with European Union support, can "fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form." This marks a departure from his previous calls for Ukraine to relinquish some territory occupied by Russia. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also indicated Trump's patience with Russia is not infinite, hinting at potential further economic costs or offensive weaponry sales if peace is not achieved. This article highlights a major policy reversal from the president, suggesting a more aggressive stance towards Russia's ongoing aggression.</p>

A UN official, however, attributed the incident to a person traveling with Trump inadvertently hitting the stop lever. Trump used the mishap, along with a faulty teleprompter, to criticize the quality of the UN headquarters during his General Assembly speech. This article highlights a minor but politically charged incident that Trump leveraged for his narrative.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults in the UK are unable to move out of their parents' homes due to the escalating cost of living, particularly utilities, council tax, and rent. Research by the Skipton Group indicates that nine out of ten young adults living with parents would spend nearly half their income on housing costs if they moved out. This trend impacts their independence and can also create financial strain for parents who cannot downsize. The article underscores a significant socio-economic challenge, with calls for more affordable housing and support for young people.</p>

          <p>Tether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin, is reportedly planning a capital raise of $15 billion to $20 billion, which could value the crypto company at an estimated $500 billion, rivaling major private tech firms like OpenAI. The transaction would involve new equity for a roughly 3% stake, though talks are in early stages and details could change. The article notes Tether's efforts to re-establish a U.S. presence, including launching a new regulated token (USAT) under the GENIUS Act, influenced by President Trump's pro-crypto stance. This indicates significant growth and ambition within the cryptocurrency market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump launched her "Fostering the Future Together" initiative at the UN General Assembly, focusing on children's digital well-being, but Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska sought a more substantive meeting with her. Zelenska, present at the event, aimed to raise international awareness about thousands of Ukrainian children allegedly abducted by Russia, a plight Trump has previously shown some openness to.

          <p>A prominent Syrian synagogue in Brooklyn, Congregation Shaare Zion, has implemented an unprecedented requirement: congregants must show proof of voter registration to secure seats for High Holidays services. The synagogue's letter cites a "very serious danger" to the Jewish community from the upcoming mayoral election, though it refrains from endorsing candidates or parties. Scholars of church-state relations deem this step highly unusual, questioning its religious permissibility despite no obvious legal issues.
