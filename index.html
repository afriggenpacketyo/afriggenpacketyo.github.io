        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Senate is facing significant challenges in advancing a major tax and immigration bill, with a key procedural vote currently lacking sufficient Republican support. The legislative effort is complicated by internal party disagreements and a recent federal court ruling that permanently blocked a Trump administration executive order targeting a specific law firm, deeming it unconstitutional. Concurrently, President Trump has escalated trade tensions by announcing an immediate termination of trade discussions with Canada in response to a new digital service tax on US tech companies. These combined events illustrate a period of considerable political and legislative friction for the administration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave impacts the UK, urban areas like London are experiencing significantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural regions due to the urban heat island effect. This phenomenon is caused by dark surfaces such as roads and buildings absorbing and re-radiating the sun's heat, compounded by waste heat from human activities. The lack of vegetation and water sources in cities exacerbates the issue, preventing natural cooling processes like evaporation. With global temperatures rising and urban populations growing, this effect makes city dwellers increasingly vulnerable to the dangerous impacts of extreme heat.</p>

          <p>The lavish wedding of billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez in Venice has ignited controversy, leading to significant protests by local residents. Hundreds of demonstrators marched through the city, arguing that the extravagant event highlights the exploitation of Venice while its citizens grapple with overtourism, high living costs, and environmental threats. Protesters carried banners with slogans like "Kisses Yes, Bezos No," viewing the wedding as an affront to the city's fragile state. Despite a donation from Bezos to local environmental groups, many activists dismissed the gesture as an attempt to appease public anger over the spectacle.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent primary schools is teaching children as young as five about sun safety to address the rising incidence of melanoma skin cancer. The initiative, which includes lessons on checking UV levels and applying sunscreen, is slated for a nationwide rollout in 2026. Experts emphasize that sunburn during childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma later in life, and educating children early is a key preventative measure. The program aims to empower the next generation with the knowledge to protect their skin, as diagnoses of this serious cancer are projected to increase.</p>

The march proceeded despite an official ban, which was based on a controversial law equating homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, championed the event, framing it as a peaceful show of defiance against a "hateful power." The large turnout, significantly higher than in previous years, was seen by many participants as a direct response to the government's attempt to suppress the gathering.</p>

The bill, which includes tax cuts and funding for immigration and defense, faces an uncertain future due to divisions within the Republican party over its contents, particularly cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs. Several Republican senators remained publicly opposed or non-committal ahead of the vote, making the outcome precarious for the party's leadership.

This decision follows a city budget plan for the 2025-26 fiscal year that initially sought to reduce the zoo's staffing by nearly 19%.

          <p>Following its recent 12-day war with Israel, Iran has deepened its internal crackdown, executing several men accused of espionage and arresting hundreds more. Human rights activists express grave concern, stating that those executed were denied due process and that the regime is using the post-war period to instill fear and suppress dissent. The government has also announced new surveillance measures to monitor citizens' online activities, which it labels an "intelligence jihad." Many Iranians fear this phase of repression, worrying the regime is taking revenge on its own people after a damaging conflict.</p>

          <p>Through a personal audio diary, a 28-year-old teacher in Gaza named Hanya Aljamal provides a harrowing account of life during the ongoing war.

The diary captures the profound psychological toll of the conflict, where simple acts like a neighbor gardening become symbols of resistance.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has declared that fixing the country's "broken" benefits system is a "moral imperative," following a significant backbench revolt that forced a U-turn on planned welfare cuts. Speaking at a party conference, Starmer assured that the safety net for vulnerable people would remain but stated benefits should not be a "snare" for those able to work. The government conceded on its plan to tighten criteria for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) for existing claimants after facing likely defeat in the Commons. However, dozens of Labour MPs still support a new amendment seeking further changes.</p>

          <p>The recently concluded Supreme Court term was characterized by significant, though not blockbuster, victories for conservative states and President Trump's claims of executive power. The court's 6-3 conservative majority sided with Republican-led states on issues like transgender medical treatments and funding for Planned Parenthood, reflecting a states-rights approach. Concurrently, the court repeatedly sided with the Trump administration by setting aside lower court orders that had blocked his agenda, effectively reining in the power of district judges. This trend highlights a shift towards empowering individual states and strengthening presidential authority, while the court has yet to rule directly on the constitutionality of many of Trump's actions.</p>
