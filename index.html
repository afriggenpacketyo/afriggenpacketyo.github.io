          <p>Mexico has initiated legal action against Google after the tech giant altered the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps platform, aligning with a U.S. presidential order. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated the lawsuit was filed after previous warnings and diplomatic efforts were ignored by Google. The dispute arises from differing perspectives on the Gulf's boundaries and naming conventions, with Mexico asserting that the Gulf of America label should only apply to the U.S. continental shelf. The lawsuit coincides with legislative efforts in the U.S. to codify the name change, further escalating the conflict between the two countries over the body of water's identity.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party, led by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, is preparing to introduce new measures aimed at reducing net migration, which reached 728,000 last year. The proposed changes include requiring employers to invest in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, particularly in the IT and telecommunications sectors. Visa restrictions are likely to be tightened for nationalities with a high risk of overstaying and claiming asylum, such as Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka. Migrants may also face longer waiting periods before they can apply for permanent residency, potentially extending to ten years. The government is reviewing the application of the "right to family life" in immigration cases, aiming for a clearer legal framework.</p>

The records, obtained by The New York Times and The New York Post, include search warrants and sworn statements related to the inquiry that began in August 2021. The investigation focused on Adams' fundraising activities and his connections to the Turkish government. Documents suggest federal agents considered seizing Adams' electronic devices at the New York City Marathon, but instead approached him later, and also detail concerns about potential obstruction of the investigation by Adams.</p>

          <p>Former New Labour cabinet member Lord Mandelson, now the UK's ambassador to the US, has described the recently agreed UK-US trade deal as a foundation for expanding trade opportunities between the two nations. The deal aims to reduce or eliminate tariffs that had been imposed by the Trump administration on certain UK imports, including cars, steel, and aluminum. While the UK's Digital Services Tax was discussed during negotiations, Lord Mandelson clarified that its removal was not part of the agreement. Despite ongoing pressure from the US to abolish the tax, the ambassador emphasized that the current arrangement serves British national interests.</p>

          <p>Top officials from the United States and China met in Geneva to discuss ways to de-escalate their ongoing trade dispute, which has resulted in significant tariffs on goods from both countries.

While prospects for a major breakthrough are uncertain, there is hope that the two nations will agree to reduce the tariffs, which have disrupted global commerce.

Tensions between the two nuclear-armed rivals have escalated since an attack in India-controlled Kashmir left 26 civilians dead, for which India blames Pakistan. The Group of Seven nations has urged both countries to exercise "maximum restraint" to avoid further military escalation, which poses a serious threat to regional stability.</p>

Krystal DuFrene, who relies on disability payments, has seen prices on Temu increase significantly.

With plans to launch its own separate customs regime, Hainan aims to avoid the retaliatory tariffs imposed by Beijing on American imports. The island hopes that the promise of cheaper goods like iPhones and US cosmetics will boost tourism and drive sales in its duty-free stores, which have faced challenges due to sluggish domestic consumption and the resurgence of overseas travel.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe, a move interpreted as a symbolic stance against Beijing's growing military pressure. Lai's speech, which emphasized unity against authoritarian threats, drew criticism for allegedly minimizing Japan's wartime atrocities and the role of the Republic of China in the Allied victory. Critics argue that Lai's focus on modern authoritarianism overshadowed the historical context of the war in Asia.</p>

          <p>The recent trade agreement between the US and the UK, which lifts the 25 percent tariff on British steel, has brought a sense of relief to the struggling British steel industry. Marcegaglia Stainless Sheffield, a major steel exporter to the US, anticipates a boost in demand as a result of the tariff removal. However, uncertainties remain regarding the implications for products processed in the EU before being shipped to the US. The Trump administration's unpredictable trade policies continue to create instability and hinder long-term planning for businesses.</p>

          <p>As US tariffs on Chinese goods reach prohibitive levels, Chinese companies are increasingly moving their manufacturing operations to Vietnam to circumvent the levies. This shift has led to a surge in Chinese exports to Southeast Asia and a rush to find Vietnamese partners. While Vietnam offers advantages such as a shared border and a young workforce, it also faces challenges in managing the influx of Chinese businesses and navigating trade relations with the US. E-commerce platforms like Shein and Alibaba are facilitating this transition, while some Chinese companies are exploring ways to conceal the origin of their products.</p>

          <p>China's consumer prices declined in April, adding to concerns about deflation as the country grapples with the impact of high tariffs. The national consumer price index edged down by 0.1 percent year-on-year, slightly below economists' expectations. While potential negotiations with the United States could ease trade tensions, existing tariffs continue to hinder bilateral trade, leaving Chinese manufacturers with surplus inventory. The drop in consumer prices reflects broader economic challenges, including weak domestic demand and the ongoing trade war.</p>
