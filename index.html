The company is now assessing the potential impact of the BIS Letter on its business, operating results, and financial condition, noting a slowdown in China during the fiscal second quarter.

          <p>The White House has criticized a trade court's decision to block President Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, labeling it "judicial overreach" and urging Supreme Court intervention. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt argued that Trump used his legal authority to address the threat posed by trade deficits. She emphasized that the ruling hasn't affected ongoing trade negotiations and cited Trump's call with the leader of Japan. Leavitt noted that Trump retains other tariff authorities, like Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows adjusting imports deemed a national security threat.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>It is not too late to seek tax relief in June, as the IRS continues to work with taxpayers to resolve debts even after the official tax deadline has passed. Taxpayers can still apply for payment plans, negotiate with the IRS, and potentially qualify for a temporary pause on collection efforts or penalty relief. However, interest continues to accrue, and unpaid taxes can eventually lead to enforcement actions, making it important to address the situation promptly. Taxpayers should know what they owe, consider payment plan options, explore IRS relief programs, and seek professional help if needed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the sentencing of a doctor to 20 years in prison for sexually assaulting nearly 300 patients, survivors in France are demanding action to address "institutional failures" and improve child protection. Joel Le Scouarnec was convicted of sexual assaulting and raping hundreds of patients, most of them children, over three decades. Despite his conviction, questions remain about how he evaded detection for so long, with many calling for accountability beyond Le Scouarnec himself. The victims and their families are pushing for legislative reforms and tougher sentences for serial rapists.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve released a rare statement affirming its independence after Chair Jerome Powell met with President Trump, amid the president's public pressure to lower interest rates. The statement emphasized that monetary policy decisions are based on careful, objective, and non-political analysis. Powell assured Trump that the Fed would set policy to support maximum employment and stable prices, as required by law. This action highlights the Fed's awareness of Trump's pressure campaign and its commitment to maintaining independence.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that the worldâ€™s glaciers are on track to shrink significantly over hundreds of years, regardless of climate mitigation strategies. Even if global temperatures remained at current levels, glaciers outside of ice sheets would lose roughly one-third of their mass. However, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius could save about twice as much ice in a millennium compared to the current warming trajectory. The study emphasizes that every tenth of a degree less of warming will help preserve glacial ice.</p>
