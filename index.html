        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A conflict between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has created uncertainty surrounding NASA's budget, potentially leading to significant cuts in science projects. NASA faces the possibility of terminating forty science missions currently in development or already in space. The dispute also involves potential withdrawal of federal contracts with SpaceX, a company heavily relied upon by NASA for resupplying the International Space Station and future lunar and Martian missions. This situation has raised concerns about the long-term impact on space exploration and the agency's ability to achieve its goals, particularly with the potential loss of international collaborations. The situation is unstable and therefore the optimism score is relatively low. </p>

          <p>Inconsistent and confusing baggage rules among budget airlines have prompted the EU to consider standardizing carry-on sizes to avoid passenger frustration and unexpected fees. A passenger's humiliating experience with oversized baggage led to a push for fairer rules, resulting in proposed EU legislation for standardized sizing of free underseat baggage. Consumer groups argue the proposals don't go far enough and legitimize charging for reasonably sized hand luggage. Airlines maintain their policies comply with the law and keep fares low, but customers desire universal standards to avoid surprises at the airport. The potential for improved regulations results in a moderate optimism score. </p>
