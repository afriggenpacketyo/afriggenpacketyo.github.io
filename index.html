          <p>The WNBA and E.W. Scripps have announced a new multi-year media rights agreement to broadcast Friday night WNBA games on Ion, including the "WNBA on Ion" studio show, a weekly program dedicated exclusively to WNBA coverage. The value of the deal was not disclosed, but the original deal expiring at the end of 2025 was reportedly worth an average of $13 million annually. The partnership has already shown significant growth, with WNBA Friday Night Spotlight viewership increasing by 133% year over year and over 23 million unique viewers tuning in. This agreement follows the league's 11-year media rights deal with Disney, Amazon, and Comcast-owned NBCUniversal signed last July, which values the WNBA's portion at about $200 million per year.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old, pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges in Tennessee after being brought back to the U.S. from detention in El Salvador. Federal prosecutors accuse him of conspiring to transport undocumented migrants, including children, within the U.S. from Mexico and Central America for thousands of dollars. The case began with a 2022 traffic stop where Abrego Garcia was pulled over with eight passengers, claiming they were construction workers. Abrego Garcia's attorneys argue the charges are meritless and that he is not a flight risk, while prosecutors cite alleged MS-13 ties as a reason for pre-trial detention.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel is preparing for potential Iranian retaliation following recent attacks, emphasizing the need for citizens not to be euphoric, as an attack could come in severe waves. He mentioned that the U.S. was informed in advance about the attack, but the subsequent actions of the U.S. are up to President Trump. Netanyahu claimed the strikes targeted Iran's nuclear facilities due to the existential threat posed by Iran possessing nuclear weapons. He also revealed he had directed the military to attack Iran after the death of a Hezbollah leader in September 2024, with the initial attack date postponed for various reasons.</p>

          <p>Germany's foreign policy faces increasing pressure as it attempts to balance its historical responsibility to Israel with international law and diplomacy following recent Israeli attacks on Iran. Germany's support for Israel's security is considered a "reason of state," but the humanitarian consequences of Israel's actions in Gaza have led to growing criticism within the German government. Despite this criticism, Germany continues to supply weapons to Israel, while some German politicians fear being pressured by Israel and insist on not allowing "compulsory solidarity." The article suggests that Germany's role in the conflict may be diminishing as direct negotiations between the U.S. and Iran become crucial.</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment in June improved more than expected, driven by optimism as President Donald Trump rolled back some tariffs. The resurgence ended six months of worsening attitudes, with year-ahead inflation expectations dropping from 6.6% to 5.1%. The improvement was reflected across all demographics, including age, income, political party, and geographic region. Trump's easing of tariffs and trade agreements with countries like China have eased costs on importers, which are often passed to consumers in the form of price hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is struggling to articulate a consistent message regarding the Israeli attacks on Iran, as Republicans diverge over the appropriate response. While U.S. diplomats reacted coolly to the strikes, Trump offered mixed messages on his Truth Social account and in comments to American media outlets. Experts suggest that Israel's move represents a willingness to go against American preferences in the region, complicating Trump's diplomatic efforts. With Iran assessing the damage and Israel continuing its military campaign, the prospects for peace appear increasingly dim.</p>

According to their analysis, the bottom 60% of households by income fell short of the threshold for a minimal quality of life in 2023, with consumers' real spending power decreasing by 4% on average since 2001.
