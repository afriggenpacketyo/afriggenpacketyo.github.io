          <p>A 42-year-old man, Bradford James Gille, is facing terrorism and assault charges for allegedly stabbing 11 people at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan. The victims, aged 21 to 84, are all expected to survive the random attack. Investigators have not determined a motive but stated the terrorism charge is appropriate as the mass attack was intended to instill fear in the community. Armed citizens confronted the suspect in the parking lot, preventing further harm before a deputy made the arrest.</p>

          <p>Johns Hopkins professor Yuen Yuen Ang discusses China's complex economic and political landscape, framing its current challenges as a "polycrisis" that could be transformed into a "polytunity." In an exclusive interview, she reflects on the historical depth of U.S.-China engagement, noting a decline in American expertise on China. Ang emphasizes the legacy of figures like Michel Oksenberg, who pioneered deep, nuanced understanding between the two nations. She suggests that adaptive strategies are crucial for China to navigate its developmental path in an unpredictable world.</p>

As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making $600 billion in new investments in the U.S. While some European leaders expressed relief, others noted the new tariffs would still make trade more challenging.

The talks highlight the delicate diplomatic balance the UK must maintain between its U.S. and European allies, particularly regarding Middle East policy.

The agreement, which sets a 15% tariff rate, avoids the threatened 30% and is presented as a landmark moment in rebalancing the major trade relationship. For the U.S., it secures significant new EU investment and tariff revenue, while the EU avoids a more damaging trade war. This analysis notes that the deal's success now strengthens the U.S. position ahead of separate, more challenging trade negotiations with China. (not investment advice)</p>

Her work provides an addendum to a 1935 theory by Hermann Glauert, accounting for real-world forces like wind pressure and blade bending that the original model overlooked. Tyagi's solution uses calculus of variations to calculate optimal thrust and performance, which could lead to more durable and efficient turbines. Experts believe even a 1% improvement in power coefficient from her work could have a significant impact on energy production from large wind farms.</p>

          <p>Russia has resumed regular direct commercial flights between Moscow and Pyongyang, signaling the deepening ties between the two nations. The first flight, operated by Nordwind airlines, carried over 400 passengers and marks a significant step in reconnecting North Korea with the outside world post-pandemic. The move follows a visit by Russia's foreign minister to a new North Korean beach resort, with Russia promising to encourage tourism to the complex. North Korea has been gradually easing its strict pandemic-era border controls, and these flights represent a key part of that reopening.</p>

          <p>The new trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union establishes several key provisions for transatlantic commerce. A baseline tariff of 15% will apply to most EU goods, including cars, though this rate is not additive to existing tariffs. The deal creates zero tariffs for aircraft, some chemicals, and certain agricultural products, while tariffs on steel and aluminum will remain for now. A major component of the agreement is the EU's pledge to purchase $750 billion of U.S. energy and for European companies to invest $600 billion in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite criticism from some prominent right-wing figures, many of Donald Trump's supporters in middle America seem indifferent to the controversy surrounding the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Interviews conducted in states like Pennsylvania and Tennessee reveal that many voters are prioritizing issues like the economy and border security over the Epstein case. These supporters often express deep loyalty to the president, dismiss the controversy as politically motivated, and are willing to "trust in Trump." The article suggests a disconnect between the outrage among political commentators and the concerns of many everyday voters in Trump's base.</p>

          <p>Following the fourth Test against India, cricket analyst Jonathan Agnew argues that England captain Ben Stokes must learn to manage his own physical limits, as no one else can force him to. Despite being hampered by injuries, Stokes bowled extensively and was England's most threatening bowler, highlighting both his importance and the team's dependency on him. The article expresses concern that Stokes's relentless efforts could jeopardize his availability for the final Test and the upcoming Ashes series in Australia. His fitness is described as crucial for England's chances, making his self-preservation a strategic necessity for the team.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the influential American musician, satirist, and mathematician, has died at the age of 97. Known for his darkly humorous and politically charged songs in the 1950s and 60s, Lehrer was a Harvard-trained academic who balanced his musical career with teaching mathematics. His iconic songs, such as "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park" and "The Elements," were renowned for their clever wordplay and morbid wit. Despite his success, he largely retired from public performance in the 1970s to focus on academia, and in 2020, he placed all his work into the public domain.</p>
