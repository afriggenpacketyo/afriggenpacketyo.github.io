          <p>Rangers will face Panathinaikos in Russell Martin's first competitive game as head coach, marking a tough draw for the Ibrox side despite being seeded. Panathinaikos, managed by former Egypt coach Rui Vitoria, finished 16 points behind Olympiakos in the Greek Super League last season and have a strong historical record against Scottish teams. Rangers progressed the last time they met, but Panathinaikos have never lost to Scottish opponents over 90 minutes in seven meetings. The upcoming match is a Champions League qualifier with significant implications for Rangers' European campaign, and Panathinaikos have not reached the Champions League proper since 2010-11.</p>

          <p>Honda has successfully tested an experimental reusable rocket as part of its expansion into the space sector, aiming for a suborbital launch by 2029. The test flight, conducted on Hokkaido, Japan, saw the prototype rocket reach an altitude of nearly 300 meters before landing just 37 centimeters from its designated spot. Honda plans to utilize its existing technologies from various products and automated driving systems to develop reusable rockets. The company envisions these rockets being used for satellite-based communication tools and environmental monitoring, as demand for satellite launch rockets increases with the growth of data systems in outer space.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 07:13:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are increasingly employing 'tariff engineering' to lower import duties by strategically altering product materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit into more favorable 'harmonized system codes.' This practice, which predates Trump, involves redesigning products to qualify for exemptions or lower tariff rates. For example, some manufacturers bundled steel and aluminum elements into products to qualify for lower duties, while others are now removing those elements as tariffs change. Companies must carefully navigate redesigning products without fraudulently misrepresenting product classifications, as illustrated by Ford's case of misclassifying Transit Connect vans to circumvent tariffs.</p>

          <p>Speculation has arisen regarding the potential use of the U.S.'s GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb, known as the 'bunker buster,' against Iran's nuclear program. This 20-foot long, 30,000-pound bomb can penetrate 200 feet into targets, potentially damaging Iran's Fordo facility where enriched uranium is believed to be produced and stored. The bomb, designed for use against underground facilities, contains 5,000 pounds of explosives and would be delivered by a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. The stealth capabilities of the B-2 would not be a factor as Israel's military has destroyed a major part of Iran's air defense systems.</p>

Boelter's projects included ambitious endeavors like ending American hunger and starting businesses in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

At the Tehran site, one building was hit where advanced centrifuge rotors were manufactured and tested, while at Karaj, two buildings were destroyed where different centrifuge components were manufactured. Both sites were previously under IAEA monitoring and verification under the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, which the U.S. withdrew from in 2018.

Women are more likely to feel the impacts of inflation due to existing gender inequality, including pay gaps and household responsibilities. They also report greater difficulty affording essential goods and services and are less confident about affording a family or receiving a meaningful raise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An antitrust lawsuit led by Texas against Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street, citing ESG concerns, could inadvertently undermine President Trumpâ€™s goal to revive the U.S. coal industry. The lawsuit accuses these asset managers of pressuring coal companies to reduce production, potentially requiring them to divest their holdings in major coal companies. This divestment could lead to a loss of nearly $18 billion in capital for the coal industry, hindering modernization and growth efforts. Experts argue that factors like abundant natural gas, renewable energy developments, and climate regulations are the primary drivers of coal's decline, not asset managers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's 50+1 rule, in place since 1999, ensures that club members retain control over professional football clubs, preventing external investors from taking complete control. The rule stipulates that the parent club must hold at least 50 percent plus one vote in its spun-off professional football company. Exceptions exist for clubs like Bayer Leverkusen and VfL Wolfsburg due to long-term investment, while RB Leipzig is criticized for circumventing the rule. Critics argue the rule puts German clubs at a financial disadvantage, while supporters value fan culture and equality.</p>

          <p>UK inflation remains at 3.4%, the highest in over a year, with chocolate prices rising at the fastest pace on record due to bad weather in cocoa-producing regions. Food prices have risen for three consecutive months, prompting speculation that businesses are passing on increased employer National Insurance payments to customers. Rising food inflation was partially offset by cheaper travel prices in May, and the Bank of England is not expected to cut interest rates. Retailers have warned that costs from the chancellor's Budget could not be fully absorbed and would inevitably lead to higher prices for shoppers.</p>

          <p>Israel's attack on Iran has ignited a debate over its legality under international law, with questions arising whether it constitutes self-defense or a preventive attack. International law sets strict rules for self-defense, requiring an imminent attack, which some experts argue was not present in this case. Others argue the attack should be viewed as part of a larger conflict or that the severity of the Iranian nuclear threat justifies a more liberal interpretation of self-defense. Concerns are also raised about the potential erosion of international law if the definition of self-defense is expanded.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of Western mayors is urging the federal government and state leaders to address water scarcity in the Colorado River Basin. The mayors propose increased federal funding for infrastructure projects like wastewater recycling and stormwater capture, as well as maintaining funding for existing federal water programs. They emphasize the need for sustainable management of the Colorado River system and call for permanent and proportionate measures for all water users. The group also highlights the importance of collaboration between agricultural water agencies, tribes, and other stakeholders to find solutions.</p>

          <h2>California Faces Dangerous Wildfire Season Amid Federal Agency Cuts</h2>

          <p>California is bracing for a dangerous wildfire season due to hot, dry conditions, exacerbated by budget cuts and restructuring at federal agencies like the U.S. Forest Service, NOAA, and FEMA. These agencies are crucial for wildfire forecasting, management, and disaster relief, and their weakening puts California at a disadvantage. The Trump administration's actions, including budget cuts, layoffs, and prioritizing resource extraction, are hampering the state's ability to prepare for and respond to fires. Experts warn of a potential disaster due to the combination of dry conditions and reduced federal support.</p>
