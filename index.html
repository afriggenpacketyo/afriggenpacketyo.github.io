          <p>Miriam Haley, one of Harvey Weinstein's accusers, recounted her experience in a Manhattan courtroom, detailing how Weinstein allegedly overpowered and sexually assaulted her nearly two decades ago. Haley described meeting Weinstein at a film premiere in London and later reconnecting with him in New York as she sought opportunities in the film industry. The retrial began this month after Weinstein's initial conviction in 2020 was overturned; he faces charges of sexual assault from multiple women. Haley's testimony is a key moment in the retrial, highlighting the #MeToo movement's impact and the ongoing legal battles surrounding sexual assault allegations against powerful figures.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the Trump administration has finalized a trade deal, but is awaiting approval from the unnamed country's prime minister and parliament. Lutnick mentioned that these negotiations were separate from those with China, which are being handled by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The announcement comes after widespread tariff hikes were introduced, with many being paused for 90 days, though tariffs on China have significantly increased. Lutnick emphasized the administration's goal of increasing U.S. manufacturing, and his comments led to a rise in the stock market as investors watched for progress in trade negotiations.

          <p>The White House condemned Amazon's reported plan to display tariff costs on imported goods as a "hostile and political act," with press secretary Karoline Leavitt questioning why Amazon didn't implement this during the Biden administration's period of high inflation. Amazon initially stated they had considered the idea for their Amazon Haul store but later clarified that it was never approved and will not happen. President Trump confirmed he spoke with Jeff Bezos, and that Bezos "solved the problem very quickly."

          <p>Interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOC) experienced a decline in early 2025, reaching an 18-month low in February and continuing to drop in March. The article speculates that HELOC rates could potentially drop again in May, influenced by factors such as the upcoming unemployment report and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. However, the article notes that economic policies and stock market performance could also impact rates, advising homeowners to consider fixed-rate home equity loans as an alternative. Borrowers should have a realistic approach to HELOC rates and consider the fixed-rate home equity loan as a viable alternative, at least through this unpredictable economic climate.

          <p>UPS announced plans to eliminate 20,000 jobs as part of a cost-cutting strategy linked to a reduction in package volume from Amazon, its largest customer. The company aims to consolidate facilities and its workforce to expand its U.S. Domestic operating margin and increase profitability, expecting to save $3.5 billion this year. While UPS stated the reduction was a strategic choice, Amazon indicated they had offered UPS increased volumes before UPS decided to reduce shipments. UPS also highlighted risks from shifts in global trade policy, particularly the trade war between China and the U.S., impacting its international revenue.</p>

          <p>The chair of the upcoming Cop30 climate talks in Brazil admitted that Donald Trump's policies on climate change and trade tensions make the United Nations climate talks an uphill battle. With the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, other countries are hesitant to commit to emissions reductions. The focus at Cop30 will be on demonstrating the economic benefits of shifting to cleaner energy and protecting forests. Despite the challenges, China remains committed to incorporating climate action into its economic growth, and states, cities, and businesses within the U.S. continue to push forward with clean energy initiatives.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how Donald Trump's policies and rhetoric influenced the Canadian election, leading to an unexpected outcome where the Liberals retained power. Trump's tariff war and threats to annex Canada transformed the election into a referendum on Canada's national existence, favoring the Liberals, who are perceived as more skeptical of the United States. The Liberals replaced Trudeau with Mark Carney, a former governor of the Bank of Canada, to defend against Trump. The election results also signal a shift away from free markets in Canada, with both parties promising interventionist policies to protect Canadian industry.</p>

          <p>Gilead Sciences has agreed to pay $202 million to resolve claims that it provided kickbacks to doctors to incentivize them to prescribe its HIV drugs. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan stated that Gilead used speaker programs to funnel money to doctors through honoraria, meals, and travel expenses between 2011 and 2017. This arrangement violated the Anti-Kickback Statute, leading to false claims for Gilead's drugs being paid for by federal healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid.

Europe is emphasizing military support and security guarantees for Ukraine, and working to establish a European force to deter future Russian attacks.

          <p>With rising economic pressures, many Americans are considering bankruptcy as a solution for high-rate credit card debt. Chapter 7 bankruptcy, or liquidation bankruptcy, is designed for those who cannot afford to pay their debts and allows for the erasure of most unsecured debts, including credit card balances, but may require giving up non-exempt assets. Chapter 13 bankruptcy, or reorganization bankruptcy, sets up a repayment plan over three to five years, allowing debtors to pay back some or all of their debt based on affordability.

          <p>Uber is requiring employees, including some previously approved for remote work, to return to the office three days a week starting in June. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi cited the need to fuel collaboration, spark creativity, and increase velocity as reasons for the change. The company has also adjusted its sabbatical program, raising the eligibility requirement from five to eight years of tenure. These changes reflect a broader trend in the tech industry to cut costs and encourage in-person collaboration, with Uber's leadership team monitoring attendance to ensure compliance.</p>

          <p>According to market analysts, periods of extreme volatility in the stock market are generally followed by strong stock returns. When the VIX index, a measure of market volatility, has spiked above 40, the S&P 500 has, on average, increased by 30% a year later. The odds of positive stock returns 12 months later have also been above 90% during these periods. This suggests that investors may be wise to avoid selling stocks during periods of high volatility and potentially consider buying more. (not investment advice)</p>
