          <p>A boat accident in Nigeria's Niger State resulted in numerous fatalities after the vessel, carrying over 100 passengers, capsized due to hitting a submerged tree stump and overloading. Rescue efforts led to the recovery of 29 bodies and the rescue of 50 individuals, with two still missing. Such accidents are frequent in Nigeria due to overloading, poor vessel maintenance, and non-compliance with safety regulations. The incident occurred on Tuesday morning local time, with the boat traveling from Tungan Sule to Dugga. The State Emergency Management Agency attributed the cause to both overloading and collision with the tree stump. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to review a federal appeals court ruling that deemed many of its tariffs illegal, arguing the decision undermines U.S. trade policy. The administration contends that the tariffs are crucial for economic prosperity and peace, warning of economic catastrophe without them. The Justice Department's appeal seeks a decision on whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) authorizes the tariffs and whether the law unconstitutionally delegates legislative authority to the president. The administration is requesting an expedited review, emphasizing the need for a swift resolution to avoid jeopardizing ongoing trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A funicular accident in Lisbon, Portugal, resulted in at least 15 deaths and 18 injuries when one of the city's iconic Gloria railway cars derailed. Emergency services responded to the scene, recovering all victims from the wreckage, with some of the injured, including a child, in serious condition. Eyewitness accounts suggest the railway car sped down the steep hill uncontrollably before crashing into a building. The Portuguese government has declared a national day of mourning and initiated an investigation into the causes of the accident, which is considered an unprecedented tragedy for the city.</p>

          <p>The Restoration of America Foundation (ROAF) is urging the Senate Finance Committee to question Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about the removal of safety protocols for the abortion pill mifepristone. ROAF argues that the Biden administration's rollback of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) requirements endangers women by allowing abortion pills to be prescribed via telehealth and delivered through the mail. They contend that the removal of these safeguards leaves women more vulnerable and shifts costs to taxpayers. The FDA originally required in-person dispensing to screen for complications, but this changed under the current administration.</p>

Judge Allison Burroughs stated that the administration's actions were a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on the university, imposed in retaliation for Harvard's refusal to capitulate to demands that violated First Amendment protections. The ruling vacates the freezing orders and bars the Trump administration from enforcing them. The projects affected by the freeze include research on tuberculosis, NASA astronauts' radiation exposure, Lou Gehrig's disease, and a predictive model to help VA emergency room physicians decide whether suicidal veterans should be hospitalized.</p>

          <p>A former staff member has filed a lawsuit against California Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, alleging retaliation for reporting sexual harassment and alleged ethics violations. Cynthia Moreno claims Rivas targeted her after she filed a sexual harassment complaint against a colleague and stripped her of job responsibilities. She also alleges Rick Rivas, the speaker's brother, exerted influence to deny her a pay raise and terminate her employment after she reported alleged unethical actions. The Assembly Rules Committee terminated Moreno after an investigation substantiated allegations of sexual harassment against her, which she denies.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll reveals that Americans continue to rate the U.S. economy negatively, with most describing it as "uncertain" and "struggling." Positive views of the economy have remained relatively stable throughout the year, hovering in the 30s. The main driver behind these views is the perception of rising prices, with two-thirds of Americans believing prices are still increasing and expecting them to continue doing so. A majority of Americans continue to believe the economy is worsening, with around a quarter anticipating a recession. (not investment advice)</p>

Nio's CEO William Li aims to deliver 50,000 EVs monthly in the fourth quarter to reach the break-even target.

The event coincided with a meeting between Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Narendra Modi, indicating a potential thawing of relations due to Trump's tariff policies. Trump's "America first" trade outlook has scrambled global economic and political alignments, with his tariff policies potentially facing legal challenges in US courts. The parade wasn't the only image coming out China this week that American policymakers intent on maintaining a US-led international order might find concerning, however.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport Venezuelan migrants, finding "no invasion or predatory incursion." The court determined that the situation with Tren de Aragua does not meet the definition of either an "invasion" or a "predatory incursion." The Trump administration has argued that Tren de Aragua is engaged in an incursion because its members have perpetrated "mass illegal migration." The appellate judges granted a preliminary injunction blocking the use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove migrants who sued in the Northern District of Texas.</p>
