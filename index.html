          <p>Scientists are investigating human consciousness to understand the potential for artificial intelligence to become conscious. The research involves studying brain activity and exploring how our minds create self-awareness and independent decision-making. Some experts believe AI could soon achieve consciousness, while others argue it's tied to living systems, not just computation. The illusion of AI consciousness could lead to over-reliance on these systems and a moral corrosion, according to researchers, as well as a shift in human relationships and social dynamics. The article explores the ethical and societal implications of increasingly sophisticated AI systems.</p>
