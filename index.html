          <p>A gunman killed four people, including an NYPD officer, in a Midtown Manhattan office building before taking his own life. The suspect, identified as Shane Tamura, reportedly left a note blaming the NFL for a traumatic head injury, suggesting the league's offices in the building were his intended target. Investigators are piecing together his cross-country journey from Las Vegas and his motives, while officials have condemned the attack and renewed calls for stricter gun control measures. The victims included two security guards and a Blackstone employee, with another individual critically injured.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has issued a new executive order aimed at changing the national approach to homelessness, focusing on making it easier for local governments to move unhoused individuals into treatment for mental illness or addiction. The administration argues that previous strategies have failed to address the root causes of the issue despite significant federal spending. However, critics and homeless advocates express concern that the order may not effectively solve these underlying problems and could potentially lead to forced treatment scenarios. The move signals a significant policy shift in federal homelessness management.</p>

          <p>Officials in Anchorage, Alaska, are cautioning hikers to be vigilant and avoid salmon-rich streams following two separate bear attacks within a week. Both hikers survived the maulings, which occurred near populated areas within the sprawling municipality that serves as a major urban-wildlife interface. Authorities believe one attack involved a sow protecting her cub and do not plan to euthanize the animal. Officials recommend hiking in groups, making noise, carrying bear spray, and keeping dogs leashed to prevent encounters with the region's significant bear and moose populations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly stated that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein "stole" Virginia Giuffre from her job at the Mar-a-Lago spa in the early 2000s.

Giuffre, who died earlier this year, had alleged she was sexually abused by Epstein and others after being recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell at the spa.

          <p>An analysis piece critiques Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's recent decision to suspend all Defense Department participation in conferences and events hosted by think tanks. The author argues the move, which the Pentagon justified by accusing such forums of promoting "globalism," stems from resentment, insecurity, and fear within the Trump administration. The ban prevents officials from engaging with experts and allies, potentially damaging civil-military relations and isolating the Pentagon from new ideas. The author suggests the policy is a self-protective measure to avoid public dissent or missteps that could draw the president's ire, ultimately harming national security dialogue.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, has stated conditions for her testimony before a House committee. In a letter from her attorney, Maxwell indicated she would only agree to a deposition if she is granted congressional immunity or a presidential pardon to avoid further criminal exposure. The House Oversight Committee, which subpoenaed Maxwell, has already stated it will not consider granting immunity. Without these protections, her lawyer said she would invoke her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, creating a standoff with the congressional investigators.</p>

If a user is identified as a teen, the platform will automatically implement safety features, such as disabling personalized ads and limiting exposure to certain content categories. The tool, which is already in use in other markets, will be tested with a small group of U.S. users before a wider rollout.</p>

          <p>UCLA has agreed to a $6.45 million settlement in a federal lawsuit filed by Jewish students and a professor who alleged the university enabled antisemitism during pro-Palestinian campus protests in 2024. The plaintiffs claimed they were barred from parts of campus by a protest encampment, which they termed a "Jew Exclusion Zone," violating their civil rights. As part of the settlement, UCLA will donate to Jewish community groups and an anti-antisemitism initiative, and is prohibited from allowing the exclusion of Jewish individuals from campus areas. The agreement is believed to be the largest payout of its kind stemming from recent campus unrest.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent visit to his mother's homeland of Scotland was met with a mix of protest and political pragmatism. While anti-Trump demonstrators gathered to voice their opposition, citing a disconnect between his politics and Scottish values, Scottish First Minister John Swinney engaged with the president on key economic issues like tariffs on Scotch whisky. The trip, which blended business with diplomacy at Trump's golf resorts, was unusual for a sitting U.S. president. The analysis suggests that despite public disapproval, Trump's business interests ensure he will remain a significant and influential feature in Scottish politics.</p>

          <p>An analysis of U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement to recognize a Palestinian state suggests the move faces significant challenges to having a tangible impact. The pledge is conditional on actions by both Israel and Hamas, such as a ceasefire and disarmament, which seem unlikely given the current political dynamics. The move is seen as a response to domestic political pressure and a hardening of the U.K.'s foreign policy stance. However, with the U.S. opposing such unilateral recognition and maintaining greater influence over Israel, there is a key question of whether the U.K.'s gesture can be more than symbolic.</p>
