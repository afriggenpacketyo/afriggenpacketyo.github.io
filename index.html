Harper's parents described her as a bright and joyful girl, calling for her memory to inspire meaningful action to address gun violence and the mental health crisis.

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged a former Department of Justice employee with a misdemeanor for allegedly throwing a Subway sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer in Washington, D.C. The decision to pursue a lesser charge came after a federal grand jury declined to indict the man, Sean Charles Dunn, on a more serious felony assault charge. This marks the second recent case where D.C. prosecutors have failed to secure a felony indictment for an alleged assault on a federal officer. The incident occurred while federal authorities were deployed in the capital to address what President Trump has described as a crime problem.</p>

In an interview, Zhao emphasized that the city's success hinges on the speed at which its regulators adapt and embrace Web3 technologies. He suggested that the government has shown a clear willingness to innovate but must act swiftly to realize its potential. Zhao specifically recommended expanding the limited range of cryptocurrencies currently permitted for trading on licensed exchanges to foster a more dynamic market.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to maintain faith in strong growth stocks, using AI chipmaker Nvidia as a key example of a company with long-term potential. Despite a minor dip in its stock price after a strong earnings report, Cramer argued that Nvidia's dominance in the generative AI sector positions it for continued success as the technology becomes more integrated across industries. He cautioned against frequent trading, suggesting that investors who trust the market and hold quality stocks are more likely to see significant gains. Cramer believes the market Nvidia leads is one of the largest in the world. (not investment advice)</p>

This 'buddy system,' a school tradition pairing older and younger students for church services, is credited with saving lives, though it also resulted in more middle schoolers being injured.

          <p>Automotive research firm Edmunds suggests that the upcoming Labor Day weekend presents a significant opportunity for consumers interested in leasing an electric vehicle. A $7,500 federal tax credit for new EV leases is set to expire on September 30, making current lease deals particularly attractive. With EV prices already declining due to softer demand, the expiring credit offers an additional incentive for potential adopters. Leasing is presented as a favorable option for those new to EV technology, as it mitigates concerns about rapid depreciation and allows consumers to experience the vehicles without a long-term commitment.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot legally fire Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America, without the approval of a bipartisan advisory panel. The judge stated that the law requires this panel's backing to insulate the international broadcaster from political pressure, and since President Trump has not filled the vacant seats on the panel, Lake lacks the authority to act alone. This ruling is a significant development in a legal battle over Lake's efforts to reshape VOA and its parent agency.

The piece argues that unlike Homelander, the president is constrained by the U.S. Constitution, the courts, and ultimately, the will of the voters.

          <p>A federal judge in New York has denied Saudi Arabia's motion to dismiss a long-running lawsuit filed by the families of 9/11 victims, allowing the case to move forward. The lawsuit alleges that the Saudi government provided material support to some of the al Qaeda hijackers involved in the 2001 terrorist attacks. The judge's ruling stated that the plaintiffs have provided reasonable evidence regarding the roles of certain Saudi individuals in assisting the hijackers. This decision marks a significant step for the families in their decades-long pursuit of holding the kingdom accountable.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that China, as a major importer of palm oil, has a significant opportunity to help shape a more sustainable future for the industry in Indonesia. The article contextualizes this by noting the Indonesian government's recent campaign to reclaim millions of hectares of forest lost to illegal palm oil plantations. While palm oil is a crucial economic commodity for Indonesia, its unchecked expansion has caused severe environmental damage. The author suggests that by leveraging its market power, China can encourage more responsible and environmentally-conscious practices within the Indonesian palm oil sector.</p>

          <p>A long-standing U.S. trade rule known as "de minimis," which allowed low-value packages to enter the country tax-free, is being suspended by an executive order from President Trump. This change means that cheap goods from popular online retailers like Temu and Shein, which have heavily utilized the loophole for shipments under $800, will now be subject to import duties. The suspension is expected to lead to higher prices for American consumers who are accustomed to purchasing inexpensive products directly from foreign sellers. The administration has argued the rule unfairly disadvantages American businesses.</p>

          <p>Public media stations serving rural and tribal areas across the U.S. are warning that crucial funding for upgrading their emergency alert systems is at risk. A federal grant program administered by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has been thrown into chaos by the Trump administration's defunding of the CPB and alleged reimbursement delays from FEMA. This has left many small stations unable to complete vital infrastructure projects, such as installing backup generators, threatening their ability to broadcast critical information during emergencies.

          <p>Shares of Gap Inc. fell after the apparel retailer reported second-quarter sales that missed Wall Street expectations and issued a warning about the future impact of tariffs on its profitability. The company lowered its full-year operating margin forecast, citing increased costs from tariffs. While the Gap and Banana Republic brands showed comparable sales growth, the overall performance was dragged down by a 9% decline at its Athleta brand. The results present a challenge for the company as it continues its turnaround efforts amid a difficult consumer environment and growing economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump to prevent her removal from office, challenging the legality of his unprecedented action. Trump moved to fire Cook "for cause," citing allegations of mortgage fraud, but her lawsuit argues this justification is a pretext to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence. The case, which names Fed Chairman Jerome Powell as a co-defendant, sets up a major legal and constitutional battle over a president's authority to remove a Fed governor. A judge has scheduled an emergency hearing to consider temporarily blocking the termination.</p>

          <p>A contributor opinion piece argues that President Trump is operating within his constitutional authority by moving to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The author contends that Article II of the Constitution grants the president full executive power, including the ability to remove executive branch officers, and that so-called "independent" agencies are an unconstitutional fourth branch of government. The piece asserts that even if a "for cause" removal is required, the allegations of mortgage fraud against Cook are a legitimate reason. This argument frames the firing not as a violation of norms, but as a necessary reassertion of presidential control over the administrative state.</p>

Barton defended the decision, accusing the newspaper of misrepresentation and stating his party would not allow "misinformation to shape the narrative."
