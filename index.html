          <p>Hurricane Kiko has intensified into a powerful Category 4 storm in the Pacific Ocean, moving on a westward path toward Hawaii. Forecasters are warning that swells from the hurricane could generate life-threatening surf and rip currents for the Hawaiian Islands by the end of the weekend. In response to the potential for high winds, heavy rainfall, and flooding early next week, Hawaii's acting governor has declared a state of emergency, urging residents and visitors to prepare and follow official guidance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research utilizing machine learning indicates that the climate crisis will lead to a higher frequency of lightning-sparked wildfires across the western United States for decades. These fires, often occurring in remote areas, tend to grow larger and produce more smoke, exacerbating public health issues and straining firefighting resources. The study predicts that 98% of the western U.S. will face increased wildfire risk due to either more lightning, drier conditions, or a combination of both, highlighting the cascading effects of climate change on public safety.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a new policy of direct military action against drug cartels, exemplified by a recent missile strike on a vessel belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang. This approach, supported by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, treats designated cartels as foreign terrorist organizations and an invasion force, shifting from a law enforcement model to a military one. The administration has made the strike public to send a clear message that the U.S. will not tolerate cartel activities, signaling a significant escalation in the war on drugs in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

          <p>After a mother persistently sought medical help for her toddler's series of unusual infections and symptoms, the child was diagnosed with a malignant rhabdoid tumor, a rare and highly aggressive cancer. Doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children discovered a large tumor in his liver, leading to an intensive and individualized treatment plan involving chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation. Now in remission, the two-year-old is under careful surveillance, and his family is adjusting to a new normal after the traumatic experience, emphasizing gratitude for every moment.</p>

          <p>A landmark test flight in China suggests the development of an AI-powered radar system that is virtually immune to jamming, a significant advancement in military technology. According to scientists at a premier Chinese radar development institute, the AI-enhanced system maintained a target tracking continuity of over 99%, compared to 70-80% for conventional radar under jamming conditions. This breakthrough could represent a paradigm shift in radar design, potentially giving China a major strategic advantage in electronic warfare and aerial combat scenarios.</p>

          <p>Susan Stamberg, a pioneering journalist and one of the "founding mothers" of NPR, is retiring after a career spanning over 50 years. As the first woman to anchor a national nightly news broadcast in the U.S. on "All Things Considered," she helped define NPR's distinctive voice with her curious and personable style. Her contributions are credited with transforming the network's identity and paving the way for future generations of women in media, leaving a lasting legacy on American broadcasting.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has conducted a major cabinet reshuffle following the resignation of his deputy, Angela Rayner, over unpaid taxes on a property sale. The departure is a significant blow to the Labour government's image of competence and integrity, undermining its "Mr Rules" approach to governance after the scandals of the previous administration. The turmoil provides an opening for Nigel Farage's Reform UK party, which argues that both major parties are fundamentally the same, as Starmer attempts to reset his government and deliver on his priorities.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has promised a robust response following the arrest of approximately 300 of its citizens during a major U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid. The raid targeted a Georgia factory under construction for LG Energy Solution and Hyundai, which is set to produce electric vehicle batteries. The incident, part of the Trump administration's crackdown on unlawful employment, has alarmed South Korean companies and could strain relations between the two allied nations, which are also navigating a major trade deal.</p>

          <p>The Harlem Hellfighters, a segregated, all-Black infantry regiment celebrated for their bravery in World War I, have been posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. The honor recognizes the soldiers of the 369th Infantry Regiment who served for 191 days in combat alongside French forces, despite facing intense racism and discrimination within the U.S. military. The medal, accepted by descendants, will be displayed at the Smithsonian, serving as a long-overdue acknowledgment of their heroism and sacrifice at a time of renewed debate over how American history is told.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the ongoing efforts to conceal the full extent of Jeffrey Epstein's network of abuse constitute a crime against democracy by silencing victims and protecting powerful perpetrators. The author contends that sexual assault is an enactment of power inequality, and the system that protects abusers undermines the democratic principles of equal rights and a voice for all. The piece specifically criticizes top Republican figures, including Donald Trump, for allegedly participating in a massive cover-up, thereby prioritizing their protection over justice.</p>

          <p>Recent online speculation and conspiracy theories about President Trump's health, which trended over a weekend when he had no public events, reveal much about the current political and media landscape. The rumors were fueled by an online culture that expects constant visibility from the president, combined with liberal wishful thinking and a general distrust of official information. The incident underscores the rapid spread of misinformation and how Trump's own omnipresence in the news cycle creates a vacuum that gets filled with speculation when he is briefly out of the public eye.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is increasingly using military force to combat the drug trade, exemplified by deploying advanced F-35 fighter jets to the Caribbean and conducting a lethal strike on an alleged cartel vessel. This strategy involves designating drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations to provide legal justification for military action, blurring the line between law enforcement and warfare. Critics and experts question this approach, noting that past militarized "wars on drugs" have largely failed and risk escalating conflicts and instability in the region.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the immediate removal of the White House Peace Vigil, a small tented protest that has been continuously maintained across from the executive mansion since 1981. After a reporter from a conservative outlet described the long-running anti-war demonstration as an "eyesore," Trump stated, "Take it down, today, right now." The vigil, which calls for global disarmament, is located in a national park and has faced threats of removal before, but the president's direct order raises new concerns for one of the world's longest-running protests.</p>

The investment is driven by strategic competition with China and the goal of reducing reliance on foreign manufacturers like Taiwan's TSMC, though it also raises concerns about government influence in a private company.
