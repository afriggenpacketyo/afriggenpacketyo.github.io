          <p>Foreign Secretary David Lammy has voiced strong disapproval of Israeli authorities' decision to deny entry to Labour MPs Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, who were detained upon arrival. Israeli officials claimed the MPs intended to spread hate speech, a charge Lammy refuted, emphasizing that such treatment of British parliamentarians is unacceptable and counterproductive. The Foreign Office has extended support to the affected MPs, and Lammy has conveyed his concerns directly to the Israeli government, underscoring the importance of respectful diplomatic relations and open dialogue between nations.</p>

          <p>A recent study by Chinese seismologists highlights a heightened risk of major earthquakes in China and neighboring regions. Published shortly before a devastating magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck Myanmar, the research links seismic cycles to shifts in Earthâ€™s rotation. The study, analyzing 150 years of seismic data, suggests that the planet's tectonic stress fields may be entering a dangerous new phase, prompting debate about potential future catastrophic events. This research underscores the importance of continued monitoring and preparedness in earthquake-prone zones.</p>

Budd identifies divisions within the white working class, distinguishing between 'heartlands,' 'enclaves,' and 'colonies,' each with unique experiences and perspectives.

The Shandong appears to have bypassed the wider waterways between Taiwan and the Philippines, instead transiting via narrower waterways of the Philippine archipelago. This new route could give the PLA alternative southbound options to approach the western Pacific via the Bashi Channel, a strategic chokepoint, and northbound options included transiting through the waterway between Japan and Taiwan.</p>

          <p>Sales of Hudson's Bay Company's (HBC) striped merchandise have surged as the company liquidates its department stores nationwide. The iconic stripes have become a symbol of Canadian identity, with shoppers hunting for rare items like wool blankets, which are being sold for exorbitant prices on eBay. This surge in demand has allowed HBC to save six stores from liquidation, highlighting the emotional connection Canadians have with the brand. Founded in 1670, HBC played a pivotal role in Canada's development, making its striped products enduring reminders of the country's history.</p>

          <p>This week's newspaper headlines are dominated by two major stories: the economic fallout from Donald Trump's tariffs and the arrest of Labour MP Dan Norris. The Observer reports that Prime Minister Starmer is ordering an 'economic reset' in response to the tariffs, while other papers focus on Starmer's pledge to protect the UK from a 'tariffs storm'. The arrest of MP Dan Norris on suspicion of rape and child sex offenses is also a prominent headline, with several papers reporting on his suspension from the Labour Party.

          <p>Donald Trump's 10% tariff on imports from numerous countries, including the UK, has taken effect, causing significant disruption to global markets. China has retaliated with countermeasures, including extra levies on US goods. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is engaging with foreign leaders to address the situation, emphasizing the UK's national interest. Experts predict that the tariffs will lead to higher costs for consumers and businesses, with potential for a full-scale trade war. The changes represent a 'seismic' shift in the way the world trades, with uncertain long-term consequences.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has acknowledged that its soldiers made errors in the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on March 23. While the IDF insists that at least six of the medics had links to Hamas, it admits they were unarmed when soldiers opened fire. Mobile phone footage filmed by a killed paramedic showed the vehicles had lights on, contradicting initial claims. The IDF has promised a thorough examination of the incident, and many international organizations are calling for an independent investigation.</p>

          <p>Mark Cuban has warned that President Donald Trump's aggressive tariffs, combined with cuts to the federal workforce spearheaded by the White House DOGE office, could cause long-term economic harm "far worse" than the 2008 financial crisis. He suggests that the tariffs, if sustained and inflationary, coupled with DOGE cuts, could lead to a severe economic downturn. Cuban's comments highlight concerns among business figures about the potential negative impacts of Trump's trade policies and workforce reductions on the nation's economic stability.</p>
