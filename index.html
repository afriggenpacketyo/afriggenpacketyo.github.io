          <p>A 37-year-old man, Marcus Monzo, has been sentenced to life with a minimum of 38 years in prison for the murder of 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin in Hainault, east London. During a violent rampage, Monzo used a samurai sword to attack Anjorin and injure five others, including police officers. The judge noted that Monzo's prolonged cannabis use was a dominant factor in his actions, which the prosecution argued was self-induced intoxication and not a defense. Daniel's family expressed that while no sentence can bring their son back, they feel justice has been served.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has altered its proposed welfare reforms after significant opposition from within its own party. The initial plan would have applied stricter criteria for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to all claimants, but will now only affect new applicants. This concession was made to avert a parliamentary defeat, though some MPs still plan to vote against the bill, arguing the changes don't go far enough. Critics argue the new "two-tier" system is unjust and could face legal challenges, while the government maintains it strikes the right balance in managing welfare costs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has limited the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block government policies, in a 6-3 ruling related to President Trump's birthright citizenship order. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for the majority, argued that such broad orders often exceed the authority granted to courts by Congress. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the birthright citizenship policy itself, the decision narrows the scope of existing injunctions to only protect the specific plaintiffs in the case. This ruling curtails a tool frequently used to halt presidential actions.</p>

          <p>California's Governor Gavin Newsom has initiated a defamation lawsuit against Fox News, seeking at least $787 million in damages. The suit, filed in Delaware, alleges that the network, particularly anchor Jesse Watters, knowingly lied by claiming Newsom was untruthful about a phone call with President Donald Trump. The damages sought mirror the amount Fox paid to settle the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit. Newsom's legal team stated the suit would be dropped in exchange for a retraction and an on-air apology, accusing the network of acting as a "propaganda machine."</p>

This verdict is the first of its kind since a 2024 Louisiana law removed the statute of limitations for civil damages in child molestation cases.

The ruling affirms that the law does not unconstitutionally burden adults' access to protected speech under the First Amendment.

The article explains that while annuities offer guaranteed income, they involve trade-offs like limited liquidity and potential inflation risk.

          <p>A Vox analysis of the Supreme Court's decision on nationwide injunctions argues that the ruling is more nuanced than a complete victory for President Trump. While the court expressed skepticism about broad injunctions, Justice Barrett's opinion leaves open the possibility for them when necessary to provide "complete relief," such as in cases brought by states. The article suggests that while Trump is the immediate beneficiary, the crackdown could benefit future Democratic administrations by reining in "forum shopping." Ultimately, the decision leaves the door open for future legal battles over the scope of judicial power.</p>

Simultaneously, retailers are managing uncertainty by reducing their stock, with on-hand inventory levels dropping significantly compared to previous periods.

          <p>In the closing arguments of Sean "Diddy" Combs' racketeering and sex trafficking trial, his defense attorney argued that the prosecution's case is a gross exaggeration. The lawyer contended that the government attempted to misrepresent a lifestyle of recreational drug use and consensual sexual activity as a criminal enterprise. He mocked the evidence presented and asserted that Combs is not guilty of the serious charges he faces, which could result in a life sentence. The prosecution had previously argued that Combs used his power, wealth, and influence to facilitate and cover up numerous crimes.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Guardian examines the recent trend of European leaders, such as NATO's Mark Rutte, using effusive praise and flattery in their dealings with U.S. President Donald Trump. This strategy, dubbed an "orchestrated grovel" by critics, is seen by some as a pragmatic way to manage the president's ego and achieve diplomatic goals. However, others argue that such sycophancy signals weakness, demeans the leaders, and may earn Trump's disdain rather than his respect. The dynamic reframes international relations from an alliance of equals to one of fealty to a powerful leader.</p>
