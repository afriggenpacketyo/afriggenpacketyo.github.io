          <h2>Eli Lilly Adjusts Profit Outlook Despite Strong Sales of Weight Loss Drugs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 07:18:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eli Lilly reported robust first-quarter earnings, driven by soaring demand for its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro, with sales up 45%. Mounjaro revenue reached $3.84 billion, a 113% increase year-over-year, while Zepbound generated $2.31 billion in its initial market entry. However, the pharmaceutical giant lowered its full-year profit guidance due to a $1.57 billion charge related to acquiring an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. The company maintained its fiscal 2025 sales guidance of $58 billion to $61 billion, even with the adjusted profit outlook.</p>

          <p>A group of local men, assisted by an 11-year-old boy, successfully rescued a 10-foot great white shark that was stranded in shallow water off the coast of Ardrossan, South Australia. Tourist Nash Core and his son Parker joined the almost hour-long effort, using crab rakes to move the distressed animal from a sand bank into deeper water. Wildlife scientist Vanessa Pirotta noted that shark strandings are becoming more visible through social media, potentially due to illness, injury, or chasing prey into the shallows, but emphasizes human safety as paramount.</p>

          <p>McDonald’s reported mixed quarterly results, with U.S. same-store sales declining by 3.6%, marking the largest domestic drop since the COVID-19 pandemic's onset, attributed to bad weather and cautious consumer spending. The company's overall same-store sales fell 1% across all markets, influenced by comparisons to the previous year's Leap Day. McDonald's plans to emphasize value meals and popular menu items to attract customers, while international developmental licensed markets saw a 3.5% sales growth. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.67, slightly above expectations, but revenue fell 3% to $5.96 billion.</p>

          <p>The Football Association (FA) has announced that transgender women will no longer be able to compete in women's football in England, effective June 1. This decision follows amendments to the FA's rules on April 11, which initially applied stricter eligibility criteria for transgender women, and now only permits those born biologically female to participate. The FA stated that the policy change was prompted by the UK Supreme Court's ruling on April 15, defining 'woman' based on biological sex, and that the FA would review and change policy if there was a material change in law, science, or the operation of the policy in grassroots football.</p>

          <p>CVS Health reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded expectations, leading to an increased full-year adjusted earnings guidance, although the GAAP diluted EPS guidance was revised lower due to legal charges. The company's insurance business showed signs of recovery, with the medical benefit ratio decreasing to 87.3% from 90.4% year-over-year, reflecting stronger performance in its Medicare business. CEO David Joyner mentioned a cautious outlook for the year due to continued higher medical costs and potential macro headwinds, while monitoring the impact of potential tariffs on pharmaceuticals.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that this partnership will facilitate Ukraine's economic recovery and contribute to ending the conflict with Russia, signaling long-term commitment to a sovereign Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Minister Yulia Svyrydenko emphasized that Ukraine retains control over where and what to extract, with the fund being created on a 50-50 basis to ensure an equal partnership, although some analysts express concern about Ukraine's reduced status.</p>

          <p>Moustafa Bayoumi argues that Donald Trump's second term is characterized by a governing style he terms "rule by error," marked by a series of blunders, gaffes, and slip-ups in implementing an authoritarian agenda. Examples include the White House's taskforce on antisemitism sending an extreme list of demands to Harvard University, later claimed as a mistake, and the deportation of an Salvadorian man despite a deportation protection order, attributed to an "administrative error." Bayoumi suggests that the administration uses mistakes to cover up evil practices and vice versa, deeming this approach dangerous rather than genius.</p>

An executive order exempts collective bargaining at several federal departments, impacting over 1 million workers, while lawsuits have been filed against federal unions. Labor leaders view these actions as authoritarian efforts to eliminate opposition, with potential implications for the entire labor movement, while the White House defends the measures as necessary to preserve legal rights against unlawful attempts to curtail the President's authority.</p>

With both countries possessing nuclear weapons, the potential for escalation remains a significant concern, despite diplomatic efforts by the US to de-escalate the situation.

          <p>Former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams has described the BBC's response to his complaint regarding a Spotlight program about the murder of Denis Donaldson as "insulting," as he sues the BBC for damages at the High Court in Dublin. The program alleged that Adams sanctioned the murder of Donaldson in 2006, an allegation he denies, and his lawyers sought an apology and compensation, which the BBC rejected. Adams stated that the BBC "doubled down on the allegations" and "dismissed" efforts to resolve the issue, leading to the current legal proceedings.</p>

The agreement establishes a U.S.-controlled fund to receive revenue from Ukraine's natural resources, and was finalized after months of negotiations, including an Oval Office confrontation.

          <p>The U.S. economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3% in the first quarter, leading to concerns about a potential recession, with consumer confidence plummeting and the stock market declining. This decline is attributed to preparations for President Trump's trade war, which is expected to bite in the second quarter, causing people to be more careful about spending money. The potential for a recession hinges on whether the president's tariffs stay intact or are weakened, while the U.S. and Ukraine have signed a deal to jointly invest in Ukraine's critical minerals, raw materials, and natural resources.</p>
