          <h2>Tennessee Congressman Continues Push for Release of Jeffrey Epstein Files</h2>

          <p>Representative Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee, has reiterated his call for the Department of Justice to release its files related to the late accused sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. While advocating for transparency, Burchett emphasized the need to protect the identities of victims and any innocent individuals mentioned in the documents. He acknowledged President Trump's recent directive to move toward unsealing some evidence as a positive first step but expressed skepticism that the full truth would ever be revealed, citing Washington's tendency to protect its secrets. Burchett's stance places him among a growing group of Republicans demanding more information on the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the AFC/M23 rebel group have signed a declaration in Doha, committing to a permanent ceasefire and peaceful negotiations. The agreement, which sets a timeline for a comprehensive peace accord by early August, aims to restore state authority in rebel-held areas. However, optimism is tempered by immediate disagreements, with the government claiming a commitment for rebel withdrawal which the rebels promptly denied. Analysts express significant doubt, pointing to the historical failure of similar agreements to be implemented and questioning the political will of all parties to achieve lasting peace in the region.</p>

          <p>The Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) party in Minnesota has officially endorsed State Senator Omar Fateh in his bid for mayor of Minneapolis, choosing him over the incumbent, Jacob Frey. Fateh, a Democratic socialist and son of Somali immigrants, announced the endorsement, framing it as a mandate for change from city residents. His platform includes raising the minimum wage, increasing affordable housing, and addressing police violence. In response, Frey's campaign criticized the DFL convention process as flawed and irregular, stating that the election should be decided by all voters, not a small group of delegates.</p>

This pledge comes in response to widespread public anger over the state of the nation's waterways and follows new data showing serious pollution incidents rose by 60% in 2024 to a record high. Reed stated that the water sector is "broken" and that its regulator, Ofwat, is failing, suggesting significant changes are necessary.

          <p>Despite a strong economy, numerous companies are conducting layoffs, often attributing them to "restructuring" or "optimization" rather than direct replacement by artificial intelligence. Employment experts suspect AI is a significant, yet unstated, factor in these job cuts, particularly in roles like customer service, HR, and content creation. While firms like IBM and Klarna have been more transparent, many others likely use vague terminology to avoid public and employee backlash while strategically transitioning to automated systems.

          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill for a child's lifelong success is self-connection, which is the ability to understand and trust one's own emotions and needs. The article argues that common parenting phrases like "you're okay" can inadvertently teach children to dismiss their feelings, leading to insecurity and anxiety later in life. To foster this crucial skill, parents are advised to validate their child's emotions, welcome their full selves, and model their own emotional regulation. This approach helps build emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence from an early age.</p>

Instead, it proposes a shift to measuring income, suggesting we should track how many working-age Americans earn above a certain threshold from all sources.

          <p>Four individuals, two children and two adults, are still in the hospital following a school coach crash in Somerset that resulted in the death of a 10-year-old boy. The coach, carrying pupils from Minehead Middle School returning from a zoo trip, left the road and slid down a 20-foot slope. A major incident was declared, and the school was closed on Friday as the community mourned and left tributes. Police have recovered the coach and are continuing their investigation into the cause of the tragic incident, while local fundraisers have gathered over £40,000 for those affected.</p>

          <p>Fauja Singh, a centenarian marathon runner who gained international fame for completing nine full marathons after the age of 89, has died at 114 after being struck by a speeding SUV in his home state of Punjab, India. Singh, who began running to cope with personal loss, became an inspiration and was featured in an Adidas campaign. His death has highlighted the severe danger of India's roads, where over 150,000 people are killed annually. While a suspect has been arrested for the hit-and-run, critics point to systemic failures in road engineering and safety enforcement as the root cause of such frequent tragedies.</p>

          <p>Families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas are increasingly voicing a profound lack of trust in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure the release of their loved ones. Many feel that the government is not prioritizing a deal, pointing to the deaths of hostages like Carmel Gat, who was killed after a previous truce collapsed. Campaigners and family members now place more hope in U.S. intervention to force a deal, believing that far-right elements in the Israeli coalition prioritize land over human life. This sentiment reflects a deep-seated fear that the foundational Israeli ethos of 'leaving no one behind' is being abandoned.</p>

In response, the Lionesses announced they would stop taking a knee before matches, stating a new approach is needed to combat racism. The Football Association is now working with police to ensure those responsible for the hate crime are brought to justice. Carter, who stated she will be taking a step back from social media, received support from her club, Gotham FC, and European football's governing body, UEFA, who condemned the abuse.</p>

          <p>Contrary to the long-held belief that personality is fixed, new scientific research suggests that individuals can intentionally change their characteristic traits. This article highlights the work of writer Olga Khazan, who successfully worked to reduce her neuroticism and introversion through methods like improv classes and journaling. According to psychologist Shannon Sauer-Zavala, by consciously and repeatedly adopting new behaviors and ways of thinking, people can shift their personality over time. The process, while not easy, involves forcing oneself out of comfort zones to make new patterns of behavior feel natural, offering a new approach to mental health and self-improvement.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan criticism for circumventing a 2021 law by renaming several U.S. Army bases back to their original Confederate-era names. To bypass the law, which mandated new names, Hegseth claims the bases are now named after different soldiers who coincidentally share the same last names as the Confederate generals, such as Braxton Bragg. This move has been condemned in Congress as an insult and a violation of the law, sparking a debate over historical legacy and the appropriateness of honoring figures who fought against the United States to preserve slavery.</p>

          <p>This long-form essay argues that Oklahoma's complex and often brutal history serves as a microcosm for the entire United States. The author recounts learning a sanitized version of the state's past, which celebrated land runs while ignoring the violent dispossession of Indigenous nations and the racial terror that followed. The piece explores how Oklahoma has always been a testing ground for America's next chapter, from its founding on contested land to its modern efforts at reinvention. It posits that grappling with these contradictions—ambition and betrayal, dreaming and dispossession—is essential to understanding the nation's true inheritance.</p>

          <p>Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate, reflects on her historic career and the current political landscape in a new memoir. She recounts facing overt racism, such as Senator Jesse Helms singing "Dixie" to her, and argues that sexism remains a more difficult barrier to overcome than racism in American society. Moseley Braun expresses concern that the Democratic party is "walking around in a daze" in its efforts to counter Donald Trump. Despite observing a backslide in civil rights progress, she remains optimistic that Americans will ultimately resist authoritarianism and uphold democratic values.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that public support for President Trump's deportation program has fallen, with most Americans now believing it is not focused on dangerous criminals and is deporting more people than expected. This shift is particularly notable among Hispanic Americans, whose approval of the president has also declined. The poll reveals a growing desire for the administration to focus on lowering prices rather than on deportation or tariffs. Views on the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" are largely negative, with most believing it primarily benefits the wealthy, contributing to the president's sliding overall approval rating.</p>

Inside, they found the articulated remains of 12 individuals dating back over 2,000 years, along with bronze, iron, and ceramic artifacts. This rare find is crucial as many of Petra's tombs have been looted, and these remains could provide invaluable insights into the Nabataean people and the history of the famed monument.</p>

The author points to dramatically increased tariffs and mandatory purchases as evidence that Washington is now monetizing access to its market rather than fostering competitive integration. This approach, the article contends, threatens to undermine the economic sovereignty and competitiveness of ASEAN members. It frames them as 'fee for access' economies rather than strategic partners in a mutually beneficial trade system. (not investment advice)</p>
