          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that a significant majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, are in favor of the United States returning to the moon and pursuing a mission to Mars. This support is particularly strong among younger generations who did not witness the original moon landing and cuts across various political and ideological lines. The survey also highlights that the 1969 moon landing is still widely regarded as a worthwhile achievement, contributing to national pride and technological advancement. The poll indicates a broad, positive public sentiment towards future space exploration endeavors.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East L.A. has resulted in the deaths of three deputies from the elite Arson Explosives Detail. The incident, which represents the department's largest single loss of life since 1857, occurred while the deputies were reportedly working to render a grenade safe. The grenade had been recovered from a Santa Monica garage the previous day. Authorities are conducting a thorough investigation into the cause of the tragic blast, with federal agencies assisting local law enforcement in the response.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba are making significant inroads in the global AI landscape by championing open-source models. The release of powerful, freely accessible large language models is providing a strong alternative to the closed systems offered by US giants like OpenAI and Google. This open-source approach fosters global collaboration and has spurred a wave of AI applications within China. Analysts suggest that this movement poses a serious competitive challenge to the dominance of proprietary AI from Silicon Valley, potentially reshaping the future of artificial intelligence development.</p>

          <p>The announcement that Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark will miss the WNBA All-Star Game due to a groin injury has caused a significant drop in ticket prices. Before the news, the average resale price was at a record high of $262, with the cheapest tickets at $126. Following the announcement, the get-in price plummeted by nearly 50% to $65. Clark, who was set to be a team captain in her home arena, will still attend the event but will not participate in the game or the 3-Point Contest to focus on her recovery.</p>

          <p>A state audit has revealed that California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) is suffering from "critical weakness" due to severe understaffing. With a vacancy rate as high as 32% in the last fiscal year, the agency has struggled to conduct necessary on-site inspections and properly address workplace hazards. The audit found that cases were sometimes closed without sufficient investigation and fines were improperly reduced. While Cal/OSHA states it has recently reduced the vacancy rate to 12% and is implementing improvements, critics argue chronic understaffing continues to endanger California's workers.</p>

          <p>Following a directive from President Trump, the U.S. Department of Justice has formally asked a federal court to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. This move comes amid a public and political firestorm over the administration's initial decision not to release more files on the case. The court filing argues that unsealing the records is in the public interest, though it notes that victim-related and other personal information would be redacted. The request also follows a report on an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein, which Trump is now suing over.</p>

          <p>An IT expert, Audrik Matevosian, 21, has been charged with the murder of Robert Boyajian, a 75-year-old real estate professional. In a bizarre twist, authorities had initially approached Matevosian for help accessing security footage in Boyajian's disappearance. Investigators later identified Matevosian in ATM footage using the victim's card and found firearms belonging to Boyajian in his possession. Matevosian confessed to the killing, which authorities believe was financially motivated, and led them to the victim's body in a desert cave. He had allegedly purchased a body bag a week prior to the murder.</p>

          <p>The "California Forever" project, a controversial plan by Silicon Valley billionaires to build a new city in Solano County, has announced its next phase: a 2,100-acre manufacturing hub. Dubbed the "Solano Foundry," the site aims to attract companies in defense, aerospace, robotics, and other high-tech industries, with the goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the state. The project's CEO pitched the plan as a way to restore the "designed in California, made in California" model. While supported by tech industry figures, the project continues to face skepticism from local residents and community groups.</p>

          <p>The family of Cornelius Taylor, a 46-year-old homeless man, is suing the city of Atlanta after he was killed when a bulldozer crushed his tent during an encampment sweep. The lawsuit alleges that city employees were negligent for failing to check if tents were occupied before clearing the area. Taylor's death, which occurred as the city prepared for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, sparked outrage among advocates who criticize the city's approach to homelessness. The family's attorneys argue the "tragic and preventable" death highlights the need for more humane policies and respect for the city's unhoused population.</p>

Gaddis was not the boy's father and had a warrant out for his arrest on a separate domestic violence charge at the time of the slaying.

          <p>Pest control experts and entomologists report that the UK is experiencing a significant increase in its wasp population this summer. The surge is attributed to favorable weather conditions, including a very warm and dry spring, which created an ideal environment for wasps to thrive. While most of the UK's 9,000 wasp species are solitary, the social wasps that cause nuisance are more prevalent. Experts remind the public that despite their reputation, wasps are crucial apex predators in the ecosystem, acting as natural pest controllers. They advise staying calm to avoid being stung.</p>

Subsequently, an allegation that Torode used an extremely offensive racist term on set was also upheld, leading to his dismissal. Insiders reveal the relationship between the two had broken down, and the BBC is now facing questions about the show's future and whether a pre-filmed series will air.

          <p>The Jeffrey Epstein case has become a focal point for many in the MAGA movement, representing a symbol of perceived corruption within a "deep state" elite. This article explores how the disgraced financier's crimes have been woven into broader conspiracy theories like QAnon, which posit that a cabal of powerful figures controls the government and society. For these supporters, the case is less about Epstein himself and more about exposing this alleged shadowy system. This deep-seated belief helps explain the intense pressure on the Trump administration to release all related files and the backlash when expectations are not met.</p>

          <p>A new fantasy stage show in Liverpool, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," reimagines the lives of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a medieval fantasy epic. Written by Helen Serafinowicz, a co-creator of "Motherland," the comedy spoofs J.R.R. Tolkien's work and is loosely based on a tabloid myth about Coleen's engagement ring. The writer and cast insist the show is an affectionate homage to the couple, celebrating their resilience as "heroic" figures who have vanquished foes on and off the pitch. The play is presented as a fun fantasy tale rather than a direct critique.</p>

According to reports from the time, the lions chased off her captors and then "stood guard" over her until she was found by police. Wildlife experts speculated that the girl's crying may have sounded like a lion cub's mewing, preventing the lions from attacking her. The event was widely considered a miracle in the region.</p>

While the network cited financial reasons, the timing—days after Colbert criticized a settlement between parent company Paramount and Donald Trump—has fueled speculation about political pressure. The article notes that all late-night shows are facing declining ratings and ad revenue as younger audiences shift to online clips and streaming.

          <p>Researchers have discovered a specific interaction between a gut bacteria molecule and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The study found that in people with a certain variant of the OTUD3 gene, the immune system overreacts to a substance produced by gut bacteria, leading to chronic inflammation. This finding helps explain why the disease varies so much between patients and why treatments can be inconsistent. The discovery could pave the way for more precise, personalized therapies that target this specific pathway rather than broadly suppressing the immune system.</p>
