          <p>A new report indicates that current climate pledges under the Paris Agreement could prevent 57 additional deadly hot days per year compared to a scenario with no agreement. However, the world is still on track for dangerous levels of warming, currently around 1.4°C above pre-industrial levels, which already has severe impacts on vulnerable populations and ecosystems. The study emphasizes that while the accord has successfully steered the world away from the worst-case scenarios, much faster and more ambitious emissions cuts are required to meet the agreement's goals and prevent catastrophic heat-related consequences.</p>

          <p>The UK government has published witness statements from a senior national security adviser related to the collapsed espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. The documents, released amid political pressure, reveal that the adviser warned of "large scale espionage operations" by China but also noted the government's commitment to a positive economic relationship. The case was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service, which reportedly stated the evidence did not meet the required threshold, sparking a political controversy over the government's handling of the matter.</p>

          <p>One of Alaska's largest-ever airlifts is in progress to evacuate hundreds of residents from remote coastal villages devastated by flooding from the remnants of Typhoon Halong. The storm caused record-high water levels, washing homes out to sea and leaving two people missing while displacing approximately 1,500 individuals into makeshift shelters. The remote location of the communities, accessible only by air or water, presents significant challenges for rescue and damage assessment efforts, with officials focusing on moving evacuees to safer locations like Anchorage.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that he has secured an agreement from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for India to stop purchasing Russian oil "within a short period of time." This development is part of a broader U.S. strategy to exert economic pressure on Russia amid the war in Ukraine, with the administration also pushing allies like Japan to halt Russian energy imports. The move comes after the U.S. imposed significant tariffs on Indian goods, partly as leverage against Delhi's continued trade with Moscow, which has been a point of diplomatic tension.</p>

          <p>The UK Cabinet Office has refuted claims made by Dominic Cummings, former senior aide to Boris Johnson, that China successfully breached high-level government systems and obtained vast amounts of highly sensitive intelligence. Cummings alleged that the breach occurred in 2020 and was subsequently covered up, but the government stated it is "untrue to claim that the systems we use to transfer the most sensitive government information have been compromised." A former head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre also cast doubt on the claim, calling it "categorically untrue" to his knowledge.</p>

          <p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued an emergency directive ordering all federal agencies to patch critical vulnerabilities in products made by technology vendor F5. The order follows F5's disclosure that a nation-state actor gained long-term, unauthorized access to its source code, creating an "imminent risk" to federal networks. Officials warned that the breach could allow attackers to steal credentials and potentially take full control of systems, highlighting a significant threat to the U.S. technology supply chain.</p>

An economist cited in the article attributes the trend to economic uncertainty stemming from the White House, suggesting the job market may not improve in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A UK housing association chief executive has proposed a plan to help the government close costly asylum hotels by moving asylum seekers into social housing. The idea involves the government funding councils and housing associations to purchase more properties, which would first be offered to existing social housing tenants, with their vacated homes then used for asylum seekers. This approach, which is being discussed with government officials, could significantly cut accommodation costs and add to the nation's long-term social housing stock, addressing multiple housing needs simultaneously.</p>
