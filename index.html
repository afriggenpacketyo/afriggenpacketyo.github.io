          <p>The maternity fashion retailer Seraphine, which gained international fame after being worn by the Princess of Wales, has ceased trading and entered administration. The move resulted in the majority of its 95 employees being made redundant. According to administrators, the company succumbed to "trading challenges," including rising costs and fragile consumer confidence, despite its once-high profile. The future of the brand is now uncertain as options for its assets are being explored.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order that prevents the Trump administration from enforcing a provision of a new law that would cut off Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood. The lawsuit, brought by Planned Parenthood, argued that the law unfairly targets the organization and would have devastating effects on patients who rely on Medicaid for non-abortion services like cancer screenings. The 14-day order directs the government to ensure funding continues while the case proceeds.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the diplomatic significance of French President Emmanuel Macron's state visit to the UK, framing it as a pivotal moment to reset post-Brexit relations. It highlights the central role of King Charles in leveraging "soft power" to reinforce alliances on critical issues like defense, trade, and migration. The visit, filled with royal pageantry, is portrayed as a genuine effort to overcome recent mistrust and strengthen a historic partnership in the face of global uncertainty and threats.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have led to the deaths of at least 104 people, with dozens, including children from a summer camp, still unaccounted for. The Guadalupe River rose with shocking speed, overwhelming communities and causing what officials describe as a mass casualty event. Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp, was hit particularly hard, confirming at least 27 deaths among its campers and counselors. Extensive search and rescue operations are ongoing as authorities and families grapple with the scale of the tragedy.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer offered a less alarmist perspective on the administration's latest tariff announcements, suggesting they are likely a negotiating tactic rather than a fixed policy. He argued that the tariff figures are a starting point for talks with countries that need access to U.S. markets and pointed to the administration's history of reducing or postponing such duties. Cramer cautioned investors against panic-selling, believing the ultimate goal is to boost U.S. exports rather than to permanently implement the high tariff rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The scrutiny was amplified by reports that the senator was vacationing in Greece as the tragedy unfolded, drawing parallels to a previous controversial trip during a 2021 winter storm.</p>

          <p>Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki volcano erupted twice on Monday, spewing a column of ash and volcanic materials up to 11 miles into the atmosphere. The powerful eruption has led to the cancellation of dozens of international and domestic flights and has blanketed nearby villages in ash, blocking out the sun. Authorities have maintained the highest alert level and an expanded exclusion zone around the volcano, which has become increasingly active in recent weeks.</p>

          <p>U.S. Coast Guard rescue swimmer Scott Ruskan, a New Jersey native, is being recognized for his heroic actions during the Texas floods, where he helped rescue 165 people. On his very first mission, Ruskan was lowered into the flood zone at Camp Mystic to establish a triage system and comfort the trapped children. He then coordinated the airlift operations that brought hundreds of victims to safety from an area where land and boat rescues were impossible.</p>

          <p>The UK government has scheduled a second nationwide test of its mobile emergency alert system for September 7 at 3 p.m. BST. The test will send a 10-second siren and message to all compatible 4G and 5G smartphones, aimed at ensuring the system's reliability for real-life dangers like extreme weather or terror attacks. This follows a previous test in 2023 that revealed technical problems, which the government says have since been reviewed and addressed.</p>

          <p>This article scrutinizes the Trump administration's claim that its signature spending bill will not lead to any loss of health insurance, despite the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projecting 8 million people will be cut from Medicaid. It focuses on the arguments of National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, who dismissed the CBO's forecast by citing its past inaccuracies. The analysis contrasts Hassett's optimistic assertions with the CBO's data and his own history of making flawed economic predictions.</p>

          <p>California, along with a coalition of 17 other states, has filed a legal challenge against recent federal immigration raids in Los Angeles, arguing they are unconstitutional. The states' amicus brief supports a lawsuit claiming that masked federal agents conducted "suspicionless" stops that have terrorized communities and violated residents' rights. The legal action seeks a temporary restraining order to halt the operations, which local and state leaders have condemned as a political stunt that undermines public safety.</p>
