          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has downplayed concerns that the company's advanced chips could be used by China's military, arguing that Beijing cannot rely on technology that could be restricted by the U.S. at any time. In a recent interview, Huang reiterated his criticism of U.S. export controls, stating they are counterproductive to maintaining America's global tech leadership, as they limit access to the large market of Chinese AI developers. This statement comes as Huang navigates a delicate balance between Washington's security policies and the company's significant business interests in China. He is attempting to maintain market access while reportedly developing new, compliant chips for the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>A major wildfire at the Grand Canyon's North Rim has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and between 50 to 80 other structures, including administrative buildings and a water treatment facility. The Dragon Bravo Fire grew rapidly due to strong winds, forcing evacuations and closures within the national park. The loss of the lodge, a beloved landmark originally built in the 1920s, has been described as a devastating blow to Arizona's history. Meanwhile, smoke from separate Canadian wildfires is causing poor air quality across the Upper Midwest, and other fires are burning in national parks in Arizona and Colorado amid extreme heat warnings.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte have announced a significant new arms deal to support Ukraine, which will be funded by European allies. The agreement involves NATO countries like Germany, Finland, and Denmark purchasing billions of dollars worth of U.S.-manufactured weapons for rapid distribution to Ukrainian forces. Rutte described the deal as a "really big" and logical step, highlighting it as an example of European nations increasing their defense contributions. This development was announced shortly after President Trump set a 50-day deadline for Russia to agree to a peace deal, underscoring a dual strategy of diplomatic pressure and military support.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a 50-day ultimatum to Russia, threatening to impose "very severe" secondary tariffs of 100% on countries doing business with Moscow if a peace deal with Ukraine is not reached. This announcement marks a significant escalation of economic pressure on Russia. Concurrently, the U.S. special envoy is in Kyiv for discussions, and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has nominated a new prime minister to renew his government. The developments reflect a multi-pronged approach by the U.S. and its allies, combining economic threats with diplomatic engagement and continued military support for Ukraine, including new arms packages.</p>

          <p>Health officials in Coconino County, Arizona, have confirmed that a resident has died from pneumonic plague, a rare and severe lung infection. This is the first such death in the county since 2007, though officials state it appears unrelated to a recent die-off of prairie dogs in the area that is also being investigated for plague. Pneumonic plague is caused by the same bacterium as bubonic plague but can spread between people through airborne droplets, although human-to-human transmission is rare. Authorities have issued public safety guidelines, advising caution around wild or dead animals and rodent burrows in the region.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing a significant political crisis as his government heads into the summer recess. The turmoil stems from a failure to elect three new judges to Germany's Constitutional Court, an unprecedented event that has raised questions about his control over his conservative bloc and drawn a warning from the German president. This internal strife is compounded by external pressure, particularly President Trump's threat to impose 30% tariffs on EU imports, which Merz acknowledged will "cut to the bone" of Germany's export-driven economy. The combination of domestic political instability and international economic challenges has put the new chancellor in a precarious position.</p>

          <p>A comparison of monthly vehicle operating costs reveals that Tesla owners can save between $360 and $900 annually on fuel compared to drivers of a Nissan Altima. Based on driving 1,000 miles per month, the cost to charge a Tesla is estimated at $35 to $60, while fueling an Altima costs between $90 and $110. The most significant savings come from home charging, where costs can be three times cheaper per mile than gasoline, although this varies based on local electricity rates. Public charging networks like Tesla's Superchargers are more expensive but still offer a cost-effective alternative to traditional fuel for many drivers.</p>

Strong inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have attracted over $3.4 billion in July alone, point to growing corporate and institutional adoption. Furthermore, analysis of the derivatives market shows that while open interest in bitcoin futures is at a record high, funding rates remain subdued, indicating less reliance on risky leverage. This shift suggests the current rally may be more stable and durable than previous ones, as institutional flows are typically longer-term in nature. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Chair Requests Investigation into Headquarters Renovation Amid Political Criticism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has asked the central bank's inspector general to review the costs of the renovation of its historic Washington headquarters. This move follows escalating criticism from Trump administration officials, including a letter from the Office of Management and Budget director expressing concern over alleged cost overruns on the $2.5 billion project. While the Fed is independently funded and not subject to OMB oversight, the criticism is seen as part of a broader political pressure campaign against the central bank's leadership. The Fed has maintained that the project is complex and necessary for the nearly 100-year-old building.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that President Donald Trump's prominent role in the trophy presentation at the 2025 Club World Cup final was a shameless act of political grandstanding that hijacked the sporting event. The author contends that by placing himself and FIFA president Gianni Infantino front and center during the celebration, Trump overshadowed the victorious Chelsea team. This act is presented as a fittingly grim symbol for a misguided tournament, raising concerns about the increasing politicization of major sporting events. The article suggests that this moment, more than the on-field action, will define the tournament's legacy.</p>

          <p>A court in the Netherlands has ordered the confiscation of $112 million in illegal assets from Jos Leijdekkers, a notorious drug lord nicknamed "Chubby Jos." The court determined that Leijdekkers, who is one of Europe's most-wanted fugitives, amassed the fortune through extensive cocaine trafficking and illicit gold purchases. Leijdekkers was tried in absentia and was previously sentenced to 24 years in prison for organizing cocaine shipments and ordering a murder. Authorities believe he is currently hiding in Sierra Leone, where images have surfaced allegedly showing him with high-level political figures, sparking speculation about his connections.</p>

          <p>A senior Trump administration official has stated that President Trump has the authority to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell "if there's cause." This comment from National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett suggests the White House is actively exploring this possibility. The statement escalates the ongoing conflict between the administration and the central bank, with officials recently targeting a $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed's headquarters as a potential justification for removal. While the Fed is an independent agency, these remarks indicate the administration may be laying the groundwork to challenge Powell's leadership before his term expires.</p>

          <p>China's exports of rare earth elements surged by 60% in June compared to the previous year, reaching their highest level since 2009. This significant increase follows reports that Beijing has been relaxing its strict export controls on these critical minerals. Analysts suggest this may be an early sign of a thaw in trade tensions, possibly resulting from behind-the-scenes agreements with the United States. The move comes after China's Ministry of Commerce indicated it would improve the export approval process for Western countries, signaling a potential shift in its strategic materials policy.</p>

Simultaneously, China is seeking closer ties with Europe despite ideological differences and recent diplomatic friction. This dynamic forces the EU to balance its historic alliance with the U.S., which remains crucial for security, against its significant economic relationship with China, leading to a complex and challenging strategic tightrope walk.</p>

The quake, which was centered off the coast, was felt across hundreds of towns in the Andalusia and Levante regions. This seismic event occurred just a day after the country's northeast was hit by torrential rain and severe flash flooding, which turned streets into rivers and forced hospital evacuations.

The restriction is a response to prolonged dry weather and increased demand, which have strained water supplies. The ban prohibits activities like watering gardens, washing cars, or filling paddling pools with a hosepipe, with potential fines up to £1,000 for violations. This measure follows similar bans by other water companies in the UK, as the region deals with the effects of a dry spring and summer, a situation officials do not expect to improve soon.</p>

The 14th Amendment establishes that all persons born in the United States are citizens, and the president has no authority to unilaterally strip citizenship from a native-born American. The feud between Trump and O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland, spans nearly two decades and was reignited by her criticism of his administration's policies. While naturalized citizens can have their status revoked under specific circumstances like fraud, the power does not extend to native-born citizens.</p>

          <p>A new analysis indicates that recent Republican legislation, which eliminates support for renewable energy, will cause a significant surge in electricity costs across the U.S., with the largest impact felt in Republican-leaning states. By removing tax credits for cheaper solar and wind power, the bill is projected to increase household energy costs by an average of $170 annually by 2035. States like Missouri, Kentucky, and Texas are expected to see the most substantial bill increases. This outcome contrasts with President Trump's campaign promises to lower energy costs, as the policy favors fossil fuels over more affordable renewable alternatives. (not investment advice)</p>
