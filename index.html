          <p>China has sanctioned former Philippine Senate leader Francis Tolentino, a prominent ally of President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr, citing his "egregious conduct on China-related issues." The sanctions bar Tolentino from entering mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Beijing's foreign ministry stated the action was a response to malicious words and deeds by certain anti-China politicians in the Philippines that undermine Chinese interests and bilateral relations. This move underscores China's firm stance on defending its national sovereignty amid ongoing tensions in the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>A private survey indicates that China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers unexpectedly returned to growth in June. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) registered 50.4, surpassing expectations and rebounding from May's contraction. This result contrasts with the official PMI, which showed a third consecutive month of contraction, though the two surveys use different sample sizes and methodologies. The Caixin data suggests a potential recovery driven by export orders, as businesses may be front-loading shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has asserted that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney rescinded a proposed digital services tax on large U.S. technology firms after facing pressure from President Donald Trump. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed Carney "caved" and called Trump to announce the reversal, which followed threats of increased tariffs and a halt in trade talks. The 3% tax would have affected giants like Amazon, Google, and Meta, generating an estimated C$5.9 billion over five years for Canada. The move has allowed trade negotiations between the two countries to resume.</p>

          <p>A U.S. military commander has requested that some of the California National Guard forces deployed to Los Angeles by the Trump administration be reassigned to help combat wildfires. The proposal suggests moving 200 of the roughly 4,000 troops to prepare for what is expected to be an "early and active" fire season. The initial deployment to L.A. to address protests was controversial and legally challenged by Governor Gavin Newsom, who had warned it could impede the state's wildfire response capabilities. This potential shift highlights the competing demands for National Guard resources in California.</p>

Abrego Garcia's case has become a focal point in the debate over U.S. immigration policy.

          <p>The ancient Nepalese village of Samjung has been forced to completely relocate due to the devastating effects of climate change. Situated over 13,000 feet above sea level, the community's traditional way of life collapsed as declining snowfall caused its springs and canals to dry up. High-altitude regions like the Himalayas are warming faster than other areas, leading to retreating glaciers and erratic weather patterns. After a decade-long process, the villagers have rebuilt their community on new land with better water access, illustrating the profound and irreversible impact of climate change on vulnerable populations.</p>

Critics are concerned that tightening eligibility criteria for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) from late 2026 will harm vulnerable people.

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Identify Compound Produced During Exercise That May Slow Aging</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, may help slow the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine acts as a key messenger that prevents inflammation and aging in multiple organs. It achieves this by targeting and inhibiting a specific enzyme. These findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the health benefits of exercise and could inform future anti-aging strategies that simulate its effects.</p>

He suggests these investors are less interested in traditional metrics like stock buybacks and are instead rewarding companies like Robinhood, Reddit, and Palantir for their innovative approaches. This has created what Cramer calls an "idea market" or a "story-dominated market," where the potential for future growth and disruption is valued highly. He argues this focus on individual company narratives is overshadowing broader macroeconomic concerns like Federal Reserve policy. (not investment advice)</p>

With no childhood vaccine meeting the 95% WHO target since 2022, preventable diseases like measles are re-emerging.

Kennedy, who has a history of promoting unfounded health conspiracies, has also dismantled parts of the CDC and questioned vaccine safety protocols.
