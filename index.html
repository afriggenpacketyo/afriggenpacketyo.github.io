          <p>House Republicans are struggling to pass President Trump's signature domestic policy legislation due to significant internal dissent from both conservative and moderate members. A crucial procedural vote to begin debate on the bill was held open for hours as leadership, including Speaker Mike Johnson, attempted to persuade holdouts. The bill, which includes major tax cuts and spending increases for border security and defense, passed the Senate narrowly but faces opposition in the House over changes made in the upper chamber. The ongoing impasse highlights the challenges of governing with a slim majority and the ideological fractures within the Republican party.</p>

          <p>In a meeting with the European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated that Europe's current challenges do not originate from China. Wang emphasized that despite differences in history and culture, the two powers should not view each other as adversaries or seek confrontation over disagreements. He contrasted China's diplomatic approach, which he described as advocating for peace and tolerance, with that of the United States. The comments reflect China's ongoing effort to stabilize its relationship with the EU amid growing geopolitical tensions and calls within Europe for a tougher stance on Beijing.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion and subsequent fire occurred at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Yolo County, Northern California, leaving seven people unaccounted for. The blast, which happened Tuesday evening, triggered mandatory evacuations for a one-mile radius and started multiple grass fires that burned approximately 80 acres. Two individuals were treated for injuries, but authorities have not yet confirmed the status of the missing people, whose loved ones gathered nearby awaiting information. The company has an active license for fireworks importation and public displays, and the incident is now under investigation by Cal Fire.</p>

          <p>A large forest fire on the Greek island of Crete has prompted authorities to evacuate four settlements, including the popular tourist resort of Achlia. Firefighters battled the blaze through the night as strong winds fanned the flames across hillside forests on the island's south coast. Over 1,500 people were reportedly moved to temporary shelters, and some individuals received treatment for breathing difficulties, though no serious injuries were immediately reported. The incident highlights the persistent threat of wildfires in Greece during its hot, dry summers, a problem exacerbated by recent extreme heat waves across Europe.</p>

The choice of Iowa, a state that has consistently supported Trump, is described as symbolic of bringing the country together from its heartland.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has admitted that he "did not get that process right" regarding his government's proposed welfare reforms, which led to a series of U-turns after a significant backlash from his own Labour MPs. The government narrowly avoided a parliamentary defeat on its bill to overhaul disability benefits by making last-minute concessions to more than 120 MPs who threatened to rebel. Starmer acknowledged a failure to properly engage with his party on the sensitive issue but insisted that the need for welfare system reform remains. The episode has raised questions about his authority and undermined key aspects of his flagship policy.</p>

          <p>Senior United Nations officials have issued a stark warning that criminal gangs now exercise "near-total control" over Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, and are expanding their influence into previously peaceful regions. An estimated 90% of the capital is under gang control, leading to the collapse of state authority and the creation of parallel governance structures. The violence has paralyzed commerce, caused prices of essential goods to soar, and fueled a surge in vigilante justice and sexual violence. The U.N. warned that without greater international action, a total collapse of the state's presence in the capital could become a reality.</p>

The author highlights that Kershaw has pitched significantly more innings and recorded over 600 more strikeouts than Koufax. While acknowledging Kershaw's postseason struggles, the article frames his career as an enduring flame of greatness that has defined the modern era of Dodgers baseball.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian reflects on the dynamic and evolving nature of the Spanish language, spoken by nearly 600 million people worldwide. The author notes that unlike the purism sometimes seen among English speakers, the Spanish-speaking world generally embraces the linguistic variations and richness that emerge from its global use, particularly in Latin America and the United States. While discrimination based on accent still exists, there is a growing appreciation for the diverse forms of Spanish, fueled by migration and cultural exchange. The article argues that this collective, cross-continental evolution is what keeps a language alive and thriving in a connected world.</p>

The achievement was celebrated with a video tribute at Dodger Stadium, honoring a career defined by consistency and dominance. The game itself ended in dramatic fashion, with the Dodgers staging a ninth-inning rally to win 5-4, securing a victory on a night dedicated to their legendary pitcher's accomplishment.</p>

This diplomatic pivot comes after Armenia's dissatisfaction with Russia's role during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and its subsequent conflict with Azerbaijan.

          <p>A federal jury in New York acquitted music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs of the most serious charges against him, including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. However, he was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, which carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison each. The verdict followed a high-profile, seven-week trial that included graphic testimony from former girlfriends about a culture of abuse and coercion. Combs, who had been in custody since his arrest, will remain detained pending a sentencing hearing scheduled for October. The mixed verdict concludes a landmark case with significant cultural implications.</p>

          <p>Recent close votes in the U.S. House of Representatives, particularly concerning a major Trump-backed bill, have highlighted the chamber's specific rules for handling a tie. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, a tie vote in the House of Representatives means the motion or bill automatically fails. According to House rules, if a question receives an equal number of 'yea' and 'nay' votes, it "shall be lost." This procedure underscores the high stakes of governing with a razor-thin majority, where just a few defections can derail legislation without any mechanism for a tie-breaker.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) has seen a dramatic rebound, positioning it to potentially become the world's top listing destination this year. The surge is primarily fueled by mainland Chinese companies seeking to raise capital, driven by regulatory support from Beijing, a slower pace of listings on mainland exchanges, and concerns over potential delistings in the U.S. Major deals, such as the secondary listing of battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology, have raised billions, signaling renewed confidence in the city's financial markets after several lackluster years.
