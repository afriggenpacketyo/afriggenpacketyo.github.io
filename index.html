          <h2>Rubio Defends US Response to Myanmar Earthquake Amid Criticism</h2>

          <p>Senator Marco Rubio has rejected criticism regarding the US response to the Myanmar earthquake, asserting that the US must balance global humanitarian efforts with its own national interests. He stated that other wealthy nations should also contribute to the relief efforts. Rubio also dismissed claims that cuts to USAID, led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, hindered the US's ability to deploy a large rescue team, blaming the military regime in Myanmar for access limitations. He emphasized that the US is prepared to help but will no longer fund global NGOs extensively.&#x3c;br&#x3e;&#x3c;i&#x3e(not investment advice)&#x3c;/i&#x3e</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The final practice session of the Japanese Grand Prix was interrupted twice due to trackside grass fires, with Lando Norris ultimately setting the fastest time. Despite mitigation efforts implemented after similar incidents on Friday, the fires continued to be a concern. The FIA is focusing on further dampening the grass before qualifying. The fires are believed to be caused by sparks from the cars igniting the dry grass, a particular issue as Japan's wet season is in the summer.</p>
