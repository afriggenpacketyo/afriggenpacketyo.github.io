          <p>Opendoor's new board chair, Keith Rabois, asserts the company is "bloated" and needs to cut 85% of its 1,400-person workforce, attributing cultural issues to remote work and a "DEI path." This announcement follows the appointment of a new CEO, Kaz Nejatian, and Rabois's return to the board amidst investor pressure and the previous CEO's resignation. Despite recent stock surges, the online real estate platform continues to face challenges as a cash-burning, low-margin business with limited near-term growth prospects. Rabois believes these drastic measures are essential to resolve the company's financial struggles and return to its foundational principles of innovation and in-person collaboration.</p>

          <p>As the inflation rate recently rose, American borrowers face an expensive economic climate with high credit card interest rates and over $1 trillion in cumulative debt. This article advises that anticipated small Federal Reserve rate cuts may not offer significant relief for high-rate credit card debt, making waiting an expensive strategy. It encourages exploring various debt relief options, including credit card debt forgiveness (debt settlement), which can reduce balances by 30-50% over time. Borrowers are urged to carefully weigh the pros and cons of solutions like credit counseling, debt management programs, and debt consolidation loans to regain financial independence.

          <p>Labour MP Clive Lewis has publicly stated that Sir Keir Starmer "doesn't seem up to the job" as prime minister, following the controversial appointment and subsequent sacking of Peter Mandelson. Mandelson, initially appointed as ambassador to the US, was dismissed due to previously known links with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, with No 10 claiming new information emerged. The incident has caused significant anger and frustration among Labour MPs, with some privately and publicly criticizing the party leadership and the prime minister's chief of staff. This internal strife suggests a "dangerous atmosphere" within the party, raising concerns about its stability and direction.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, who rose from a teenage activist to a pivotal figure in the MAGA movement, was a close ally and friend to former President Donald Trump.

His political views, initially more conventional, shifted rightward over time, embracing Christian nationalism and promoting controversial claims. Kirk's significant influence was recognized by Trump, who credited TPUSA's "ground game" for his 2024 election victory, cementing Kirk's role as a powerful voice in conservative politics.</p>

          <p>This article reviews two new literary works, Michael Clune's novel "Pan" and Lee Lai's graphic novel "Cannon," which vividly portray the debilitating experience of panic attacks. Clune's work describes consciousness vibrating the body, while Lai's uses menacing magpies to symbolize anxiety. "Cannon" follows Lucy, a line cook managing anxiety through exercise and self-help, whose bottled-up fears eventually erupt into a cathartic, destructive rage. Both pieces aim to communicate the internal struggle of panic and the journey towards learning to live with it, offering readers a raw yet ultimately gleeful and insightful perspective on anxiety.</p>

          <p>Luxury furniture retailer RH's shares declined after the company reported lower-than-expected second-quarter revenue and reduced its full-year outlook. RH attributed a significant $30 million hit to tariffs, despite maintaining its forecast earlier in the year. The company also delayed its Fall Interiors Sourcebook to finalize pricing amidst potential new tariffs on imported furniture, which President Trump has threatened to impose to "bring the furniture business back" to the U.S. RH's CEO Gary Friedman expressed concerns about the feasibility of large-scale domestic high-quality furniture manufacturing, as the company continues to shift operations away from China and India.

          <p>The UK House of Lords is engaged in a two-day debate on the Assisted Dying Bill, marked by emotional testimonies from peers sharing personal experiences of loved ones' suffering. Lord Charlie Falconer, the Bill's sponsor, highlighted the "terrible suffering" caused by current laws, advocating for compassion and safeguards, while urging respect for the Commons' prior approval. However, former Prime Minister Theresa May opposed the Bill, citing concerns about insufficient safeguards against pressure and the potential for normalizing suicide, particularly for vulnerable groups. The debate underscores profound divisions on the ethical and societal implications of allowing individuals to choose the timing and manner of their death.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Altay Bayindir will remain Manchester United's starting goalkeeper for the upcoming derby against Manchester City, despite recent mistakes. This decision comes as new arrival Senne Lammens, signed for £18.1m, is seen as a future first-choice, and Andre Onana has been loaned out due to inconsistent performance and high pressure. Head coach Ruben Amorim emphasized Bayindir's greater experience over Lammens, highlighting the need for a strong and experienced goalkeeper in the current climate. Onana's struggles and subsequent loan spell underscore the immense pressure at the club, making Bayindir's retention a relatively straightforward decision for the manager.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has issued a strong condemnation of Robert F.

The article highlights Kennedy's assertions that sanitation and nutrition, not vaccines, vanquished infectious diseases, and his widely debunked claims about vaccine safety and efficacy.

          <p>The Flanders Festival Ghent canceled a concert by the Munich Philharmonic due to its Israeli conductor, Lahav Shani, not sufficiently distancing himself from Israel's government actions, sparking widespread outrage, particularly in Germany. Critics, including German politicians and antisemitism experts, condemned the move as "pure antisemitism" and a "dangerous precedent." Other European theaters are proceeding with Shani's concerts, rejecting boycotts based on nationality. Shani, a prominent classical musician, has previously called for peace, and the debate draws comparisons to Valery Gergiev's dismissal but is rejected by many, highlighting the complex entanglement of culture, politics, and freedom of expression.</p>

The 58-year-old zookeeper, Jian Rangkarassamee, died after stepping out of his vehicle. An inspection revealed damaged fences and inadequate safety measures, with the zoo's permit awaiting renewal. Conservationists, including WFFT and PETA, are calling for stricter controls on dangerous animal ownership, citing Safari World's controversial history of staged animal shows.

Unlike older liquid-fuel rockets that require lengthy fueling and cannot be stored fueled for extended periods, the DF-5C incorporates upgraded fuel storage technology. Military experts suggest that features like membrane-protected rocket nozzles indicate a leap forward, enabling the missile to remain in silos in a state of high readiness. This development enhances the DF-5C's strategic capabilities, ensuring it can reach targets globally with greater efficiency and responsiveness, marking a notable evolution in China's nuclear arsenal.</p>
