          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News, seeking damages of at least $787 million. The suit alleges that the network, particularly anchor Jesse Watters, falsely claimed Newsom lied about a phone conversation with former President Donald Trump. The complaint accuses Fox News of intentionally distorting facts to support Trump and damage the governor's reputation, drawing a parallel to the network's recent settlement with Dominion Voting Systems. Newsom's legal team has offered to drop the lawsuit in exchange for a public retraction and an on-air apology from the network.</p>

          <p>Molly Schafer, a quiet 18-year-old high school senior from Waunakee, Wisconsin, found a unique way to overcome her social anxiety and reconnect with her peers. Feeling isolated, she spent approximately 600 hours painting detailed portraits of 44 of her classmates, whom she had known since elementary school. She then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with astonishment and appreciation. The project not only helped Schafer feel seen again but also prompted her classmates to reflect on their own missed opportunities for connection during their school years.</p>

          <p>During the first round of the LIV Dallas golf tournament, professional golfer Brooks Koepka displayed a moment of intense frustration after a poor drive on the ninth hole. Visibly upset with his shot, the five-time major champion slammed his driver on the ground before swinging it at and destroying a tee marker. Koepka was struggling in the round, sitting at six over par through eight holes before he ultimately withdrew from the day's play, citing an illness.

          <p>A contemporary furniture store in Merriam, Kansas, is being forced to liquidate its inventory and close its doors, with the owner citing the financial strain of U.S. trade tariffs. Henrik Svendsen, the owner of My Home Contemporary Furniture, stated that the tariffs, particularly on goods imported from China, have made his products unaffordable for customers. Svendsen, who imports about half of his inventory from China, has paid approximately $162,000 in tariffs, a cost he cannot absorb due to slim profit margins. The closure will also result in the layoffs of his 10 employees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a permanent injunction against a Trump administration executive order that targeted the law firm Susman Godfrey, marking the fourth such judicial rebuke. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan declared the order unconstitutional, aligning with previous decisions that found similar orders against other major law firms to be violations of First and Fifth Amendment rights. These executive orders sought to punish firms for representing clients or causes opposed by the president. This latest decision reinforces a series of legal victories for firms challenging what judges have described as an unprecedented attack on the legal system.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government executed a significant policy U-turn, reversing planned cuts to disability benefits after facing a major rebellion from within its own party. The initial plan aimed to save Â£5 billion annually by tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payments (Pip), a move intended to help meet self-imposed borrowing rules. However, critics argued the cuts were a short-term fix that unfairly targeted vulnerable individuals instead of representing a coherent long-term welfare reform strategy. This reversal has now raised broader questions about the government's fiscal credibility and its ability to implement its long-term economic and social renewal agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of President Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship, its decision allows the administration to begin implementation planning. The ruling means the order could take effect in the 28 states not involved in the lawsuit, creating a potential patchwork of citizenship rights across the country.

          <p>Rick Taylor, a veteran Los Angeles political consultant, reported that he was detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents upon returning from an international trip. Taylor stated that after confirming he was from Los Angeles, an agent placed an orange tag on his passport, and he was escorted to a holding room for nearly an hour. He was separated from his family and held in a room predominantly with Latino travelers, leaving him confused and intimidated. Taylor expressed concern over the lack of explanation for his detention, highlighting the potential for such experiences to happen to anyone.</p>

This effort comes as NATO members increase defense spending to counter perceived threats from Moscow. The conference served as a platform for Russia to emphasize that it still maintains numerous economic partners and is not isolated on the world stage. (not investment advice)</p>

The show's opening featured models with shaved heads in all-white outfits, their hands tied, kneeling in a formation reminiscent of images from high-security prisons. Presented in partnership with the ACLU, the runway performance aimed to address the "dehumanization" of immigrants. The show received widespread attention online, with many praising it as a revolutionary use of fashion to highlight social injustice, while some criticized it as being in poor taste.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Guardian argues that the Supreme Court's recent decision in the birthright citizenship case has dramatically expanded the power of the presidency. By curtailing the ability of lower federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions, the ruling effectively allows the executive branch to implement potentially unconstitutional policies while legal challenges proceed. The author contends this creates a chaotic "patchwork of rights," where constitutional protections may vary by jurisdiction. Justice Sonia Sotomayor's dissent is highlighted, warning that "no right is safe" under this new legal framework, which poses a significant threat to the rule of law.</p>

By removing this judicial check, the decision liberates the executive branch to implement policies more freely while legal challenges are ongoing.

          <p>California's legislature has approved a $321 billion budget designed to close a $12 billion deficit, a plan that involves scaling back several progressive initiatives. Key changes include pausing new enrollments in a state-funded healthcare program for undocumented adults and introducing future premiums for some recipients. The budget largely avoids new taxes, relying instead on state savings, internal borrowing, and delayed payments. While lawmakers protected some safety net programs from deeper cuts, the spending plan reflects the fiscal challenges facing the state, which could be exacerbated by federal policy changes.

          <p>The S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq composite indexes both closed at all-time record highs on Friday, continuing a strong rally from recent weeks. Investors appeared to shrug off concerns related to new trade tariffs and geopolitical conflict in the Middle East. The S&P 500 has surged over 20% since a low point in April that followed President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcements. Analysts suggest that cautious optimism has returned to the market, fueled by a partial rollback of some tariffs and data indicating continued, steady economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The leader of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S. and Israeli-backed aid group, has defended his organization's work despite numerous reports of Palestinian civilians being killed and injured near its distribution sites. GHF head Johnnie Moore claimed that reports attributing all casualties to proximity to GHF sites or the Israeli military are "not true" and are part of a disinformation campaign. The UN has condemned the GHF's system as "inherently unsafe," as it channels desperate civilians into militarized zones. The Hamas-run health ministry reports over 500 Palestinians have been killed seeking aid.</p>

          <p>English football clubs Manchester City and Chelsea are already earning substantial sums from their participation in the FIFA Club World Cup, with the potential for total earnings to approach Â£92 million. The tournament offers a significant participation fee, which varies for European teams, plus additional prize money for wins, draws, and advancing through each round. Manchester City has earned the most so far, with their winnings already covering the transfer fees for several new players. The large prize pot has raised concerns about its potential to distort domestic competitions. (not investment advice)</p>
