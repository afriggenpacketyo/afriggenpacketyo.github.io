          <p>Donald Trump's second presidency has seen him assert executive authority aggressively, leading to questions about the constitutionality of his actions. Times Opinion reached out to 35 legal scholars, including liberals, conservatives, and libertarians, to assess the legality and impact of Trump's actions in his first 100 days. The scholars identified actions that might draw legal challenges but are within the powers of the president. Trump's actions include his administration’s revocation of visas, the detention of foreign students, and the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia.</p>

          <p>Ryan Coogler's new Black horror film, “Sinners,” is a critical and commercial success, prompting discussions about its symbolism and political subtext. Set in the Jim Crow South, the film explores moral dichotomies through characters like the Smokestack twins and their cousin Sammie, who attracts white vampires with his blues music. The guitar, a gift to Sammie representing Black music history, becomes a weapon against the vampires, highlighting the film's themes of good versus evil.

          <p>President Donald Trump's approval ratings are underwater 100 days into his second term, with concerns over the economy and inflation contributing to the decline. The latest Fox News poll shows Trump at 44% approval and 55% disapproval, reflecting a slide from the start of his term. Increasing concerns over the economy and inflation, along with Trump's recent tariff announcement, have negatively impacted his poll numbers.

          <p>An HR executive at Accenture, Angela Beatty, identifies a pattern of short employment stints (one year or less) as a resume red flag. While career paths are diverse, a series of short roles raises concerns about a candidate's ability to collaborate and make an impact.

          <p>A Brazil-led study has found a link between high consumption of ultraprocessed foods and increased rates of premature death across eight countries.

          <p>Settling a debt, while providing financial relief, may not immediately improve your credit score and could initially cause it to dip. Settled accounts are typically marked as "settled" on credit reports, signaling to lenders that the full balance wasn't repaid. However, settling a seriously delinquent account can be a step towards rebuilding credit over time, freeing up resources to maintain other obligations.

          <p>A Microsoft report reveals that 17% of employees use AI more than human colleagues to avoid judgment, highlighting a shift in workplace dynamics. While AI offers 24/7 availability and a stream of ideas, some workers are using it for emotional reasons, seeking refuge from potential criticism. Happiness expert Jessica Weiss notes that AI can become a stand-in for human connection, but often not for the better, underscoring the importance of fostering genuine workplace relationships.</p>

          <p>Florida Democrats believe recent strong performances in two congressional races signal a potential shift towards regaining swing-state status, despite Republican dominance in recent elections. Democratic candidates in special elections significantly narrowed Republican margins in traditionally conservative districts, sparking optimism. The candidates focused on local issues and winning over Republican voters, emphasizing how Trump policies would negatively impact them. Party leaders hope to replicate this strategy in future campaigns, targeting young voters, Hispanics, African Americans, and independents.</p>

Manchester City's frequent trips to Wembley appear to have taken a toll on attendance, with lower numbers compared to previous semi-final appearances. Ticket sales breakdowns reveal that Manchester City had significantly fewer tickets sold than other teams, such as Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace. One scenario would be to give the tickets away, but there is a balance to be struck between keeping them on sale until the last minute for fans to purchase them, against the idea of distributing them among people in the local area for free.</p>
