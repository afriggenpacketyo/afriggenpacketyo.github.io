          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has stated that Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a special legislative session could be investigated for felony bribery. The governor alleges that payments made to support the lawmakers' travel and lodging could constitute a bribe for breaking quorum. This development comes as a judge issued a restraining order against Beto O'Rourke's group, preventing further funding for the Democrats, intensifying the political and legal conflict over the state's redistricting efforts.</p>

          <p>Despite criticism from former President Trump, Goldman Sachs is not alone in its prediction that increased tariffs will lead to higher consumer inflation. Economists from other major firms like JPMorgan Chase and UBS also anticipate a steady rise in prices as companies pass on the higher costs of duties to consumers. While this inflation is not expected to be runaway, it could push the Federal Reserve's preferred core measure into the low- to mid-3% range and potentially dampen consumer spending and GDP growth.

The Mendenhall River crested at 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record and prompting evacuations in low-lying areas. This annual event, driven by climate change, has intensified in recent years, destroying homes and threatening infrastructure, despite the installation of temporary protective barriers along the riverbank.</p>

          <p>A recent Siena poll indicates that progressive Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani has widened his lead in the New York City mayoral race. The poll shows Mamdani with a 19-point lead over his nearest rival, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, with incumbent Mayor Eric Adams trailing significantly. As the frontrunner, Mamdani is facing increased scrutiny from opponents over his residency in a rent-stabilized apartment while campaigning on housing affordability and higher taxes for the wealthy.</p>

          <p>The legal dispute between Priscilla Presley and her former business partner, Brigitte Kruse, has intensified with a new $50 million lawsuit filed against Presley in Los Angeles. Kruse alleges fraud and breach of contract, claiming Presley undermined their joint ventures and exploited her daughter Lisa Marie's death to gain control of her trust. The lawsuit presents a counter-narrative to Presley's own suit against Kruse, painting a picture of betrayal after Kruse invested millions to revitalize Presley's brand.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United is dealing with internal disruption as star striker Alexander Isak remains determined to leave the club for Liverpool, despite the club rejecting a £110 million bid. Isak has been training away from the first team, creating an unsettling situation ahead of the new Premier League season. While the club is contractually entitled to hold him to his contract, the commercial reality of paying a high-value player who is not participating creates a high-stakes standoff.</p>

          <p>A Certificate of Deposit (CD) remains an attractive option for savers due to its fixed, competitive interest rates and FDIC insurance. For a $75,000 deposit, the potential earnings are substantial; for example, a one-year CD at a 4.40% APY could generate $3,300 in interest. Longer-term CDs offer even greater returns, with a five-year CD at 4.15% APY potentially earning over $16,900, making it a powerful tool for those who can lock their money away.

          <p>Walmart announced it is expanding its 10% employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, including milk and meat, for its 1.6 million U.S. workers. The move comes as rising tariffs fuel concerns about higher consumer prices, which Walmart's CFO has acknowledged the company cannot fully absorb. The expanded benefit is one of the most requested by employees and could also serve to boost Walmart's own sales and help with worker retention in a competitive market.</p>

          <p>Researchers predict that global reindeer populations, also known as caribou in North America, could decline substantially by the end of the century due to climate change. A new study using ancient DNA and computer models found that the North American population is at the highest risk, potentially facing a decline of up to 80%. This loss would have significant cascading ecological effects, including reduced plant diversity and a diminished capacity for Arctic soils to store carbon.</p>
