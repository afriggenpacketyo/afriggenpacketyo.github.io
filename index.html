        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from potentially closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial global oil trade route. This appeal follows warnings from Iran's foreign minister about defending its sovereignty after the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites. Iranian state media reported that the parliament supports closing the strait, though the final decision rests with Iran's national security council. Blocking the Strait of Hormuz could severely disrupt the global economy, as it facilitates approximately 20% of the world's daily crude oil consumption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NHS Lothian in Scotland is considering establishing a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This initiative follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire offering ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression, which costs Â£6,000 for a four-infusion program with psychotherapy. Ketamine, an anesthetic, is used 'off-label' for depression, and some patients find it makes them more receptive to psychotherapy, although it is also linked to health problems and fatalities. Psychiatrists emphasize the need for diagnosed conditions and assessments before treatment, hoping to make it more accessible through the NHS.</p>

Muncy's grand slam in the sixth inning shifted the game's momentum, and he later added a three-run home run, continuing his mid-season turnaround.

          <p>A 60 Minutes report details how research on Cayo Santiago, also known as Monkey Island, survived Hurricane Maria. The island is home to approximately 1,800 rhesus macaque monkeys, studied for their genetic similarity to humans. Despite initial fears of complete destruction, most monkeys survived, possibly by huddling together and consuming seaweed. Crucially, data and biological samples were preserved due to the relocation of offices and the dedication of staff who maintained generators to keep freezers running, ensuring the continuation of long-term research dating back to the 1930s.</p>

The report also highlights the work of the Toucan Rescue Ranch, which rehabilitates sloths injured by power lines, and zoologist Becky Cliffe's population study, which reveals the impact of climate change on sloth health.

          <p>A magistrate judge in Tennessee has rejected the government's request to detain Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant who was mistakenly deported and subsequently returned to the U.S. The court stated it would ensure Abrego Garcia receives due process. A hearing is scheduled to review the conditions of his release. Abrego Garcia is facing criminal charges related to allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the U.S., and the case is ongoing.</p>

          <p>As military actions intensify in Iran, concerns are growing about the fate of Isfahan's architectural treasures, a city renowned for its 17th-century Persian landmarks. The region, near one of the targeted nuclear sites, boasts intricately tiled mosques, bridges, and the UNESCO-listed Naqsh-e Jahan Square. Despite no reported damage in central Isfahan, the city's cultural heritage is at risk, with potential impacts on sites dating back to the Safavid dynasty. The U.S. military targeted Iranian sites in Fordo and Natanz with "bunker-buster" bombs and Isfahan with missiles from a submarine.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear facilities was based on his belief that Iran is close to developing nuclear weapons, despite intelligence agencies' assessment that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003. CIA Director John Ratcliffe presented a more nuanced view, suggesting Iran is clearly trying to build a nuclear weapon based on its uranium stockpiles. Israel's actions and warnings also influenced Trump's decision. Critics argue Trump has ignored his intelligence advisors, while officials maintain the strikes were necessary to neutralize the threat of Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Florida Republican congresswoman Kat Cammack attributes the delay in her treatment for an ectopic pregnancy to the fearmongering by pro-abortion groups regarding Florida's abortion law. Cammack, who opposes abortion, sought treatment for a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy, but medical staff hesitated due to concerns about the state's six-week abortion ban. She blames pro-abortion messaging for creating fear of criminal charges, while abortion rights activists argue the restrictive laws themselves caused the issue.

          <p>A Pentagon briefing outlined the mission to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, involving a 37-hour round-trip flight, multiple mid-air refuelings, and deception tactics. Seven B-2 stealth bombers dropped "bunker buster" bombs on Fordo, while cruise missiles targeted a nuclear site near Isfahan. The US claims the operation "obliterated" Iran's nuclear regime, but the true extent of the damage is still unclear. Iran has confirmed the attacks but minimized the damage. The mission began just after midnight when Secretary Hegseth joined US President Donald Trump, Vice-President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and elite Pentagon staff in the Situation Room at the White House to watch as a fleet of aircraft departed an American airbase in rural Missouri.</p>
