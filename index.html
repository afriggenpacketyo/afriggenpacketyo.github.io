          <h2>Federal Judge Examines Legality of National Guard Deployment in Los Angeles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 06:02:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge is questioning whether the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts military involvement in civilian law enforcement. This inquiry arises from California's challenge to the deployment in response to anti-ICE protests. The judge has requested briefings from both sides to determine if the federal department overstepped its authority, particularly since the appellate court allowed the president to maintain control of the troops. The core dispute revolves around whether the protests constitute a "rebellion" justifying federal intervention, with the judge noting the protests fall short of this threshold, while the administration argues courts shouldn't second-guess presidential decisions. The legal battle continues, with California seeking to regain control of the troops as tensions have eased. </p>

          <p>China's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, is reportedly developing the capability to carry out "deck load strikes," a type of swarm attack designed to overwhelm the enemy. This ability would enable the Chinese navy to rapidly launch a large number of aircraft simultaneously, potentially gaining a first-mover advantage in combat. The Fujian is expected to be commissioned by the end of the year, joining the Liaoning and Shandong to form a three-carrier fleet for the Chinese navy. This development marks a significant advancement in China's aircraft carrier technology, as it enters a critical phase of combat capability development. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the conflict between Israel and Iran intensifies, the crucial factor determining its duration hinges on the balance between Iran's missile arsenal and Israel's interception capabilities. Iran has launched hundreds of missiles and drones, prompting Israel to utilize its interceptors at an unsustainable rate. Experts worry about Israel depleting its interceptor supply, forcing it to prioritize defending key military targets over civilian infrastructure, which aligns with Iran's strategy to pressure Israel into abandoning its nuclear ambitions. Israel claims to have crippled Iran's air defense and is targeting missile launchers, while the U.S. may consider direct military intervention. Civilians on both sides continue to suffer heavy casualties as the conflict escalates. </p>

          <p>Investigators are exploring potential motives behind the killing of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband, as well as the shooting of another legislator and his wife, with a focus on the suspect's religious views on abortion. While initial discourse centered on the suspect's political leanings, some scholars suggest examining his connection to the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), an Evangelical Christian movement that often uses war-like rhetoric against those supporting abortion rights. The suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, allegedly sent a text message to his family invoking "war" after the rampage. This language aligns with the NAR's emphasis on dominion and taking control over society based on Old Testament Biblical law, raising concerns about the potential for religiously motivated violence against perceived enemies. </p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is planning to implement DNA testing for all newborn babies to evaluate their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative is part of a broader government strategy to predict and prevent illness, with Â£650 million invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030. The goal is to shift the NHS from a reactive healthcare system to one that proactively identifies and addresses potential health issues before symptoms manifest. While supporters tout the potential for personalized healthcare and reduced pressure on NHS services, concerns have been raised about the need for qualified professionals to interpret the vast amount of genetic data and provide appropriate counseling to patients. This program aims to revolutionize prevention through genomics and AI, providing faster diagnoses and early warnings for diseases.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing an intensifying heatwave, with temperatures reaching up to 34C and a yellow thunderstorm warning issued for parts of northern England, the Scottish Borders, and Wales. The Met Office warns of potential localized flash flooding, large hail, and frequent lightning due to the humid weather. An amber heat-health alert is also in effect, with concerns about increased pressure on health and social care services and a rise in deaths, particularly among vulnerable populations. Firefighters have responded to a surge in wildfires, and scientists attribute the increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves to climate change. </p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is appealing to the House of Lords to approve the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would grant terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. The bill was passed by the House of Commons but faces potential opposition in the Lords, with critics expressing concerns about the potential for coercion of vulnerable individuals. Dame Esther, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, emphasizes the need for scrutiny but not opposition, while some peers plan to introduce amendments to strengthen safeguards. The proposed legislation would allow mentally competent, terminally ill adults with less than six months to live to request an assisted death, subject to multiple assessments and approvals. </p>

          <p>The People's Liberation Army (PLA) maneuvers around Taiwan have become increasingly frequent and intense, evolving from occasional sorties to a coordinated campaign for combat training and strategic signaling. These operations fall into three categories: near-daily aerial patrols, combat-readiness patrols, and large-scale joint forces exercises, each varying in scale and purpose. Since 2021, PLA Air Force sorties around Taiwan have been conducted almost daily, with a significant increase in numbers since 2024, following the election of Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te.

          <p>Reporters for Voice of America (VOA) and other U.S.-funded networks are concerned about their safety and job security following mass layoffs and political retribution. The Trump administration has issued layoff notices for 85% of positions at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which owns VOA, leading to fears that the agency's role in providing objective news to closed societies will be eviscerated. A Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reporter was sentenced to nine years in jail in Azerbaijan on charges deemed false by the network. VOA journalists who are citizens of countries with repressive media environments fear returning home when their visas expire, as they may face imprisonment or other forms of persecution. </p>

Goldman Sachs estimates that demand for new homes in Chinese urban cities will remain suppressed, falling to under 5 million units per year, a fraction of the 20 million units seen in 2017. China's population has been declining for the past three years, with government data for 2024 showing a decrease of 1.39 million from the prior year due to falling birth rates.

          <p>Japan has been proactive in building supply chain resilience, particularly in rare earth minerals, long before China imposed export restrictions. In 2010, China's export ban on rare earths targeting Tokyo after a territorial dispute motivated Japan to change its approach to supply chain security. Japan invested heavily in non-China rare-earth projects, notably Australia's Lynas, which helped reduce its dependence on Chinese rare earths from over 90% to below 60%. Japan's efforts serve as a template for Western nations seeking to diversify their critical mineral sources, although escaping China's dominance remains a significant challenge. </p>

The debates often occur on online platforms, which could provide a space for serious discussion about popular culture, but instead are dictated by sexist algorithms rewarding extreme views. The author argues that vitriolic chastisement is no substitute for meaningful critique and that modern critiques often ignore the complex history of feminist thought. By reverting to paternalistic tellings off, the author suggests, contemporary feminism risks packing women into smaller boxes. </p>

          <p>Suga, the final member of the K-Pop group BTS to complete his mandatory military service in South Korea, has been discharged, fueling anticipation for the band's reunion. Suga began his service in 2023 and completed his duty as a social service agent. Unlike other members, his discharge was not publicly celebrated due to overcrowding concerns. BTS has been on a self-described "hiatus" since 2022 as its members fulfilled their mandatory service, and the group is expected to hold its largest-ever world tour in 2026. </p>

          <p>Chinese brands are increasingly making their mark in Europe through strategic advertising and sports sponsorships. Xiaomi, for example, is planning to open 500 new retail stores outside China this year, particularly in developed markets, with a goal of 10,000 stores overseas in the next five years. The company's decision to close its stores in France in 2022 was part of an adjustment in its retail strategy to better respond to French consumers' purchasing behavior. This expansion reflects a broader trend of Chinese brands enhancing their image and market presence in Europe. </p>

          <p>Towns and cities in eastern German states are offering free stays to attract new residents and combat depopulation. The "trial living" scheme provides people with the opportunity to live in these cities for up to four weeks free of charge. Guben, a city on Germany's eastern border with Poland, has seen some success with this initiative, with several participants moving there long-term. The scheme aims to address the demographic challenges facing many industrial towns in the former East, including declining birth rates and emigration of young people. </p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and Palestinian activist, has been released after 104 days in immigration detention in the U.S. A judge ruled that Khalil, a legal U.S. resident, should be released, but the Trump administration is seeking to deport him over his role in pro-Palestinian protests. Civil rights groups argue that the administration is conflating anti-Semitism with criticism of Israel to silence dissent. The judge allowed deportation proceedings to continue based on allegations that Khalil lied on his green card application, which he disputes. </p>

This warning follows similar statements by senior figures, including President Xi Jinping, who has called for promoting the "Sinicisation of religion." The slew of warnings comes ahead of the Dalai Lamaâ€™s 90th birthday, reflecting concerns about foreign influence in religious affairs. These directives underscore the government's efforts to maintain control over religious organizations and prevent perceived external threats. </p>
