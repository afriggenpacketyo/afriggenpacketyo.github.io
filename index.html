          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 12:38:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A gunman who killed four people in a Midtown Manhattan office building was targeting the NFL's headquarters, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Investigators found a note on the shooter, Shane Tamura, indicating he believed he suffered from the brain disease CTE and blamed the league for his condition. Tamura, who had a history of mental health issues, took the wrong elevator and opened fire in the offices of Rudin Management, killing four people, including an NYPD officer, before taking his own life. The incident has prompted the NFL to advise New York employees to work from home and offer grief counseling.</p>

          <p>Luxury group Kering announced disappointing second-quarter financial results, with sales falling 15% year-on-year, missing analyst expectations. The downturn was largely driven by its main brand, Gucci, where sales plunged by 25%, reflecting persistent challenges in key markets like China and the United States. Chairman François-Henri Pinault acknowledged the poor performance but expressed confidence in the company's long-term turnaround strategy. The results highlight ongoing difficulties for the luxury sector amid geopolitical uncertainty and concerns about consumer spending, placing significant pressure on Kering's incoming CEO.

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Turnberry is Unlikely to Host The Open, But May Secure Other Major Tournaments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 12:30:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite its owner's ambitions, the Turnberry golf course is considered unfit to host the Open Championship due to a lack of surrounding infrastructure, according to this analysis. However, the article suggests that Donald Trump's resort could realistically host the Scottish Open, a significant European Tour event, providing a mutually beneficial arrangement. The European Tour Group has already scheduled other tournaments at Trump's Aberdeen course, indicating a willingness to partner with his properties. This quiet expansion of Trump's golf footprint in Scotland continues as his Irish course, Doonbeg, is also being considered for the Irish Open.</p>

          <p>Comedian and actor Marc Maron has announced he will end his influential podcast 'WTF' this fall after a 16-year run. Maron explained the decision stemmed from concerns about burnout and maintaining the quality of the show, preferring to conclude with a strong body of work. In an interview, he reflected on the profound personal impact of the podcast's deep conversations and the challenge of finding similar connections in his personal life. Maron also discussed his new HBO special, 'Panicked,' and the ongoing process of grieving the loss of his partner, Lynn Shelton, in 2020.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Since taking office for his second term, President Trump's job approval rating among Americans aged 18-29 has plummeted from 55% to 28%, a significantly steeper drop than in any other age group. This analysis suggests that many young voters, particularly independents and non-voters, who initially gave him the benefit of the doubt have soured on his performance. The decline is linked to perceptions that he has not fulfilled campaign promises and growing dissatisfaction with his economic policies. A majority of young people now feel his policies are making them worse off financially and focusing too much on issues like tariffs and deportations.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services is withholding $108 million in federal funding from Duke Health, the medical arm of Duke University, citing alleged violations of President Trump's executive order against DEI practices. In a letter, administration officials claimed that racial preferences in hiring, admissions, and patient care at Duke Health are illegal and endanger lives by rejecting merit. The funding freeze is a result of an investigation into whether the institution's practices violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. To restore funding, Duke Health must review and rectify all policies involving the alleged illegal use of race.</p>

          <p>A German court has convicted three men for the 2022 theft of 483 ancient Celtic gold coins from a museum in Manching, Bavaria. The defendants received prison sentences of up to 11 years for the heist, which was executed in just nine minutes after the thieves disabled local communication networks. The stolen treasure, dating to around 100 B.C., was considered the largest trove of Celtic gold discovered in the 20th century. Most of the coins remain missing, and authorities fear they have been melted down, as lumps of gold were found on one of the suspects upon arrest.</p>

          <p>Amid reports of catastrophic hunger in Gaza, medical experts are detailing the devastating physiological effects of starvation on the human body. The process begins with the body consuming its carbohydrate and fat stores before eventually breaking down muscle and organ tissue for protein. This final stage leads to severe muscle wasting, a weakened immune system, and organ failure, with death often resulting from infection or cardiac arrest. Children, pregnant people, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable, facing rapid deterioration and long-term developmental consequences. The article highlights the dire situation where thousands face severe malnutrition due to a lack of food.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency has proposed revoking the 2009 "endangerment finding," a crucial scientific determination that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare. This finding serves as the legal foundation for most federal climate regulations under the Clean Air Act, including limits on emissions from vehicles and power plants. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as the "largest deregulatory action in the history of America," aiming to end what he termed the "holy grail of the climate change religion." Critics, including former EPA leaders and environmental groups, argue the repeal would endanger millions and face significant legal challenges.</p>

The artwork, titled 'Vecchio Sultano,' was authenticated as an original illustration from a series based on 'The Arabian Nights' that Dali was commissioned to create in the 1960s. The art dealer who bought the piece discovered it had been previously attributed to Dali at a Sotheby's sale in the 1990s but had since lost its attribution. The rediscovery is considered significant for Dali scholars, and the piece will be offered by Cheffins auctioneers in October.</p>

          <p>As his four-day visit to Scotland concluded, President Donald Trump met with Scottish First Minister John Swinney at his Balmedie golf resort. Their conversation reportedly covered the impact of U.S. tariffs on Scotch whisky, with Swinney appealing for a better position for the key Scottish export. The two leaders also discussed the humanitarian situation in Gaza and North Sea oil and gas taxation. Following the meeting, Trump attended a ceremony to open a new golf course at the resort before departing for the United States. Swinney described the conversation as positive and productive.</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk plunged 23% after it drastically cut its full-year sales and profit guidance. The company cited weaker-than-expected U.S. sales growth for its blockbuster obesity drug, Wegovy, due to competition from compounded versions and a slower market expansion. The announcement coincided with the appointment of a new CEO, Maziar Mike Doustdar, who will take over in August. This is the second time in recent months that the company has downgraded its outlook, intensifying concerns about its ability to maintain market dominance amid increasing competition.

          <p>Union Pacific has proposed an $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern, a deal that would create the first single-entity transcontinental railroad in the United States. The merger would connect Union Pacific's extensive network in the western U.S. with Norfolk Southern's tracks across 22 eastern states. Proponents argue it would streamline deliveries and reduce delays, but the deal faces intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators, who have set a high bar for railroad consolidation after previous mergers led to significant service disruptions.

          <p>Eloghosa Osunde's second novel, 'Necessary Fiction,' is praised in this review for its poignant exploration of kinship and community among a group of queer Nigerians. The story centers on characters who, feeling alienated from their biological families, forge new, chosen families to survive and thrive in a society that often shuns them. The reviewer highlights a key scene, the "truth circle," where characters affirm their bonds through vulnerable conversation. By focusing on connection as an act of sustained intention rather than inherited obligation, the novel offers a compelling vision for building meaningful relationships in an increasingly atomized world.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth, attributing the improvement partly to a softening of some U.S. tariffs on imported goods.

Despite the improved outlook, the IMF warns that higher tariffs and ongoing uncertainty could still dampen economic activity and that global inflation will likely remain above target in the United States.
