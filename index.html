          <p>A federal building in Lower Manhattan, which houses offices for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, was evacuated Thursday following the discovery of an unknown white powder. The FDNY and hazmat units responded quickly, and officials later reported that five separate letters contained the substance. While at least two people were exposed, authorities have stated that no ongoing threat remains to employees or the public. The FBI is now analyzing the powder to determine its nature and origin.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, which formed off the coast of Africa, is on a path to become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict it will intensify into a major hurricane, with winds exceeding 111 mph, by the end of the weekend as it approaches the Caribbean. While the storm does not pose an immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path remains uncertain. Tropical storm watches have been issued for the northern Leeward Islands, which are expected to be affected over the weekend.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, has formally requested that Prime Minister Keir Starmer allow his party to appoint peers to the House of Lords. In a letter, Farage argued that the current composition of the upper chamber is undemocratic, as his party lacks representation despite receiving over four million votes in the last general election. He pointed out that parties with fewer votes and MPs, such as the Liberal Democrats and Greens, have numerous peers. The decision to grant peerages ultimately rests with the prime minister.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has significantly increased federal control over Washington D.C.'s local law enforcement, appointing the head of the DEA as the city's "emergency police commissioner." This move grants the new commissioner final approval over all orders from the Metropolitan Police Department, effectively superseding the city's current police chief. The action was justified by Attorney General Pam Bondi as a response to the city's "sanctuary policies" regarding immigration enforcement. This assertion of federal authority is part of a broader anti-crime and immigration crackdown in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has rescinded local directives in Washington, D.C., that limited cooperation between the Metropolitan Police Department and federal immigration agencies like ICE. This policy reversal effectively ends the city's status as a "sanctuary city," allowing local officers to fully assist in federal immigration enforcement. The change is part of President Trump's broader anti-crime initiative in the capital, which has placed the city's police force under temporary federal control. The new directive allows D.C. police to assist in arrests based on administrative immigration warrants and transfer detainees to ICE custody.</p>

          <p>The UK division of online fast-fashion giant Shein announced a significant 32.3% increase in sales for 2024, reaching £2.05 billion. This growth also led to a rise in pre-tax profits to £38.25 million, reinforcing the company's strong market position.

          <h2>China's Economic Momentum Slows in July Amid Weak Domestic Demand</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy showed signs of faltering in July as key indicators like retail sales and industrial output failed to meet forecasts. Retail sales grew by 3.7%, slowing from the previous month and missing analysts' expectations, pointing to persistent weakness in domestic demand. Industrial production also saw its weakest growth since last November, while fixed-asset investment slowed, exacerbated by a deepening contraction in the property sector. These figures suggest that the initial economic boost from government stimulus earlier in the year is fading, raising concerns about achieving the annual growth target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mali's ruling military junta announced on state television that it had successfully thwarted a coup attempt allegedly supported by foreign states. Security Minister General Daoud Aly Mohammedine stated that a group of military officers and civilians, including two generals and a French national suspected of being a foreign agent, have been arrested. The announcement comes amid a broader crackdown on political dissent and growing discontent within the population and military. Critics suggest the arrests may be a tactic to intimidate opposition rather than a response to a legitimate coup attempt.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' predictions for 0.1% growth. The resilience was largely driven by a rebound in exports, which contributed significantly to the GDP despite the imposition of U.S. tariffs on key sectors like automobiles. While the quarterly performance was strong, annualized growth was 1%, and some economists warn of a potential slowdown ahead.

Putin is expected to appeal to Trump's transactional nature by discussing economic incentives, such as rare earth deals and Arctic projects.

          <p>A recent analysis by ConsumerAffairs has ranked Oregon as the fourth-worst state to move to in 2025, a drop from its seventh-worst position in 2024. The state received low scores for affordability, safety, economic strength, education, and healthcare access. According to the report, Oregon is the third-worst state for affordability and is highly vulnerable to environmental risks like wildfires and drought. In contrast, neighboring Washington was ranked the 35th best state, outperforming Oregon in most categories except for crime and climate risk.</p>

          <p>Police in Serbia clashed with anti-government protesters in Belgrade and Novi Sad, deploying tear gas to disperse crowds. In Novi Sad, demonstrators attacked the headquarters of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party, leading to a heavy police response and cordoning off parts of the city center. The protests are the latest escalation in months of student-led demonstrations against President Aleksandar Vucic's government, initially sparked by a deadly building collapse blamed on corruption. The EU and UN have expressed concern over the government's increasingly repressive response to the ongoing dissent.</p>

          <p>The city of Youngstown, Ohio, once a symbol of industrial decay after the collapse of its steel industry, is now showing signs of a steady economic revival. Entrepreneurs are repurposing old, abandoned factory buildings into new businesses, such as a brewery and a bustling flea market, bringing new life to the former industrial heartland. The city's population has stabilized, and its unemployment rate is now only slightly above the national average, with employment levels returning to pre-pandemic numbers. This gradual comeback is being driven by local efforts to build a new economic future beyond the legacy of steel.</p>

          <p>The state of Louisiana has sued the online gaming platform Roblox, accusing the company of failing to implement adequate safety measures to protect its young users. The lawsuit, filed by the state's Attorney General, alleges that the platform's environment allows sexual predators to victimize children and that the company prioritizes profit over safety. This legal action follows similar lawsuits and growing criticism against Roblox for its handling of child safety issues. The company has recently stated it is implementing new measures, including an AI system to detect endangerment.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, feel that expectations around tipping have grown in recent years. For many, tipping is seen as a way to show appreciation or supplement service workers' income, while others view it primarily as an additional mandatory cost. The sentiment that tipping has become more prevalent was widely viewed as a negative development. This perspective may be influenced by broader concerns about rising prices and costs that have been a consistent theme in public opinion over the past few years.</p>

          <p>The British government is collaborating with medical influencers on TikTok to raise awareness about the dangers of traveling abroad for cosmetic procedures. This campaign addresses growing concerns over UK citizens seeking cheaper treatments like dental work and hair implants overseas, which can lead to botched results and health complications. The influencers will advise their followers to consult with a UK doctor first, purchase proper travel insurance, and avoid package deals that include surgery. The initiative aims to protect patients and reduce the burden on the NHS, which often has to correct procedures that go wrong.</p>

          <p>Four years after famously relaunching with a fully plant-based menu, the three-Michelin-star restaurant Eleven Madison Park is reintroducing animal products. Chef Daniel Humm, who had previously championed the vegan menu as an ethical and creative necessity, announced the change citing a desire to be more inclusive and noting a decline in business. Sales of wine and bookings for private corporate events had flagged, as many diners were less interested in a high-end, meat-free experience. The reversal highlights the significant challenges even top-tier restaurants face in sustaining a purely plant-based luxury dining model.</p>

          <p>Nearly two years after the start of the conflict, Israeli society is experiencing profound divisions over the government's handling of the war in Gaza. While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintains a message of total victory, a significant portion of the population, particularly secular Israelis and hostage families, are demanding a ceasefire deal. Conversely, the religious right and ultranationalist coalition members advocate for continuing the war and oppose any concessions. This internal friction is reflected in public opinion polls and large-scale protests, revealing deep chasms over the war's objectives and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

Obama told the lawmakers their actions were a courageous stand against a "systematic assault on democracy" and have inspired responses in other states, like California.

          <p>This analysis contrasts the potential goals of President Trump and Vladimir Putin ahead of their summit in Alaska to discuss the war in Ukraine. Putin likely seeks international recognition and a validation that Western efforts to isolate him have failed, along with cementing territorial gains in Ukraine. For Trump, the summit represents an opportunity to fulfill his campaign promise of being a global peacemaker and to achieve a significant diplomatic victory. While Putin's objectives have been consistent, Trump's approach has been more variable, creating uncertainty about the potential outcomes of the high-stakes meeting.</p>
