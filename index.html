          <p>The Washington Post reports that the White House National Security Council has instructed US agencies to suspend participation in this year's G20 conference in South Africa. This decision follows Donald Trump's false claim that South Africa is carrying out a "genocide" against white citizens and his declaration that he would boycott the summit unless the situation is addressed. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa stated that the group who ostensibly left the country opposed policies aimed at addressing racial inequality. The G20 comprises 19 countries with the world's largest economies, along with the African Union and the European Union.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara, marking the first meeting between leaders of the United States and Syria in 25 years. This meeting occurred a day after Trump announced plans to lift sanctions on Syria, a move aimed at easing the economic strain on the war-torn nation. Trump urged al-Shara to normalize relations with Israel and remove foreign terrorists from Syria. The meeting was facilitated by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia and included a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, both of whom supported lifting the sanctions.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom faces a healthcare crisis as costs spiral out of control due to Medicaid initiatives, including expanding coverage to immigrants without legal status. The state borrowed $3.4 billion to pay for Medi-Cal, and Newsom is contemplating rolling back coverage and benefits. Polling shows tepid support for providing healthcare to immigrants without legal status, complicating Newsom's political tightrope. Lawmakers are considering freezing enrollment or imposing cost-sharing measures, with Newsom proposing an enrollment freeze in 2026 and a monthly premium in 2027.</p>

          <p>More than a thousand inmates will be released early to free up spaces in prisons in England and Wales, as the government grapples with an overcrowding crisis. Offenders serving one to four years who are recalled to prison for breaching their licenses will be released after 28 days. The change would not apply to those who commit a serious further offence or are deemed to pose a high risk. A senior Ministry of Justice official said the government would "run out of prison places in just five months' time" if action was not taken.</p>

          <p>Across the country, students are short-circuiting their laptops at school in a new and sometimes dangerous social media trend called the “Chromebook challenge.” The challenge involves students jamming objects into their laptops until they spark and smolder, then recording the damage and sharing it on TikTok and Instagram. This trend has led to damaged computers, scorched floors and desks, interrupted lessons, and even criminal charges for some students. School districts are sending letters to families, pleading with them to intervene and warning of consequences.</p>

          <p>Three Yale professors, Marci Shore, Timothy Snyder, and Jason Stanley, are moving to the University of Toronto due to concerns about the state of American democracy. The professors, all experts in authoritarianism, express fears about attacks on the rule of law, the courts, and universities. They believe America is increasingly vulnerable to democratic backsliding. This move serves as both a warning and a call to action, highlighting the fragility of democratic institutions and the importance of defending civil liberties.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing freezing undocumented adult enrollment in full-scope Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program. The proposed freeze would take effect "no sooner than January 1, 2026," and would apply "to new adult applicants over age 19." People would not "be kicked off their health care," according to the document. It also notes that the Golden State governor is proposing a $100 per month premium for Medi-Cal enrollees 19 and up with "unsatisfactory immigration status."</p>

          <p>A $250,000 annuity could generate monthly payments ranging from about $1,200 to more than $2,600, based on market data, with payments varying based on age, gender, and contract structure. A 60-year-old man with a $250,000 immediate fixed annuity could expect monthly payments of $1,476, while a woman of the same age might receive slightly less due to longer life expectancy. Selecting the right annuity requires careful consideration of immediate needs and long-term goals, including shopping around for the best rates and understanding tax implications (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the gap between what Americans earn and how much they need to achieve a basic standard of living is growing. The analysis, from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP), considers whether people have the means to pay for technology, education, healthcare, and childcare. For the bottom 60% of U.S. households, a "minimal quality of life" is out of reach, with these households needing to make $67,000 annually, while they earn an average of $38,000. The cost of a basic level of economic security has doubled from 2001 to 2023.</p>

He stated Boeing should lease another plane to the president, even if it's the Qatari jet, which he argued would "take away all implication that somebody says we're getting some gift, because Boeing is responsible, because they're too delayed."</p>

The 19-strong roundtable of stars joining Claudia Winkleman at Ardross Castle in Scotland boasts household names across sport and the arts. Comedians are likely to be "the obvious frontrunners to go the distance", says Susie Masterson, a psychotherapist registered with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). Humour can be a highly adapted defence mechanism, she says, which can make comedians more opaque than other contestants.</p>
