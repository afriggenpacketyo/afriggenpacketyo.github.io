          <h2>MAGA Aesthetic Reflects Extreme Politics, Expert Argues</h2>

          <p>An editor at Vox discusses how the aesthetic choices of figures within Donald Trump's political orbit, including hairstyles, makeup, and plastic surgery, reflect and reinforce the administration's policies. This "MAGA glam," often seen on Fox News and among Trump's supporters, is described as an extreme, almost artificial look that distracts from the underlying policies. The article suggests a connection between these exaggerated appearances and the administration's extreme political stances, drawing parallels between reality TV's manufactured drama and the spectacle of Trump-era politics. The author argues that this aesthetic serves as a tool of distraction, obscuring the realities of the policies being enacted. Optimism score: 55</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin judge, Monica Isham, is threatening to boycott holding court after fellow Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested for allegedly obstructing ICE agents by helping a migrant evade arrest. Isham expressed her refusal to allow ICE to take anyone from her courtroom, likening such actions to sending individuals to a concentration camp without due process. Dugan is accused of escorting the migrant and his attorney through a restricted area to bypass ICE agents waiting to arrest him on misdemeanor battery charges.

This database combines sensitive data from across the federal government, raising concerns about the misuse of centralized data.

While the official designation remains "The Liberation of the South and National Reunification Day," the government is increasingly using the term "Reunification Day" to promote national reconciliation. This shift is seen as an effort to bridge the gap with the Vietnamese diaspora and improve relations with the United States, even as Vietnam navigates its relationships with both China and the U.S.</p>

          <p>The article provides a rare look inside the San Jacinto Tunnel, a 13-mile-long tunnel that delivers water to Southern California. Built in the 1930s as part of the Colorado River Aqueduct, the tunnel is typically off-limits when filled with water. The article describes the engineering marvel, the constant stream of groundwater seeping into the tunnel, and the maintenance procedures. It also recounts the history of the aqueduct's construction, the challenges faced by workers, and the environmental impact on local Native American communities.</p>
