          <p>A lynx born at Newquay Zoo in Cornwall may become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild. Due to a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding program, the zoo was asked to contribute. The lynx has been moved to Germany's Black Forest for monitoring to assess its survival skills. The goal is to introduce new cats to increase genetic diversity among European lynx populations, as they once roamed the UK but were driven to extinction centuries ago, and conservationists aim to reintroduce them.</p>

          <p>The New York Times editorial board argues that President Trump's first 100 days of his second term have damaged American democracy more than any period since Reconstruction. The editorial asserts that Trump is attempting to create a presidency unrestrained by Congress or the courts, undermining constitutional checks and balances. It calls for a broad coalition of Americans, spanning the political spectrum, to oppose Trump's undemocratic actions while acknowledging his legitimate election and some effective policies. The editorial emphasizes the need to distinguish between unwise policies and those that violate constitutional principles.</p>

          <p>Leaders overseeing California's high-speed rail project are expressing concerns about its financial future, as the project awaits word from the Trump administration regarding federal support. Board members raised alarms about the potential loss of federal funds and the risks of committing to contracts when funding is uncertain. The Department of Transportation initiated a compliance review of the project following concerns about delays and costs. The project, which originally aimed to connect Los Angeles to San Francisco by 2020, is significantly over budget and behind schedule, and faces challenges with its finances.</p>

          <p>Marvel's "Thunderbolts*" offers a jokey and moody take on the superhero genre, focusing on lesser-known characters from the Cinematic Universe. The film follows a team of misfit side characters, including Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), as they face off against a corrupt CIA director. The movie aims to be punk-rock and snarky, with a sense of humor and visual awe. While the plot delves into themes of trust, trauma, and mental illness, the film's plainness and occasional reliance on after-school PSA tropes may appeal to some while leaving others wanting more.</p>
