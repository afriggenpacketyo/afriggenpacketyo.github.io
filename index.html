          <p>An alleged airstrike by Myanmar's military has resulted in the deaths of numerous students at two private schools in Rakhine state. The Arakan Army, an ethnic armed group in conflict with the ruling junta, reported that the attack on a village it controls killed 19 students and wounded 22 more. This incident is part of the broader armed conflict that has engulfed Myanmar since the military coup in 2021. The United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, condemned the event as a "brutal attack," highlighting the devastating impact of the violence on civilians.</p>

          <p>An animal shelter in Billings, Montana, faces an uncertain future after smoke from an FBI methamphetamine burn filled the building, hospitalizing staff. The FBI was using the shelter's incinerator, typically for animal carcasses, to destroy two pounds of seized drugs when the smoke was inadvertently drawn inside. Fourteen shelter workers required medical treatment for symptoms including intense headaches and dizziness. The facility is now closed for contamination testing, and its 75 resident animals have been relocated to foster homes.</p>

          <p>Facing declining sales and a nearly $3 million operating loss, the Girl Scouts of the USA are launching a new cookie flavor called "Exploremores." Inspired by rocky road ice cream, the new treat is intended to boost interest and revenue following the discontinuation of two other flavors. The organization has been grappling with challenges, including rising cookie prices, a significant drop in membership since the pandemic, and planned increases in membership dues. The new cookie has already sparked online debate among consumers, particularly concerning allergens.</p>

Kalver has since founded a nonprofit gift registry for cancer patients, written a book, and become a public speaker.

          <p>A loan estimate document for a home purchased by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook shows she declared the Atlanta property as a "vacation home." This evidence appears to counter accusations of mortgage fraud from the Trump administration, which claimed she improperly designated two different homes as her primary residence to gain financial benefits. The document, issued by her credit union, supports Cook's denial of wrongdoing. The controversy is part of a larger political battle over the independence of the Federal Reserve and efforts by Donald Trump to exert more control over the central bank.</p>

          <p>Brianna Ladapo, the wife of Florida's controversial surgeon general Dr. Joseph Ladapo, reportedly holds numerous unconventional beliefs, including that angels communicate with her and that her family is targeted by chemtrails. In published works and interviews, she claims to have visions and has stated that her husband, a prominent vaccine skeptic, will not work with anyone she has not personally vetted. These revelations provide context to the influences surrounding Dr. Ladapo, who recently ended vaccine mandates for children in Florida, a move he claimed would receive God's blessing.</p>

          <p>Fast-food giants are losing their morning customers to convenience stores, which are investing heavily in their prepared food offerings. According to market research, morning traffic to food-focused convenience stores like Wawa and Casey's grew 9% recently, while fast-food chains saw only a 1% increase. This trend is driven by consumers seeking value and variety, with convenience stores offering a wider range of options beyond traditional breakfast items. Even McDonald's has acknowledged that the breakfast period is its weakest, as budget-conscious consumers are more likely to eat at home.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a $125 million lawsuit against Uber, accusing the ride-sharing company of systemic discrimination against passengers with disabilities. The lawsuit alleges that Uber violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by routinely denying rides to individuals with service animals or stowable mobility devices. The DOJ claims the company has failed to adequately train its drivers on ADA compliance, leading to disabled passengers being stranded or unfairly charged fees. Uber has stated that it disagrees with the allegations and maintains a zero-tolerance policy for confirmed service denials.</p>

However, the event is shadowed by controversy surrounding the re-imposition of mandatory gene testing for female athletes to detect a Y chromosome. World Athletics President Sebastian Coe has defended the policy as necessary to protect women's sport, but critics argue the test is an unreliable indicator of athletic advantage and raises significant ethical concerns.

The president's tariffs have started to increase consumer prices, while his immigration crackdown has tightened the labor supply. Recent data showed downward revisions to job growth and an uptick in inflation, creating a challenging scenario for the Federal Reserve. If stagflation intensifies, it could weaken the Fed's ability to stabilize the economy and potentially increase poverty. (not investment advice)</p>

The disease can lead to serious chronic heart and digestive problems decades after the initial infection.

Otherwise healthy, younger individuals may now need to self-attest to a risk factor or, in some cases, get a doctor's prescription to be eligible.

          <p>A new book, "Chinese Encounters with America," profiles twelve influential Chinese individuals whose lives were shaped by their experiences in the United States, highlighting a period of cooperation and optimism that has since faded. The collection includes academics, diplomats, and activists who played key roles in fostering cultural and scientific exchange after 1979. The book's editors argue that these stories serve as a reminder of the mutual benefits of engagement, a policy now viewed with skepticism in both nations. They express concern that both countries are losing sight of shared interests amid the current climate of intense rivalry.</p>

          <p>Nikos Michaloliakos, the founder and leader of the neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn, has been released from prison in Greece after serving less than half of his 13-year sentence. A judicial council granted the 67-year-old conditional release on health grounds, allowing him to serve the remainder of his term at home. Michaloliakos was convicted in 2020 for running a criminal organization responsible for violent attacks and the murder of an anti-fascist musician. The decision has sparked outrage from left-wing parties, who argue it sends a message of impunity for fascism.</p>

          <p>Peter Mandelson, the United Kingdom's ambassador to the U.S., has been recalled after newly published emails revealed the depth of his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The emails showed Mandelson remained supportive of Epstein even after his 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor, which the British government deemed "new information." This marks Mandelson's third involuntary departure from a government post due to ethical scandals. The timing is difficult for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government, as it comes just before a scheduled state visit from President Trump.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, some historians are drawing parallels between the current U.S. political landscape and the volatile 1850s that preceded the Civil War. They point to similarities in widespread political violence, deep societal divisions (what was then called sectionalism), and widespread disillusionment with the Supreme Court. While cautioning that the country is not on the brink of another civil war, scholars note that the paranoid reactions to violence and the rise of politically motivated youth movements echo the tensions of that era. They emphasize the urgent need to de-escalate the political temperature.</p>

          <p>An opinion column posits that President Biden's decision to seek reelection in 2023 effectively stalled the ambitions of the next generation of Democratic leaders, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Gavin Newsom. The author references Harris's new book, which details the frantic 107-day timeline she had to campaign after Biden eventually stepped aside. The piece argues that Biden, who initially positioned himself as a "bridge" to future leaders in 2020, became a roadblock by delaying the party's transition. This delay, not Harris's campaign, is framed as a key factor in the Democrats' subsequent challenges.</p>

          <p>The city of Santa Monica, California, has declared a state of fiscal distress, pushed to the brink by hundreds of millions of dollars in sexual abuse settlements. The city has already paid $229 million to victims of a former police dispatcher and still faces 180 additional claims. This financial burden is compounded by a post-pandemic economic downturn, including declining tourism and retail revenues in its once-thriving downtown. The declaration has raised concerns of potential service cuts and layoffs among city employees as officials grapple with a budget deficit and declining revenue projections.</p>
