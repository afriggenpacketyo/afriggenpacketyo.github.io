        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem is demanding that Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker revise his state's immigration policies. The call to action follows the capture in Mexico of Gabriel P. Calixto, an undocumented immigrant accused of murdering 24-year-old Emma Shafer in Illinois in 2023. Noem cited the arrest as evidence that so-called sanctuary policies are dangerous and urged a return to stricter law and order. Her statement aligns with a broader push by some political figures for increased immigration enforcement, contrasting with Pritzker's opposition to using military troops for domestic crime control.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 experienced a slight downturn this week, ending a four-week winning streak, yet it successfully closed out August with a monthly gain of over 2%. Profit-taking ahead of the Labor Day weekend and a mixed reaction to Nvidia's strong earnings report contributed to the weekly decline. Despite some investor concerns about Nvidia's data center revenue, its overall performance has been a major market driver. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the PCE price index, showed core inflation at 2.9%, keeping the possibility of a September interest rate cut on the table.

          <p>Struggling with high costs and weaker domestic demand, Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time within twelve months. This move comes after a previous restructuring in March failed to stabilize the company's finances, leading to a net loss of nearly $257 million since its last exit from bankruptcy. The budget carrier now plans more significant cost-cutting measures, including reducing its flight network and fleet size. The airline's financial troubles have been compounded by a failed takeover bid by JetBlue and issues with a Pratt & Whitney engine recall.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a deadly shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic church, extremism analysts are examining the 23-year-old assailant's online materials and finding a complex and contradictory profile rather than a clear ideological motive. While the FBI noted anti-religious and anti-Semitic references, experts point to a broader, misanthropic worldview obsessed with mass violence for its own sake. The shooter's writings and videos contain a chaotic mix of right-wing and left-wing extremist symbols, reverence for past mass killers, and nihilistic themes. This profile aligns with a growing trend of attackers motivated by a desire for notoriety within online subcultures that glorify violence.</p>

          <p>As the school year begins, the United States is seeing an uptick in COVID-19 metrics, with hospitalization rates doubling over the past two months and test positivity rising significantly. However, these figures remain substantially lower than at the same time last year, with hospitalizations about three times lower. Health officials attribute the increase to waning immunity and new Omicron subvariants, with XFG now being the dominant strain.

          <p>Meta announced it is implementing temporary changes to its AI chatbot policies for teenagers in response to a Senate investigation and public criticism. The company is training its AI to avoid generating responses on sensitive topics like self-harm and to prevent inappropriate romantic conversations, instead directing teens to expert resources. This move follows reports that internal documents permitted chatbots to have "romantic" conversations with minors, which Meta now calls erroneous. Advocacy group Common Sense Media recently issued a risk assessment advising against teen use of Meta AI until fundamental safety issues are addressed.</p>

          <p>The mother of a 15-year-old U.S. citizen has filed a $1 million claim against the federal government after immigration agents allegedly held her son at gunpoint in a case of mistaken identity.

The claim alleges false imprisonment, unconstitutional racial profiling, and emotional distress, stating the boy is now traumatized. This event has intensified local concerns about aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, particularly near schools, prompting condemnation from local officials and members of Congress.</p>

Authorities suspect the collision was caused by an illegal street race, where a BMW traveling at high speed crossed the median and struck an oncoming Nissan Sentra. The victims included 15-year-old Jacob Labib and 14-year-old Mina Sabet, who were teammates on the SoCal Reds soccer club. The driver of the BMW survived and is expected to face charges including vehicular manslaughter.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has yet to rule on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's request for a temporary restraining order to block President Donald Trump from firing her. During a court hearing, Cook's attorney argued that the president's justification for her removal, based on unsubstantiated mortgage fraud allegations from an ally, was pretextual. A Department of Justice lawyer countered that the president has the discretion to determine cause for removing a Fed governor. The case raises significant questions about the limits of presidential power over the independent central bank, with the ultimate outcome likely to be decided by a higher court.</p>

          <p>A Texas man has been reunited with his Fordham University class ring 56 years after it slipped off his finger and fell into the water off Long Island, New York. The ring was discovered this summer by an electrician using a metal detector at a local beach. After finding the ring, which was engraved with the owner's name and graduation year, the electrician used social media to track down the original owner, Al DiStefano. The heartwarming story highlights the kindness of the finder, who chose to return the valuable and sentimental item rather than sell it.</p>

          <p>The United States has announced it will deny or revoke visas for Palestinian officials planning to attend the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the decision was due to Palestinian efforts to seek unilateral statehood recognition and undermine peace negotiations. This move is unusual, as the U.S. is generally expected to facilitate travel for officials visiting the UN headquarters. The ban comes as several countries, including France, are leading a push to recognize a Palestinian state at the UN, a move the Trump administration and Israel strongly oppose.</p>

          <p>The federal public defender's office in Los Angeles has filed a motion to disqualify acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, arguing that his appointment is unlawful. The motion contends that the Trump administration used an unprecedented legal maneuver to extend Essayli's term without Senate confirmation, circumventing congressional limits. This challenge is part of a growing number of legal actions against similar appointments in other districts, such as New Jersey and Nevada. Critics argue these appointments are a way to install political allies who pursue the president's agenda, undermining the traditional independence of federal prosecutors.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have identified a new species of ankylosaur, an armored herbivorous dinosaur, based on recently discovered fossils in Morocco. Named Spicomellus, the 165-million-year-old dinosaur is the oldest known ankylosaur and has been described as one of the strangest ever found due to its unique defensive features. Unlike any other known vertebrate, Spicomellus had long, bony spikes fused directly to its rib bones, creating a formidable armory. This discovery challenges previous theories about the evolution of ankylosaurs, suggesting their defensive armor was complex much earlier than previously believed.</p>

The election was the town's first since the 1960s, held as part of a federal settlement after Braxton sued over the town's history of "hand-me-down governance," where mayors appointed their successors. In 2020, Braxton ran unopposed but was prevented from serving for three years. His decisive victory this week is seen as a significant step toward restoring democratic representation in the majority-Black town.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is set to begin flying its first Boeing 737 MAX 8 equipped with a secondary barrier to the flight deck, a safety feature designed to prevent intrusions. The measure has been advocated by pilots' unions since the September 11, 2001 attacks to enhance cockpit security. A 2023 FAA rule mandates these barriers on all new commercial passenger aircraft, and both Boeing and Airbus have started delivering planes with the feature installed. While the FAA has granted airlines an extension until 2026 to implement the barriers, Southwest has chosen to comply immediately upon receiving new aircraft.</p>

          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has scheduled a special election for a state Senate seat that has been vacant for nearly nine months, a delay that has drawn criticism from Republicans. The vacancy in the 35th Senate District was created when the Democratic incumbent was elected to the U.S. House. Democrats currently hold a narrow 19-18 majority in the chamber, and a Republican victory in the special election could create a tie, potentially allowing the GOP to block parts of Whitmer's legislative agenda. The primary will be held in February 2026, with the general election in May.</p>
