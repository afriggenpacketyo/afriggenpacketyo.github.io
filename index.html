          <p>The Commerce Department reported that the inflation rate slipped to 2.1% in April, lower than expected, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's key inflation gauge. The monthly increase was 0.1%, while core readings excluding food and energy also showed slight decreases, with consumer spending slowing to a 0.2% increase. Simultaneously, personal income surged by 0.8%, leading to a rise in the personal savings rate to 4.9%, the highest level in nearly a year, reflecting a more cautious consumer mood. Markets showed little immediate reaction to the news, with stock futures continuing to point lower and longer-duration Treasury yields higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after being convicted for falsifying business records related to a hush money scheme, Donald Trump is still fighting the case. A federal appeals court is scheduled to hear arguments regarding moving the case from state to federal court, a move opposed by the Manhattan District Attorney. Trump's lawyers argue the case belongs in federal court due to its unprecedented nature involving a former and current president, while Trump maintains his innocence, claiming the case is a weaponization of government. The Supreme Court previously rejected an attempt to throw out the case based on presidential immunity, and Trump's former defense attorneys now hold high-ranking positions within the government.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused China of violating its trade agreement with the U.S., just weeks after a temporary easing of tariffs. While he did not specify the nature of the violation, he stated that China has "totally violated its agreement with us." The U.S. and China had previously agreed to a 90-day suspension on most tariffs imposed on each other's imports, with the U.S. reducing tariffs on Chinese goods to about 30% and China reducing its levies on American imports to 10%. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer echoed Trump's allegation, expressing concern over China's purported non-compliance. (not investment advice)</p>

The city, named "Los Abuelos," dates back to the Middle Preclassic period (800 to 500 BC) and is believed to have been one of the most ancient and important ceremonial centers of the Mayan civilization. The site includes a pyramid standing 108 feet high with murals and a unique canal system.

          <p>The SEC has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, marking an end to one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions brought by the agency. The original complaint accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal comes as the Trump administration aims to prove its support for the crypto industry, with the Justice Department shutting down its crypto enforcement team. Binance is forging ties with World Liberty Financial, a project aspiring to be a crypto bank, and Zhao has been appointed as an adviser to Pakistan's newly formed Crypto Council.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering a diplomatic strategy akin to a "reverse Nixon," aiming to draw Russia closer to the United States to gain an advantage in geopolitical competition with China. The goal is to isolate China, guarantee European security, and solidify American global primacy. However, this plan could backfire, potentially fracturing the American alliance with Europe without splitting Russia from China. Analysts suggest that the bond between Russia and China is strong due to shared political, economic, and strategic interests.</p>

In Discourses on Livy, Machiavelli espouses a deep belief in republicanism. Benner believes Machiavelli's work is often misunderstood, with superficial readers missing the deeper criticisms and republican ideals within his writings.</p>
