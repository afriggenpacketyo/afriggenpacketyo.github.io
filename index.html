          <p>A feud erupted between Elon Musk and Donald Trump after Musk criticized Trump's tax bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination" due to its potential to increase federal deficits and its inclusion of electric vehicle incentive cuts. Trump responded by expressing disappointment in Musk, stating that he had helped him significantly and that Musk was upset about the EV credit elimination. Musk retorted on social media, claiming Trump would have lost the election without his financial backing, adding to the challenges facing the tax bill's passage in the Senate. Tesla shares experienced a significant drop amid the escalating conflict between the two figures. The general tone of the article is a reflection of the chaos surrounding the legislative process and the personal conflict between two powerful figures.</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf has resigned as chairman of Reform UK, stating that working to get the party elected is no longer a good use of his time. His resignation follows criticism of a Reform MP's call to ban the burka, which Yusuf deemed "dumb." Nigel Farage expressed regret over Yusuf's departure, acknowledging his significant contributions to the party's recent electoral successes, including winning a by-election and gaining new councillors. Yusuf, a former banker and Conservative Party member, played a crucial role in professionalizing the party and attracting donors, and his unexpected resignation has led to further departures within the party, reflecting internal discord.

          <p>Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government in Israel is facing a political crisis due to disagreements over military conscription exemptions for ultra-Orthodox men. The crisis stems from the October 7 massacre and growing resentment towards Haredi draft exemptions, which are increasingly seen as unsustainable amid the ongoing war in Gaza. The Supreme Court ruled the exemptions unconstitutional, but Netanyahu's coalition, heavily reliant on ultra-Orthodox parties, remains divided, and the ultra-Orthodox parties are demanding new legislation to enshrine the exemptions, threatening to leave the coalition if their demands are not met. The article reflects a sense of political instability and potential government collapse due to internal divisions over a contentious issue.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has processed over 2.5 million retroactive payments for public pension holders who were previously barred from collecting full benefits due to the Windfall Elimination Provision and Government Pension Offset. The Social Security Fairness Act, signed into law in January 2025, ended these provisions, enabling millions to receive retroactive payments dating back to January 2024. The agency started issuing payments in February, and most eligible parties should have seen payment increases starting in April, although some complicated cases may take longer to process. The SSA expects all beneficiary records to be updated by November 2025, and those eligible who have not received payment can check their account online or call the agency to ensure they have the correct information on file.

          <p>The Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision in Catholic Charities v. Wisconsin Labor and Industry Review Commission, ruling in favor of Catholic Charities, which was denied an exemption from paying unemployment taxes. The Court found that Wisconsin law violated the rule that the government cannot prefer one religious denomination over another. The ruling avoids a broader fight over when businesses with a religious identity can ignore the law, focusing on the narrow distinction between religious groups that proselytize or serve only co-religionists and those that do not. The decision is unlikely to significantly undermine workplace protections, but future courts may need to determine whether other laws that treat organizations differently do so because of theological differences.</p>

          <p>Stellantis is bringing back its V-8 Hemi engine for Ram 1500 pickup trucks, reversing a decision to discontinue the powertrain amid tightening fuel economy regulations and a shift toward electric vehicles. Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis admitted the decision to cancel the Hemi was a mistake and said the return is part of a new product turnaround plan. The move reflects a broader trend of automakers adjusting plans as EV adoption has been slower than expected, with the Trump administration seeking to unwind initiatives pushing the industry away from internal combustion engines. Kuniskis expects Hemi to represent 25% to 40% of Ram 1500 pickup truck sales, offering it as an option alongside the more efficient Hurricane engine.</p>

          <p>Five people, including three journalists, were killed in an Israeli strike on al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City, according to the Anglican Church, which operates the hospital. The Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem condemned the attack, stating that 30 bystanders were also injured, including four hospital staff. The Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate accused Israel of a "full-fledged war crime," while the Israeli military claimed it "precisely struck" a Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighter operating from a command center inside the hospital's yard. The incident occurred on the same day that over 130 global news and press freedom organizations called for immediate access to Gaza and protection for Palestinian journalists.</p>

          <p>Private school pupil numbers in England have decreased by 11,000 following the government's removal of a VAT exemption for private schools. The figures indicate a 1.9% drop in pupils attending private schools, with overall pupil numbers in England falling slightly. The Independent Schools Council suggested that VAT on fees was putting pressure on parents and was the reason behind the drop. The government had predicted that around 3,000 private school pupils would need to be absorbed into the state system this academic year, but the census data does not give clear reasons as to why pupils have left private school.</p>

Both sides have accused the other of breaching a recent deal between the two nations struck in Geneva, and Trump said that "there should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products."</p>

Biden stressed that he made the decisions about pardons, executive orders, legislation and proclamations during his presidency.
