          <p>Fair Isaac's CEO, Will Lansing, has responded to criticism from the Federal Housing Finance Agency regarding price increases for FICO credit scores. Lansing argued that the cost, at $4.95 for a mortgage score, is a minor part of closing costs and not a barrier to homeownership. This defense comes after the FHFA allowed lenders to use rival VantageScore and disparaged FICO as a monopoly, a move Lansing claims raises safety and soundness concerns for the mortgage market.</p>

The WDF's ruling follows similar debates in other sports and comes after some of van Leuven's former teammates resigned in protest of her participation.</p>

Authorities attribute the surge to land-grabbing for livestock farming, illegal construction, illicit crop cultivation, and wildfires exacerbated by drought, reversing a positive downward trend seen in 2023.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans for a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom to be constructed in the White House's East Wing. The project, estimated to cost $200 million, will be funded by President Trump and other private donors, with construction set to begin in September. The new venue is intended to host major state functions for up to 650 guests, eliminating the need for temporary tents on the White House grounds, a practice the president has criticized.</p>

          <p>Following a Los Angeles Times investigation, a motion has been introduced in the L.A. City Council to compel the city to comply with a 2019 state law requiring an analysis of its emergency evacuation routes. The law mandates that local governments assess the capacity, safety, and viability of these routes for disasters like wildfires and tsunamis. The city's planning department had previously cited terrorism concerns for not publicizing the routes, a justification the law's author called a "dubious claim."</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that changes to federal student loan programs within the new "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" will create significant financial barriers for students pursuing professional degrees. The law caps federal loans at $50,000 per year, leaving a substantial funding gap for expensive programs like law and medicine at California universities. The author urges the state of California to create its own loan programs to fill this gap, warning that failing to do so could exacerbate shortages of essential professionals.</p>

          <p>A series of agreements between elite universities like Columbia, Penn, and Brown and the Trump administration are raising alarms among free speech advocates. To resolve allegations of civil rights violations and restore withheld federal funding, the universities have agreed to significant policy changes, including slashing DEI programs and cracking down on student protests. Critics argue these deals compromise academic freedom and set a dangerous precedent, creating a blueprint for political coercion that could ripple throughout higher education.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the removal of 1,350 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, significantly reducing the force sent by the Trump administration to address protests against its immigration policies. The original deployment of 5,000 troops was met with strong opposition from California state and local officials, who argued the matter should be handled by local law enforcement. While the administration maintains the troops were vital for keeping peace, California politicians applauded the withdrawal and called for the remaining 250 troops to be removed.</p>
