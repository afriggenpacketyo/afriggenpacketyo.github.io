          <h2>IMF Downgrades U.S. Growth Forecast for 2025 Due to Trade Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 09:11:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has significantly reduced its U.S. growth forecast for 2025 to 1.8%, a 0.9 percentage point decrease from its January projection, primarily due to the impact of newly implemented tariffs. President Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs have destabilized markets and triggered retaliatory measures from trading partners, creating a negative supply shock. The IMF also lowered its global growth forecast to 2.8%. Additionally, the IMF revised its inflation expectations for advanced economies, including the U.S., upwards to 2.5%, reflecting persistent price pressures in the services sector and the effects of tariffs.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. Vice President JD Vance have voiced optimism regarding the progress of ongoing trade negotiations between India and the United States during Vance's visit to New Delhi. Both leaders acknowledged the "significant progress" toward a mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer noted the "serious lack of reciprocity" in the current trade relationship but welcomed India's constructive engagement. The two countries aim to more than double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, addressing trade imbalances and creating opportunities for workers and businesses in both nations.</p>

          <p>Current mortgage rates remain elevated, with the average 30-year mortgage at 6.76% and the 15-year mortgage at 6.01% as of April 22, 2025. Refinance rates are similarly high, with 30-year refinance averaging 6.83% and 15-year refinance at 6.14%. Experts suggest that potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance should focus on strengthening their credit profiles to secure better rates. While the Fed's future rate decisions may provide some relief, borrowers should compare rates from multiple lenders and consider shorter loan terms to potentially lower interest rates.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several companies, including Johnson & Johnson, Apple, and Honda, have announced increased investments in U.S. manufacturing facilities as new tariffs take effect. While not all directly cite tariffs as the primary motivator, these moves align with the Trump administration's goal of fostering job creation on home soil. Companies are committing substantial capital to expand production capabilities, although economists note that factors such as labor costs, tax rates, and regulatory environments also heavily influence such decisions. Despite the potential for tariffs to support emerging industries, economists caution that broad-based tariffs may suppress overall job growth.</p>

          <p>Xia Baolong, Beijing's top official on Hong Kong affairs, delivered a strongly worded speech condemning U.S. tariffs on Hong Kong, claiming they aim to undermine the city's very survival. Xia highlighted that despite Hong Kong being a significant source of the U.S. trade surplus, high tariffs have been imposed. Some observers interpret Xia's remarks as a call to action for Hong Kong officials and the business sector to align with Beijing in the trade war with the U.S.</p>

          <p>China's shipyards are experiencing relief as the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) has scaled back its port-fee plan, reducing pressure on Chinese shipbuilders. The finalized plan contains a phased fee structure with exemptions, differing from the stricter initial proposals. A significant change is the removal of the plan to charge fees based on the number of Chinese-made vessels in a company's fleet, which alleviates concerns for clients placing orders with Chinese shipyards. This adjustment eases pressure on shipping companies and benefits China's shipbuilding industry.</p>

To break the deadlock, Beijing could invite the U.S. to negotiate in China, or a neutral third party could broker a meeting on the sidelines of a regional summit. The Trump administration maintains that China must make the first move.
